B004KA9MQO|1.0|First off let me say this. I truly believe some of these people up here are on payrolls.Nobody needs to read a whole book worth, just to see if they are going to like the album.How can anyone truly give this album 5 stars? 4 of the 12 songs are decent and that is it.Actually I'd say 3 out of 12 we've heard feeling good done over and over.These tracks sound like the producer had leftovers and gave them to jennifer. I respect her voice even though she yells too much for me and yelling isn't singing.She still hasn't found her own sound and she is on album number two.Jennifer needs to be careful she doesn't want to fall into the effie curse that hurt Jennifer Holiday also.

0061735817|4.0|I ws not familiar with this writer until \\"Anansi's Boys\\" - which I enjoyed - so I ordered this one, and was not disappointed.  The humor, both overt questionable, actually had me laughing out loud in the car and smiling at myself enough that others caught in the rush hour traffic were either moving closer to hear what I was listening to, or edging away to get as far from the crazy lady as possible.  I have been trying to get American Gods on standard CD with much termoil and frustration - but the fact I am still trying, instead of moving on to another in my shelf of available audiobooks, says soething positive for this particular author/book.
1439156816|5.0|Stephen King's book answered the hardest question I was asking before beginning my first novel: Where do I start?  Stephen King speaks about the process of becoming someone who writes, laying out the activities, attitudes and discipline necessary to be someone who produces good fiction.  This book set my imagination on fire. King's voice is strong and familiar, and after I finished reading the last page, I felt as though Novel Writing was an exclusive club house, and I'd just been ushered into a cushy red leather chair and handed a glass of 18-year-old scotch.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|There a many reasons I was (and remain) excited for the release of Suckerpunch:<br /><br /> 1) An original concept by the director of such Graphic Novel adaptations as 300, Watchmen and the Upcoming Man of Steel Superman reboot project, too.<br /><br />2.) I'm always ready for Retro-Neo-Anime-kick-a$$-Chicks, including the lovely  Emily Browning as an institutionalized girl slated for a lobotomy who escapes to a reality as Babydoll along with 4 equally hot inmates the brash Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-wise Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the loyal Amber (Jamie Chung) and dear-reluctant Sweet-Pea (Abbie Cornish) as fact and fiction merge.<br /><br />3.)Suckerpunch is the first mainstream DieselPunk movie since 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' or 'Dark City' although it is not a pure example of the sub-genre as there's modern firearms and fantasy aspects present which diverges from traditional Dieselpunk. If you aren't familiar with the genre DieselPunk it's a term coined by  by game designer Lewis, to include a WW II  look along with stylistic influences of that period like Art Deco, pulp serial film cliffhangers , film noir, even  pinups.<br /><br />Ultimately Suckerpunch's premise of removing us and characters from the 'real'  world provides ammo for over-the-top action, but at the cost of creating cliched characters. While one can make an argument for the archetypes and roles assumed here, it can also be argued it can be too formulaic. The film's action scenes are epic, no question, but opportunities are missed to develop them. In the end a needed narrator closes the gaps in on-screen exposition with what can also be construed as a stylistic element and not a flaw in<br />character development or storytelling.<br /><br />The story is largely akin to Alice in Wonderland meets the Anime feature of your choice.,, our incarcerated heroines band together to escape the hands of Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm) by collecting 5 symbolic items,  a map, fire, a knife,  a key and a mystery all while building their own sense of self-worth, of course.<br /><br /> Having grown up with the Star Wars saga, the storytelling aspects of film scoring is a very important consideration for me; here Suckerpunch is a knockout (sorry). The soundtrack merges nicely with it's visuals, single songs framing scenes using clever covers, mash-ups and remixes from Queen, Bjork, The Pixies, The Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, Iggy Pop. Some featuring vocals from stars themselves, for example, Emily Browing's cover of Eurythmics'\\"Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This\\"<br /><br />Other casting includes Jonathan Perez as Magician,  Vicky Lambert as The Countess, Danny Bristol as Little Tommy Soldiernife,  a key and a mystery all while building their own sense of self-worth, of course.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever.  I have seen the play, and loved the movie even better.

A classic!

B004OBC7TS|1.0|I'm not easily offended, and in fact I like edgy movies, but this film is totally sick. What is sad about it is that the director is not untalented, and for the first hour this seems to be a very good if disturbing movie. Unfortunately, the last half hour goes downhill in the most sickening way. In Serbia, Milos, a former porn legend, currently out of work and living a family life with a wife and a small kid, is tempted with huge money to step out of retirement to participate in a new kind of artsy porn film. He is not told the argument of the movie (as if porno films have such things) and the mysterious director, one Vukmir, seems totally off the rocks. But since he needs the money he agrees to do it. Unfortunately, his misgivings turn out to be very true, since he is soon forced to participate in increasingly degrading acts, a nonstop parade of horrors (including, and I suppose I'm giving some spoilers here, killing a woman with a machete while he is having intercourse with her, the rape of a baby and of his own small kid) for which he will eventually take revenge. As I said, I think there is some talent here, but is so sick that is not worth it. What is laughable is some reviews I read which try to justify this film as a metaphor or an allegory for the rape of Serbia during the war or something like that. Believe me, there is nothing here about that.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is one of those concept pieces that was intriguing enough to pick up, even if I am an adult reading a \\"young adult\\" book.  Who doesn't like a good post-apocalyptic scenario?  America has been destroyed by environmental changes and war; a totalitarian regime has been established in its place.  At some point in the history of Panem, a rebellion occurred and was squashed.  Ever since, the twelve poverty-stricken districts that make up Panem must send two of their teenagers to a Roman Gladiator style battle to the death...just to make sure everyone knows who is really in charge.  Just the anticipation of how this would play out had me turning the pages just as fast I could tap the forward button on my Kindle.<br /><br />I read several reviews before finally picking this up.  Many lower star reviews point to the extreme violence presented by the author.  I was expecting a gore-fest something akin to \\"Kill Bill\\" by their descriptions.  Nothing could be further from accurate.  The author handled this brutal game as finely as possible.  There were never any over-the-top descriptions of death.  Even those kills made by the main characters are done so in a light that doesn't make them murderers.  The author clearly sets up a set of antagonists to contrast the innocent nature of the main characters forced to kill or be killed.  Those who thought it too violent are probably too sensitive to read/watch war scenarios anyway.  I take away one star because I was actually longing for a bit more detail, particularly into the psyche that comes at the point of making a kill.  It seemed almost too fast-paced, oddly, like \\"oh! we're already done with that subplot...moving on.\\"  To the point where I felt like in such awful circumstances, the main characters got off too easy.<br /><br />A war is brewing and how it affects young people in all of their vulnerability is what the author focuses on.  What does battle force the innocent to become?  How can those pure of heart hang on to their innocence and love?  Those are the themes that come out of this book.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next two!innocence and love?  Those are the themes that come out of this book.    Looking forward to the next two!

B003NRWW58|1.0|This show is not for families or children.  It is a sad attempt to cash in on the Dr. Who franchise.  After wading through the first season I found the stories tedious and weak.  It seems that the creators are attempting to push some political correct sexual mores into their stories since more often than not the characters are involved sexually with each other, as well other characters they come across.
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|I like both these actors and see every movie they are in, but this just was not a good movie. Depp seemed to be phoning it in, I did enjoy Jolie. I was expecting much more from this movie, there was absolutely no chemistry between these two actors on the screen.

It is one of the few games that after I have finished it that I don't delete just to free up some memory (since the Droid's memory capacity is pathetic!).

B0041KKYEM|5.0|God, this is brilliant--an entire movie as an homage to the Seinfeld episode where Elaine dares to say that she doesn't like The English Patient!    Ever since people (both on and off Amazon) started ripping into anyone who says they don't like the movie, I've been wondering why the relentless \\"you just don't get it\\" stuff was nudging at my memory. Now I remember. The director has done an amazing job of balancing over-wrought crap so that the audience will play along with his homage.    Interestingly, the people who patiently explain to us morons that the dancer was breaking down psychologically because of yada yada, uh, the pressure she put on herself and because her mother was a) nuts b) smothering (take your pick) don't seem to get that maybe the mother was neither. Maybe the birthday cake scene never happened. Ooooh. Deep.    As someone else commented, I'm looking forward to getting the DVD so that I can turn the sound off and dub in my own dialogue, or maybe the Seinfeld English Patient episode sound track. Excellent.
0425170349|3.0|If you enjoy a solid military story this is a book you will enjoy reading. Personally not being a military person I found the story a bit dragging. The start is excellent with a terrorist attack on Russia's largest of oil and gasoline storage facilities which presents a major national problem for the country once it is destroyed. From there they work out a solution of how to capture another county's oil fields to allevite their own shortages and off to a military solution we go. The end of the book has some interesting twists as well which the reader will enjoy. Overall the book is a worth while piece of literature especially if you enjoy military tactics and battles being fought.

1599218011|3.0|I purchased this book after reading a couple of interviews with Kris Carr. She came across as strong, smart, and humble with a fantastically empowering life story. This book has disappointed me greatly. While she has a gift for simplifying diet science, the use of ridiculous similes and metaphors is incredibly trying. At one point she explains that digesting meat is like a \\"coke whore bender\\" for one's intestinal bacteria. Vulgar for all the wrong reasons, and wait!?! What does that even mean? There is also superfluous use of the word \\"titties,\\" which seems more fitting for junior high school locker room talk. Now, admittedly, I've NEVER read a diet book. I've never been on a \\"diet.\\" I'm vegan, interested in wellness, and not as healthy as I would like to be. She claims that weight loss is just a \\"side-effect\\" of this diet, but makes sure to mention at any point possible that one can use this diet to rid the \\"big C,\\" and she doesn't mean cancer,rather...cellulite. She claims to champion self love, but is turning the dimples on your thighs into an enemy the way to accomplish that? Not for me. I would like to say that this review is strictly on the writing, I am no expert on the science. This book did encourage me to purchase a juicer, which I now love. However, aside from some useful (but expensive) resources for health and wellness items, I believe the same information on health could be found in numerous places for less, probably even free. This book is lackluster, and at times downright insulting.

0062515675|5.0|I'm a negative person and this book is helping me a lot.  It is the story of big shot lawyer who discovers a much better, calm, fulfilling life and then tells an ex-coworker (and us) about it.<br /><br />It tells a fable that makes no sense originally but it's used as a reminder of the things that will help you live a better life.  Each of the main things on the fable represent an idea and the fable helps you remember all of them.<br /><br />To me the books is already worth it just with the first chapter.  It is helping me avoid, or at least kick the negative thoughts out of my mind.  The book explains, how our mind is like a garden and depending on your thoughts you can have a beautiful garden or one full of weed.  I have started with a pretty ugly garden but I'm already working on improving it.<br /><br />That's just the beginning, then it goes from there, giving more wisdom with every chapter.<br /><br />Please, if you are a negative person, you need to read this book.

I was very diligent in making sure I was buying a box set that contained the original versions of the film ... even had the right picture on the front.

My son had opened the package and was watching them before I even got home and realized the mistake.  Disappointed.

B004L49K2A|5.0|I'm one of the many who lost interest in Duran Duran after 1985. Though I did purchase Notorious and Big Thing, and eventually Liberty, only to reluctanctly realize that I did not like them at all. Duran Duran had succumbed to the traditional trappings of success and musical growth, and thus lost their personality. The overuse of funky rhythms, female backing singers and horn sections left me bored. Even their comeback in 1993 was of complete disinterest to me and I've not paid much attention since.    But then came the reunion of the original line up. I saw them on tour for that reunion in late 2003, and was so pleased with the show they put on. Duran Duran's debut album will always be my favorite, and when they played 5 songs from it, I was thrilled. Then they played 2 then-new songs and I was completely bored. When Astronaut was released, I didn't go near it.    Then came the news that Mark Ronson, a long time fan of DD's early sound, was going to try to bring back the sounds of their former glory, I couldn't help but be curious. As samples of new songs started appearing online, I could hear the long lost sounds of 30 years ago, and began to get excited.    I purchased All You Need Is Now in its deluxe edition on the day of release, and I cannot stop playing it. I never thought the day would come that I would be excited about another Duran Duran album, and I thank Mark Ronson for reminding the band how amazing they can be when they are not immersing themselves in attempted credibility or modern \\"growth\\" nonsense. This album is better than Rio.    The hooks on All You Need Is Now are endless. While some people have been indifferent to releasing the title track as the first single, I think its got a great melody and some appreciated quirk. But the highlights for me are the phenominally catchy `Other People's Lives' and `Too Bad You're So Beautiful'. Followed very closely by `Runway Runaway', `Being Followed', and `Girl Panic!'  It's usually the upbeat songs that catch my ear initially, but some of the mid-tempo numbers have proven to be gorgeous instant classics. `The Man Who Stole A Leopard', `Before The Rain', and `Mediterranea' are all wonderful songs. The only truly dire song is the stomach-turning `Safe'. It's got all the excessive funky nonsense that put me off of DD in the first place, and it's very out of place in the track listing.    The special edition I have came with a total of 17 songs, and the last 3 seem obvious to have been done after Ronson's departure. They sound a bit more modern and fairly out of place. `Too Close To The Sun' has an attractive chorus but Simon sings the song so willingly whiney and nasally that it's a drawback. Simon can sound nasally, especially during live performances, but he's gone out of the way to do so here. `Early Summer Nerves' is an unlistenable bore. The best of the 3 is `Networker Nation'. Though it still sounds fairly modern, it's catchy enough but still not to the standard of the original album tracks.    Having been turned off to \\"new\\" music for almost 20 years, I'm finding that some veteran artists have returned over the last several years with some of their best work. It's been so rewarding to hear artists in their 50's and 60's release material that rivals their best efforts from their heyday: Lene Lovich - Shadows and Dust (2006), The B-52's - Funplex (2008), Sparks - Exotic Creatures of the Deep (2008), Devo - Something For Everybody (2010), Josie Cotton - Pussycat Babylon (2010), and now Duran Duran. I highly recommend this amazing work.    I've watched numerous recent interviews with Duran Duran regarding the return to their roots sound of this new album. They seem to be getting irritated about it and quickly defend it by saying that they believe it to still be modern. Not wanting to disrespect the band, this album would not have been the creative success without Mark Ronson encouraging the band to rediscover their originally exciting spirit. I fully expect this to be a fluke and that Duran Duran will be back to making forgettable music after this, unless they retain Mark Ronson to keep them sounding as they should. Yes, the new album is retro, but it's also undeniably Duran Duran. No one else sounds like them. In the fruitful early 80's, numerous bands has such distinctive sounds that sounded like no other, but then they either split up or went down mundane street never to return. Duran Duran may just be revisting an old neighborhood from the past, but I would be overjoyed if they decided to take up residence there once again. Welcome home, boys.

1853260320|5.0|Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's third novel. Dr Ian Littlewood describes it in his introduction as her first \\"fully mature work\\". The novel centres around Fanny Price, who, from the age of nine, is raised by her aunt and uncle, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram, in the company of her cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia, and her aunt Norris. Austen's prose gives us a clear snapshot of what life was like for the well-to-do and also the less well-off in Regency England. In this novel, Austen deals, as usual, with morality and, in this case, also with adultry. Austen's characters are well portrayed and it is easy to see why her novels are still popular today.
0439023513|2.0|Today I finished the Hunger Games trilogy. I began Hunger Games this past Saturday, ordered Catching Fire and Mockingjay on Monday, got the two in the mail on Wednesday and am now finished. Four days of actual reading time for three books, which seems like quite an accomplishment. I know most of my friends may be impressed with the speed in which I read, but I think finishing these books so quickly say more about Suzanne Collins than me.<br /><br />It has been a while since I have read such a captivating book. I originally resisted jumping on the band-wagon and reading the popular series. The books didn't really seem my style, and honestly, they aren't my style, but I decided to read them anyway after reading a good review of the series by one of my favorite authors. And I am so glad I did.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy is really well written. The language isn't very poetic or beautiful, but the plot is extremely captivating. The story took a hold of me and I could not put the books down - until the final book that is, but we'll get to that in a minute. Collins dives the reader right down into the story, very vividly portraying both the characters and setting. The plot of Hunger Games is breath-taking. I literally held my breath in suspense at some parts of the story. Catching Fire, too, kept up a very quick pace. Mockingjay, however, left much to be desired. The story seemed to take a long time to get the action, and the sense of urgency felt in the first two books was missing.<br /><br />Overall I was just disappointed with the conclusion of the series. I had such high hopes for Mockingjay, and while it was well-written and just a great story in general, it had some huge flaws. Firstly, the deaths in the final chapters of the story were entirely too quick. Finnick, who became a very central character in Katniss's life, dies so quickly that I barely have time to acknowledge his death before the next. The reader has no time to mourn over the character or really even realize the magnitude his death must take in Katniss's life. The same goes for Prim. I didn't understand Prim's death at all. It seemed just thrown into the story. Earlier in the series I worried that Collins wouldn't have the heart to kill off any of the people Katniss needs. However, I was more disappointed when she did. Prim's death just seemed unnecessary. Even further infuriating is that she gets only a few sentences. I feel that Prim, the most important person in Katniss's life, the person Katniss would willingly sacrifice herself for, suddenly dies and then the chapter ends. I can excuse Prim's death, however, because it does add to the plot. I can see Collins' reasoning for killing Prim. What I cannot excuse, however, is the erosion of Katniss's character throughout Mockingjay.<br /><br />In the first book Katniss is a heroine. She is willing to sacrifice herself for her sister, she fights bravely and valiantly in the hunger games, she saves Peeta's life and even her own. I admired Katniss's fire. In Mockingjay, however, she is no longer the girl on fire. She is no longer a heroine. Suddenly Katniss is a little girl to whom the story happens. It irritated me how much she resemble Bella, of Twilight, sitting and waiting, doing nothing on her own. I understand that Collins' wanted to help the reader understand the brutality of war, the feelings of desolateness and fear Katniss must have felt. But I, the reader, needed Katniss to do something. I needed her to be something in the story. Katniss's transformation from the first book was almost unbearable to read. She spends a majority of the book either on drugs or hiding in isolation, and when she does act she inevitable injures herself and once again returns to drugs. Also annoying was that she seems to forget how much she loves her family. She pushes them away and leaves them several times with no explanation or goodbye. Several times she mourns for her father, but Prim and her mother seem to fall asidewithout any explanation until Prim's death.<br /><br />Prim and Katniss's mother aren't the only characters whose story seems to be forgotten. What happened to the Peeta/Gale/Katniss love triangle? I completely understand that Katniss's confused feelings about the boys is not the central story. It shouldn't be. However, it should be part of the story. In the beginning I was glad that Katniss wasn't choosing between Peeta and Gale. She loved them both, in her own way, but did not need to be in love with either of them. In the end, though, I did want her to choose. There is so much build-up in the book about the conflict between Peeta and Gale over Katniss, and then she doesn't even choose. I never really had a \\"team\\" throughout the series. I could understand why Katniss cared for both Peeta and Gale. The two offered very different things for Katniss. But I did want someone to win. But instead of Katniss choosing, Gale makes the decision. He drifts away and Katniss just accepts Peeta. Which was just so sad to me.<br /><br />Katniss just doesn't rise up to my expectations in the book. She just kind of dies to me. She was once so vibrant and so exciting; but in the end, instead of living she just exists. Everything I loved about her character seems to fade away by the end of the story. In Hunger Games she kept me turning the pages, exhilarated by her story, eager to read what would happen next. In Mockingjay, she caused me to slam the book shut. \\"I vote yes...for Prim.\\"<br /><br />That one line honestly ruined the series for me. One thing I loved about the books was that they fought so intensely against the totalitarian regime and the inhumanity of the Capitol. They fight to change the people, but in the end, they're still the same. When the rebel tributes vote to continue the hunger games, it completely broke my heart. Especially with Katniss's vote. In the end it is revenge, not the desire for change, that wins.<br /><br />Katniss does redeem herself somewhat by assassinating President Coin, but I will never forget that she voted for the Hunger Games. After all she had seen, after knowing the utter inhumanity and injustice of it all, she is just like them. I cannot describe the sadness I felt when I realized nothing had changed and nothing would ever change for the people of Panem. Even though the Hunger Games are actually cancelled, forever, I am left feeling hopeless.<br /><br />\\"Are you preparing for another war, Plutarch?\\" I ask. \\"Oh, not now. Now we're in that sweet period where everyone agrees that our recent horrors should never be repeated,\\" he says. \\"But collective thinking is usually short-lived. We're fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction. Although who knows? Maybe this will be it, Katniss.\\"<br /><br />Sadly, I think that the people of Panem remain \\"fickle, stupid beings.\\" The Hunger Games trilogy was marvelously written and I am sure I will read them again. The series was thought-provoking and heart-wrenching. It wasn't hopeful, though.<br /><br />I admire Collins' courage to avoid  stereotypical happy endings. I however, enjoy happy endings. Which is probably the root of my disappointment.im's death.    Prim and Katniss's mother aren't the only characters whose story seems to be forgotten.

Everything I loved about her character seems to fade away by the end of the story. In Hunger Games she kept me turning the pages, exhilarated by her story, eager to read what would happen next. In Mockingjay, she caused me to slam the book shut. \\"I vote yes...for Prim.\\"    That one line honestly ruined the series for me. One thing I loved about the books was that they fought so intensely against the totalitarian regime and the inhumanity of the Capitol. They fight to change the people, but in the end, they're still the same. When the rebel tributes vote to continue the hunger games, it completely broke my heart. Especially with Katniss's vote. In the end it is revenge, not the desire for change, that wins.    Katniss does redeem herself somewhat by assassinating President Coin, but I will never forget that she votedfor the Hunger Games. After all she had seen, after knowing the utter inhumanity and injustice of it all, she is just like them. I cannot describe the sadness I felt when I realized nothing had changed and nothing would ever change for the people of Panem. Even though the Hunger Games are actually cancelled, forever, I am left feeling hopeless.    \\"Are you preparing for another war, Plutarch?\\" I ask. \\"Oh, not now. Now we're in that sweet period where everyone agrees that our recent horrors should never be repeated,\\" he says. \\"But collective thinking is usually short-lived. We're fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction. Although who knows? Maybe this will be it, Katniss.\\"    Sadly, I think that the people of Panem remain \\"fickle, stupid beings.\\" The Hunger Games trilogy was marvelously written and I am sure I will read them again. The series was thought-provoking and heart-wrenching. It wasn't hopeful, though.    I admire Collins' courage to avoid  stereotypical happy endings. I however, enjoy happy endings. Which is probably the root of my disappointment.
B004SCI9BS|5.0|The more I listen to this album, the more I enjoy songs that I thought I wouldn't ever like during the first few listens of the album. It's rare that I listen to an album and fall in love with it immediately. My favorite album of all time, Blood Sugar Sex Magik by the Chili Peppers is a perfect example of this as I couldn't get into it at first except for a few songs but now just about every track on that album is funky-licious and awesome.    Anyway, back to the Strokes. Bands are always critical of their own stuff and I'm not surprised if some members of the Strokes said they aren't happy with how the album turned out. However, I'm pretty sure the Strokes would have completely scrapped this album if they were actually THAT unhappy with it. The Strokes don't seem like a band that would half-ass their work and even if they are insecure about the album, it doesn't mean that it isn't a great album.     Some of the tracks on this album will be some of my favorites Strokes songs period. For example, Machu Picchu has this 80s reggae mix feel which is very unique and very cool and a perfect way to start the album. Under cover of darkness is also a great track and it's not surprising that they chose this as their first single.     I realize this not really the best review as it's not that in depth but what spurred me to write this review is that it is IMPERATIVE that you give this album a lot of listens. Not just a few listens but a PLETHORA of listens. If you are a hardcore Strokes fan you will start to enjoy this album more and more without realizing it and songs that you might have been \\"meh\\" about could quite possibly be tracks that you put on repeat.     LET    THE    ALBUM     GROW      ON     YOU!!  You won't regret it and disregard the low review on here. Some people can't handle a band changing and I feel bad for these people. Open up your minds and if you are that bummed that a band has changed their direction a little bit then just continue listening to their old stuff. The Strokes have maintained their trademark stroke-ish sound anyway...Hope you all give this album a chance if you consider yourself strokes fans!
B004QYZATW|5.0|What do you do when you have a great idea. You get the best people.  This movie works hard to look simple and is a success. When the portfolio of great works is compiled is 50 or 500 years, The Tourist like the Lives of Others will be on the list.  As part of cinematic history, look back at the French Comedies like The Tall Blond Man with One Red Shoe or Romance like Charade  or intrigue like the Lives of Others.  For Drama look at the Merchant of Venice yes Timothy Dalton tries to get his pound of flesh.  Complex plots that involve audience perception and involvement are hard to pull off.  The Tourist is a sleeper.  The more your look the more your discover how much you missed.  This is a love pentagonal think A Little Night Music.  A dance with the prime characters in the center waiting for the viewer to catch up.  See it at home with friends.  Feast on the Venice Scenes and for dessert enjoying unraveling the threads of thought that went into the plot, casting and visual impact.  Bon Apetite
1423101499|5.0|This review is spoiler free!<br /><br />Percy Jackson is back at Camp Half-Blood - and there is yet another problem.  Or rather, the continuing problem of Kronos and his growing army.  When another oracle is revealed - this time to Annabeth - the daughter of Athena chooses three inhabitants of the camp to go with her: Percy, Grover, and Tyson.  The three set out on the dangerous mission of finding Ariadne's string before Kronos' monsters can find it, but it turns out there is more to their quest...and that it is all the more dangerous.  With Grover still wanting to find Pan, and Annabeth desperate to accomplish this quest - even though it seems someone will die in the end - Percy must once more use his wits and the power of Poseidon to help his friends and prevent Kronos from being able to navigate Daedalus' deceitful labyrinth.<br /><br />___________________________________________<br /><br />My thoughts:<br /><br />Ummm...can I say, \\"WOW\\"?  Because that's how I feel right now - and have felt since I finished this book.  I will start by saying this is my favorite Percy Jackson book so far.  It had a tone that was a bit more serious than the others, but its contents are fascinating to no end.  Not kidding, I was ten times more hooked than in the last three, and I really really liked those!<br /><br />Percy is altogether a likable guy.  If I was in the story, I'd have a major crush on him...  He's smart, kind, reliable, and has faults to make him more human.  And more likable, I say.  When I'm reading these books, especially this one, I feel like I've grown up with him.  He started out as a 12-year-old who thinks he's a mortal with ADHD and dyslexia.  Now he's almost sixteen and has skills like none other, and fights demigods and monsters - and sometimes gods.  He's like the Hercules of our time.  You can't help but love him!  And just when you think he's pulled the coolest stunt in the series so far, he does something else that's even cooler.  The fight scene in chapter 14, \\"My Brother Duels Me To The Death\\", has got to be one of the best fight scenes I've read in a long time...maybe in all time.<br /><br />Annabeth's character was altogether more developed in this book, I felt.  Because she had to lead a quest, you see and hear more of her decisions.  It was really neat to get close to her character like never before....to get inside her head a bit.<br /><br />The other characters, of course, are awesome.  They accent the story perfectly; no one is out of place.  And I love the writing.  I can tell Rick Riordan has a fun time writing these books - because the reader has fun reading them!  Percy's voice is unmistakable and (again) likable and interesting to read.  So far, the story has built up perfectly.  It started out with just a little bit about Kronos in the first book, then a little more in the second, then more, and now this - a full battle!  It feels so natural.<br /><br />Favorite character -<br /><br />This has been established: Percy.  However...there is another that tied pretty closely who is only in this book.  That would be Daedalus.  He. Was. Amazing.  The twist in the story that revolved around his character was SO fascinating!<br /><br />Favorite aspect -<br /><br />Percy and Annabeth's growing relationship/friendship (call it what you will).  Their friendship has always intrigued me and I feel it has developed well over these four books.  I can't wait to see what happens between them in the next and final book!<br /><br />One word to sum up this book (and final conclusion) -<br /><br />This book is a maze.  Really and truly.  Not only are the characters stuck in a multi-thousand year old maze for most of the time, but the story events are just like it - twisting and turning and totally surprising.  Highly recommended to everyone...seriously.  This book just topped off an already good series.  And I heard from the kids I babysit that #5 is super duper surprising and that I \\"won't guess in a million years whathappens!\\"  They tried many a time to tell me what happens...I had to plug my ears and make loud noises until they stopped screaming and getting all excited about it...and still they were jumping up and down.  They had me all excited and squealing!  And when I finished The Battle of the Labyrinth, it had me squealing with excitement and clapping my hands and dropping my jaw over and over again, trying to say something worthy.  (Nothing worked...)  So what am I going to do now?  Dive into The Last Olympian, of course!  I'm sure many wonderful and surprising adventures await me there! :)<br /><br />yearningtoread DOT wordpress DOT comntil they stopped screaming and getting all excited about it...and still they were jumping up and down.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Downloaded Angry Birds Rio and I must say that the game is amazing. Extremely fun and a great game to pass the time.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|You have to pay attention and think.  Someone here described it as \\"like a love letter\\" - this is true.  Not for everyone but an excellent movie
B002ZG98C8|4.0|This is a film which combines the talents of a strange mix of actors.  I mean, you have 2 A Movie actors (Robert Deniro, Jessica Alba), 2 former A Movie actors (Steven Seagal, Jeff Fahey) and one thespian whose career is still in a sort of limbo (Lindsay Lohan).  Bring them all together and you have an ultra-fun, over-the-top B movie!<br /><br />The film centers around the rather sensitive topic of illegal immigration.  Namely, Mexicans illegally crossing the Rio Grande into Texas, and tempers tend to flare on both sides.  In the middle of it all is a hero (played by Danny Trejo) who prefers wielding a machete to a machine gun.<br /><br />Seagal's character seems to be more of a spoof than anything else.  It's Seagal's opportunity to portray just the type of thug that he relentlessly went after in his early movies (before his acting career dropped off the map).<br /><br />For those of you scoring at home, Lindsay Lohan does NOT appear topless in this film.  Sad to say, but a body double is in the film in place of her in the swimming pool scene.  Sorry ~ I'm just the messenger on this.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a mostly mindless movie that has plenty of violence & a little bit of nudity sprinkled in, then this movie might be for you.  If you like movies where the ugly guy always gets the hot babe, then this film is a MUST!!
1401310672|5.0|I love DYAC website so much, I am there everyday since I found it back in November, 2010. I share the chats on that site with m y friends on Facebook, my friends at work, it is so so funny. My hardest laughs in the past 4 months have come from here. However with the extra content in this book, I am not sharing it with anyone. It is WELL worth buying the book to see some of these for yourself!    Thanks for the great stuff!
B002ZG997C|2.0|Some 30 years after some sort of nuclear war, the world resembles a Mad Max type of hell.  People struggle to survive, cannibalism becomes common and there is no longer a United States of America.  In its place, small communities basically go back to being city states, and the roads are full of rogues & thieves.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays a self-sufficient man who is able to take care of himself in spite of all the chaos that the world has descended into.  Books have been burned & most of the inhabitants of the planet are illiterate.<br /><br />This is  a well done movie, and you're always going to get top-notch performances from Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and Malcom Macdowell.  There is one problem w/this film, however, and that's the simple fact that it's not a very good movie.  Frankly, I found it to be a yawner.  I kept hoping that the denouement would be profound & make up for everything leading up to it, but it just wasn't to be.  I felt like the ending of the movie was like waiting in line for 3 hours to see Mick Jagger only to be stuck with a Roseanne Barr concert instead.<br /><br />There is one demographic who will likely enjoy this film, and that would be far right-wing religious types.  The religious overtones basically take Old Testament topics & place them into the future.  If you're into that sort of thing, then you might like this film.  If you're a person of no religious persuasion whatsoever (like me!) then you're much more likely to find the whole premise of the storyline to be rather banal.  It's your call.
B000XXI8G2|5.0|These boots are amazing. I don't use them for hiking I use them for fashion, and I have been asked multiple times where got them. Amazing!
B004DK5CYM|4.0|This movie is a great story about the life of Secretariat and it's owner, a housewife. This was truly a great horse, probably the greatest race horse that ever was. The final scene was truly amazing! This movie will have you cheering for Secretariat. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|OMG, I have not brought a cd in years but i had to get this one , love every song on this cd , Jennifer is  the bomb, cannot stop repeating Believe (my favorite) also Why Is It So Hard , I Remember Me , Where You At,No One Gonna Love You  and Still Here , Love You Jennifer cause You Got This !!! Beautiful Album Cover
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Won't install on my EVO. First app download from the Amazon app store and the app won't even install. Way to be Amazon. Why do we need another app store anyway??
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I just watched this movie and totally loved it! It is a really great laugh, and I highly recommended this to anyone with a quirky sense of humor.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Loved it! I have only seen the other \\"Emma\\" starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and honestly, I didn't really like it. I fell asleep. This version, however, was amazing! One episode every Sunday night-kept me in horrible suspense as we waited to find out what would happen to Emma and Mr. Knightley! I wanted to watch it online again, but alas, it was not available to be watched online. I was so excited when I found out I could get it on Amazon!!!! <3
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you prefer saving birds to killing pigs this is the game for you As addictive is the original is My only complaint is that the additional levels aren't available for another month
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I kind of like this better than the original angry birds. nice music and graphics. would definitely recommend to my friends and family. what's up with the 25 word minimum?
B004NELBPC|2.0|I'm not sure that aol actually got its money worth out of this acquisition the &quot;news&quot; Is so slanted it makes the onion seem legitimate

B001PU8N0I|5.0|This is a clean series well cast and realistic. A lesson in human nature with a touch of humor and mystery.    Even my son liked it who has much more sophisticated taste than I.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|Great service and CD is one that I enjoy more each time I play it. Will be interested to hear Greg's next one if it produced. Recommend both!
B004LP601S|5.0|There have been so many eloquent reviews of this album already listed, so I'm not gonna try to top them. I love this album...actually listening to it as I type this...it throws back to \\"Fever\\" but not in a copying way, and some of the songs definitely show the influence of \\"Pretty Odd.\\" I thoroughly enjoyed both previous albums, for different reasons, I think the mixed reception of \\"Vices\\" comes from, in part, the previous albums having such different sounds. If you liked both previous albums, you will like this, if you liked \\"Fever,\\" you'll likely like this, if you fell in love with \\"Pretty Odd\\" and weren't too fond of \\"Fever\\" you may not like it as much.  The boys are definitely growing up, and I, for one, am really liking it.
B000002I27|5.0|The disk came from Europe for the price of a domestic shipment, it took about a week, no more. Both the disk and the case were in mint condition - much better than some totally broken acrylic cases I got cheap from other sellers through Amazon. What else to say? The rest is about The Doors, and I am not starting that topic on a product review here :)
B002FGU45S|5.0|Excellent sandals for those who like to travel in the nature .   They are so soft and comfortable , yet .... Very durable .  From personal experience .... The will travel with you for years
B004SBS8LA|5.0|How can anyone not love the Angry Birds?  Great gameplay &amp; crisp graphics!  Wish I didn't have to deal with going around AT&amp;T's bogus &quot;Security&quot; protections.  If you are on AT&amp;T and want this game, you need to sideload the Amazon App Store .apk file using Google's Adb tool from the Android SDK. Adb runs on a PC with your non-rooted phone connected to it.  Then download and sideload the Angry Birds .apk file using the same Adb tool from the Android SDK and you'll be shooting your birds in less than 5 Minutes!
B0027J4SKA|5.0|Melody Gardot has a lovely voice.  I played this at a house party recently and it was great music from beginning to end.  No loud sreeching, just nice, soft jazz/blues to accompany conversation.  I recommend watching the Skavlan interview on Youtube to get her back story.  It's amazing.  You'll listen to the CD again to learn a bit more about her and then find out that she wrote/composed all of her own songs (except \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" of course).  I highly recommend this CD. You won't need to pick and choose, EVERY song on the CD is engaging.
1439133948|5.0|As Cordelia said in _Shards of Honor_, the author has done this as well.  Cordelia's last four words in her drabble broke my heart.  This book is a quick read, seeming superficially to be just that - superficial.  However, further reflection, upon reading the end of the book, leads to the appreciation that here is yet another Vorkosigan book not only recounting Mad Miles' adventures, but the themes of life and death and that both are a gift.  As Cordelia would say, a great gift, and a great test.    I wish more of the book had been written from Miles' point of view.  Also, the obstacles Miles faced were too easily overcome.  As one character observed, he managed everything by ignoring the rules.  Typical Miles, in as far as it goes.  Yet the level of creativity in problem solving Miles has heretofore displayed was notably dimmed.  Miles has one atypical reaction to a sedative which did not result in his usual hysterically funny babble but in rather uninteresting, plot/theme-irrelevant hallucinations, with little attention paid to the confusion or fear he would have felt while in this condition.  I never once felt Our Hero was in any real peril.  Bujold had missed an opportunity to showcase Miles' ingenuity, cunning, and bravery with the kidnapping, drugging, and subsequent escape, by starting the book just as Miles finishes his long escape and is rescued.    In Ivan's words, I wonder what the old Miles would have said?    Overall I would have rated this book at four stars, but for the end.  It is impeccable, simple, elegant and painful as a scalpel, and worthy of 20 stars.  I am curious as to whether it will receive a Hugo nomination.    I highly recommend this book for Miles fans but suggest, for newcomers, reading the rest of the series first, starting with Shards of Honor (or the omnibus, [[ASIN:0671578286 Cordelia's Honor (Vorkosigan Saga Omnibus: Shards of Honor / Barrayar)]]) to absorb the full impact of the ending drabbles.  This is the most moving book I have read in years.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Simple to learn but difficult to master is usually a great sign of game design.  Requires certain amount of thinking and not just finger gymnastics. Much easier to play on a larger screen.  On a Dell Streak, need to remove the SD card before installing or it will show an unknown error 18 and abort installation. A firmware bug limits the size of an app that can be installed on SD. This program defaults to installing on the SD card with no choice of installing on the phone. By removing the SD card first, the program will install on the phone.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I got this game while it was free for my HTC Glacier (MyTouch 4G). It installed and runs smoothly. Overall the game is very enjoyable with beautiful graphics, entertaining gameplay, and easy controls, and I'd say it's definitely worth the list price of only a dollar. However it's not quite 5 stars because it isn't 100% stable or complete thus feels like it might have been rushed out the door.    As of this writing, the game comes with two worlds with 30 levels each. In the world selection screen it shows 4 empty boxes for worlds that they promise to release over the course of 2011. I played halfway through world 1 but got stuck at a level because I couldn't figure out how to hit all of my targets with the birds I had. It was only later when I read the full description on the Amazon detail page that I discovered that each bird comes with some special ability, and you have to tap the screen to engage it. After the fact I realized that in-game images were trying to convey this to me, but it wasn't clear at the time that it was giving me instructions. I don't know if they were trying to save on translation costs, but even just a small caption would have been sufficient: \\"Instructions for special bird abilities\\" or something.     After figuring out the special bird abilities I was able to move on through the levels. However, when I got to the second world (Jungle escape), the game locked up in the first level and consumed 100% cpu. Thankfully I already had a CPU monitoring / task killer app installed (Usage Timelines Free), so I was able to just kill the game and restart it later. When I went back to the level it played fine and I was able to move on, and it didn't happen to me again.     I played all the way through the two worlds that came with the game. Several of them were pretty challenging, requiring some pretty precise shots, but there were a few here and there that I beat on the first try, so the difficulty of the levels didn't seem entirely consistent.     Overall I greatly enjoyed the experience of playing through the game. I had many laughs due to the comical bouncing and rolling of birds and collapsing structures. I think it would be worth paying for the game if I had to.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Christmas and Halloween are really tough to get all 3* but Valentine's and St. Patrick's are similar to regular angry birds. Good time killer if you are waiting in line or taking public transportation. Turn off the music and sound effects so you can concentrate and also not annoy others around you.

It took a long time, but I am extremely pleased to have this set, as i can finally gain some understanding and clear directions. It can seem intimidating at first, but the directions are clear.

B00009AOBI|5.0|This is a noteworthy movie based on a true story.  It is sad that a person would have to live with something like this, but he seems to be a well-adjusted boy. His mother is very supportive and loving towards him. My grandmother and aunt really enjoyed this movie and wanted me to watch it.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|Hilarious! This is a so-bad-it's-good classic. Lags in the middle, has an almost touching moment late, but this movie is pretty much LOL all the way. Astonishingly bad writing - enjoy!
B00008L3U1|4.0|This is a solid movie.  Robin Williams does a great job pretending to be a 10-year-old boy. The boy's condition is similar to Werner syndrome, a disorder that causes premature aging starting during puberty.
0061537969|5.0|what a refreshing, reflective, and clever piece told by a dog.  who could ever imagine that the perspective of a dog could be so sensitive and so acute.  garth stein has got some major creativity and  talent!!  this is a story that gives the reader hope that there is life after life and that good will always outweigh evil in this world--even dogs know it.  i loved this book!!
0385732554|3.0|The book describes a really sad society, where everything is controlled and the people are like robots. They do not know colors or music, they have climate control and they must always use the correct words when speaking. It reminded me of the movie Pleasantville. The ending was ambiguous as you're not sure if what the boy is experiencing is a memory or if it is real. The novel forms a loose trilogy with Gathering Blue (2000) and Messenger (2004), two other books set in the same future era.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|This tripod does exactly what i wanted. It holds my iphone4 in vertical way as i wanted it. i just use it on top of my desk. To use it in a vertical way you have to align the holder in a way that once the phone is inserted into grip device, it will rest on one of the legs of tripod.For me it was a great buy.

B000KB8DB2|5.0|It is one thing to read a book or listen to somebody narrate a documentary film but it is another to actually hear the words coming out from the very few who survived, those who helped in executing these innocent victims as well as those that were close enough to witness it all. I think of this testimony as a \\"behind the scenes\\" commentary on what was happening to the captured inside the infamous Death Factories throughout Eastern Europe - Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, and Chelmno extermination camps as well as Warsaw and many other less known ghettos where people also died from diseases, starvation and daily murders.    It is not a secret that SS personnel systematically \\"processed\\" up to 2,000 people a day in a gas chamber (just Auschwitz alone) there were, of course, multiple camps such as Auschwitz throughout Eastern Europe (some of them had far more unspeakable cruelty toward prisoners). Every single day, for years - men, women, children, old and sick, entire families were wiped out in a matter of hours with barely any trace of who they were or where they came from. (Czechs were allowed to stay in the camp with all of their families for about 6 months where they were fed and clothed after which they have all been gassed).    I could go on with this review but I feel that other reviewers gave a far better description of what you could expect from watching Shoah. I shouldn't spoil the film and you should see it for yourselves. There's a lot to take in but it is certainly worth it.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|We saw this on PBS and immediately looked it up on Amazon.  The DVD did not dissapoint.  We've watched it 3X with friends and the voices were just so pure and memorable, we enjoy it each time more than the last.  We had bought the 10 year reunion just a few months ago and this one is way better.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|one word... spectacular.... must watch from beginning of the series though other wise the series is not easy to understand...
B004Q3UL2O|2.0|Maybe my expectations were to high given that I was watching a love story with supposed comedic overtones.  Maybe my expectations were too high given that 2 of my favorite actors were in this movie.  Either way, this movie failed on many levels.  I found the chemistry between Gyllenhal and Hathaway forced and unconvincing.  I found the portrayal of pharaceutical representatives an accurate and disturbing look into the mid to late 90's.  But I also felt like this movie glorified Drug Reps in their hay day.  For a movie with comedic potential, it took itself way too seriously.
0307454541|4.0|Having heard so much about this book I felt obligated to read it and see for myself why it has generated so much buzz. As someone who didn't know a tremendous amount about the story going in, I found the book to be much more violent and horrifying than I expected.<br /><br />The book consists of two storylines involving disgraced financial reporter Mikael Blomkvist, and socially-inept hacker Lisbeth Salander. Together the two are trying to uncover the mystery surrounding the death of corporate heiress Harriet Vanger, and expose the financial misdeeds of a prominent tycoon. I was much more taken with the Vanger mystery than with the story about corporate corruption. That was rather dry.<br /><br />One of Larsson's larger objectives in this book is clearly to highlight the disturbing pervasiveness of violence against women. All of the significant violence in the book is gendered, and is perpetrated against female victims. One of its victims is co-protagonist Lisbeth Salander. She is certainly an interesting character, one who is uncomfortable with what many of us might consider basic sociability. She is also a woman who has endured much abuse, and that makes her essential to Larsson's larger point. One of Salander's most significant problems is that legally she is considered a ward of the state. She had been in this position as a child without competent parents, but her status as a legal dependent was allowed to continue into her adulthood. The fact that an adult who earns her own money, holds a job, and is capable of managing the basic elements of day-to-day life can be legally alienated from her money and her basic legal rights is, quite simply, frightening. Clearly Larsson is making an argument against the institution of guardianship. I was unclear if the portion of the text which explain guardianship were part of Larsson's original text, or if they were added by the translator for the non-Swedish audience.<br /><br />This is not the most amazing book I've ever read, but it's a book I'll certainly think about for some time. I suspect I'll read the next two books in the trilogy, as long as I can stomach the violence. Larsson does not glorify the horrific violence about which he writes, but it is, undeniably, difficult to read.ll certainly think about for some time.

142311339X|3.0|This book is definitely appealing to those who have not read the previous series. I thoroughly enjoyed that series but the similarities between the two kind of turn me off. The beginnings are so similar. They have the same kind of idea. Both have to return something in a very small amount of time. When I'm reading a new series I expect new material. Although it is very similar to Percy Jackson, I can forgive it enough to give it a 3 star review because it's so well written.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Never really liked the superMB app, but when I saw the graphics and that was free I decided to download it. Itz a fun game but my physics knowledge only goes so far. As far as the download? Smooth as butter. I feel bad for the Euros, but the BBC did the same to me with their BBC Video program for the PC.
1423113497|4.0|This is an amazing and creative story written by Rick Riordan. The characters are fresh and sometimes humorous (like the part where Grover hunts the hunters in the arcade). The only thing I can complain about is how it looses a little appeal each time you read it but every book does. This book is the first of it's kind that combines ancient mythology with modern day stories. This is a memorable book. There are no characters to dislike because they all play a part and aren't annoying though Percy comstanly needs attention. To be honest, this is one of my favorite books of all time.
0756404738|5.0|Rothfuss keeps it up in day two of the kingkiller chronicles. What keeps this page turner going is the depth and detail of the universe he has created. I'll be waiting eagerly for the sequel.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Nice new graphics and a few new gameplay additions.  New enough to be interesting but still have Angry Birds feel to it.  And it is free!!!
B004GYY714|3.0|this app buffers way the heck to much. i moved and wanted to listen to ks95 still, but all it ever did was buffer. in short, too much buffering= piece of crap
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Finished the game too quickly. I wish they would have had more stages before releasing the game. That's the only reason why it didn't get more stars from me.
0446569895|5.0|I just have to write a few lines, because this book was a real feast for an Ozzy fan like myself. Others already wrote a lot of good things about it and I just want to add some of my comments. First of all, I was impressed by the honesty and openness with which many very personal situations are described. Ozzy went through a lot of good but also a lot of hard times and the book has abundance of both. After reading this book, I gained even more respect for Ozzy. To achieve what he was able to achieve, it takes a lot of talent, persistence and hard work. This book tells it all. Many would get discouraged by all the setbacks he had to go through but he was always able to regroup and achieve even bigger success. What a life! I'm still in awe that somebody was able to go through so much in one life.
031261246X|2.0|This is my first review ever, so please be forgiving with the form (not necessarily with the content).     In this book Mark describes a world that is about to be attacked by a group of terrorists. The kind of attack is one that will supposedly bring the World-As-We-Know-It to a halt due to our actual dependency on computers and the Internet. Mark describes the efforts and sacrifices a pair of highly technical individuals have to make in order to stop this attack and save the world. I won't comment on the outcome of these two individuals efforts, that would be an spoiler, but you will pretty much guess what it will be after reading the first quarter (maybe less) of the book.    There are two things that I did not like from this book.     First, I found the plot to be thin and highly predictable. As I mentioned in the last paragraph, from the very first chapters of the book you start knowing all there is from the characters involved: their motives, their flaws and the role each of them are going to play at the end. There are a couple of surprises here and there but at the end, I found them to be inconsequential to the history.     Second, and the issue that bothered me the most (and pushed me to do this review), is that the plot is full of clichés: the Russians are corrupt, the Arabs are all fundamentalists in a quest to destroy America, the Chechen are all criminal, Latin American is the prostitution backyard of the Americans and so on. The only american character that was portrayed under a bad light was because of his uncontrolled ambition and not because of his patriotism. I got the feeling that the message that the book was conveying was that everything that is outside America is bad and dangerous.    I only hope that the world view that Mark built for this book is the by-product of his first work writing a novel and not how he really \\"sees\\" and \\"thinks\\" the world. For what is worth, for me, a huge fan of his technical work, would be disappointing.
B004RQ5WUG|5.0|This album is so good I listen to it over and over again.  They hit it on the head.  Every song is interesting and different.  No songs sound the same they all are different and unique.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|Many theater-goers and critics have stated that those who do not enjoy \\"Black Swan\\" must not have understood what the film was about.  It seems to be the same argument used for those who did not like \\"Inception\\".  \\"If you did not like it, you must have missed the point entirely, you stupid person, you!\\"  Well, excuse me for using my brain and questioning the logic and mediocre writing that is passing itself off as creativity.  \\"Black Swan\\" is, without a doubt, the most ridiculous and over-the-top tripe I have ever witnessed.  This film may be somewhat enjoyable after having consumed an entire sheet of acid, but being sober and of sound mind is not the way to go.  The opening sequence of the film was promising, Portman dancing onstage with a man dressed in black, covered in feathers.  The man morphs into a black swan creature as he spins around and the music swells and we are sucked into the freakshow that is to follow.  Portman is a woman who lives at home with her outlandish stage mom, played by Barbara Hershey, who is in the running for worst mother ever.  Hold onto your eyebrows, Joan Crawford, there's a new sherriff in town!  Hershey is certainly a postermother for Munchausen by proxy syndrome.  Her mother dotes on her and, after noticing strange scratches on Portman's back, clips her nails with a feverish intensity.  No nail clippers here, we use scissors!  I half expected to see Faye Dunaway stride in and pull all of her clothes out of the closet, seeking out those pesky wire hangers.  Portman's professional life isn't going so well, either.  The company she performs for is doing a re-imagining of \\"Swan Lake\\" and she wants the lead of the \\"Swan Queen\\".  The only way to get the part, it seems, is to do a little tonsil hockey with the man who runs the ballet company.  He only gives the leads to those who are willing to put out.  He has an issue with her going after the part, considering she has an inability to tap into her dark side.  Portman must forego her virginal ways and become a crazed, semi-lesbian in order to better understand what it is to be the \\"black swan\\".  Mila Kunis is there to usher her through that phase.  She is the Gina Gershon to Portman's Elizabeth Berkley.  We spend most of the film wondering if things are really happening, or if it is just an occurence in Portman's shattered psyche.  There are so many problems with this film, the praises it is receiving is astounding.  Portman is shrill and over-the-top throughout, Kunis serves as nothing more than sex on legs and Hershey is laughable.  So much of this film is laughable.  At one point, Winona Ryder stabs herself in the face, multiple times, with a nail file.  I know how you feel, Winona.  The most absurd section of the film comes at the end.  After having it out with Kunis in the dressing room and stabbing her in the stomach, Portman stashes the body away and rushes to the stage.  THE SHOW MUST GO ON!  After finishing her scene on stage, she rushes back to the dressing room only to discover that there is NO BODY!  She is absolutely terrified and confused, but she has to go back on stage to perform the final scene.  While she dances, she notices Kunis is dancing on stage with everyone else.  Perhaps everything that has happened was in her mind!  Perhaps if Portman were to look into a mirror, Tyler Durden would be there with a bar of soap.  She does the final dance and \\"kills herself\\" by leaping off of a ramp onto a mattress.  As the company gathers around her, congratulating her on a job well done, everyone notices that she is bleeding out from her abdomen.  So she actually stabbed herself, NOT Kunis?  Puh-lease.  She danced for the last part of the film with a piece of shattered mirror embedded in her abdomen?!  I realize that most films rely on a leap of faith from its viewers, but I would rather take a swan dive from the tallest building than see this s#!t again.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|[NO SPOILERS]    Before seeing this movie, I was fully aware of its low Metacritic rating. In spite of that, I decided to give it a try. After all, BATTLE: LA got trashed by critics and I found that movie to be not as bad as everyone said. Not only that, but I love airships, steampunk creations, WWII battles, fantasy novels, feudal Japan and photogenic women. You'd think this would be my perfect movie. I wish it was! . . . but it wasn't.    The biggest complaint I heard for Suckerpunch were the slow-motion scenes. Honestly, the slow-motion didn't bother me one bit. In fact, it was actually a RELIEF to be able to see the action instead of feeling sea-sick due to shaky-cam techniques so jarring that you'd think that Jaws was holding the camera in his mouth during a frenzied attack.    But while the slow-motion wasn't an issue, there were tons of other things that were:    1) The movie uses slow-motion to make everything look \\"cool\\". Bullet cases raining down, huge monsters sliding across the ground, gravity-defying acrobatics that would make any ninja jealous. Unfortunately, it's not like we haven't seen any of this before, so it may not impress you for very long.    2) There is almost no emotional attachment to any of the characters. When things happened to them, I felt as empty as the clockwork Nazis and robots that they killed by the hundreds.    3) Baby Doll's surreal music-triggered worlds are certainly entertaining at times, but the harsh truth is that probably 2/3 of the movie takes place in a depressing asylum and boring bordello dance-school. In fact, it seems like the only way they could prolong this surreal world escapism was by resorting to slow-motion while fighting copious groups of enemies.    4) Finally, I could have done without all the narrator-spoken philosophical questions used to try and4pass this movie off as \\"intelligent\\" and \\"serious\\". The ending, instead of blowing you away, bores you with admonishment. I thought this was going to be a mindless, surreal fantasy romp, not AESOP'S FABLES.    ALTERNATIVES:    If you like the \\"Girl uses her imagination to replace reality\\" plotline, then I highly recommend PAN'S LABYRINTH--a film with a far better story and engaging soundtrack.    If you're into perverted chef's and weird characters in general, try Mervyn Peake's GORMENGHAST books. You won't find a more twisted chef than Abiatha Swelter.      This movie tries to show that you can use the power of your mind to make realities more palatable. Unfortunately, no amount of imagination can delude me into thinking that this movie is anything more than a fantasy with a lot of flaws.
1400052181|5.0|This book was an education and shined a light on a part of medical science and history I knew nothing about. Thank you to the author for writing Henrietta's story and telling it in a way that makes it accessible to the masses.
0749942010|5.0|This book belongs to one of my favourite genres (psychological thriller with a twist) and so, because I read so many, I am particularly fussy. Well, I could not have been more pleased with it. It has absolutely captured me from the very first line to the very last one. An engaging read written in letter form, from a sister to another.     Beatrice lives in New York with her fiancé. Her mother rings her up one day delivering shattering news: her younger sister Tess has vanished. The ties between sisters are very strong despite the geographical distance and of course Beatrice hops on the first plane out to London. The circumstances of Tess' disappearance are multi-layered with obscure details and Beatrice is determined to find Tess no matter what. Little does she know, boarding that plane, of the journey she will have to face, uncovering some horrible, painful and frightening facts that will forever change everybody's life.     This book deserves a high praise because it is not only engaging, it has a certain psychological depth that is seldom felt on fast-paced reads, no matter how entertaining. The vocabulary is stylish and cultured and it perfectly conveys emotions and feelings, entwined with the chilly, suspenseful atmosphere that permeates the story. It also defines the deep, deep love between the two sisters. Piercingly touching.     Thumbs up for debut writer Rosamund Lupton!
B002XMGGK6|4.0|There are so many glaring mistakes in this movie it will hurt your brain unless you have had a traumatic brain injury.  One of the most glaring is when he waives his right to council during his interrogation  yet when he is in court there is NO ONE at the defense table to assist him.NO JUDGE WOULD LET THIS HAPPEN.  They don't keep him in the county jail they have him in PRISON-Impossible  This is more like an order of Law And Order than a movie.From having a male/female prosecutor team with a white haired chief DA and a female Lt. policewoman who controls the detectives one of whom is also a bomb technician!!!!    The bad guy is so smart that he doesn't have any alarm system on his hide out!!! yet he was able to tunnel into EVERY SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL WITH NO ONE HEARING.    And again like Law And Order when the DA can't find what they need the girl atty has a \\"Friend\\" who can get the information.Not another legal agency,but a friend.    I could go on and on there are so many more glaring impossibilities.They are so obvious a 5 year old  can and will see them.    Please don't watch this,you can't get back the time you wasted and that will make you very angry.
B001ECDVKE|1.0|No problem with the movie itself including the second version. However, I was not aware it is a subtitled DVD, on BOTH versions no less. This leaves out the option to watch at least the unsubtitled movie. I don't know about anyone else but for me, I find this very distracting & takes away from the whole experience. I was extremely disappointed. If I had known....oh well.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I have not seen this item.  I had it sent as a gift to a teenage friend.  He has seen it before, but raved at his gift.  I asked him if it was OK and he said \\"definitely\\".  And he told me it was \\"like a really great surprise.\\"  End of story.  And that's my review.
B0009F2EPU|5.0|Every time I watch or listen to this production of the Ring, I feel comforted that I seemed to be one of the only voices praising it when it first was produced in Bayreuth. There may be some better Siegfrieds, better Brunnhildes, etc. but no recording presents such perfection as a whole from start to finish. It might very well remain the Ring by which all others will be judged.   Robert Lepage has a difficult task but is poorly served by a substandard cast (`park and bark` Terfel, obese Blyth and `past her BBD Voight).

B0044RUSZM|2.0|When first purchased, this stand worked well. It's stylish, inexpensive, holds the laptop at a nice angle, and collapses down to a very portable size. However, after a couple of years the rubber pads lose their \\"stick\\" and your laptop will just slide right off. It will still hold my older 13\\" white plastic Macbook fairly securely, but my unibody 13\\" MacBook Pro slides off far too easily now.<br /><br />I can't really recommend this stand. It becomes a danger to your laptop after a couple of years. I need to replace mine with a Rain Designs stand, or something similar that has a \\"lip\\" at the bottom and will safely hold the laptop.<br /><br />UPDATE: it's possible to 'refresh' the rubber with rubbing alcohol. You'll have give it a rubdown every so often, but it does extend the life of the stand and lets you safely stick a unibody laptop on it. However, unless you need a portable stand, I'd still get something with a lip that doesn't rely on rubber.
1594133379|5.0|What makes this book special is the spiritual insight it offers. When the author's left hemisphere of her brain was incapacitated by a hemorrhagic stroke, she experienced the spiritual feeling of \\"oneness\\" with the universe, feeling no distinction from her body and the rest of the energy molecules around her.  In the absence of the judgment of her left mind, she experienced deep internal peace and joy, the \\"Nirvana\\" that exists in the consciousness of our right brain. She explained how, at any moment, we can choose to hook into that part of our brain. Meditation is one way, and definitely, a less traumatic way than suffering a stroke. She also offers wonderful insights into quieting the constant \\"story telling\\" and chatter of the left brain, to bring you into the now, the peace of the right brain which only experiences the present moment, where there is no fear or anger. I was impressed with her scientific explanations of how we experience these negative emotions physiologically for 90 seconds, but can then choose to let them go and return to a peaceful state.<br /><br />Taylor learned to reign in the judgment and ego center of her left brain and retain the compassionate feeling of oneness that was her only sensation when the left hemisphere of her brain was impaired. I thank her for sharing her experience and the wisdom she acquired in her journey back to wholeness. She says, \\"I choose to observe my environment through the nonjudgmental eyes of my right mind, allowing me to retain my inner joy.... it's really easy to be kind to others when I remember that none of us came into this world with a manual about how to get it all right.\\"<br /><br />A fascinating read! Namaste, Becca Chopra, author of The Chakra Diaries
B003EY7IUY|3.0|I read Shopaholic and Sister and Shopaholic and Baby. I enjoyed both, so when I found out that another had been released, I was excited to start reading it. Boy was I disappointed. I actually read 3 or 4 chapters and stopped for awhile. I read a few other books on my kindle, and then due to a girl I knew who was continually asking if I had finished it yet I started reading more of it. I agree with many other reviewers, that while Beckys antics seemed cute and realistic for a girl in her early 20's and just learning how to manage money and be on her own, you would think that almost a decade later after getting married, traveling all over the world, and becoming a mother she would have grown up a little bit.<br /><br />Instead she finds more excuses to turn her bratty spoiled daughter into her little mini me. Being a mother myself I was appalled by some of the stuff that went on. And Kinsella obviously has no children of her own, and I highly doubt she consulted any child experts with this book because she has the supposed child behavior expert telling Becky and Luke that Minnie is a perfectly normal toddler. Um, no effing way is that kids behavior anywhere near what I would consider normal or acceptable. I have 2 kids who are not perfect by any means, but never have they come near to the actions of the spoiled little monster that Sophie Kinsella created in this book.<br /><br />I thought about giving this book 2 stars, but I decided to be generous and give it 3 because it was, as 3 stars represents, OK. I definately think that either the shopaholic series should end here, or the author needs to come up with some very different plot lines, and maybe have Becky grow up quite a bit because she is just getting annoying.
0321544080|5.0|I have tons of books, this one is by far the best read.  It is easy to read, interesting and very, very informative in a SIMPLE way.  No hard to understand specifics AND it really gives you ideas and desires to explore your shots more.  A must have for your library...one that you can re-read to revive your boring shoots!!!
B000FCKBCU|4.0|Overall I have to say I really enjoyed this book. At first it started off a little slow, I had to remind myself that I liked the shopaholic books and this was the same author. I almost put it down but decided to read one more chapter. And boy Im glad I did! I actually think i liked this book better than the shopaholic books, because the main character seemed more realistic than Becky Bloomwood/Brandon. She wasnt as silly I guess is how I would say it. The ending was a little cliche, but still very romantic and I actually love movies with the same ending, so I enjoyed it alot. Once I got a few chapters in I couldnt put it down! I have now purchased 2 more books by Sophie Kinsella aside from the shopaholic series after reading this book. Highly recommended if you enjoyed Kinsellas previous work!

B004DMIIOG|5.0|I'm not a film critic. I am an anime fan. I'm a bit biased towards this movie as a result. However, this release garners 5 stars from me for several logical reasons. First of which being, the English voice-acting is of a very high quality. The translation is accurate to the spirit of original Japanese, if not the content explicitly. The actors seem very authentic, and with very few exceptions sound quite invested in their work.     That said, I prefer the Japanese. I'm familiar enough with the culture to appreciate it from an outside perspective. So why do I care so much about the English? I don't like watching movies alone, and not all of my friends and family are comfortable reading subtitles. I tell them learning Japanese is the best solution, but most aren't quite interested in becoming that invested. High-quality English makes for easy introduction to this movie.    What carries it, is the easy pace and undeniable style of the film. The visuals are stunning in their attention to detail, both in the \\"real world\\" and OZ centered scenes. The movie sets itself up effortlessly in just a few minutes, and then throws you into the center of the story rather quickly. Kenji's status as a math nerd and social idiot is a tried and true one, and the cool beauty of Natsuki isn't new either. Simply well executed here. Without spoiling the story too much, the introduction of Natsuki's family to both Kenji and the audience is a whirlwind (putting it lightly). While some people would argue the sheer number of characters would make them shallow and not leave time for development, I would tend to disagree. Kenji is overwhelmed at the situation, he's our protagonist so we should share that with him. That said, despite the huge number of folks flicking on and off screen the important few shine through in just the right way. The stern but loving grandmother, eccentric uncles, overbearing aunts, and annoying cousins are damn near universal in most families. They're all here too, and more like my own than I might care to admit. So, surprise surprise, it's a bit of a family film. Of course, throwing in the high-tech near-future environment of the OZ Network gives you an entirely new layer to work through.    OZ isn't too far away from how we live now. We bundle cell phones, home phones, internet, and TV. OZ is that, plus Facebook, and pretty much all of your billing and work-related systems slammed into one. Games, media, communications, business, and financial services all through one central hub. Just like in the real world, the cyber world of \\"Summer Wars\\" starts reaching into everyday life in very unexpected ways. Of course, things go quite a bit further in the film. This is where that little \\"Deeper Meaning\\" comes in. The \\"Wars\\" in question are between the real people of the movie and the online world they depend on day to day. The movie is a bit of a hint towards what we're heading to today with our dependence on social media and online conveniences. Most of us are guilty of it. I'm 26, of course I am. Again, trying not to give anything away here, but suffice it to say that we probably don't want to be quite as plugged in as the folks in \\"Summer Wars\\".     Of course, this isn't some broad-reaching culture modifying epic which will forever change movies as we know it. It is, however, an amazingly completely experience. People can argue that it's not terribly meaningful, lacks some depth, is unrealistic, or even somewhat immature. In some ways, all of that is correct. To me the strengths of this movie perfectly compliment the few weaknesses. It's a parallel of real life with a dash of science fiction and just a bit over-the-top. It's approachable, enjoyable, funny, heart-warming, heart-wrenching, and endlessly watchable. To be fair, that's all I really want from an entertainment movie. To be entertained. \\"Summer Wars\\" does this for me, my friends, and my family. I've seen the movie at least 5 times now, and I don't think it will wear out it'swelcome anytime soon.
B003QNXPUK|2.0|I wrote my original review in March of 2011 and gave it 4 stars. I have since changed it to 2.<br /><br />This screen protector does not stay on the phone well at all. I installed mine without any bubbles and it looked ok for a few months (OK if you don't mind the \\"orange peel\\" effect). One of the things I hated the most about this was that the screen protector that ran along the side rails would get dust caught under the edges. The edges would peel up ever so slightly and then you were pretty much doomed to always having a corner sticking up.<br /><br />After 5 months or so, I removed the entire screen protector. There are videos available online to show just how tough the iphone 4 screen actually is. Unless you're dropping it, I wouldn't be overly concerned about scratching the glass.<br /><br />Skip this product and get something else.

B004SBS8LA|2.0|I've heard of angry birds and the idea of trying a new version for free was appealing.  But what I found is that the game simply isn't fun.  The entire game is catapulting birds to break objects.  Considering the plethora of identical games online, there is nothing interesting about this title.    It's also terribly slow which really affects the enjoyment, it takes so long for everything to happen that I'm usually bored just waiting to able to launch another bird.      At least it's free right now.  Granted, I've already deleted it from my phone.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this mostly for the research for our podcasts. It's very convenient to create and have access to these files from my droid or any pc I am at. I'm not a power user and have not run into anything annoying or limiting.
B0000AC8LR|2.0|I tried to get into this movie but the expectation was so high, because of a ridiculously false hype, that when I saw it, it was inevitably a big let down.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with this movie. It's not a bad mvoie. The performances are quite moving. It comes at you from interesting angles and the characters are subteley bizzare.<br /><br />The problem with the flick is that once you get past the daring artistry, the movie is pretty boring. There's not a lot going on. I know I may sound old, but the whole \\"what do you mean you didn't know you were dead? on your way to dying bit \\" has been done in TV shows, movies etc.<br /><br />I think the director's narrative and theme were much more interesting than the actual story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that I can read any book right on my phone.  I don't have a regular kindle, but I am having no problems reading on my phone.  Most of the time when I want to read, I am not outdoors, but waiting in line somewhere or on break at work.  This helps with the inevitable glare on cell phone screens.  Also, love the ability to change screen brightness and color.  It helps with eye strain.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game and I can't wait to get the updates. Nice aiming at monkeys instead of pigs... lol.  Let's have some new birds to throw.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I love the Decemberists, and this newest album is absolutely amazing. It's a world different from the Hazards of Love, but it's wonderful all the way through!
B004SKHJF2|1.0|When I first saw this, I was excited that I will be able to get Shazam for free. Well, upon downloading and installing I was able to tag one song, and since that one song the app refuses to tag subsequent songs. Every time I touch the button it brings up the alert \\"Sorry, we coulnt tag your music. Try again?\\" Uh ok?    Ok, so I uninstalled and installed again. Same deal.    Straight trash.    I will try Soundhound now since that app is free and unlimited.    Shazam lost. Blown out. Destroyed. Epic lost.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome it is lots of fun! Def need some new birds with better powers though. Been aying like crazy and lovin it. Fo angry birds rio!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|After the recent appstore app update, I restarted my phone and found that the only app I have downloaded from amazon, Rio, has disappeared from my phone. Does not even show in my phones settings manager. I am even more skeptical about using amazon appstore now...time to uninstall
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Another great addition to the angry bird family. Angry Bird Rio differs slightly from the originals. Challenging and entertaining for adults and children. Can't wait to see what's next. DOWNLOAD
0061537969|5.0|A wonderful book for just about anyone. At the ridiculously low price Amazon is selling it for, I suggest you buy two - because you're going to want to share one and keep one.    I'm not a fan of \\"doggie lit\\", and while I have actually raced at Thunderhill (the track mentioned in the book) I am not a racing fan, yet I loved this book. (The racing part of the story is maybe 5% so don't let that put you off). Granted, the story was a lot more depressing than I was expecting, but fascinating and uplifting at the same time. Never before has a book made me feel so many strong emotions - including anger - anger at the obstacles the main character has to endure to the extent that you find yourself wishing the antagonist were a real person so you could stop by their house and punch 'em in the nose.    This book is by no means about racing, although racing is used effectively as a metaphor. Many times in the novel, the author uses racing metaphors for individual, and often minor, incidents in the story, but the real art here is that the entire story is actually part of the metaphor - the main character must manoeuvre his way through the most difficult track of his life - not a physical race track - but rather the circumstances of his life and the seemingly endless objects throw in his way. He must navigate through this period in his life with heart and skill of race car driver if he is to survive.     Despite the negative connotation, I think the novel should have been called \\"The Art of Racing in the Dirt\\". Why? Because in Rallye racing your success depends on having a great co-pilot to help you navigate the twists and turns, and Enzo, the canine narrator of the book, makes an excellent co-pilot to this struggling family.    My 85 year old mother gave me this book, exclaiming that after a lifetime of reading and studying great literature, this book may be her favorite. I'm not sure I would go that far, but it is a wonderful book that will stay in your soul for a long time to come. However, don't get the idea that this a difficult read - it's quite the opposite. It's as deep as you want it to be and is a very fast, easy read at any level. I recommend it for anyone from 12 to 100.    The only person who did not like this book was my dog, Mollie, who thought that Enzo was a self-aggrandizing hothead, but after debating the topic with her for hours, she finally recanted, admitting she was just envious of Enzo's talent.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Great time killer.  However, it does get very repetitive, and I got it for free at launch.  Sucks amazon is charging for the older ones.

B0034G4ORC|3.0|Great war movie.  You watch it for the combat and the combat only.  That's just about it.  It has good action, explosions but beyond that this is just one of those popcorn flicks.
030746363X|5.0|This is an extraordinary book, full of information which you won't see in a single book.  Tim Ferris writes in a no-nonsense, easy-to-read and comprehend manner and includes lots of easy, practical tips.  It was recommended to me by several friends who have regained health and lost many kilograms of excess weight easily by following his indications.  Most had tried all sorts of diets and exercise previously without success.  Having read several chapters of the book I can see why they raved about it.  I shall be adopting the recommendations and am very grateful to the author.
0470913029|5.0|Can't endorse this enough.  I've been studying food, diet, nutrition etc. for over a year and this is one of the best/easiest to understand explanations of what is hurting most people's health.  In one month, I lost 3 inches of body fat around my waist and midsection, I sleep better, and I have more energy, and I wasn't in bad shape before.  Read it, give it an hones try, change your life.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|To watch an animal suffer emotionally and longing for the love of it's life over such a long period of time just devastated me.  Weeks later, I find myself thinking of ways that his life may not have been so bad. Maybe people gave him enough food and a place to sleep. Maybe he found a place where the people understood that he had to be at the train in the evenings. Maybe, Maybe, Maybe.... I still cry when I think of this film.  I wish I could learn more about his real everyday life.  This is a brilliant film and it anyone knows more about Hachi,s life, please let me know. It made me remember and realize my own longing for long dead loved ones. I hope that I see them in heaven too.                Wikepidia indicates that Hachi spent some time at the home of his owner,s gardener so there was a place he could go and maybe others too. Yet he never lost his love for his owner and never wanted another forever home as long as he was free to go to the station and wait.   Some films bring up your own heart ache in a powerful way and this is one of them.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I suppose there IS a sort of Austen reader (or at least Austen movie fan) who's in love with the costumes, and attracted by the personalities of the characters - but who really thinks that the Regency era would be much improved by a shrill, vulgar modern harpy, bossing everyone around, and that Austen novels ought to have included bitter hostility towards the Church, and a bit of lesbianism for good measure.  This movie is for that person.<br /><br />It is possible to do lighthearted, very funny parody while retaining affection and respect for the source material; indeed, with the wonderful job the BBC has done with various adaptation of Austen works, that's the tone I expected. Ironically, the protagonist of this work is a young modern lady who uses Austen for escapism - but, when \\"lost in\\" the world of Austen's characters, does her best to re-make her surroundings in the image of her own pointless and vulgar twenty-first century life.<br /><br />Individual scenes are somewhat amusing, but not often enough to redeem the short-sighted, mean-spirited arrogance of the work as a whole.  Buy this as a gift for your own favorite vulgar harpy - then ask yourself why you HAVE a favorite vulgar harpy at all.
B004RLPWXS|5.0|I was one of the poor unfortunate fools that purchased the incomplete version of this album from Itunes in December 2010. Duran Duran has been one of my favorite bands forever and I jumped at the opportunity to support them and buy All You Need is Now immediately. Rather than reward loyalty by allowing us to complete our albums for a reasonable price iTunes disabled the function, which would result in my having to pay $1.29 for each missing song. The album is fantastic and well worth the effort of completing through amazon at $.99/song instead. Thank you Amazon, for offering the individual songs at this great price!
B00005176F|4.0|I have a friend also in his late 50s who was going on about how great Blur are, and how much like the Beatles. Well, after picking this up and listening through it once, I don't detect much inspiration or continuity from the Beatles. It's ok, but I'm indifferent as to whether I hear it again.
0470638842|1.0|I can not believe how a useless book like this could get published.  If you have searched Google in the last five years, you are up to date on this content.  The only obvious thing left out of this book is that the sky is blue.  I should have sent it back, but I figured it would cost me more to argue with Amazon about it.  The author points out that social media exists and is happening.  That is it. If you are looking for social media babble, this could get you through a kindergarten level test on it.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Fantastic visual effects, great action sequences, hot characters, guns, monsters, bad guys, fantastic soundtrack and a way outside the box approach. What's not to like? My wife and I saw it last night and enjoyed it very, very much. It's too bad it won't do as well as it should because a lot of people just won't get it.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I was so delighted when I saw this title was available for my new Coby MID7015 tablet! It's so much fun I'd rather play this then watch TV! Lots of levels and the computer plays very well. I get my butt kicked on the \\"normal\\" level! Great sound effects, the music is okay too. Be careful where you tap to get the screens to change though. You might bounce yourself out of the game. I love love love this version of the popular card game!

IM just going to leave it at that. I know How Id` feel If I read something about a show That I havent` seen yet! Like Heroes lol!  I LOVE the dollhouse wish it could of stayed` on there was alot of storylines they could of made up along the way! They did for angel and Buffy!

Why cant dollhouse be rescued?

006016848X|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read to help me understand myself, my husband and my relationship.  It is really like he has written some parts on your own experiences, this helps you understand that you are not alone and how you think, feel and behave is quite normal.  I think it could save your marriage, but face to face counselling is also essential to put everything into perspective. Read it before you start having relationship problems, that's my advise, I wish I did.
0763611883|5.0|I fell in love with Lauren Child's Clarice Bean books and was delighted when she came out with books for younger children.  I don't know if this book is the first of her Charlie and Lola Series, but it was the first I read.  I was thrilled, years later, to see Charlie and Lola as a TV series for children (produced in Great Britain).  When one of my grandaughters indicated that she didn't like tomatoes, I immediately remembered this book and decided to get it for her.  My hope is not that it will make her love tomatoes, but that she will see some humor in her situation.

Good movie.
0375850864|5.0|For years I taught Children's Literature in a college.  I like to keep up with what is available and new for children and I have read all the Newbery winners.  This book presents an element of science fiction that encourages young people to really think about the possibility of time travel.  I don't buy a book unless I have read it and love it.  I bought this book and will share it with my grandchildren.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you have an AT&T phone you will have to search for SuperOneClick - that will allow you to add \\"non-google Android Market\\" apps until AT&T gets off their butt to allow us to use Amazon's Market.  Shame on AT&T for locking usout of our own phones in the first place.<br /><br />RIO is a very nice take on the original Angry Birds.  If you liked Angry Birds this one is just more levels and added fun!  Especially for the price  - a real no-brainer!<br /><br />mkztg
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Gorgeous and best interface yet. There are no pigs in this one. Thought I'd miss them. I love the pigs. I don't, because this game is just that cool.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Downloads but doesn't install. Same with the paid apps. I have a droid 2. Can't ever delete this useless Amazon app store. Even &quot;deactivating&quot; is time consuming. This entire thing is a waste of time. I use Amazon a lot and I feel a little scammed. Too bad. Will stick with the Android market from now on.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Give it a try for free then get the paid version here to remove your ads. It says it overwrites and you'll lose your settings. You don't. I kept all my progress.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Great app! Came in handy when I needed to analyze and client's site for gaps in coverage.   A very useful tool if you deal with wireless networks.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Same ad version as Google Android market. Try it free if you haven't. Then pay 99 cents (that's cheap) and get the ad free version here on Amazon. Way better to have ads out of the way at last.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is one of those films that had me hooked from beginning to end. This isn't your typical Hollywood-style action-adventure. It's a very elaborate and very realistic \\"historical\\" film with tremendous details on costumes, art direction, and cinematography. The action scenes are spectacular, no slow-motion fights or unnecessary over-the-top music whatsoever. Performances from the entire cast are superb (jobs well done for Crowe, Bettany, Woodall, Boyd, etc.). The dialogue is solid gold, while the pacing of the film is just right. The baroque music is enjoyable, and the sound effects are first-rate. This is good stuff right here. I can easily recommend it to those who love swashbuckling adventures, historical epics, and human drama.<br /><br />Grade: 9.2/10
B00068CVJ4|5.0|Best described as cerebral hard rock with over the top energy. If you enjoy King Crimson or Rage Against The Machine, than you should find something to appreciate with At The Drive-In who consists of two members of Mars Volta and three members of Sparta. My favorite cuts are the hyperactive \\"One Armed Scissor\\", \\"Invalid Litter Department\\" with the haunting lyric \\"Dancing On The Corpses Ashes\\", the punk song \\"Rolodex\\" with Iggy Pop on guest vocals, and the very apocalyptic \\"Quarantined\\" with it powerful wall of guitars. These guys were exceptional, passionate musicians.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I have loved playing this for so long that I'm more than happy to pay and hope dev gets a good portion. Great w/o ads!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Runs very well on my Droid by Motorola, especially for the size of the application! Was characteristic of other Angry Birds games on terms of the degree of enjoyment gained from playing it.
B000XR4OC0|3.0|I just got my black canvas shoes in the mail today.  I'm an 8 1/2 in Sperry top sliders and same with nine west shoes. So since the site told me to do a \\"1/2 size smaller from what I wear b/c they stretch\\" I ordered them in 8 1/2, thinking they wouldn't be too small( if anything, a little big). TOO SMALL!! Can't even get my foot in them! But the shoes in general are cute and very light weight.

I don't even want to think about how slow it would be with multiplayer. Disappointed. 3rd stars for being somewhat fun, but the slowdown issues need to be fixed for me to rate this one anyway higher.
B0042KZJR8|5.0|Michael Buble is awesome and in my humble opinion, this is one of his best albums.  I especially like \\"I Just Haven't Met You Yet\\".  He's a winner!
B004KD5TQI|5.0|The best thing you can say about any movie soundtrack is that the songs all mesh together -- even if they are from different artists.<br /><br />And from the look of the movie \\"Sucker Punch,\\" it needs a butt-kicking soundtrack -- something girly yet tough and wild. So that is pretty much what you get in the soundtrack: one part rousing rock'n'roll, one part ethereal floating pop, and one part psychedelic wildness. It sounds like it shouldn't fit together at all, but it does.<br /><br />It opens on a grand note with Emily Browning's cover of \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),\\" which begins as a soft pop anthem but quickly becomes tangled in dark twisting guitars and epic washes of electric violin.  After that we get a strong serving of rock and pop music, with the lines between them blurred with fiery guitars and soaring epic melodies.<br /><br />There's the sizzling, yowling \\"Search and Destroy\\" by Skunk Anansie; the slow-swirling psychedelica of Yoav's \\"Where Is My Mind?\\"; the sensual jazzy \\"Love is the Drug\\" by Carla Gugino and Oscar Izaac; the wildly energetic, epic remix of Bjork's \\"Army of Me\\"; Alison Mosshart and Carl Azar's hauntingly expansive rock anthem \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\"; and Emily Browning's bittersweet, violin-soaked lullaby \\"Asleep.\\"<br /><br />The ultimate highlight: Emiliana Torrini's trippy, blazing cover of  \\"White Rabbit,\\" which basically sums up the whole concept of the movie. The only downside is \\"I Want It All/We Will Rock You,\\" which is basically hip-hop artist Armageddon (formerly of the Terror Squad) rapping over Queen samples. It just... doesn't fit with the rest of the music.<br /><br />The \\"Sucker Punch\\" soundtrack is one of those soundtracks that you can enjoy independently of the movie. And even though most of the songs are from different artists (ranging from actress Emily Browning to Icelandic pop stars), they all have a unifying sound -- very gritty around the edges, with lots of fiery rock'n'roll, but also with softer ethereal edges.<br /><br />So expect lots of fiery electric guitars, psychedelic riffs, violins and blazing bass, usually woven into melodies that sound.... well, epic and action-packed. Some of the songs are pretty much instrumental, but the vocals are amazing as well -- Skunk Anansi's raw yowl, Torrini's chilly accented voice, and Browning's sleepy girlish  soprano (\\"Some of them want to abuse you/some of them want to be abused...\\") all mesh easily.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you love or hate the movie, the \\"Sucker Punch\\" soundtrack is a delight -- an intense, uncoiling barrage.c guitars, psychedelic riffs, violins and blazing bass, usually woven into melodies that sound.... well, epic and action-packed.

B004L49K20|5.0|Here is what you need to know about this album. Duran Duran has returned to their fantastic melodies that were so prominent in their first 4 albums, plain and simple. For so long Duran Duran has tried to be hip but forgot to be, well, Duran Duran. On this album they are finally back to being Duran Duran. Basically they needed someone to tell them and Mark Ronson was the right person. He produced the album and did a superb job by returning to the magic of the first 4 albums. My favourite is \\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard\\". What a brilliant song.
0399250573|5.0|I began reading this series when I was just fifteen. I'm now 22 and I never lost interest in it, not for a single moment. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Crocodile Tears had not actually been the final installment.     Scorpia Rising is an amazing book chock full of action and suspense. Lots of interesting plot twists and foreshadowing that was just enough not to make it too predictable. I was sort of expecting this one to be a bit more unique than it was (I was hoping to see every single executive member of Scorpia dead by Alex's hand or some other ironic twist of fate), but it was still very enjoyable and I found it quite difficult to pull myself away from it.     I'm really hoping that some day soon someone will make a TV series out of these, because it's hard to capture every epic moment in a movie due to limited length. And I was also very disappointed in the movie adaption of the first book, Stormbreaker.     Another thing that I would like to mention is that this should not ever be classified as a children's book at all. There are some rather graphic descriptions of violence, gore, and pain in it that were disturbing even to me as an adult. I would even caution younger teens, but it depends on the person.

B004EQAVHI|2.0|Since I've heard a little about this film I thought I'd check it out.<br /><br />This has got to be one of the most depressing films in recent memory.  It's about a special boarding school somewhere in England that is part of the National Donor Program, a program that has a chain of \\"schools\\" that are actually raising clones for future organ donation.<br /><br />Although the film claims in this alternate world we can live to be 100, I'm assuming that is because of the miracles of medicine regarding organ donation .  But why not just raise clones as sheep and harvest their organs for those who are dying or desperate.<br /><br />The clone eventually \\"completes\\" after a few major organs are removed, either dying outright with a team of nameless and emotionless doctors gathering around, or as a vegetable at some home.<br /><br />The story itself revolves around Tommy, Kathy and Ruth, three kids who bond early in their childhood.  Early in the film, a sympathetic teacher reveals their real purpose as short-lived solutions to adults who live on.  She is soon \\"let go\\" as it were.<br /><br />The performances are solid as well as the acting.  The cinematography is well done in creating a dark, sullen and depressing mood.<br /><br />At the same time, the film beats you severely about the head regarding the morality of clones and that they too can love, can fear, and can feel rage.<br /><br />The film confronts issues of ethics regarding organ donation, the creation of a supply for that purpose and whether this could possibly happen in a later, dystopian future.  Who is to say?<br /><br />There have been other organ harvesting films such as Coma (1978) and the more recent Repo Man (2010) but none so depressing and squeezing out your spirit as Never Let Me Go.  If anything, Never Let Me Go is a fascinating art film but that's about it.<br /><br />Keira Knightly is great as the jealous, vindictive Ruth, along with Carey Mulligan as Kathy (the leading lady) who is the most depressing of all and the target of their affections, Tommy, played with rage and fire by Andrew Garfield.<br /><br />Other Organ Harvest Films!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0045HCJ8A Coma]]<br />[[ASIN:B002ZG98TG Repo Men (Unrated) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B001FACH7S The X-Files: I Want to Believe (Single-Disc Edition)]]yed with rage and fire by Andrew Garfield.

0670022411|2.0|After reviewing the reviews, I almost passed on contributing as much of what I experienced from this read has already been said.  Although I found the premise of the four species, the science of alchemy and the inter-related search for specie origins interesting and promising, I had a difficult time getting through the book as the pace was slow and tedious.  I enjoyed the references to historical characters and events, but also found Matthew's involvement with these a bit contrived.  I think the character of Diana was a bit too petulant, emotionally frustrating and somewhat sophomoric for a super-star witch.  I was not at all attracted to Matthew (as I was, for instance to Anne Rice's Lestat!) and I found their relationship to be somewhat embarrassing...I'm not sure why...as someone else observed, perhaps too \\"romantic novelish\\"?     I just didn't find the depth of complexity in the book's characters that I was hoping to find.  In addition, and has been said by most of the 1 and 2 rating reviewers, much of the \\"drama\\" involved bathing, sleeping, eating, drinking (especially wine, not so much blood), rowing, manuscript researching, etc., etc., etc.  By the end of the first third, I was begging for more action, or at least an ongoing crises or two.  Unfortunately, anything resembling a crises came and went very quickly and then reverted once again to bathing, sleeping, eating, etc.  I have to ask where was the editor in all this?    I was disappointed as I had great expectations for this novel, particularly based on the author's background and the published reviews.  (Perhaps I've been spoiled by the first two Lestat books and THE MAYFAIR WITCHES?)
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Somehow the mechanics feel improved, and the game feels faster than the original (although this may be in part because I have only played the ad-supported version, which may suffer from some lag).    In the end, though, its still just more \\"Angry Birds\\". So if you're good with that, then this game's great!

0399229191|4.0|A very Busy Spider board book was a cute little book for kids to enjoy. I loved the illustrations but I felt that the actual story was way too repetitive. It's like... after the first 2 sentences of saying the spider was very busy...I didn't want to continue to say the exact same thing again, on each page, but that's just the way the book was written. My three year old son enjoys it though so I guess it works out :P
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Sucker Punch can be described as a big screen video game with hot chicks. It's almost as if Zack Snyder went down the check list of everything you could throw into an action film. You have your giant samurai warriors, WWI era German soldiers who are full of steam rather than blood, medievil knights, orcs, dragons, a robot army and five good looking girls with big guns. This is not going to win any awards, but I had a blast. If you liked Snyder's other movies (300, Watchmen) you can pretty much expect the same CGI bonanza, but at least it's used in moderation. All of the fantasy sequences come from the main character's imagination, who just happens to be stuck in a mental hospital and looking for a way out.<br /><br />I know some have found the plot confusing. In fact, I overheard some guys leaving the theater saying that they liked the music and visuals, but didn't undertand it. I did not find it that hard to follow, but it could have used a little more work when it came to layering the story. I'm pretty sure a Director's Cut Blu-ray will be released with an R rating and hopefully some more scenes to help clear a couple of things up.<br /><br />There is a lot of music in this film and not just a background score. The lead actress, the ever so cute Emily Browning, actually sings an entire cover of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" over the opening scenes and the classic rock tune \\"White Rabbit\\" gets covered at length as well as some other nice songs.<br /><br />The acting and dialogue are adequate, with nobody really standing out other than the main girl. Or maybe I was just transfixed by Emily Browning's appealing face and lips?<br /><br />I can't say that I've seen a bad Zack Snyder flick, so maybe the future of Superman is in good hands after all.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|the first thing you need in any theatrical portrayals is believability and this comes first from the actors. If the actors do not appear believable and dynamically so, it doesn't matter how great are the CGI or special effects, who cares. Not only are Dean and Sam believable they are highly dynamically portrayed by Jared and Jensen. But the most important thing about their relationship is to see how devoted they and their father are to each other. All of the wondrous aspects of family love are seen in them. Love and reverence for their mother (and wife) a desire to make any an every sacrifice for their brother, father, mother or loved one.     Another great character trait they show is their great principle in caring for the lives of innocent people who are the pawns of the forces of evil in life. they don't care who it is, heaven or hell, they're not allowing anyone to do wholesale or limited killing of innocents and they are dedicated to the destruction of evil, no matter what its forms.     I'm very sorrowful that Dean has such a hard time believing in God but I am delighted to see how much support these guys get from the Top. God believes in them even if they (Dean) doesn't believe in God. So despite the gross blasphemy (and scripturally unsupportable plots and portrayals) that is often displayed on this show there is so much more good that I find in it (like God) that I can't help but love it.
B004ISVH5W|4.0|As a big Ashcroft fan I couldn't wait to hear something new from him.I enjoyed \\"The Journey\\" and the single \\"Are You Ready\\",but was not prepared for a full,head on,Hip-Hop,bouncy,loopy,string of songs from Richard Ashcroft.<br />I was more \\"ready\\" for some \\"You On My Mind In My Sleep\\",\\"Music is Power\\" type of an evening.I popped in the player,turned up the volume,and got ready.<br />I was already familiar with the lead off single\\"Are You Ready,\\"Born Again\\" was alright at first,\\"America\\" kicked up the momentum a bit,I was still waiting for that familiar Ashcroft signature tune.\\"She Brings Me the Music\\" is as close as it gets to the old Richard sound....and it is a beautiful song to his wife.<br />The moment I waited for never really came,reason is...Richard completely and intentionally changes style on this record,top to bottom.The melodies are still there,the golden voice is also there,it's just wrapped in a funky and groovy beat.I admire the man for taking the risk and putting out some of his strongest material in such an unexpected genre.<br />At about the third listen is when it sunk in....this record isn't supposed to sound like anything from his past.The tracks are very well produced and they sound so much better live than on disc.<br />Critics have not been kind to this record for the simple reason,they want Richard to sound like The Verve again.If this album would have been put out by an unknown artist they would be praising the effort rather than tearing it apart.<br />Give it a shot,\\"Good Lovin'\\",\\"America\\",\\"Are You Ready\\",\\"She Brings Me the Music\\",\\"Let My soul Rest\\" and \\"Born Again\\" are a good start!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|*** It should be noted that I wrote this review before Amazon converted this app to the \\"cloud player\\" so even though this app has the same name as the current one, there may be significant changes in how it works now. ***<br /><br />You can search, listen to samples, and buy songs with this app. However, there are no user controllable settings and it gives VERY little information about the song or the album while shopping. You also must sync this to your amazon shopping account and enable one-click purchases to make it work.<br /><br />This is a very basic app, which is a good thing to some degree... that's what keeps it simple. I'm glad it's not trying to be everything under one roof. I don't want it to be a music player and do all sorts of other annoying stuff like iTunes does. However, it is so limited that it's hard to feel like it's easy to use because the limitations require other work-arounds.<br /><br />~~~Shopping Experience:~~~<br /><br />When shopping for songs or albums, there's no description, reviews, or anything else other than the artist, title, and a date (which is not explained--is that the release date or what?).<br /><br />Being able to listen to song samples so easily is a very nice feature. It's quite easy to search for a song, quickly find it, and listen to a sample before buying. It's great if you're not sure what song you're looking for.<br /><br />There are some strange things about it though. For example, several songs and albums I searched for have two versions of the same song for two different prices. Songs from the same name, artist, and album sometimes show up as two separate listings for $.99 and $.89 with no explanation of the difference. Are they different bit rates or something? Different formats? With no explanation available and no extra detail about the song... who knows what you're getting.<br /><br />There seems to be no way to put songs in a cart and buy them all in a single purchase. You must activate one-click on your amazon account to use this app. I just started using it so I haven't seen the credit card bill yet, but the way this works makes it seem as though there's going to be a separate $.99 charge on the card for every individual song you buy. This seems a little tedious. I would love to buy several songs at once in a single transaction.<br /><br />It would also be nice to buy up a credit balance for the phone like a gift card so I could just purchase songs as I discover them and have the cost deducted from my  balance without paying for each separately. I don't want to have to share that with my other amazon web shopping however, so I'm not sure if a traditional Amazon gift card would work. It's all pretty poorly explained. If I were going to use this app a lot I would be tempted to create a new amazon account specifically for this app so I wouldn't have to commingle settings with my web shopping.<br /><br />Also, there seems to be no way to retrieve previously-purchased songs later on if they get lost or deleted. It would be really nice if it would put the song in a queue to download next time you sign in from your computer so you can easily use it there too. Currently I copy them from my phone to the computer... so why not just buy them on the computer and copy them to the phone? That's not any harder or easier so it contributes to my point that while the app is easy in itself, it requires a bunch of extra work to get the full value out of your music purchase thereby negating the so-called convenience of the apps simplicity.<br /><br />~~~App Experience:~~~<br /><br />Because there are no user controls, you can't specify what folder the songs get put into or where it is located. Neither of the music players on my phone are able to find the amazon mp3 folder on their own (even after refreshing the media list) and therefore are unable to show and play the new music. So I had to install a file manager app, and each time I buy a song I have to copy the it to my normal music folder.<br /><br />Finally, the documentation for this app sucks. Actually working the app itself is pretty easy and self-explanatory (mostly because it has no features other than searching for songs and pressing the buy button), but it requires a whole bunch of coordination with your amazon account and its settings and the implications of all the little things you do are not at all evident. Everything is very poorly explained, if at all. You have to fumble through all the steps until you figure things out on your own. Then for the few topics they offer help with, it's takes you to a web page for an explanation... but comically, it's not a mobile-friendly web page so you have to zoom in and scroll left and right to read the lines. Seriously? These are web pages written specifically relating to a mobile phone app, ostensibly to be read primarily on a mobile phone, yet they're not in a mobile friendly format. Big fail.<br /><br />~~Summary:~~~<br /><br />As powerful a site as amazon.com is, I'm a little surprised at how incredibly basic this app is. The way it works now, I find it much easier to just buy the songs from the amazon web site with a computer, and transfer them to the phone manually. The only time I envision using this app is when I'm away from my computer and desperately want a song right away.lder.<br /><br />Finally, the documentation for this app sucks.

B004BLTNJI|5.0|Coraline is an exquisitely realized exemplar of pre-cgi stop-motion animation.  Fans of Tim Burton's A Nightmare Before Christmas will delight in this similarly thematically conceived and technically created  excursion into the darker recesses of childhood angst and fantasy.  The 3d is totally extraordinary in its field of vision, occasional pop-out effects, and its virtually ghost-free perfection.
0061478784|5.0|Diana Wynne Jones is now forever engraved in my mind as the epitome of a fantasy writer.<br />Is it Howl's cavalier personality, or Sophie's practicality that keeps me reading? Perhaps it's Howl's resident fire demon, Calcifer, or the fact that Howl's castle door is actually a portal that opens onto four different places? It's everything and more. The tongue-in-cheek pokes at fairy tale clich&eacute;s are funny. Sophie doesn't expect anything exciting to happen to her as she's the eldest (and as we all know in fairy tales exciting things only happen to the youngest.)<br />And being the eldest is certainly turned on its heels when Sophie ends up offending the Witch of the Waste who literally turns her into an old lady.<br />The odd and magical thing is that after this transformation is when Sophie finally starts learning about herself and becoming an awesome heroine. Before she was shy and led a tedious life in a hat shop, but once she aged she really didn't care what people thought of her. Howl is deliciously her opposite, where she is practical he is nonsensical, shallow and vain. Of course in the most likable way. Each character balances the other. This book takes you through such a fun adventurous journey. One everyone should take at least once.

B004S5D3B6|3.0|I love Mark Wahlberg. I love Christian Bale. I love boxing and boxing movies.   But...    The movie was way too slow and predictable.  It really should have been more about Micky Ward than Dicky Eklund.    The Micky Ward vs. Arturo Gatti fights were the most incredible showing of determination, heart, valor, and true guts I have ever witnessed.    If these fights were even partially shown in the movie, the non-boxing fans would have been shown the true character of Micky Ward.    This movie, for some reason, wanted so much for us to feel sorry for and like Dicky Eklund, but this is where they went wrong.

B004SDSSFY|5.0|Part of my job is writing a lot of requirements documents.  There's no doubt that writing a document on a phone takes a lot of time and patience. The documents I write on my PC, I then transfer to my phone, then have the ability to review the document with minor changes before sending out to others to review.  My favorite place to do this is at a table near a fountain close to where I work.  When the fan on my laptop stopped working, this app allowed me to do some critical updates that the boss called and said she needed ASAP.  I have an iPod Touch and have the paid app on there as well and really liked it.  On my Droid with the slide-out keyboard, it's even better.

Brilliant acting by Sir Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud and John Hurt, this one is guaranteed to touch your heart and mind.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Ridley Scott got it right with Blade Runner.      Although the film was not a hit at its original release, it has, nevertheless, stood the test of time, and continues to grow in popularity. Scott has gone back to Alien, as well as Blade Runner, and refined these very popular films.    Scott also left the original films out there for the public to 'choose' which version that they wanted to see.  A classy move that Lucas should have replicated.

0060936223|5.0|Although I knew very little about Patti Smith or the punk rock scene in New York City of the 1970s, I decided to buy this book on the strength of its reviews.  Just Kids is not a story about Patti Smith the Legend, but about Patti Smith, a girl from New Jersey who came to New York to find herself.  And what a fascinating story it is. With poetic prose, humour and nakedness, Smith recalls her early years in New York City and how, with the mutual love and respect of Robert Mapplethorpe, the foundations of their futures were laid down.    Part of the beauty of her writing is that although we know she will become Patti Smith the Legend, she never conveys a certainty that she will \\"make it\\".  Rather, she focuses on her and Mapplethorpe's hunger to create and to define themselves and their crafts.    Equally fascinating as Smith's personal story, is the story of New York City in the 1970s. How I would have loved to have been there during that time! She vividly describes the vibrant energy of the blossoming cultural movement and the people who made it and recalls colourful anecdotes of neighbourhoods that have long become gentrified.    I highly recommend this book and I hope it will touch you as it touched me.
1400052181|4.0|I bought The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks completely on the strength of its reviews on Amazon, without knowing what it was about at all.  I figured the book was a biography of Henrietta Lacks' life, but did not expect that its scope would extend to cell biology, bioethics, the recent history of the medical profession and class and race relations in the United States.  The book manages to touch all of these areas and describe even the complex topics with clarity. But what this book is about most is people - specifically Henrietta and her kin.    Henrietta Lacks was born in Roanoke, Virginia on August 1, 1920.  Skloot narrates Henrietta's life from her childhood, to her marriage to her cousin at the age of 14, the birth of her five children, then eventually her struggle with, and demise from, cervical cancer in October 1951.  Dr. George Gey, a doctor from Johns Hopkins University, took samples of her cervical cells, both normal and cancerous, for his research and, miraculously, the cancerous cells multiplied and survived when every other sample he had ever taken had died within days. These cells became known as the HeLa cell line.  HeLa continued to multiply at an aggressive rate and continue to do so today - they are immortal.  HeLa cells have been used in a vast spectrum of scientific research, including developing vaccines; uncovering the secrets of viruses, bacterium, cancer and the effects of radiation; they have been sent to space and were part of the first cloning experiments.    Henrietta's family did not learn of any of this until decades later when scientists began using each of them for research, all without their informed consent.  For everything Henrietta's cells contributed to society, nobody had taken the time to tell her family any of it, or look beyond HeLa cells to the woman behind them.  Ergo, Skloot's story feels long overdue and one that was meant to be told.    Skloot narrates the family's story with grace and intimacy, engrossing the reader,and perhaps taking away precious sleep time hours because the book is just so hard to put down :).  We trust Skloot's narrative immediately because we can sense from early on in the book that her interest in Henrietta and her family is genuine.    Skloot first heard of Henrietta Lacks in her high school science class, and from then on, she was fascinated and determined to learn more about her. What struck me immediately from Skloot's prologue was that one such preoccupation can be the spark that will pave the course of one's life.  For Skloot, that moment in her science class, led to 10 years of research on the story behind Henrietta Lacks and HeLa, resulting in her first book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks and a journey she could never have imagined.    My only complaint about the book is the gap between 2001 and 2009, when the book was published.  While I trust that the most pertinent events in Skloot's story occurred between 1999 and 2001, the first three years of her research, surely there was something to convey during that eight year period!
B003YBNREI|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet................I love this CD!!! The band sounds great and the material is \\"for sure Doobies!\\" It is done extremely well and it is something that so much music lacks currently......FUN!      August 12, 2011:  After reading several of the reviews here I feel motivated to add that I also think this is the best Doobie Brothers record EVER! The songs are wonderful, played and sung as good as anything out there. It is solid, good, rockin' amazing rock 'n roll! The ballad style songs are beautiful with absolutely gorgeous melodies.    These guys are the real deal. Most of our younger musicians could/should study what they do. They would learn a lot about how to make an amazing record.    I will be seeing a Doobs concert in late August and I can't wait!

B0011Z8RQW|5.0|I'm not really into this kind of music anymore, but in high school Simple Plan was one of my favorite bands (Still Not Getting Any is actually the first cd I ever owned). Overall this album is not as good as their first album \\"No Pads\\" but there are some very good songs on here. SP matures somewhat in their lyrical content and the music is just as fun as ever. If you are into pop punk definitely check these guys out. While I wouldn't give this album 5 stars (I only did it because of the 1 star reviewer) for me this band reminds me of feeling out of place in high school and how music got me through it.
0756655730|5.0|This was recommended to me by a female friend of mine who is a huge dinosaur buff and can spot a bad dinosaur product a mile away. She said this was a great reference and as a struggling geology and zoology student that I would love it. And she was right! It's a general access book for all ages. I'm 20 and I love. My 40-year-old mother loves it, my 14-year-old brother loves it, and my baby cousin would probably love it too. It doesn't have every single detail about ancient earth (and why would a single book do that), but it does cover ever major geologic era, from the Archean to modern day. Unfortunately, fans of the Hadean era will be disappointed because it still isn't scientific cannon and will not appear in this book. But what is great is that this book isn't just a dino book! There are dinosaurs, but also paleo-plants, insects, sea life, and environmental conditions. There are also maps of what scientists speculate the geography would be on the earth as well. It even takes a non-controversial approach to the evolution of modern humans in its last chapter, taking a brief look at the primates we supposedly came from. The illustrations in this book are also a plus. They are full color, big, vibrant, scientifically accurate, and just plain fun to look at!

B000002L9B|5.0|If music could be a cartoon, Prince's Parade would b it.  Parade to me, sounds like a conceptual album, rather than actual music.  Alot of the trax are French inspired, the horns and strings, the whole bit.  There r no duds on here, like 99 percent of Prince's albums.  The only questionable track would b \\"Life Can B So Nice\\".  I used 2 absolutely adhore this song, but when I listened 2 it today, I caught myself singin' along, so I guess I like it!  Lyrically, this album is very romantic and poetic.  It conjures up images of french kissing on the banks of some Parisian river, under a cherry moon of course.  This is a frantic yet strange offering from Prince. The movie is also a wonderful piece of work, which makes the total package worth it.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|True, this film suffers at times from poorly written plot transitions and strained dialog.  That said, the chemistry between Traci Dinwiddie and Necar Zadegan is outstanding and this movie is absolutely worth watching and/or adding to your collection.
B001UV4XUG|3.0|There are a few high points here, but not many.  All in all, I was disappointed with a movie that was very fragmented and that made it very clear very early just what it was leading to at the end.  It's very predictable, and its jumping-around-in-time format seemed more gimmicky than necessary for telling the story.  Add to that the main character's self-absorbed personality which doesn't allow him to see that his \\"girlfriend\\" has issues of his own, and there's not a whole lot here to like.  When the protagonist spends most of his time feeling sorry for himself, it becomes a bit difficult to continue to watch.  Even as I write this, my thoughts about the film are fragmented and unclear--I feel like I've just been shown a test, and my job is to put everything back in an order that will tell an actual story and allow the viewer to feel something other than confusion and expectation.  Maybe that's the problem--my mind was so much on \\"where are they going next\\" that the story and the characters became secondary.    It just isn't a very satisfying movie.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This review may never be read, but I had to get in my 5-stars. I haven't had so much fun in years; Willis never fails to entertain, and to gather all these terrific old pros in one place is overwhelming. There isn't a weak link in the bunch, and a terrific script, and excellent direction from Robert Schwentke puts this near the top of my favorite movies of 2010. Quite simply, one of the most enjoyable, entertaining, suspenseful and impressive film-making endeavors I've seen in a long time. I thought, to this point, that \\"True Lies\\" was the most fun intrigue/action/comedy movie. This tops it, if only for the magnificent cast and unending craziness. The chemistry among all is perfect. Watching Helen Mirren kick butt is best of all. I repeat: NO END OF FUN! Great editing, photography, lots of 'splosions 'n stuff. Very little foul language, and should appeal to most kids, despite the mindless violence (they can see that on TV anyway, a lot worse). The DVD I watched had no extras. Bummer.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|Without Jennifer Lawrence this movie would be a throw away.  The story which takes 90 minutes could easily have been told in fifteen if everyone didn't take thirty seconds to answer each other, not to mention the panning shots of the bleak landscape.  Yes on top of everything else, it's kind of 'artsy fartsy'.    The story of 17 year old Ree Dolly trying to find her father because he has put their house up as collateral for his bond would make a great short story.  But as a full length film it's to empty (just like the scenery).  You would think that the 'true concern' of the extended Dolly family would be to see that Ree, her mother and two siblings (12 year old Sonny, and 6 year old Ashley) could survive the death of their father.  But even though they all know he's dead (they killed him for talking to the Sheriff) they want to ignore her and just act dumb.  Well acting dumb comes easy to these people but family should come first.      Every house in the area is either a broken cabin or single wide trailer, with lots of dead cars and appliances all over the property, and Ree and her siblings have no way to get food unless they shoot it.  But the kids are way to well dressed and look like some one does their hair every morning, and we never find out why none of them go to school or that the truant officer never shows up.  Considering they are supposed to make their money by selling crank and moonshine, there isn't anyone around to sell it to.      Too bad, could have been a much better movie.      Zeb Kantrowitz
1416550534|3.0|An English estate. A mysterious death. A deceptive dance between two sisters. All fodder for a great historical mystery.<br /><br />Grace Bradley is a housemaid at the English country estate of Riverton during her youth and serves two of its residents, sisters Hannah and Emmeline. This part of the novel spans the years of 1914 to 1924 in Essex and London. Alternately, we see Grace as an old woman, asked to advise on a film being made about Riverton.<br /><br />Kate Morton slowly reels you in. This reader struggled through Part I of The House at Riverton  until page ninety. Main character Grace, remembers something her grandson, Marcus, a writer said. \\"When all the central characters have made their way onstage and the scene is set for the drama to unfold. The storyteller relinquishes control and the characters begin to move of their own accord.\\" In addition to being good advice for writers, it drew this reader in.<br /><br />The subsequent scene is in the mysterious library which must be purged of all dust. Our main character, Grace, now fourteen years old, cleans the second tier of the library, unbeknownst to the new players on the scene. Sisters Hannah and Emmeline discuss playing the game \\"Three\\" with their brother David and his visiting friend, Robbie. Obviously \\"Three\\" cannot be played by four. Now I was drawn into the novel as if it were a play being enacted before me. They proceed to decorate the Christmas tree. An accident interrupts them and Grace, the maid, suddenly enters their lives on a whole different level. Her devotion to Riverton and the sisters in the years that follow is absolute, if not unbelievable.<br /><br />Occasionally in this book there is a scene or sentence that pulls the reader in. \\"A sudden, jagged kiss that caught her off balance and silenced, utterly, the niggling voices of misgiving.\\" It appears the fame of \\"Three\\" is to be replayed late in the sisters' lives, except not all three know a game is being played.<br /><br />I found the book erratic. I was enthralled, and then I was bored. Grace in her elderly years was a fascinating character who waited until after her death to reveal the secret of Riverton we'd been waiting for all along.<br /><br />Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of CrestmontI was bored.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|Not quite sure why there are so many negative reviews. I find this game to be a refreshing addition to the beloved angry birds series. I'd certainly say it is at least equal to the original. Can't wait for the next parts in the series!
B004OBC7TS|5.0|Over the course of the last 5 years or so the world of cinema has seen a handful of films whose main attraction, for most, is the hype around the brutality: Pascal Laugier's 2008 film `Martyrs', Tom Six's 2009 film `The Human Centipede' & Srdjan Spasojevic's 2010 film `A Serbian Film'. The thing that differentiates those three particular films from the run of the mill cash grab trash films like the Saw series is their capacity for resonating with the viewer long after initial viewing; there are moments in each three of the listed films that 99% of viewers will never forget for the rest of their lives. Where as a Saw film will shock you for a few seconds, making you turn to your friends in awe asking \\"Did you see that?!\\", `A Serbian Film' will grasp your mind, imprint its images upon your psyche, and make you ever so slightly more curious about just exactly what the people you know do when they're alone. I'd had the film recommended to me in a sort of roundabout way, \\"you haven't seen A Siberian Film yet?\\" I was asked.    I searched for a synopsis that only sort of sparked my interest: retired porn star needs money to help his family, get suckered into making snuff films, alright, whatever. About a month later I randomly remembered the film and searched yet again and after reading that the film contained, without censorship, \\"infant rape, child rape, necrophilia & decapitation during sex: among other things\\" I thought to myself \\"I have to see this.\\" Not so much because I'm a gore junky, this is hardly the case, but every once in a while I get a little scratch in my mind that won't go away until I see what the fuss about a particularly so called \\"brutal\\", \\"extreme\\" or \\"relentless\\" film is all about. A lot, around 98%, of the films turn out to be absolute trash, but every once in a great while one of these ruthlessly brutal films contains more than just what is bleeding on the screen; there's something more, something intellectually stimulating. So, I took the whole 2or 3 minutes it took to find a torrent of the film, because lets face it it might be a while before this reaches DVD in the US. The copy that I ended up with was the \\"Screener Version\\" or something like that; it says that its the unedited version and if there is a more complete version than this then I think that maybe Satan is real and he exists as that longer version because all that was found in the version that I saw was more than enough to permanently scar most people.    Spasojevic has said in reaction to the controversy surrounding his debut film that its meant to be taken as a symbolic tale, an allegory of how the Siberian government treats its people. Now, when a director has a bad film on his hands and they know its terrible, or eventually realizes how horrible it is, they will try to play the whole \\"Yeah, this is how I meant it to be seen.\\" (Tommy Wiseau, I'm lookin' at you, no ones buying it.) card, but after seeing `A Siberian Film' I can understand Spasojevic's statement. Now, I know next to nothing about the circumstances in current Siberia so I won't go around saying that this is symbolic of this or that, but what I will say that in a general sense one can view the film as a symbol for the general willingness of humanity to exploit others without sympathy. The powers that be will more than willingly drug those below them, not literally of course, into a state of confusion so that they eventually become nothing more than puppets capable of the most heinous and disgusting acts imaginable, but only after lying to them about how they're simply looking out for their best interests, that whatever is to come will be okay because they have it under control. Now drink this and do what I say. The fact that the film is titled `A Serbian Film' begs the question \\"Why this title?\\" It could have been given a multitude of other names, but Spasojevic intended for people to see this film and understand that this is his venomously hateful view of his country & government, full of immoral opportunistic scum.    Some have declared that the director is criticizing his country for willing to become more like the West, that the film is nothing more than some sort of fascist fear mongering propaganda film portraying the influence of the west as one of hedonistic and full of decadence and debauchery. This feels like reaching for a grain of sand in a dark room the size of the Atlantic ocean. This simply reads as Serbians, or people of Serbian descent, reacting the way the director wanted them to; shame. Now, perhaps its shame that the director, in their views, is depicting their homeland as a place of nothing but pimps, prostitutes, pornographers and other societal goodies, but again, this just seems like spitting in the wind.    The premise of the film is as simple as they come: A man needs money to help his wife & son. How he gets it is something not so commonly found. A retired porn star he receives a tip from an ex-\\"coworker\\" that there is a new breed of porn emerging from their country to be released to the whole world: Art Porn. Milos, the main character, meets with the man in charge, a man by the name of Vukmir Vukmir (chillingly odd coincidence that a psychotic woman with the same last name has been recently elected to the Wisconsin State Senate.) Milos asks his brother, a man jealous of Milos' family life (obviously indicated by the fact that he got fellatio while watching a home movie he shot of his sister in-law), a cop to check up on his employer and nothing incriminating is found. Things begin to turn dark and darker amd eventually there is no possibility of turning back from the bottomless abyss into which Milos has been flung.    The effects in the film do more than their job in convincing the viewer of their dedication to a realistic depiction of decapitation, forced anal sex and a few other things that I'll leave as a surprise to whomsoever is brave enough to seek this out, or to watch it with me. There isn't really muchto say about the cinematography of the film as with a film like this cinematography is of little to no importance; its the impact of the experience that matters the most. There is no real bad acting to be found in the film, from the lead characters to the tiniest role everyone does a compelling and convincing job with their characters. The soundtrack works to create a mood of impending doom and chaos.    `The Human Centipede' is disturbing in a \\"what if\\" sense; \\"What if some guy, or gal, was psychotic enough to do something like this for no real particular reason other than their own gratitude. `A Serbian Film' is disturbing in a realistic, 100% visceral sense, because you know in the back of your mind after watching this that the movies you saw being filmed are sitting somewhere on a shelf in someone's house.
B004DN3VEM|1.0|I usually don't write reviews but I felt that this needed to be said. The first disc features two versions of the great 1976 Rising album \\"remastered\\" in different ways and neither seems to get it right. The 'new york mix' is supposed to be the original mix featured on the original release but is so totally devoid of any bass it's difficult to listen to...even when compared to the 1999 remaster. What gives? The 'los angeles' mix on the other hand is so bass heavy it buries Blackmore's guitar. The second disc is strickly for die hards... rough mixes. I doubt the biggest Rainbow fans in world would listen to this more than a couple of times.   All things considered I would be happy to stick with the '99 remaster and save the money.
0525423273|5.0|by Linna Lee<br /><br />From the back: Anna was looking forward to her senior year in Atlanta, where she has a great job, a loyal best friend, and a crush on the verge of becoming more. So she's less than thrilled about being shipped off to boarding school in Paris--until she meets &Eacute;tienne St. Clair. Smart, charming, beautiful, &Eacute;tienne has it all . . . including a serious girlfriend.<br /><br />But in the City of Light, wishes have a way of coming true. Will a year of romantic near-misses end with their long-awaited French kiss? Stephanie Perkins keeps the romantic tension crackling and the attraction high in a debut guaranteed to make toes tingle and hearts melt.<br /><br />Lately, I've been reading a lot of books that either dodge the realities of going to school, or circumvent it by throwing in some kicker: character leads a secret life, has supernatural talents, is involved with someone with supernatural talents, lives in a future where \\"school\\" is irrelevant/unimportant...etc. Writers are SO GOOD at coming up with excuses for why their characters aren't in school. Because, I guess, school is...less interesting compared to living life as a WEREWOLF/WITCH/WHAT HAVE YOU?<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins is all about Anna's life at an international American school. It was a trip abroad for Anna, and it was a trip for me. It reminded me that life doesn't need the drama of impending death and the supernatural to be completely absorbing and thrilling. There's romance and friendship and boy problems, and it's all narrated with Anna's sharp wit. This is so much more than a cute, fluffy romance. Anna's story packed a strong punch that had me laughing throughout, and ok, even crying a little in a few places.<br /><br />Anna's thought process and reactions are hilarious, and her voice carried the entire book (like when she's embarrassed, I was in mortified agony, too). I loved seeing Paris through Anna's eyes and reading about the new friendships she makes. I want to be Anna's friend! She's human and flawed: When she's whiny or oblivious or on the edge of making bad choices, she was still funny and likable. I was cheering for her throughout the entire book. Moments that could have been cheesy were moving scenes that tugged at my heartstrings.<br /><br />Of course, I have to (HAVE TO!!!) talk about the boy she falls for. Oh, St. Clair. Etienne St. Clair is swoon-worthy. Anna's first reaction to him: French name, English accent, American school. Anna confused. Her relationship with this \\"English French American Boy Masterpiece\\" is the kind of love story WE ALL WANT FOR OURSELVES. Midway through the book, they part ways for Christmas break, so they keep in touch through emails and phone calls. The separation of characters can sometimes be a lull in a story - not so here, because some of my favorite Anna and St. Clair moments took place in their long-distance correspondence.<br /><br />This is not only one of my favorite contemporary YA books, but one of my favorite YA books ever. And I cannot wait to read the companion novels to follow (or really, anything by Stephanie Perkins): Lola and the Boy Next Door (September 29, 2011) and Isla and the Happily Ever After (Fall 2012).he's human and flawed: When she's whiny or oblivious or on the edge of making bad choices, she was still funny and likable.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|This would seem to be a series crying out for a Blu-ray release. But the image is so crisp and clear and pristine that I wouldn't be too concerned if this never comes out on Blu. In terms of picture quality this series is competitive with many Blu-rays I own and is superior to some.     The series itself is, of course, stupendous. This is television at its best. In fact, it's visual media at its best. It's so flawless that I can't identity a single fault.
1595141715|5.0|by Sam Bagood<br /><br />How many of you have heard about the butterfly effect? If you haven't, here's a simplified explanation: One small change can have large consequences. Or, as Hannah Baker says in Thirteen Reasons Why, \\"In the end, everything matters.\\"<br /><br />The butterfly effect is commonly associated with time travel. But Jay Asher's young adult novel Thirteen Reasons Why is not about that. It doesn't explore diverging storylines or two significantly different outcomes from a seemingly minor event. It does, however, hint at the question, \\"What if?\\" And it is that question--that hint--that haunts the story and its characters.<br /><br />When Clay Jensen returns home from school, he finds a mysterious package waiting for him. There is no return address or note. He wonders if this is intentional, if this is perhaps from a secret admirer. Clay's guess is half-right. The box filled with thirteen audio tapes is from Hannah Baker, a girl he's liked for a long time--a girl that killed herself two weeks before.<br /><br />Death is inevitable. But when it comes, the question why now? resounds loudly in everyone.  When there's a suicide, the question is cut down to why? Asher weaves two narratives--Clay and Hannah's--in order to answer that there is no single reason. There is a whole story behind it.<br /><br />In a beautiful and haunting novel, we see thirteen events, people, times that could have changed one girl's life. We begin to understand the terrible truth of Hannah's downward spiral and the pain that knowledge brings to Clay. In the end, we become part of Hannah's list, forced to step back and truly see what we are, as Hannah puts it, \\"truly doing\\" before it's too late.<br /><br />Personally, I found myself gripped from the very beginning. Like Clay, I was desperate for the reason for Hannah's death. I wanted to know how thirteen people could be a part of it. More than that, I wanted to understand how Hannah pins down that number. Asher does wonderful job of keeping the reader in suspense and showing different sides of a highly complex situation. I recommend this novel.fferent sides of a highly complex situation.

But the whole package is here, with great songwriting and incredible guitar work.  Mostly, it's just a premier artist coming into his own.  It seems there is no style to which he can't do justice and no emotion that he can't evoke.  Love the guest spots with John Hiatt and Vince Gill.  Standouts are Prisoner, No Love on the Street, Slow Train, Dust Bowl, Heartbreaker, and Black Lung Heartache.  I'll stop now before I list all of the tracks because they are all fantastic.  And if you like this, see the guy live because that is where he takes it to a new level.

B001HPP2XW|4.0|I somehow missed \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" the first time around, and upon seeing it decades after the fact, I am trying to weigh up the balance between the good parts of the movie and the bad. Upon a twenty-four hour reflection, I have to come down on the side of a qualified \\"worth seeing.\\"  I'll call it as I see it.<br /><br />Terrific: Watching Audrey Hepburn in all her elegant Givenchy style; experiencing the chemistry between her, George Peppard, and Cat; Henry Mancini's \\"Moon River\\"; The rain scene. The extra by Mancini's widow and children was well worth watching.<br /><br />Less terrific: Don't even think about the miscasting of both Hepburn and Peppard in Blake Edwards' interpretation of Capote's novella. In the DVD extras, I discovered that Marilyn Monroe's name was mentioned for the role of Holly (She would have been wholly believable in the role).<br /><br />Fun: A typical goofy Blake Edwards' party scene (played with endless variations in his other films: e.g., \\"Victor, Victoria.\\"). (The Extra of the actors who played in the scene, which was choreographed and took eight days to film, is interesting from a filmmaking point of view).<br /><br />Mediocre: The equivocal comedy of the shoplifting scene.<br /><br />Cringeworthy: Edwards' widely acknowledged \\"direction\\" and resultant \\"performance\\" of Mickey Rooney (One must ask, however, if the character of Mr. Y. was not merely a prelude to Cato in the Pink Panther films, and whether the character of Cato was rendered slightly less offensive because it was played by an Asian and was possibly balanced by the goofy context of Sellers' idiotic \\"Frenchman,\\" Inspector Clouseau?). I am certain that I would have cringed had I seen \\"Tiffany's\\" at the time it was made!\\"<br /><br />Upshot: Because of the luminescence that Audrey Hepburn brought to any part she played, the splendid color and costumes, I would recommend  \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's with qualifications as an example of film history. Three-and-a-half stars.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|If you like action and adventure on an epic scale, with an opposites attract love story with beautiful people, set against a huge canvas that includes the outbreak of global war, Australia (2008) may just be the ideal movie for you.  The film is massive in scope, with beautiful cinematography, and action that is capable of exploding with earth shaking consequences.  This is big time filmmaking at grand proportions that captures your attention, featuring Nicole Kidman as Lady Sarah Ashley, a widow in a strange new land, battling to save what is left of her fortune.  Spanning 165 minutes, there may be even a little too much story, as the adventure extends to include the Japanese attack on the continent in December 1941.  A tale of tragedy and triumph, Australia certainly delivers a big bang for your buck.<br /><br />The film opens with intrigue as, Lord Maitland Ashley the owner of the cattle ranch Faraway Downs is killed with a native spear while out on the range.  Lady Sarah has only just arrived from England, and after burying her husband, she finds that she has a ranch about to go under on her hands.  Ranch manager Neil Fletcher (David Wenham) has been stealing cattle, and trying to drive Faraway Downs into the ground, so that King Carney (Bryan Brown) a neighboring rancher can eventually take over.  Fletcher is fired after Nullah (Brandon Walters) an aboriginal boy informs Lady Sarah of the true situation, setting in motion the conflict that will propel much of the film.  With little choice, Lady Sarah turns to Drover (Hugh Jackman), to help drive her cattle across the countryside, so they can be sold at Darwin.<br /><br />The setup is familiar, as the cultured \\"Mrs. Boss\\" finds herself in a man's world dealing with situations requiring determination and physical strength.  Refusing to quit, she has no options but to depend on her staff, and an apparently crude individual of questionable character.  With her pale completion, native Australian Nicole Kidman looks the part of an Englishwoman completely out of her element.  With the physique of a Greek god, fellow Australian Hugh Jackman makes for one of the most dashing of outback cowboys.  As Lady Sarah learns the ways of the drove and braves the rigors of the outback, her romance with Drover is predictable, but probably sure to satisfy most romantics.<br /><br />What may be less familiar, are elements of Australian culture that play significant roles in the drama.  This includes prejudice against indigenous people, and the relationship between Nullah and his grandfather King George (David Gulpilil), who is suspected of killing Lord Ashley.  Also important are the spiritual elements related to aboriginal life.  King George is a \\"gulapa\\", a magic man, who helps the group cross the \\"Never-Never\\" desert.  Lady Ashley develops a special relationship with Nullah after he loses his mother.  Fletcher, Nullah's biological father, is the cause of much tragedy and hardship.<br /><br />A tale of struggle, sacrifice, survival, and love, Australia is a throwback to classic American Westerns, with some feel good Disney-like touches, and a uniquely Australian supernatural element.  The voice of Nullah narrates at points, providing some perspective as the story unfolds.  The special effects and CG green screen tricks more commonly a part of action films, are featured quite prominently here.  The cattle stampede sequence is one of the most impressive examples, as is the attack scene by the Japanese.<br /><br />The acting is quite good, given that the film is something of a romantic fairy tale.  Nicole Kidman shows great range in a strong performance.  Drover isn't given a lot of depth, but Hugh Jackman's performance is exactly what is called for.  The huge diverse supporting cast, apparently features a large number of native Australians, which along with the period costumes, helps give the film a realistic look.  Young Brandon Walters, makes and impressive acting debut, where somehow despitehis youth, he manages to convey in his eyes, wisdom beyond his years.  David Gulpilil, perhaps most known for his iconic role in Walkabout (1971), doesn't say much, but as in that previous film, communicates much by his actions and presence.<br /><br />Writer/director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) does perhaps overreach by including the war story, and the film gets too melodramatic in the final act.  Still, Australia mostly holds your interest, taking on some surreal aspects in the aftermath of the attack.  This tour de force adventure/drama, is one should touch your heartstrings.  The only real disappointment is that lack of significant extras on the DVD release.  At this time, an upgraded full featured version would seem to be overdue.to convey in his eyes, wisdom beyond his years.

He WAS the head of the Foreign Technology Desk, and was in that position when I was in the ARMY.  He WOULD HAVE BEEN the one entrusted with these materials.  I served on some of the weapon systems that he wrote about in the book, and he really knows what he is talking about.  Have you noticed that the government has TOTALLY ignored this book, with no rebuttal, criticism or anything?  Any acknowledgement by them of any kind would PROVE that he is telling the truth, so they have officially ignored it completely.  This book is the unadulterated truth.  Believe it.

B004DK5CW4|4.0|Preface to my review: Reviews are simply an opinion from the viewer. There are a wealth of opinions on this movie and while we are all entitled to our opinions people need to remember some important facts about movies based on true stories or movies that were adapted from a book: It will NOT be identical. Some reviewers got their knickers all twisted up in a bunch because certain things didn't mesh with the real deal. Well, boo-hoo. Anyone expecting absolute greatness from a movie where the story is NOT an original will be disappointed especially if they have inside information on the true story or if they have read the book.<br /><br />For all intents and purposes, this movie was not flawless but it certainly was entertaining and at times uplifting. The cast was well above average in my opinion. I believe the makers wanted to convey a story about a really great horse-heck the best horse ever according to the experts and sports journalists. I think they did a fine job. Diane Lane certainly has gotten better as an actress and she did a really good job here. One reviewer had an issue with the soundtrack and the Gospel song included. I had zero qualms with soundtrack. I think the second placement of the song in question (Big Red coming around the track in the Kentucky Derby scene)was right on point. Awesome in fact.<br /><br />A lot of people who didn't like this movie compared it to Seabiscuit. I don't remember that movie and will have to watch it again to decide which of the two I like better. I do know while the movie was centered around horses/horse racing, they were two completely different stories. Also, there were things in Seabiscuit that wasn't completely correct either. At the risk of redundancy, any movie based on a true story will not be an ecaxct replica of that story. Things are changed and altered for thematic purposes and visual appeal. For that reason it will always be different and viewers will just have to get over it or not watch the movie.<br /><br />This movie doesn't fall short of entertaining. Equestrian history buffs may have issues with it. Movie lovers who are partial to feel good movies will love it it. I suppose it is a toss up for everyone else. All in all it was a good project and if you watch it with an open mind you might just add it to your library. Rent it first and decide if you're torn but at least give it a try.

B004L3AQFG|1.0|....for stealing two hours of your life.    Yes, the movie is great at showing the power of the human spirit and the will to survive and all that stuff good.  But to draw it out for two hours when Oprah could have made a better version in 15 minutes for her show or perhaps a Discovery channel show on Camping Disasters would have been better suited.    Its not that the movies is that bad (decent acting, cinematography etc....).  Its just long, drawn out and super boring.  Almost as boring as the horrendous Social Network.      Maybe we should just all wait for the sequel 127 Days and see a Hollywood version of the video footage he took of his kid being born.     Thats all about Hollywood can come up with these days when they aren't ripping off the rest of the world for original content.

B004EPYZU8|2.0|Sucker Punch was a long awaited film(at least since Christmas for me)especially after the endlless string of mediocre, dud films that were released this last summer through fall.I was hoping for more, but at the same time I wasn't entirely surprised when Sucker Punch didn't measure up to the hype of the trailer. Personally, I'm getting a tad tired of the \\"alternate reality/mind game/Matirix\\" plot driven films.     Sucker Punch (as anticipated)was visually stuning, but it was largely left to the viewer to translate the rest of the film as it stalled and dragged on from one mission to the next.It seems that this film was largely depending on the \\"exploitation\\" of the female cast to \\"sell it\\" and fill in the blanks where the film lacked substance.     When in doubt, dress a hot girl like a porn star,put her in lingerie or something else tight and/or revealing and have her dance around to maintaim the male audience's interest.Kind of like what I call the \\"Michael Bay soloution\\", except this film uses \\"skin\\" and allot of \\"suggestion\\" instead of bullets and explosions(although there is plenty of that too).    Granted,I have to give credit where credit is due.It had originality and potential and some good art style/direction.It borrows heavily from \\"Steam Punk/Heavy Metal fantasy and Samurai/Japanese film/animation, but the \\"you have 5 tasks\\" to complete plot and the mysterious,\\"only you know the answer to the riddle\\" question to win your freedom has been done to death a hundred times.    Boiled down to its basics, Baby Doll is sent to an asylum by her evil step father where the girls are used(or sold) I should say to the highest bidder as sex slaves and/or objects of affection.Baby doll creates her own fantasy world to win her freedom and escape for herself and others to ultimately keep from being labotomized. Guess what happens?    I liked the the visuals, but a film being \\"visually attractive\\" isn't enough.Just because a film has fantastic CG and visuals doesn't make itan outstanding film let along an entertaining one.Often it played out(or reminded me) of some elaborate video game as the heroines pranaced around dressed up like Jappanese Anime characters and who (miraculasly) had super human strength and intricate knowlege of  martial arts and warfare. I know that was \\"part of the fantasy\\" and that being part of the gag, but it can only work for so long.In the end,I found myself wanting more from this film than it was capable of giving.     Sucker Punch will be worth renting and certainly when released on Blueray and viewed on a large Plasma/LCD screen it will look great.However,if you are looking for a storyline that will keep you going, this one is left on auto pilot virtually from the begining hoping to bedazzle you with pretty faces,tight bodies,over the top action and CG. I wouldn't pay to see an evening show at the theater,and watching a matinee is really pushing it.     The title itself has no realtion to the film at all,its just \\"catchy\\" and looks/sounds cool. What I can say is, \\"don't be a sucker\\" and pay to see it in the theater let alone buy the film when released on DVD.While I thoroughly enjoyed Sin City and 300, Sucker Punch can't deliver what is promised, not even on a strictly \\"entertainment level\\" which both 300 and Sin City were capable of doing. Simply put...\\"don't believe the hype\\" because in the end, all it ends up being is just a cool movie trailer.

Ironically,  the Amazon Wireless store (wireless.amazon.com) does not detect your browser type or device.  Wow!
1931788340|5.0|Two reasons I purchased this book: 1) I am a photography fan/hobbyiest photographer and 2) I hoped to unearth some \\"pictoral documents\\" of days gone by when I was a kid growing up in the '70s.  This book quite simply captures scenes of cars, buildings, signs and street corners (from densely populated to dirt road outskirts) in carefully composed frames.  Mr. Shore also included some nice portraits of folks he came across in his travels to find \\"uncommon\\" places.  If you like fine art photography and want to take a visual trip back in time, you can't go wrong with this book.  Highly recommended.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|Terrific performances with one glaring exception(why CAMERON MACKINTOSH used the supremely talentless Nick Jonas, who can not sing, act or begin to create a character, instead of any of the superior performers who have played the part previously is beyond comprehension). The staging of the Tenth Anniversary Concert was better than in this concert, though the performances (with the noted exception) are just as good. If you love Les Mis,this is well worth getting
B000WAEK0E|5.0|First things first.  I am not a \\"complete\\" diehard Van Morrison fan, but have thoroughly enjoyed his music that did manage to reach my eardrums over the years.  I owned several of his titles on cassette as well as \\"The Best of Van Morrison\\", \\"Too Long in Exile\\" and \\"Down the Road\\" on CD.  To those of you that just own \\"The Best of Van Morrison\\" CD and want to further expand your collection of Van's songs, you'd be well off to purchase this three disc set.  There is also a single disc version of this title for the budget minded Morrison fans.  One note: the song \\"Sweet Thing\\" that appears on \\"The Best of Van Morrison\\" is absent from this collection.  Regardless, if you want a great overview of Van Morrison's career,  this set should satisfy your appetite.  Enjoy!
B0020TS5LU|3.0|I bought the Blue Ray of this film because I'm getting hard of hearing and I wanted the captioning for the hard of hearing found on most blue ray discs. The advertising blurb for this dvd doesn't mention that there is no captioning. too bad  It took an exceptionally long time for this dvd to finally arrive  Amazon's service is usually quite good- this was a disappointment all around
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is a GREAT movie.  I cannot understand why it didn't get more nominations or wins for Oscars.  The photography, acting and subject matter were superior.  I truly enjoyed this movie far more than I expected.  Diane Lane and John Malkovich were terrific as was the supporting cast.  Kudos to Disney!!!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I cannot wait for the next book from this author.   This is a: mystery, comedy, suspense novel, love story, and tale of friendships, weaved together so brilliantly you will not be able to put it down.  The descriptive words make you feel like you are living in the book with each character, feeling each emotion right along with them.   You sit on edge wondering if trusts are misplaced, and what other characters this author is going to introduce next to join in the mayhem.  I cannot remember feeling more sad to have a book end then finishing A Discovery of Witches.  I may just have to re-read it before moving on.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Better graphics, new birds, more &quot;golden eggs,&quot; good times. I don't know why people would give this low ratings. It even has a adventure element to it.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I use this app to scan docs I frequently use on a daily basis. I've not had any trouble with any text size. Though some smaller text may not be 100% clear, it is still readable. This is probably the most used app on my phone, I love it!<br />The only thing I have to be careful about are shadows on the paper. I make sure to take the pictures in good lighting where there are no objects to obstruct the light. I couldn't ask for more in a free app.
0345528581|3.0|I like the creativity of the author in using around-the-house objects to get fit. Sometimes his creativity is a bit more than I can handle, as I would not pull on doorknobs or fall against bookcases without expecting to strip out a few screws or break a shelf at a very inopportune moment.<br /><br />The more pressing issue is I am not a fan of the concept of strength training without flexibility training. If I'm going to do one and not the other, I'll opt for flexibility as there is strength training inherent in it. I cannot, however, say that flexibility training is inherent in strength training. There is a great Systema DVD replete with exercises to address the two together. Pilates, yoga, and other modern systems also do the same. Mark Lauren's system does not.<br /><br />In short, it's probably a great book for people who want to look ripped. If that's you, get the book. If you want ideas for at-home exercises, get the book. It is indeed a nice compendium of bodyweight exercises. I got it and plan to keep it. But I'll skip Mark's regimen and stick with my own, as his objectives are not my own.
044654759X|5.0|When I told a friend that Nickolas Sparks was one of my favorite authors, I was surprised by my friend's reaction. She said she didn't enjoy reading his books because they all had a sad ending. Was I ever happy that I had read this book! I enjoyed telling her that she was wrong--Safe Haven was absolutely wonderful! I was surprised, however, by the intrigue included in this romance novel--something I had not experienced in previous Nickolas Sparks reads. I was so engrossed in the story that I could not put it down! The twist at the end was really a surprise!<br />Again, Mr. Sparks brings the coastal North Carolina setting vividly alive through his descriptive powers. Those of us who love this area of the country thrill to read about it in novels such as this one.<br />I am happy to recommend this novel not only to those readers who love a good romance, but also to mystery buffs--you'll love it!
B002N8A14M|5.0|This product has everything I was looking for in an armband.  I read all the reviews before buying and after using this I am very happy with my purchase. The iPod fits right in the hard plastic cover that pulls apart in half and the entire iPod is covered except the click wheel which is great to prevent scratches while allowing ease of use when switching songs. I have had covers before that did not cover the screen and that was a major problem. The only thing I don't like is that the clip is not removable from the cover but I guess it is designed that way so people can just clip it on their belt.  It does separate from the band itself.  Overall, I am very happy this product and would reccomend it to everyone who is looking for these features.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it works great on my Evo 4g and the graphics are great its so fun and I think a lil much better than the seasons, I love it!
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I loved this game if I could play it. If I stop in the middle of a game it will not open again. I had to reinstall the game and start over at the begining. it happened again and I will not install.
0316017922|3.0|In Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, different stories of success are focused on. This book explains how success is achieved and the way in which Gladwell explains success is surprising. As for the 10,000 hours chapter, I found that this did hold some truth to the story of success. If you work, you will achieve success. The only difference is that Gladwell seems to imply that if you do not get a jumpstart on pursuing your talent or goal at a young age and put in enough hours, you will not reach your goal and you will not be successful. Gladwell seems to put down us \\"ordinary\\" people throughout the course of this book. If the right opportunities are not presented in front of us, then how can we be expect to be successful? In the chapter about the Beatles, he explains that they knew the right people and were in the right place at the right time in order to be discovered and brought to America. This goes against everything we have been taught about the American dream. If we work hard, we should be able to achieve our goals, right? Gladwell's book could very well have the potential to depress people that at their age, there's no point in trying to succeed because you've missed your opportunities. On the other hand, there was potential for this book to be great. The idea that there are outliers in society is no new concept and Gladwell could have elaborated more about extraordinary people without putting down the efforts of people who work hard to succeed. Being in the midst of reading Blink and having already read Gladwell's the Tipping Point (one of my favorite books), I just did not find Outliers to be attention grabbing or inspiring in any way. It was disappointing in my opinon especially coming from an author who I typically love. There are always going to extraordinary people and ordinary people but I think both are capable of success in their own ways. Hard work should and does pay off regardless of the schmoozing that you're supposed to do in order to arrive at success.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Angry birds Rio is a fun game with a new set of antagonists. I like the new environments and the graphics look great. Still the fun addictive game it was before.
B002ZG99TK|3.0|though i did enjoy this dramatic action thriller,i thought it was missing something.there was drama,to be sure,and plenty of action.but it was not as thrilling as i had hoped or expected.there was enough tension to keep me watching,but none of the 'edge of your seat 'or nerve shredding intensity.it wasn't boring,by any means but compared to the tension in Crimson Tide,for instance(also directed by Tony Scott)there was no comparison.Scott really reigned himself in here(which he usually has trouble doing(see Domino)but in this case,he could have let loose a bit.still,the movie was entertaining enough.for me,Unstoppable is a 3/5
B001FB0WBK|5.0|I rated this 5 star only because there weren't more.  Absolutely dynamite.  How can one player get so much music from an acoustic guitar?  Unquestionably the best dvd I have in a considerable collection.  MUST HAVE THIS ONE.
B002ZG97EC|2.0|i found this movie mildly entertaining,with a few light chuckles here and there,but i don't think it wasn't as funny as i had hoped or expected it to be.there were no real 'laugh out loud,tears rolling down your face moments'.i think it was just a case of a lot of the jokes falling flat.it had some cute moments though,and of course there's a feel good ending.it's suitable for the whole family and kids will get a kick out of it.for me,it was just this side of boring.compared to a lot of animated films i've seen this one just doesn't stack up.having said that,however,it's far from being awful.it's just not great.for me,Despicable Me is a 2.5/5
B0033AI4CK|2.0|Fans of Network, don't get mad at me for this two star review. This rating is for the blu ray and NOT this classic (the movie gets five stars from me). I have to be honest in my review of this product. Warner refuses to spend the money on great transfers to the newer blu ray format. Once again Warner has slapped together a quick (what appears to be)  single layer at cheaper price rip off! This transfer looks bad!! It's as if it is DVD upconverted! Warner \\"we are tired of the bulls..t!\\" Stop releasing crap like this!! This great film deserves better...we as consumers buying your blu rays deserve better. They need to pass a blu ray law where they have to state on the packaging the layer numbers used for each release. Universal is good about this and Fox does a fine job. If you are gonna keep ripping us off, Warner you need to quit releasing classics on blu ray and keep to new releases only. I would pay a little more for great transfers of your classic catalog. Please stop being cheap!! The only plus about this blu ray is its in color again. Seems the prints in the past have faded color. Other than that, I cannot recommend this 'upgrade' of this brilliant classic. Wrong again Warner.\\"I'm mad as hell...\\" Great way to prove what I stand against, blu ray IS a rip off! I have been proven wrong that its a great format. That's my two cents.
B003EYVXT6|3.0|this is a tense,atmospheric,drama/sci-fi/thriller.it deals with a topical issue,one that has been done before,but it works here.the issue is one of cloning.and the ethic and moral issues involved.it's a thought provoking movie and no matter what side of the fence you're on regarding this particular issue,it should engage you.it moves at a deliberate pace in order to to keep a tense atmosphere.the acting is solid all around,but Delphine Chanéac stands out as Dren.if you're expecting an action packed movie with lots of things blowing up,you should look elsewhere.but if you're looking for something engaging and compelling,check this one out.for me,Splice is a 3.5/5
B003UESJF6|1.0|This movie sucked to me...on top of the fact that I truly despise animated films created for children that just feel compelled to incorporate a shot of romance, the movie just didn't cut it for me. I was surprised to see the high rating.<br /><br />I was really annoyed by the blue guy never saying anything correct, like it just wasn't funny. The music thing was really corny. I saw it when it first came out so if I remember correct, they incorporated a little Michael Jackson, yeah, did nothing.<br /><br />It just was a bum movie to me. I can't remember enough of the details to really lay out well. But of course my 8 year old loved it, he's no help though because he pretty much loves all the animated movies that come out. Never fails.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|my friend and i thoroughly enjoyed Salt from the get go.it's basically wall to wall action.yes there are no doubt plot holes,and logic gaps,but it's all about the action here.and it's so much fun.plus it's so fast paced,you don't really have time to think about logic or plot,unless you really want to.we just went with it and had a blast.and actually the story is generally well written and has some very clever sequences.if you can just turn your brain off for the allotted run time,you should really enjoy yourself.but if you need you movies to have a high degree of logic and realism,this likely isn't your cup of tea.for me, though,i loved it. 4.5/5
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The app downloaded to my phone but won't install even after settings were changed. Very disappointed but hoping its available on Android market soon because so far not impressed by amazon appmarket.
B0041KKYEW|4.0|i wasn't blown away by this film,but i did enjoy it.for me,it was well acted,creepy and bizarre. i guess you could classify it a horror/thriller.it might make you cringe in some spots.if you're squeamish,this might not be the best movie for you.but this is also a movie that really makes you think.you never really knew what's real and what's fantasy.Natalie Portman really immerse herself in the role and is very convincing.and the film is never boring.there is always something going on.if you like your movies straight forward with everything laid out neatly,this probably isn't the movie for you.otherwise,i'd say give it shot.for me, The Black Swan is a 4/5
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This book is amazing. Anne Frank is a young girl who is struggling in the cold and unforgiving time of the Holocaust. She keeps an unflinchingly honest and humorous view on the world around her. Frank pays close attention to the nature of the human spirit as she fights for her independance and knowledge. I definetely recommend this.
B002ZG99NG|4.0|i really enjoyed this movie.it's the second film directed by Ben Affleck,who also stars in the film.i thought it was well written.the dialogue was very good.the movie flowed very well from one scene to another.there is a fair amount of action which is well done,and there is lots of tension and suspense.the acting is good all around,but i thought Jeremy Renner was really impressive as James Coughlin as was Blake Lively as Krista Coughlin.the Boston accent is pretty thick at times,so you might want to use caption or subtitles so you don't miss anything.there is a fair amount of strong language here,as well as some nudity.and of course being a crime drama,there is some violence,but it's not a violent as you would expect.the extended version clocks in at 150 minutes compared to the theatrical version of 125 minutes.i can't compare the two,as i only viewed the extended cut,but i will say it never found it boring or slow.for me,The Town (extended cut) is a 4/5
1439102724|5.0|I thought this book was extremely well written. It's sincere and genuine. It conjures lovely images for what a partnership could be. I love all the characters, I wish I could have heard from Zoe more, but maybe that's because she was my favorite. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B003YUC9JI|3.0|i enjoyed this remake of the 1984 original.it's a bit more fleshed out than the original,although it may be a bit too long.this one's actually about Kungfu,not Karate,and it shows the definite differences between the two disciplines.Jackie Chan plays the handy man role made famous by Pat Morita in the original.Jaden Smith(Son of Will and Jada Pinket Smith)plays the role made famous by Ralph Machio.i'd say this movie compares favourably to the original in all aspects except one:it doesn't quite have the same crowd pleasing intensity.at least i didn't feel it.still,it's well acted and well directed and looks good.for me,The Karate Kid is a 3.5/5
0670022411|2.0|I was looking forward to this book but exercised a little restraint and put a library \\"hold\\" on it instead of buying it. I am so glad I did! I got about half way through the book and just didn't care anymore. The writing is fine, the subject matter is interesting but I found nothing to connect to in the characters except annoyance. When our new puppy decided to eat the corner of the book, I promptly brought it back to library and paid the fine without finishing it.
B002ZG9940|3.0|some people may find this film slow.granted,it's not action packed.but it's not intended to be.i think it's more of a character study than anything else.George Clooney plays an assassin living abroad who agrees to one last job,and then wants out of the business for good.the film deals with his internal conflict,and shows what a lonely sad existence the character has.it's a bleak existence,to be sure.the pacing is very deliberate,but the film isn't what i would call boring.it is well acted and well directed.the tone of the movie matches the existence of the main character.if you don't have a lot of patience,this movie is not for you.otherwise,id say,give it a try.for me,The American is a 3/5
B0034BW9CO|4.0|I sing oldies-but-goodies, doo wop, motown, latin, blues and jazz.  His version and style of \\"Stand By Me\\" was just want I wanted to improve my presentation to my varied audences.  He's got a style that reaches his audiences and I like that since I've got a large Latin audience as well.<br /><br />Since I've incorporated some of his lyrical style and vocal shifts, my audience base has greatly increased.  Yes, I like this artist and this CD.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|With sounds akin to Radiohead, Queen and Fredric Chopin; this album is a sublime masterpiece.  Undeniably brilliant and aurally arresting.  The Exogenisis symphony is elegant and worth the whole price of admission.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|Wonderful and essential book for any Bukowski fan. The kindle edition has missing text on Location 4558 (page 298).<br /><br />The sentence reads: Both his hands gripped the sides of the machine, as he tried to guide the ball with body-English.<br /><br />I have no idea how much content has been omitted. I wrote a complaint to tech support. I'll update this review if I get a notice that it's been corrected.<br /><br />Update: I got an email from tech support that they acknowledge the problem and that the editor is going to fill in the missing content. I will be notified when that will be complete, upon which time I'll write an update again.<br /><br />Update: After comparison with the source, it turns out there is no missing text. Please read the comments if you need the details.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Installed no problem on Thunderbolt.  Very snappy and smooth.  Makes nice use of TB's great screen and awesome speed.  First adventure fun but not a real challenge.
B003L20IJM|5.0|We bought this for our 6 year old daughter after she fell in love with the first movie.  While it isn't our favorite of the two, it was still good for kids that are too old to watch cartoon movies all the time.  We would definatley recommend this movie.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|I love HULK. Even if the movie suck as hell, I will still see it.  In this Blu Ray, there aren't much differences from DVD.  The movie itself, it is better than ANG LEE one.  I just wish there were much more destruction.
B00005U122|5.0|Unbelievably gorgeous sound, great filming with good sense on who to centre on. As well as the Pink Floyd tunes we all love, this VD includes the best of  Waters' lyrics and songs from his solo albums, performed better than the CDs by far! Amazingly planned visuals and light show, cerebrally aware, honest and I'm pissed I was unable to catch this tour! One of the top DVDs in my collection by a real artist who cares.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|The book was much much better. The acting in the film seemed shallow and the first half of the movie was a bore fest. It almost seemed as if the actors were not really into acting this all out either, yes they all came to play it out...but emotionally, they were vacant.<br />The last half of the movie seemed that the actors redeemed themselves; however, the wolf was hilariously computery looking and looked more like an old Nintendo graphic rather than something from a 2011 werewolf movie.<br />This movie will not make it to my video library, but the book is here and I will read that again and again!<br />;-)
B004EQAVHI|4.0|I had intended to read this book for quite some time...then the film came out so I saw it instead.  I don't intend to write a full review of the entire film, but I felt such a distinctive array of emotions while watching it that I wanted to write something.<br /><br />This is a sci-fi movie about cloning, although it is \\"sci fi\\" in that aspect only,I know I think of futuristic robots and spaceships and whatnot when sci fi comes to mind. This movie is set in a boarding school in the English countryside of all places, which I believe to be the most atypical setting for a sci fi film I can think of.<br /><br />The subject matter reminds me a lot of a movie from a few years back, \\"The Island\\", starring Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor. In that movie, the stars realize that they are clones being groomed and maintained for organ harvesting as needed later down the road by their wealthy originals. That movie is set in the future- I think 2050?<br /><br />\\"Never let me go\\" is set in the mid twentieth century, which is part of what makes it so astonishing. Life expectancy has risen to beyond 100 years thanks to the advent of boarding schools that raise clone children to be smart, responsible and civilized beings that will donate all their vital organs later down the road through a series of surgeries. Little mention is made of the scientific aspect of the cloning or how it is accomplished, which would be boring anyway. The film focuses entirely on a group of these kids as they grow up.  When an outsider tells a group of the children, aged 8 or so, that their sole purpose in life will be to provide organs for regular people that need them, they are shocked.<br /><br />The film then fast forwards about a decade and focuses on the same group of kids.  They are now coming of age, and living in a big old farm house, where they pretty much sit around and spend their time as they please. For the most part they are completely resolved to their fate.  This total acceptance of their sad lot in life gave me the most overwhelming feeling of sadness.  This is in such stark contrast to what you typically expect to find in a movie where the subjects know they face such a tragic fate.  These clones understand their fate and have no plans to try to escape it. They are not even locked up, they are pretty much free to come and go as they please, as long as they scan their wrist monitor for tracking purposes.<br /><br />There is some talk amongst the young adults about the possibility of having the harvesting delayed if they can prove to the powers that be that they are in love. Some of the kids disspell this notion as only a rumor, but most secretly hold out hope  that there is truth to it.<br /><br />As the clones reach their early twenties, they begin to be called for surgeries for organ donation.  They often survive two or three of these surgeries before they \\"complete\\" (die).  The clones have various ailments as each surgery passes, they show one young girl that had one of her eyes removed in a past surgery. Keira Knightley cannot walk without a cane. There is a scene where Keira Knightley is undergoing her third surgery. As they pull out her organs, the monitor beeps loudly to indicate that she has expired...they show the cold, callous medical staff simply continue to remove her organs and not even attempt to revive her. This is such a powerful scene.<br /><br />That is really all I wanted to say about this film.  I don't know if I felt particularly connected with the characters themselves.  For me the amazing part of this film was watching these poor young people accept their fate and live their lives as creatures of science, bred for the pure purpose of organ harvesting. Makes me shiver just thinking about it.e most overwhelming feeling of sadness.

B004KA9MQO|1.0|I enjoy listening to Jennifer's strong vocal style with that beautiful voice, but was very disappointed after hearing this album. The song 'Where You At', (terrible grammar), was the only song that I did like because of the melody which has a catchiness to it but...... I hate the grammar :(         Sorry Jen, but I'll have to wait for your next cd.
B0034G4OUO|1.0|DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS CRAPFEST! THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!! Blehhhhhh! the who movie was full of extreme, gritty violence. He just goes around killing all these people. i hated it. if they had given the Rock's character more empathy, it would have been better. But he sure did not bring anything to the role. Even though I hate that sleazebag Billy Bob Thorton, I felt sorry for his character at least. No so with The Rock.
1439190275|5.0|I enjoyed this book, very easy to follow I love the lower carb lifestyle,  you really enjoy food while keeping cravings away!..   The edge..      my personal low sugar and watch carbs started over two years ago!!! 50 pounds gone and feel great! !!!!!!! Great way to maintain your weight is this lifestyle :).
0670022411|4.0|Debut author Deborah Harkness has definitely hooked me in with her novel A Discovery of Witches. Now I won't pretend to know anything about tenure at a college, or alchemical things so it helps anyway for me to enjoy this book much more because I wouldn't know if the author screwed something up. LOL<br /><br />I listened to this book on audio and the narrator had a very smooth and enjoyable voice. She did a very good job with trying to make voices for everyone and only sort of messed up on that when she was trying to do two male voices at the same time. For example she had a voice for Mathew, but when she had a new male voice Mathews voice sort of disappeared and became like the other male voice. Though I don't think I could do all those voices while reading the book aloud so kudos to the narrator Jennifer Ikeda.<br /><br />We learn that Diana is a witch, but she really doesn't like to have anything to do with magic. She is a historian and was wanting a alchemical manuscript and she receives the manuscript but didn't know it at the  time but she called the script using magic because it was under a spell and everyone wants this particular script. So even though she has put it back and has no clue how to call it back everyone thinks she can and it puts her life in danger. Not only do other witches want this manuscript but Vampires and Demons as well.<br /><br />There is a certain vampire Mathew Claremont who keeps hanging around and get to know Diana and sort of becomes her protector from everyone. He also wants the manuscript but he takes a liking to Diana even though he knows that you are not suppose to mix breeds. There is a council that is formed from three witches, vampires and demons to enforce such rules like that one. So being together is dangerous in more ways than one, not only because of the script but because of them being different creatures.<br /><br />Though as you go along you find out that there is a lot more to what the council is wanting than just the script and being mad because they are dating.<br /><br />Diana is a interesting main character, at first I thought she was a little bit wimpy, but she turns out to be a fighter in the end. She doesn't want to learn her magic, but it sort of comes out of her and she has no clue how it happens. Its sort of weird that she is 35, but doesn't have a clue about her magic or want anything to do with it. Mathew has been around for centuries so he knows a lot about witches and he knows that Diana has a lot of magic in her even if its suppressed. He also knows she is in a lot more danger than she could ever imagine and he tries his best to protect her from as much of it as he can, but there are times when she has to protect him. Mathew sounds like a very likable, handsome vampire and I like how protective he is of Diana.<br /><br />It also has a lot of secondary characters and villains. Since I listened to the audio I can't recall all of their names but I do like Emily which is Diana's Aunt Sarah's woman. Sometimes I like Sarah and sometimes I don't. Mathews mother Isabol (not sure of spelling) is a pretty fun character. She is his mother because she made him a vampire, just like Mathew has a son Marcus who he made into a vampire. There are a lot of villains in this book, each breed of creatures has villains and good guys. Though so far the worst villains have been two witches and one vampire, but there are a lot of them because they don't like the witch and the vampire being together.<br /><br />Over all I found the book to be very enjoyable, at points it has some slow parts, but once I got over that hump and it headed towards the end all I wanted to do was listen to it to find out what happens next. It leaves you wanting to know what happens next as this is part of a series. I would recommend this book if you like witches, vampires and demons. It's got a love story in it but I wouldn't really say it is just a romance book because it has so much more in the book than theromance.

1401323952|5.0|This is my first book by Nigella Lawson and it never leaves the coffee table.  I have made a few cookies and cakes from this book which are perfectly sweetened and moist; not one was cloying or dry.  The dinner entrees I made so far came out perfect as well.  My husband is not very fond of vegetarian dishes and even he loves them, they are that tasty and full of bold, beautiful flavor.  The book is full of comfort food recipes from different parts of the world made easy.  There are also tips of what to do with leftovers.  I have yet to make use of them though, these recipes are just that tasty.  I also like the make-ahead and freezing tips on baked goods since there are only two of us and the recipes may yield too many scones or cupcakes.      The book is presented beautifully with lots of photographs and the witty little introductions to each recipe that add the perfect touch.  These well-loved recipes from her home are now becoming part of my kitchen as well.  When this book is not in the kitchen being used, it is on the coffee table and being read and flipped through in anticipation of the next baking/cooking adventure.
B00275EHJG|4.0|Toy Story 3 was the best of the series. Rarely does a sequel match up to the original, but in this case it exceeded the original.
B004NOH9LW|4.0|This IS NOT a movie for those adrenaline junkies, sure to think an Eastwood flick starring Damon, is some kind of \\"Action Thriller\\"!<br /><br />It is, however, a very thoughtful and peaceful story.  I suspect you have to be over the mental age of 13 or 14 to actually understand this kind of movie.<br /><br />And while at times, it did seem to be a little difficult to follow... it was worth the effort.<br /><br />Damon did a masterful job developing his character's struggle with this strange talant.<br /><br />Ms. France's scene, in the restaurant, when her cad of a lover admits his feckless betrayal, was so real I was both moved and shamed at the same time. Moved in sympathy for her character... shamed because I recognized my own human weaknesses from experience.<br /><br />I would indeed reccomend this film to persons I think might enjoy it.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Although told from many different points of view, both Southern and Northern, this battle is told mostly from the view point of a college professor who was colonel of a Maine regiment. The movie has done an excellent job of showing the scope of the action while allowing us to come to know a specific individual who played a critical part in the battle. His speech to some would-be deserters is worth watching even if the rest of the movie was just so-so. However, the rest of the movie is very well done, especially the part where Colonel Chambers orders a fix-bayonet charge, after running out of ammunition, in order to repel the last Confederate advance.
0452295548|5.0|A fantastic book written by a woman who suffered a stroke and recovered to write what's it's like when you're having the stroke, getting help, in treatment, rehab etc. She had worked in the field of brain injusry for her career so her insight is extra deep, but not too technical. Really helped us to help our brother who had a stroke...how to communicate better, what's happending inside his head etc. Lots of good tips too.

B004RL9T50|3.0|As a married man without kids I love this genre. With the voice talent and original premise this movie could have been up there with the Incredibles but instead it stumbles along with awkward pacing and little to no laughs.    I found myself amused and laughed out loud a small handful of times but there were only two moments in the entire film that really got us all laughing.    This feels like the newest Alice in Wonderland in that it has all the ingredients of an instant classic yet somehow it fails to grab you and will be quickly forgotten.
B0037QGS0A|4.0|While I enjoyed the movie, one aspect bothered me. The son is portrayed as a mean, selfish, teenage brat. It appears he is just a rotten, damaged kid. No back story is provided. But in the Extras (Special Features deleted scenes) we see the reasons for his bad behavior, and they unfortunately change the whole dynamic of Julianne Moore's character for me. I realize the director has to make these decisions, but such an important incident should never have been left on the cutting room floor.

B004H83IFA|5.0|I am a big fan of Langella, and once again he delivers an amazing performance as an ice-cold real estate baron. But I digress as this film was one of the most meticulously researched \\"true story\\" films I have had the time to find. Jarecki impressed me with the volume of time and material he put into this, and I think if even the critics of this film watch the supplements they will have an alternative viewpoint of this whole project.<br /><br />The picture quality is great, albeit the clarity overall is not a benchmark as Jarecki uses a great deal of darks, retro-footage and varying focus points. The DTS is crisp, but the outer channels are mostly score heavy (which haunts the scenes just right), with the stand-out exception of the thunder during the murder scene (excuse me, disappearance night). The story appears to be a solid theory of how Durst's life might have transpired over those thirty years of friends and lovers being killed. The supplements are outstanding and include:<br /><br />* Deleted scenes, 4 @ 5:21 minutes. Low-def, glad they were cut as they seemed out of place.<br />* Truth in Fiction, 26:07 minutes. A documentary about the process in researching this film and finding as much of the truth as possible. The amount of self-accolades and how great everyone is to work with (which I loathe) did not really hit until the 18-minute mark. Worth the watch.<br />* Back in Time, 22:48 minutes. Interviews with all of the real people associated with these crimes and the overall story. Worthy of a History Channel presentation with all of the material presented. The detective's answers to why he was re-assigned and how he evades blurting out all that is wrong with this case (at the 20-minute mark) is priceless - worthy of another film about what is not being said. Absolutely worth the watch.<br />* Beneath the Surface, 60 minutes. A very articulate interview with the director. He reveals all there is to know about the production, story and background on this film. Good insights and does not feel too long even though it is a talking head format. I would say watch this one last so you have all of the information going into it.<br />* Wrinkles in Time, 1:44 minutes. A fast-forward clip on Gosling getting the make-up applied for his advanced age scenes.<br />* Commentary with Jarecki and the producers. Informative, but I preferred the other supplements regarding the actual material and filmmaking.<br />* Commentary with Jarecki and Robert Durst. WOW. I cannot think of any instance in movie making history where the person whose life is being depicted (and is most likely the serial killer) is talking on a commentary track. I spent hours watching and researching this story, but I still found a way to listen to this guy talk about what he was seeing in the film - and how accurate Jarecki had made things. Selfishly I had wanted to hear this guy finally admit to it, but his lawyers had already not allowed him to participate in the documentaries, so I am sure this was planned out to the word. Still, for serial killer researchers this might be a track to play. His voice sounds identical to Pacino's role in [[ASIN:B00005T7I1 Dick Tracy]].<br /><br />This will be on my recommendation lists for so many reasons, but most of all the actors did an amazing job fulfilling the roles of real people and the BD holds all that one would want to know about regarding this story (except for an ending of the bad guy being caught). No region coding listed, English language only, subtitles in English and Spanish only.feel too long even though it is a talking head format.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|I play sports, and am very busy and stressed most of the times. Its a rare to find a show that would make you want to just drop whatever you have planned and watch it. I think people need that kind of a thing sometimes. The graphics, the acters, and the script are all well written and played out great. Its a kind of a show like prison break or Lost that makes you just want to keep on watching and see what happens. I strongly recommend this to anyone has a bit of free time on their hands. This fantasy based series are based on book series known as Sword of truth, and even though its not followed exactly like the book its an amazing experience to watch. For people that liked Lord of the rings, Spartacus, and other series of the sort this is the show for you. Combines Action, love, great storyline, more action, and through watching it you will connect with the characters and feel for their pain. ( NOT SPOILING IT HAHA )  Buy this im looking forward to season 3 ( yes i have watched season 1 )
B004289ZW0|1.0|my gns 5870 mfi turns itself off while sitting on the vehicle dash with a bluetooth connection to my ipad.    this seems to be a touch \\"switch\\" sensitivity issue because it works fine once i disabled the touch switch.    i now turn my unit on by briefly attaching an external power source or pressing the reset button  and turn my unit off by turning off bluetooth on the ipad and waiting for the gns to auto-power off.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This show absolutely stunned my mind ( in a good way ). I dont like leaving reviews because they probably would not be as good as others but I had to stop take the time to do this. This show is just simply amazing. I play sports, deal with a bunch of other stuff, so time isnt always so kind. But when I saw the first episode of the season, I knew my schedule had to change ASAP. It was wake up, eat, lift, shower, this show, eat, this show, attempt to sleep, wake back up, this show, sleep and repeat. It is very addicting series much like prison break and Lost. After you finish watching both seasons ( cause there are only two out at the moment ) you simply want to watch it again. Great plot, adventure, alot of action, and through out watching the series you start connecting with the characters and feeling for their pain ( NOT SPOILING HAHA ). The only bad thing about this is getting calls from coaches and they scream at you because you were supposed to be at lifts an hour ago.... ( joke )   Rent an episode, read more comments and experience this for your self.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life is one of the more formative of the movies I've seen. It takes at least a second viewing to digest a good amount of it, and having seen it several times past that, I can say with certainty that this film yields more riches every time I pop it in the dvd player. Even if you aren't on the \\"life as dream\\" train, you should still check this movie out for its excellent direction, head-scratching script, and the wondrous, rapturous, hypnotic art direction.

B004CLYKLI|3.0|As an Asian-American myself, I was raised by parents who believed in the &#34;Chinese&#34; parenting philosophy that Amy Chua espouses in her book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. Because of my background, I took this book very personally. How could I not?<br /><br />I imagine that most people are drawn to this book because of the WSJ article, &#34;Why Chinese Mothers are Superior.&#34; Is the book just more of the article? For the most part, yes.<br /><br />In this memoir type of a book, Amy Chua sets out the dreams she has for her daughters and recounts her relentless pursuit of those dreams at all costs. Her stories alone would not be so offensive had she not tied them all together with the assertion that the Chinese parenting philosophy produces better progeny than the Western parenting philosophy.<br /><br />First of all, I completely disagree with the Chinese parenting philosophy. It is true that the Chinese parenting philosophy might produce high achieving children. But it is equally true that it might produce some very miserable ones. There is a cost in terms of time, energy, missed social interaction, and mental health.<br /><br />Amy Chua casually dismisses the idea of any harm to self-esteem, but I couldn't disagree more. Perhaps it's true that Amy's two daughters don't have any self-esteem problems. But their mental health may be attributed to just plain luck rather than to Amy - that is, nature rather than nurture. If Amy had more sensitive children, I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up in the mental hospital.<br /><br />In the book, Amy Chua spends a disproportionate amount of time on her daughters' musical pursuits. Although learning either the piano or violin is commonplace in Asian households, there is also typically emphasis on SAT prep, supplementary math studies, and learning Chinese. Amy Chua does touch upon some non-music goals, but most of her book focuses on the piano and violin.<br /><br />Hence, I often got the impression that Amy Chua wished that she herself could be the piano player or violin player that she made her children become. She devoured, digested, and regurgitated all of the music theory taught by her daughter's music teachers. She recruited the best teachers and even arranged for both of her daughters to practice while traveling. Yes, she even hunted down pianos in Europe just so that her daughter would never miss a day of practicing. Then when it was time for her daughters to perform, Amy Chua seemed to experience stage fright from the comfort of her seat in the audience. Perhaps she knew that she wasn't able to do what her daughters did. Her level of obsession with her daughters' musical performances seemed to be not just on a different level, but on a different planet than many of the Asian-Americans I know.<br /><br />At the beginning, Amy Chua framed the book by stating that she was humbled by her youngest daughter Lulu, who rebelled against the harsh parenting tactics of her mother and took up tennis. But I found this so-called &#34;humbling&#34; to be disingenuous. It was contrived. Amy even mentions how she had a difficult time coming up with how to end the book. I don't buy that she was humbled by Lulu. She didn't have an awakening. Lulu simply was more stubborn and won the war with her mother. Besides, tennis isn't even outside of the Asian-American comfort zone. It's not like Lulu took up cheerleading.<br /><br />If you strip the book of its parenting manifesto message, then there are some redeeming qualities. For one, it does provide a glimpse into the lives of many children of Asian descent in America, albeit, a bit an extreme example. For all those who wonder why Asians are the most educated ethnic/race group in America, and yet are grossly under-represented in executive leadership positions, this book offers some insight. The Chinese parenting philosophy demands hard work, high results, but virtually no innovation.<br /><br />Second, the book is funny. I laughed out loud when, in an argument with her husband, Amy Chua demanded to know what dreams he had for their dog Coco. That was the funniest part of the book. Much of the time, her words were spot on. I laughed because I related. And then, there were times when her anecdotes were so over the top that they were hilarious.<br /><br />Lastly, I commend Amy Chua for being ridiculously honest. It definitely takes some guts to go that public with some of her horrifying and near-CPS-worthy parenting decisions.<br /><br />Overall, my recommendation of this short book is mixed. I cannot stand the fact that she truly believes in the Chinese parenting philosophy. On the other hand, it's entertaining and good fodder for discussion.<br /><br />**Edited on 6/12/15 to remove the line &#34;Indeed, statistically speaking, Asian-American girls have the highest suicide rate among any race or ethnic group in the 15-24 age group,&#34; because I cannot find the citation to back this claim.

0316017922|1.0|In Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, he discusses the various reasons as to why people are more successful than others of similar ability. He uses various examples to support his theory, but in my opinion, I think the book is a little ridiculous. While Gladwell does present interesting points about the success of certain individuals with supporting evidence, the points he writes in the book are a little out there. I personally think Gladwell's observations he discovered that make people successful seem more of a coincidence. The hockey player example towards the beginning of the book says that players who are born closer to the cutoff date are more likely to become the best hockey players. He then shows a lis of all the hockey players in Canada that are born in January - March. While there are a significant number of players born in this months, it is not the TOTAL explanation as to the success of the hockey players. Gladwell, however, describes this little factor to be the total reasoning as to why these specific Canadian hockey players are the most successful. He does this through out the whole book and I found it rather annoying and degrading to the millions of people out there who worked just as hard as the highly successful people but just haven't received similar opportunity. Gladwell leaves out some vital factors that contribute to the success of people. Number one is he leaves out that everybody has a different definition of success and he generalizes the term success to be famous and rich for all people. And number two is that he doesn't mention that people make opportunities happen for themselves just as much as opportunity happens by chance. If someone thrives to be there idea of successful, then they will find a way to do that. I think Gladwell towards the end of the book started mentioning really pathetic examples and reasons for success just to meet a page quota for the book. I do not recommend this book to anybody who has a strong opinion of self success and an unbendable will towards hard work. I gives this book a 1 out of 5 stars for the lack of substantial and decisive evidence in the book.

B00129H7VS|5.0|I will make this short and sweet, no lengthy review needed (some reviews are longer then my credit card statement. Its not rocket science). Simply.. AMAZING!! If you landed on this page, then obviously either you are interested in war movies, or clicked the wrong movie link. Based on a true events this miniseries encapsulates first hand account of US Airbourne squadron that was dropped behind enemy lines in France (after D day). It is a spin-off from a Blockbuster movie Saving Private Ryan played by Tom Hanks. Actually this HBO series was produced by Hanks. From first episode you will get familiar with each character that is unique in their own way. Throught the series you experience different perspective from each soldier that deliver their function and horror they saw in their eyes. Each episode starts with a brief intro from real life survivors, so they give you heads up what you will see in the next hour. Kinda hold your hand. If you love WW2 movies or any war movie for that matter  and you did not see it yet, either you were in a coma and skipped this series, or clicked here by mistake.
0307454541|3.0|The book can put you in an agitated or depressing mood.  It has graphic details of sexual abuse and domestic violence. Easy reading that is not for readers of all ages.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|I've been going through the reviews and it captured my attention on how people were rating this film based on the accuracy or credibility of a \\"Hereafter\\". Well, for starters I really can't blame them. People have their own opinions, their own believes. \\"What will Happen to Us after we die?\\" is a Question that crossed many people's minds at least once in their lives. Of course, when we are younger we are told that Good people go to Heaven and bad people go to hell and we accept that fact as it is, plain and simple but as we grow older we always Question our believes our minds are always rebelling against the illogical and the idea of Heaven and Hell seems too paranormal for some that it simply can't be true.<br /><br />I think when you view this film, try to view it based on your believes and on your point of view. Do you believe in a \\"Hereafter\\" do you believe that there is something after death ? or is death merely the end ? If you believe that there is something for us after we die, then this movie isn't trying to establish itself as a fact. It's just a possibility of what might happen when we die.<br /><br />I personally am a superstitious person, I like to believe that people will eventually get what they deserve. The idea of a bad person who kills people and do so many crimes and not getting punished for it is disturbing and depressing, It almost make me feel that there is no meaning in life, so the idea of Heaven and Hell gives me a comfortability. You can never be too sure right ? So, when I watched this film I liked the idea behind it and I also liked the story. True, this may not be Eastwood's best work but it's unique and different.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to people who have an Open mind, or are willing to see something new. If however, your into fast paced, action movies than you'll probably get bored considering there is little to no action in this film at all. I know the trailer has that tsunami and the people running away from it that gives us the impression it's full of action scenes under water almost like 2012 but after watching the actual movie I was amazed at how fooled I was by the trailer.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who like to watch \\"realistic\\" movies. The film is obviously a work of fiction and it's not related to any world problem issues at all.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to watch spiritual based movies that deal with the issue of life, death and after death.<br /><br />On the other hand, if your just curious then I would give this film a rent.ion it's full of action scenes under water almost like 2012 but after watching the actual movie I was amazed at how fooled I was by the trailer.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I didn't think I'd like this book at first.  It sounded a little dry and boring...however, after the first chapter, I was hooked!  I'm not finished yet, but I am close and I love the way history has been sprinkled through the book more than most \\"vampire novels\\" - other novels have 1000 yr old vamps but not a bit of history.  This book is rich in history and the characters are well developed.  I am enjoying this book immensely!!

What I will tell you is that we went to see the movie with two 12 year-old girls and they loved it!  No heavy date scenes to make them squeamish and plenty of action-they loved the little beagle in it and the hottie main character.  After watching the movie, they had to read the book-a big plus when you'd like them to read more.  We have the second book on pre-order and will buy the film when it comes out, which is a five-star movie in my house:)

0143038419|1.0|It was a gift. Nice title, but seriously? Nothing to write about. She was unhappy, unfullfilled, blamed her husband, had a midlife, got divorced, tried to escape, ran away and went on a spiritual search. But it was all about experiencing me me me me and indulging. In the end empty, unfullfilled, unhappy. Sad really. Yes I know she says she has found herself but thats only till her next meal or \\"experience\\" is over. I guess the attraction beside a good title is that all of us want to escape from time to time but she was acctually wreckless enough to do it and then write about it and made it sound fun.

Yes, it was a lot slower than just about all the other movies I watch but because it was at the pace it was, I was able to enjoy it as I used to.  Way back when just about all movies were as this one was.  I was drawn into the character and plot which made it very a joy to watch.

B0049OSQ18|3.0|The Decemberists' early albums were the soundtrack to falling in love with and marrying my wife.  So both of us hold them very dear.  But it's been a rough few years with the Decemberists.  Crane Wife was great but lacked the whimsy of their earlier work.  Hazards of Love sits untouched on a shelf after ~20 listens convinced me the concept album just wasn't any fun to actually listen to.  The King is Dead is an improvement over Hazards for sure, but for fans who've invested in the Tarkio double, a lot of this album will be familiar, and flat.  The eclecticism (instrumental, thematic, vocal) of the perfect early albums is mostly (but not entirely) missing here.  We'll keep buying, but the hope is fading.  We're on the lookout for the next band to be our soundtrack.

B000YCLRBA|5.0|The majority of the productions that I have witnessed from the Metropolitan Opera House have been \\"eye popping\\" spectacles.  This 2007 Metropolitan Opera House's production of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin is spectacularly intimate with minimalistic sets and very sparse scenery.  It all works wonderfully for this, to me, very intimate opera that focuses more on Tatiana. Lenski and Onegin's inner emotions.  Although, the production thrilled me, I was overwhelmed with the musical side of things, as well    The Met Orchestra, outstandingly led by Valery Gergiev, was, per usual, wonderful playing with extreme beauty and sensitivity--bravo.  All three (3) of the principal singers (Renee Fleming, Ramon Vargas, and Dmitri Hvorostovsk) were simply outstanding delivering their arias and duets magnificently.  The closing duet between Onegin and Tatiana (Fleming and Hvorostovsky) was truly special being so dramatic and beautifully sung.  Once again, I must say BRAVO.  I really loved this operatic production.      The sound and picture are great.  I too question why Decca had to put this opera on two (2) discs?  However, it's well worth the investment.
0316017922|2.0|So far I have read three of Gladwell's books. By far Blink was the best one, then comes The Tipping Point and then Outliers. I have a mixed review about Outliers because while I was reading the book I felt like the \\"chosen\\" or \\"lucky\\" ones will become successful in this world. What are the chances that to be good at hockey you have to be born at a certain time of the year in a certain year? The statistics are proven facts but I also think it could be a chance. There are a lot of successful people In this world that don't need a statistic to prove that they're successful. But, I suppose that is the whole concept of this book, the outlier. A quality of the book I did enjoy was the stories of how the successful people we know today such as Bill Gates, their entire story was told. It was interesting to see the similar qualities in their stories and how the not so common opportunities happened to the billionaires of the world today. I enjoyed the pieces of psychology that were demonstrated throughout the story however, I did not like the purpose and how it was presented. I give this book a two out of five because I know that the other book's Gladwell has written are better.
0066620996|4.0|Well researched and strong, sensible advise for people trying to lead. But, not as good as they thought at the time.  Two of the good to great companies were Circuit City and Fannie Mae. With hindsight, these were pretty bad picks. But the book still works, because even those companies made the 15 year run that they were looking for. The reasons for greatness that they found make a great deal of sense. The concept of a level 5 leader is very strong. I have used some of the ideas and they seem to be working.  Is this the final leadership answer? No. The unintended message that I got from the book seems more like the Tao; things that become great will eventually loose their greatness no matter what.
0545302862|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this series.  I like mythology, I like action and mystery.  These books were all pretty great and hard for me to put down.  My Dad likes to read my books too, and he read through these pretty quickly.  I also liked Harry Potter and the Warrior Series.

0393061310|1.0|This book was without a doubt one of the most ridiculous things I have ever read.<br /><br />This quote, \\"from the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American\\" is pretty much his thesis statement.<br /><br />He delves into such scientific detail to support this as \\"because we have tv\\". When he issues such statements, go check the footnotes out, oops, they don't exist! It's all based on anecdotal hippy diatribes.<br /><br />He tries to show that technological achievement is not necessarily indicative of some inherent genetic advantage. Which is a fair enough statement to make, because there are other things in play. The stature of different societies is a complex issue. However, he overcompensates to such an hilarious extent that he is equally as ridiculous-if not more so-than some antiquated eugenicist from decades past he is trying to retort. He often seems to make believe the human mind doesn't exist, and everything that happens is just \\"luck\\", not the directed effort towards something by people.<br /><br />This book isn't a piece of science literature, but a treatise in PC. The Pulitzer prize committee must include the same individuals who gave Obama the peace prize. They both hold about as much merit.
B004SCI9BS|2.0|The fanboys and johnny-come-lately Strokes fans can fluff up this album all they want, but the fact is, it's just not that good. Under Cover of Darkness is great, there's a couple other songs worthy of going on the playlist and the rest feels like hastily put together filler. Unfortunately it seems Julian and Albert spent quite a bit of their remaining creativity on their solo careers (which were both great), and didn't leave much for this album.
B000MG1ZGA|5.0|this review is for people approaching for the first time to the doors.   this album is the last record of the doors with jim morrison, but not their masterpiece. you can find two gems: \\"l.a. woman\\" and \\"riders on the storm\\" that are among the most beautiful songs ever written by the band. there are also some ordinary songs and some uninspired songs. so, why so many people like this bluesy album? the answer is that L.A. Woman is the most candid and honest work of the band. a kind of live performance (better than a live performance, if you compare it with \\"Absolutely live\\" - what a paradox, the title - where the producer made a million of cuts in studio). \\"Morrison Hotel\\" LP, for instance, sounds very artificial and a little commercial, against the last album. L.A. Woman is a naked album, where Jim shows himself in all his genius and misery.  i actually think that this is the only remix we really needed by the doors. that's why the original LP \\"L.A.Woman\\" was recorded too quickly, after the great producer paul rothchild had left the band. The LP was suffered a lack of experience during the mixing in studio. the original team (the survival components of the band and bruce botnick)40 years later, provides a remedy to these little mistakes. especially in the central section of L.A.Woman where they double the vocals and in The changeling. the blues \\"Cars hiss by my window\\" is another original version, much better and complete than the preceeding. You can find an adding original verse sung by morrison, which is the best one (\\"Dog crawled out of my window in the cruel morning yard\\")which closes the song better, either musically or poetically: Jim awakes after a bad drunk - because of his dog, outside - and realizes that \\"the girl killing him in a darkened room\\" was just a nightmare.  You can find also \\"Orange county suite\\" an extra song that jim wanted to be included in the LP, well arranged by the doors. It is one of the best songs of the album and Jim would be very happyabout it. So the remix is faithfull and even better than the original. the only (little) defect is the final blues sung by manzarek which has a different mood.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|This is an analysis of the financial collapse and the ensuing bailout. Many of the key players refused interviews (think Greenspan, Paulson) but the story is told with a great deal of restraint yet it is startling. This is a sad commentary on the state of the nation, how much Obama and Bush have in common, and why we might want to get the Prime minister of Singapore to become President of the U.S.A. (The Prime Minister of Singapore is interviewed in this documentary and comes across so differently from our posturing politicians). The cinematography is beautiful and I found myself mesmerized by the vistas of NYC. On Blu-ray the image quality (aerial shots of the buildings in lower and midtown Manhattan) is superb. The special features are also very informative. The Prime Minister's in full is here and again, how very very different. In him I saw an FDR  or maybe that is what I long for. For someone interested in understanding what credit default swaps are the explanations are lucid. The global interrelatedness is explained with finesse and this DVD has great educational value despite the moribund banking world.   For content and cinematography 5 stars.

B003UESJHO|4.0|I am writing this review as a casual boxing movie fan.  Having seen all of the offerings over the past decade or so, this movie was entertaining in comparison only because of Christian Bale's excellent representation of the would-be champ who (tripped) knocked down Sugar Ray.  He nails the quirky and witty remarks & mannerisms of Micky Ward's brother, Dicky.  Wahlberg's performance is essentially a mail-in ... he fits the role well, but seemed uninspired.  This is coming from someone who typically enjoy's Mark Wahlberg's movies, too.  Amy Adams plays the (at first) hard-to-get bar maid and eventual love interest of Micky.<br />Obviously, the movie is more about the messed up Ward family dynamics and the love/(not quite) hate relationship between two brothers carving their niche in the boxing world.<br />Overall, 4 stars ... something for both men & women in the movie.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|This book was not what I expected but it was amazing still! I loved this book! I laughed and cried multiple times throughout the book. My heart went out to both characters at different times in the story.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS READ!!!!!
B000KITQK2|5.0|Okay, like most of you, I usually do a lot of research before i buy products on the net, and I have to say I'm really glad that I settled on the Berhinger ADI21.  I play guitar in a smal Irish folk/rock band, and this DI is the perfect fix to my missing tone.  I play a straight acoustic guitar with a Dean Markley Pro Mag XS, and usually send it right into the powered mixer.  While easy to do, the Markley's limited output usually meant I had little by way of EQ and control. I had to max the volume on my chanel of the power mixer while everyone else was at 2 or 3!  Now with the Berhinger ADI21, I don't have that problem!  Aside from the increased output level, the tone is amazing!  The on-board EQ is just perfect for folk music, and makes my guitar sound as warm as I've ever heard it! it actually sounds like an incredibly warm tube pre-amp, and the \\"Blend\\" control is great for mixing your guitar's own Piezo pick-up, or a out-board pick-up like my Dean Markley Pro Mag. If you dont feel like spending 150 or more for an LR Baggs, this is the tool for you! Amazing tone, increased output level, great value; you can't go wrong! I'm kinda sad it took me so long to find this product and buy it; I would have done it years ago!!! Make sure you pick up the optional power supply; this things eats 9V's like there is no tomorrow, (plus the 9V battery conector seems a bit fragile).  But hey, with the money you are saving over buying a LR Baggs, who cares!  Buy this DI...you WIL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!

B004P1J6X2|5.0|This is a book of statistics put together by a central banker. It is reminiscent of \\"The Bell Curve,\\" another statistically heavy work which was notable only in that it addressed topics that were conventionally beyond discussion, such as the correlations among race, poverty, and intelligence. As with \\"The Bell Curve,\\" only a minor part of Sarrazin's book deals with the unmentionable, politically incorrect topics.<br /><br />Sarrazin devotes most of his effort to talking about ethnic Germans themselves. Each succeeding generation of ethnic Germans is approximately 1/3 smaller than the preceding. They have that many fewer children. Stated another way, the replacement rate for ethnic Germans is something around 1.4, whereas it takes 2.1 (children per woman) to maintain a steady population rate. Extrapolating, and using round numbers, the number of grandchildren is roughly half the number of grandparents. He makes the commonsense observation that this is no way to sustain a country.<br /><br />This book frequently makes reference to the set of tables in his appendix, showing projections for the number of people within each age cohort for the next half-century, plotting an inexorable decline. He shows that the ratio of retired people to workers will shrink to about 1:1 in that time, and almost untenable proportion. He also computes that Germany's Gross National Product will perforce decline as the number of workers declines, marginal improvements in productivity notwithstanding.<br /><br />What appears to be his main theme, though certainly not the chief thread in discussion of his work, is educated women's absence from the ranks of motherhood. The more educated a woman, the fewer children she has. And since, of course, education is quite highly correlated with intelligence - a statistic that Sarrazin doesn't cite, but is rather well known - this means that Germany, like the rest of the Western world, is suffering from a dysgenetic secular decline in intelligence. Each generation is not only smaller than the preceding, but it is less intellectually capable as well, simply because the most intellectually capable layers of society are not having kids.<br /><br />Nobody challenges this thesis. The feminists may not like to hear it, but they do not want to acknowledge any obligation to have children simply for the sake of society. Speaking of society, Sarrazin reminds one of the eugenics advocates, discredited since Hitler's time, who would encourage the best of the Aryan race to reproduce abundantly. No doubt that would be the best thing for the future of the German state, but it is antithetical to the sovereignty of the individual, which is now taken to be the highest good in society. Women, and men, now have an unchallenged right to put their own interests above those of the society that spawned them.<br /><br />Sarrazin notes that Hitler's Endschluss had terrible consequences for the upper reaches of intelligence within German society.  Jews either left or were exterminated.  His discussion of Jews is entirely consistent with what one routinely reads in American publications such as Murray's \\"Human Excellence,\\" and most recently Harpending and Cochran's \\"The 10,000 Year Explosion.\\"  The intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews is about 15 points higher, on average, than the average American or German. This claim is controversial only in Germany, which is so touchy about its historical treatment of the Jews.  Gentiles in America accept the statistic rather easily; thanks to the Nazis and the Eastern European pogroms, enough Jews arrived in our country that we can anecdotally validate the claim. The only thing that is novel in Sarrazin's book is that he published it in German, and that in Germany any note on Jewish intelligence might be construed as anti-Semetic.<br /><br />Sarrazin takes on the wishful thinking that ethnic Germans' unwillingness to reproduce themselves can be offset by immigration, and the fertility of immigrants. This is where he gets into another kind of trouble with political correctness.  His discussion of Muslim and African intelligence is consistent with the findings (yes, frequently vilified but never refuted) of American, Canadian and British social scientists such as Arthur Jensen, Philippe Rushton, Richard Lynn and Hans Eysenk. It surprises me that Sarrazin does not credit them in his bibliography. He backs up claims with regard to their criminality and welfare dependency with statistics from the German state. It is interesting to note that the Germans, just like the French and Americans, obfuscate these statistics by using groupings that make it difficult to tease out the relevant conclusions. All three countries' statistical offices do not want to support politically incorrect uses of their data, such as observing inconvenient truths about Muslims or Mexicans.<br /><br />Sarrazin concludes that the immigrants which Germany is receiving, primarily from black Africa and the Muslim countries, are a net drag on German society. They take more in social benefits than they contribute in wealth. They certainly will never be in a position to compensate for the absence of births among ethnic Germans.  He claims that it is high time that Germany abandon its wishful thinking about immigrants and perform a statistical analysis of their actual performance to date. They have a 50 year history with Turks - enough time to draw some reasonable conclusions about the limits on their potential contribution to German society. It is time to do so, he would say.<br /><br />In summary, the most earth shaking fact about this book is that it was written by a high-ranking German politician, in the face of stifling German political correctness. The observations are well drawn and statistically supported, but nothing is new except their application within the context of Germany. His most original proposal is that university educated women have more children.  He is certainly not the first to recognize the need - Carle Zimmerman made the observation for the US in the 1930s - but he is one of the few to make the statement so boldly in the modern age. Bottom line, its greatest claim to being a great book is that it stirs an important discussion.olitical correctness.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|What can be said in praise of this movie that hasn't been said already?  I think the Disney/Pixar folks need to be commended for this package: Blu-ray Feature, Blu-ray Bonus Disc, DVD Feature and Digital Copy 7.1 DTS Master Audio all in one set for a decent price.  Blu-Ray fans need to vote with their wallets to show the industry that this is the expected, acceptable STANDARD - all Blu-ray releases need to be done this way.

1601251505|5.0|Until January, 2011, I had not played any pen-and-paper RPGs for about 5 years. The last one I had played was D&D v. 3.5. A friend asked me to join his Pathfinder group, and I did. The results have been great. I have really enjoyed Pathfinder as a game. I'll keep this review short for those who are newer to RPGs or who haven't played in a while.<br /><br />To someone coming off of a 5-year hiatus who had last played D&D 3.5, this book is wonderful! The system is built on 3.5, but the changes they have made only make the game better. I also like the way that magic items, combat rules, and virtually every rule you need, are included in this one volume. With this volume and the Bestiary for monsters, you're basically ready to go. This is a big improvement over 3.5 where you needed to purchase at least 3 volumes to get rolling. Another plus is the depth of the book. Although you can buy plenty of well-designed extra volumes, the Core Rulebook devotes extensive explanation to most topics.<br /><br />The only quasi-negative is that it's a lot of material to digest if you are new to RPGs. If that's your situation, I would suggest learning the game with someone so that you can get the basics down quickly and read the book between gaming sessions.

B00007KMOX|5.0|I've listened to many recordings of Beethoven's fifth, my favourite symphony of all time. To me, it is the perfect symphony; this is the perfect interpretation to go with the perfect symphony. Kleiber's interpretation is just right: electric, but never to the point where the interpretation distracts you from Beethoven's music. The VPO sound magnificent.    Be aware that there are two versions: the CD and the SACD. The SACD is the latest release - it is a hydrid, allowing you to play it on normal cd players and SACD players.    I first came across this recording during the top 100 symphony countdown in on ABC classic fm Australia. The recording was phenomenal: I've never heard beethoven's 5th sound like this. I HAD to buy a copy, and I wasn't disappointed.

1439102724|5.0|Reading Jodi's books is always a pleasure, but Sing You Home marks a giant step in her writing.  It would be easy enough to make this story all about politics and religion, but somehow I doubt that Jodi would--or could--treat such a human story so superficially, not when she can (and does!) delve deep into the human heart.  The characters in Sing You Home have endured tragedy and loss on an enormous level, one only the strongest people could survive.  They turn to religion, the law, and each other to try to combat the sorrow only to discover that they have more in common than they ever imagined.  Fairness isn't about winning, ultimately, it's all about giving and trust and selflessness.  My favorite character is Lucy, the troubled girl Zoe tries to reach through music, and goes so far as to put her self and her legal battle in jeopardy in order to connect with and help her. This is why Jodi is a great writer--she knows that the truly heart-rending story isn't about gender, legal issues, God, or any of that.  The true story belongs to Lucy.  It's all well and fine to fight for what you believe in (on both sides), but in the end what matters is the children we raise to inherit the cuckoo, complex, difficult world we live in.  Everything that happens in this book--miscarriages, alcoholism, divorce, same-sex relationships,legal battles--only happens so that we can peer into the life of a confused teenager in so much pain that she doesn't want to live, and discover how to make her want to live again.  I won't give a synopsis or spoil the reading experience for anyone here.  I believe that the journey Sing You Home takes you on should be private, intimate, a pact between the author and the reader.  But don't skip this book.  It's one of the best I've read this year, and I read a ton of books. Brava, Jodi.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|When I first heard this, I thought that it was okay.  But one day I went back and listened to it one more time and I was addicted.  This is an amazing album and collection songs.  The lyrics are incredible and you must listen closely to get some of the messages.  My favorite album in the last few years by far.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|my first logitech purchase was a trackball 5 years back, and that has not failed me yet. I still own it to this day and works great (the logitech sybol since worn off). So I am looking forward to this one once it arrives at my door. I will nit pick it at another time.
B004L49K20|5.0|I own the entire Duran Duran catalogue.  I am NOT in love with everything they've ever done.  I think \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" is vastly underrated.  That said, if you're cool with me, read on...    There is something instantly familiar about \\"All You Need Is Now\\", both the title track and the entire CD.  Duran Duran has grown up, for sure. They are still very attractive, but now they are men of a certain age.  Just like a 30th High School Reunion, there is a relaxed vibe here -- that everyone is exactly at the place they are comfortable being at.  That doesn't mean they got exactly where they wanted to go, nor that they settled.  But, they are at peace with who they've become.  Thankfully, Mark Ronson showed up at the perfect time to place his polished stamp of approval on it all.    (How phenomenal it would be if Mr. Ronson could go back and retool a CD like \\"Liberty\\", to scour out the Foreigner'ness of some of the sound and embolden it with DD's.)    In all the years I've been a fan, I'd never seen them live.  I recently got that opportunity.  What I've failed to notice during the course of my appreciation is that they are all very gifted musicians.  John Taylor really can tear up the bass in the style of the late Bernard Edwards (of Chic).  With Roger Taylor on drums, DD is all rhythm, Nick Rhodes' sweet synths and Simon LeBon's surprisingly awesome vocals.  Simon has mastered his gift over the decades and it is the signature to this band.    So, the '5 stars' are because the beginning, middle, and end all blend together for a completely enjoyable listen.  It's my hope that will all the touring they're doing for this effort, they will release a live version.  Duran Duran is embraceable again.  Spread the word.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Not for everyone, but for those who know what it is designed to do, this is the tool you are looking for.  Good work dev.
B002NOAF9W|4.0|The cd's are worth getting, if your a rolling stones fan, an some of those songs sounds like singing with jazz background on it.    But still its worth it, but the dvd is a waste, cuze it sucks.    4 stars because the dvd is a rip off.    I like both rolling stones an the beatles an yes I think both of those bands are alot better than all the sissy music today like LINKIN PARK, LADY GAGA, BRITNEY SPEARS, SLIPKNOT, etc.    I don't care for late 1990s newer bands till now.    an right now while i'm  writing this review I'm listening too the cd called big bang from rolling stones.    An I dont like most of todays main stream music. like jay z, akon, lady gaga, bone thugs & hamorny, slipknot n the rest off bull**** bands.

0670022411|5.0|One of life's greatest pleasures is finding a book that I just don't want to put down because it is so enthralling and engaging.  I LOVED this book!  If you are one of the \\"grown ups\\" who fell in love with the Twilight series, you'll love this book too.  The only problem with it is now I have to wait until 2012 for the sequel.
B001RH6L6C|5.0|I only saw a portion of this and it had me glued to the screen. I immediately had the thought to pick up a copy and now I can say from experience that it is really great! If you can let go of reality for a few hours you will really enjoy it.
0142001104|4.0|this book by Ben Zander is really inspiring, and the reason why I purchased this book is because I was impressed by one of his lectures he delivered at MIT during one of the classes at SLOAN I attended!
B004KA9MQO|5.0|I am listening to this album. I must say It's just as good as her debut album from 2008. This album is a remarkable step forward for one of the biggest and most talked-about stars to emerge in recet years. The songs were writtena and produced by today's all-star-line-up of the biggest talents in music. Intense and intimate, joyous and danceable, This album demonstrated the range and growth of her as an artist. It is a testament to music power to heal, and to the continuing maturity of a singer who is practically a household name, but still in the early stages of her career.
1401324029|5.0|Richard Castle 'Naked Heat' is fantastic. Wasn't able to out it down at all. Good plot line and the characters shine. I did perfer the previous one though, 'Heat Wave'.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|My husband had to have it after he saw me casting and reeling on the couch! It is challenging to figure out to cast and to get enough money to move on to the next levels. Good enough until summer gets here and we fish for real!
0679735909|2.0|Such a gorgeous cover, such an intriguing parallel-plot premise, so much critical praise and promise... but alas, after 170 pp. & 20 yrs., I had to abandon ship.  It wouldn't have been this hard but the book was a Christmas gift from one of my dearest friends, a librarian and avid reader, who called it her favorite book of the year (1990) and entered an inscription about how she hoped I would love the book as much as she had. Doubly disappointing that I couldn't hack a book she had adored so.      I'm a slow reader in the first place, so the snail's pace of \\"Possession,\\" was even more agonizing. Using an audio-book didn't help appreciably. Not that I don't commonly read long, involved books with multiple languages, dense layers of plot and multi-cultural &/or historical contexts--but this one just didn't move me.      To some, it might be seen as a literary tour-de-force.  Ms. Byatt's technical facility is clearly evident, but for me, the style was too over-the-top Rococo, too precious.  It's a literary flexing of muscles in which the panache is too obvious, too contrived, the details too florid.  One begins to feel pummeled by the proliferation of ornamentation at the expense of essence.  The plot languishs while the reader is left to wade through endless literary showpieces, like so much broken statuary littering the path.  The poetry was especially a drag.... zzzzzzzzz ...... very soporific book.     So, after 20 yrs., with great reluctance & sadness, I finally had to give up. But hey, for you insomniacs out there, \\"Possession\\" may be a great sleep aid!
0670022411|5.0|I BOUGHT THE FULL AUDIOBOOK (GREAT READER btw)AND HAVE ONLY 1 CD LEFT.  I DON'T WANT IT TO END. I THINK I'M GOING TO BUY IT IN HARDBACK SO I CAN READ IT TOO. I CAN'T INAGINE THIS STORY CAN BE WRAPPED UP IN ONLY A FEW MORE CHAPTERS AND I WILL BE FIRST IN LINE FOR THE NEXT BOOK.
B004NS710C|1.0|I knew this movie was bad before I was talked into watching it! I am a professional locomotive engineer, and this movie does not represent the way it is in the railroad industry. Hollywood got so much wrong on this one that I don't know where to begin. But 99% of what happened in the movie could not happen in real life. If you are a career railroader by profession, a rail buff, or a rail historian, don't even waste your time with this awful movie. What an insult to my intelligence!
1592401791|4.0|There is one thing indisputable, reading a book from someone somewhat inside the beatles is invaluable, even more invaluable than from a beatle themselves. Not being in the band allows for some politically incorrect comments and gives some needed distance.  Interestingly, both the 5 star and one star reviews are all correct in their comments, just differ by what the READER wanted to get out of the book or the READER'S preconceived notion or bias is.  Because the authors bias grated on my nerves, i plucked off one star. If you approach this book with an open mind, it is fantastic, if you approach it as a, for example, pro Lennon zealot, you can sit there and get pissed and overlook all the good information, information that only the author knows.    First the bad.     If you are a beatle fanatic of one beatle, likely you will be offended plenty from this book, with the possible exception of Macca fans.  It is somewhat like a 16 year old girl wannabe groupie writing the book.There seems to be an estimation of the actors involved in the book by Mr Emerick by how they treated him. He makes a big deal about how the beatles did not include him in their dinner/snack time. They didn't give him rides home. Whether they talked to him/how they talked to him/how nice they treated him. He even once talks about another EMI tech is pissed because the beatles did not offer to dine in studio with him, but HE (Emerick) understood (but he did not understand, lest he would stop bringing it up all the time. It was a professional relationship, not a highschool popularity contest with tons of money on the line. He seems to miss that. He wants to be good buddies and recognized for his genius by the beatles and all around him. Whoever talked to him most and in the most friendly terms, was a great musician.    He frequently gives himself a central role in saving the day on insurmountable problems while at times giving no credit elsewhere, or only peripherally.    Comments about others seem to be somewhat self-centered. If George Harrison told me off, he would still be one of the great guitarists in the world, not so with Geoff however.    According to Emerick: George Martin is so egotistical, he puts fellow employees in bad situations to elevate himself, he is a poor leader, he does not understand the beatles like Emerick does, he is not respected by the beatles, they do better without him on occassion, he is too old, he is manipulative, not decisive.     His fellow techies at EMI are measured by their ability to learn from him, at one point he essentially states someone is good because he learned how to do it by Geoff, and as long as he did not vary from that, he was OK.    Lennon is fraught with moodswings, unreasonable, unpredictable, drug ridden,petty,mean, and incapable of describing what he wants, the genius Emerick has to figure it out. He pretty much seems to have Lennon correctly, BUT at times he says he is disengaged, not contributing anymore, forgets things that are brought up, does not pay attention to details. At different times he characterizes John as not missing a thing (accidently erased tapes on yellow submarine by his assistant who, because he was not as good as Emerick, made a mistake, but Geoff saved the day again. Or John being a control freak wanting to dominate sessions.      Ringo is relegated to a pretty much non entity, non contributor, checker player, comic book reader, basically a simpleton who needed Paul to show him how to play the drums on tough parts.    Macca comes off as a genius and the one who could do no wrong. He did point out his overbearing ways which were, at times counter productive to the sessions, and his ego. However, contrasting to George Harrison, almost everything Paul did was genius, while even when George made a mistake and accidently/freakishly got a song, he would blow the lyrics, could not do simple guitar solos, or his song did \\"not fit\\" in with the album. This is so ridiculous when compared to several of Paul's songs out of synch with the album. It was almost like he wants more work from Macca and was overly stroking Paul's ego. Funny, if I was Paul, I would be insulted on how he bashed my friends. He (Paul) can have an opinion on the other beatles, but Geoff does not have this right! He wasn't there as John and Paul grew up and played hundreds of gigs in hamburg et al.    G. Harrison is treated the worst. He could do nothing right until the end of the book where he is given credit for writing songs on par with Lennon-Mccartney. Even when he said something positive about George, he would shoot it down with 2 negative comments. According to Geoff, he was truly the weak link, all their songs when Paul or John wanted 5 five days to work on it, they were perfectionists (except John who just wanted to irritate Paul) Harrison's repeats were because he was an inept guitarist, and Paul did not step in and do all his parts because he did not want to hurt his feelings. Right. I can't say enough about how he puts George down and how unequal his opinions are. My guess is George put him in his place at some time and Geoff has a bone to pick with the now dead artist who cannot defend himself. It is almost comical in the book that when Paul does something, it is hardwork, perfectionism, genius, when George does the same thing, it is due to lack of talent.    The Neutral. If someone did not insert their opinions and their feelings, it would not be much better than a writer who is regurgitating second hand info. All of us would like to rub elbows with greatness. Geoff is no different than any of us and he is at least honest on how he feels. Though I don't like his assessments all the time, I am glad he let us in on how he felt.  A dry book of facts it would be without the soul. I just wish he did not have such blinders on considering Harrison. It is clear that John and Paul made more money on their songs, wanted everyones best for days upon days, but had no patience to assist or put in effort if it was a Harrison song.    The good.     First, this is from someone who worked day in and out with these great artists from their first formal session to their last with some scheduling conflicts. It is from the perspective of an emotionally attached teenager in awe of what is going on. It is easy to relate to how he felt. He obviously contributed mightily to the atmosphere which was the beatles, including George Martin. Innovative and talented, the beatles music has his stamp on it.  Overall the best thing about this book is to read it along with the beatles library at hand. I have just became a beatles fan, recognizing their amazing talent. Many of the songs I had not heard or not much. As he would go through the album, the intricacies, the missed cords, the parts where everyone participated upon the finished product, I would listen to the tracks he was discussing. I loved the end of the Abbey Road album where the beatles all got together and each did a kind of dueling guitar solo. You can feel the chemistry and feel like you are in studio. I can see it everytime I hear that song now. Never noticed it before reading the book ALONG with listening to what he is describing. I ABSOLUTELY LISTEN TO THE SONGS DIFFERENTLY after hearing what went into the songs and have learned much new respect for several of the songs. It was extremely enjoyable to listen to the songs as he described what went into it. His memory for detail is amazing and his contribution again is nothing short of amazing.  His stories about the visitors, and some of the strange goings on were hilarious. He is quite funny in the telling of some of them.    Because this is from someone sitting in the studio while the group worked their magic, participated in shaping the sounds and what went into the recording, despite some of his biased opinionated comments, this book is informative,an invaluable unique read. Great to read along with the beatles music at hand.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Yes!! Finally the paid version of Angry Birds! Never thought this day would come.  GLADLY paid $0.99 for no ads.  Install without fear; it will carry your progress over.  Now we just need The Mighty Eagle....
B004SBS8LA|4.0|So I LOVE Angry Birds. Rio is not an update it is a whole new game with better interface, better graphics, and unique challenges in every phase. The game starts out a little easy to free captured birds compared to saving eggs in the original. You can complete a level easily but the *golden* items are harder to reach and accumulating points might come easy but getting all three stars is not. And be prepared to wait. I just completed the second phase and then it pops up that the 3rd on up are going to be released through the rest of 2011. May to November for the rest of the games. Guess I'll fight for those stars while I wait.
B004H4XJW6|5.0|It was  a cute movie, that after reviewing am satisfied my small grandchildren will be able to watch and enjoy.
B004QK5N5W|2.0|If you have an iPad 1 and if you do not have the VGA connector, then this is an ok, but overpriced, accessory. Ipad 1 will not mirror, as many others have stated. The quality of the output is disappointing. I compared the HDMI output in Netflix to the VGA output (I have both connectors) and the difference in quality is negligible. In fact, and you may not believe it, I actually think the Netflix output on the Wii to my 47\\" LCD flatscreen is better than either the HDMI or VGA output of the iPad 1. The only benefit is the pass through charging ability allowing you to watch while powering\charging. Shame on you Apple. You could have done better.
B000002AH7|4.0|My main problem is how unexpectedly LOUD it becomes at random, the trumpet being the usual culprit from what I remember.  I turn it up to hear the beautiful, elegant light sounds in the background, then BAM the horns comes in and makes me feel like my head got sawed in half horizontally from ear to ear (I dont say that euphemistically, at all).  I never thought the differences in volume among the parts would carry so much weight on an album, but it does at least on the recording I have.  There are definitely great parts to the album, and I get it out every now and then b/c the cultural richness + Miles Davis is certainly attractive.  The things I like about it, however, are more fully expressed in the electric/fusion era albums, which I listen to like there's no tomorrow.  Agharta, Pangaea, Dark Magus, Bitches Brew.
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|I don´t know why you say that it blue ray is 3D because it is not true! I was expecting to see in 3D and my son too, but it is not 3D.  I can´t return this items because I´m outside of USA I´m in Colombia.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This App is great.  It is easy to use, and allows access to my expanding Kindle library.  The program is laid out so it is easy to start using, and easy to sync your library.  Highly recommended for Kindle users to ensure you always have your favorite reading material close by.  You definitely want a good display though, like a Samsung Galaxy or HTC Evo, which have 4+ inch screens.  It makes it a lot easier on the eyes than a smaller display!
B00003CY5J|4.0|If you can just get past the \\"M.F.\\" all through the movie, I think you will really enjoy this.  It has a great plot and it is very suspenseful.  I don't particularly care for Marlon Brando, but even he is good the little he is in the movie.  DeNiro is his usual self---a very good actor and Edward Norton simply steals the entire movie in my opinion!  This is well worth watching, I promise!
0756404738|5.0|I read a lot of books especially of this type. From Robert Jordan to Joe Abercrombie. Patrick Rothfuss is right up there at the top. The Wise man's fear keeps you reading for hours because you can't put it down, you have to read one more chapter then another. I can hardly wait for the next book in the series.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I had originally thought I wouldn't like this game as much as the regular Angry Birds, but after playing it for sometime, I think it is just as good as the original.  I love the graphics on the Angry Bird games.  These are fairly simple games to play, but a great game to just pass some time by or get your mind off the day for a moment.  I have really enjoyed playing both on my smart phone.
B004GYY714|5.0|I'm not sure why, but I have tried just about every streaming radio app out there, and this is the only one I have found with has 101X (101.5 FM) from Austin, TX.  I'm just outside of the coverage area for the station, and miss it so much, I was happy to find an Android app which would let me hear it.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Eight of us got together to watch this last night, we were ages 23 to 75. This movie ROCKED.  It was SO funny, lots of great one liners.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i thought angry birds was fun this new game bets it hands down best angry bird one thing though i wish you could go though all level instead of waiting each month for a new set of levels
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Is 'hecka' actually a word?! Well, you get the point, I'm sure... definitely worth downloading... this is a great addition to the Angry Birds franchise... way to go Amazon for it being FREE for a little while!<br /><br />Droid X
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|A beautiful movie in every way possible that looks and sounds as good as possible, and with many informative behind the scenes extras.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|If you nick the heck out of a blade, this is OK for a 'first pass' at making the edge smooth again.  However, it is worthless for actually putting a sharp edge on the knife afterward, as the preset angle of the sharpener is at far too wide.  The little flip-out stick sharpener for serrated edges is semi-useful, although the coarse grit leaves a jagged edge which I don't like.  Overall, I don't use it.  I would have returned it if it was worth the trouble, but for less than $10 I didn't bother.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I love this movie and as a 26 year old mother to 2 girls I knew I had to get it for them.  Funny part about this movie is it made my 4 year old cry at the end.  In between sobs I heard \\"that was so beautiful\\"!
1892005034|4.0|This book is a wonderful read.I love the premise but the actual implementation is a little tricky! They have trainers available it would be better with more roll playing,but being able to communicate and really articulate what you want out of life or a conversation is so inspiring. If you can master this book you can enrich your life beyond your dreams!
B002ZG993Q|2.0|It is a remarkable achievement to make a movie about a professional assassin boring, and that is the most successful thing about this disjointed film. The entire first half of this movie appears absolutely pointless and unnecessary, with long scenes of Clooney doing pushups, sitting around killing time or walking around aimlessly. It's really a waste of time and film. The scenes are completely disconnected and there seems to be no plot at all. George Clooney plays a hit man who makes guns for other killers as a sideline. I guess contract killing doesn't pay as well as it used to. It's a tough economy, even for criminals. Throughout the movie, people keep trying to kill him, although we never find out why. Then suddenly, in the last half hour, the movie evolves into a love story. One minute he's telling a prostitute that he's not interested in having a conversation with her, he's only there for his pleasure, and the next minute he's planning to abandon his profession for her and run away together. We never see the transition, we're just supposed to take the director's word for it that it happens. That is a major theme in Anton Corbijn's direction, unfortunately.    All of the characters in the film seem stiff, and deliver dialog like they're reading it from a teleprompter(no acting required). Also deserving a mention is the weird, creepy priest character in this film, played by Paolo Bonacelli.  He is horribly miscast in this role, which is supposed to represent Clooney's conscience. But he seems much more like a pervert who dopes his victims with a date rape drug than a holy father. Think John Wayne Gacy with a thick accent.

B004CIIXC8|5.0|Fish Tank follows the trials and tribulations of Mia Williams, a teenage girl growing up in the seedy neighborhoods of Tilbury England. Mia has no friends and spends the majority of her time binge drinking in an abandoned apartment building while practicing her dance moves. Dancing is Mia's only means of expression and way to escape from her \\"family\\". Mia's mother finds her a inconvenience and a disappointment and doesn't mind expressing it every chance she gets while her little sister has the mouth or a drunken sailor and hates her guts. For Mia, growing up is hard.Though things seem hopeless some rays of hope break though in her life.     she enters a dance competition, she starts seeing a dim witted but nice young man and her mom starts dating a charismatic man named Conor. Conor is the kind of guy that women have trouble resisting. He's good looking, has a 1000 watt smile and most importantly for Mia and her mother, symbolizes change and hope. As Conor slowly establishes himself has the new man of the house, you get the feeling that the he's not everything he seems to be and the stability that he brings into their life maybe just too good to be true.     Fish Tank unravels slowly, but it does so in way that feels natural for the film. It's shot in a way that feels like you're watching a documentary or somehow in the room with the characters as events are unfolding. Fish Tank is beautiful in its simplicity and is a touching tale of a young woman who's every chance of happiness is taken from her. It's a film that may just break your heart.
B0019NG73G|4.0|Sheen's Robert E. Lee makes him look like a \\"Weeble\\" on a pony. You remember the child's toy...\\"Weebles Wobble but they don't fall down\\". His zombie-like performance and slovenly appearance do not fit the historical figure at all. Aside from the above and Ted Turner giving himself and Ken Burns embarrassing cameos, and some really \\"cheesy\\" beards throughout, the rest of the movie is quite good. Hollywood will never get it \\"right\\", but this is a noble effort.
B00280LYHS|5.0|There are plenty of other reviews that are going to give a synopsis of this book/ series,so I don't want to reinvent the wheel here:<br /><br />I began this series shortly after I received my Kindle for Christmas.  I downloaded each book as soon as the last word was read in the previous one. I have finally understood what it means to CONSUME a book.  OMGods,  this series was AMAZING.  I have always been fascinated by Greek Mythology, and Mr. Riordan has brought those characters to (believable) life.  I feel like I have known, and cared for Percy all my life and watched him grow up and mature throughout the series.  He is a very likable, believable preteen/teen who is dealing with pressures/issues of regular mortal teens, (ADHD, Dyslexia, stepparents, crushes on girls) but also learning that he is a demi-god son of Poseidon, and the pressure of fighting monsters, learning his prophecy and trying to understand his powers.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the way Mr. Riordan created characters, (even the evil ones), that you could picture in your mind as you felt that you were RIGHT THERE in the story traveling along with Percy.  I am very satisfied all around with the outcomes and feel they were very believable and made sense.... well, as much as they could in a Fantasy book.  Too many times when I have read a mystery or suspense book I am left with lingering questions, or a little disappointment in how conflicts were  resolved. In this last book of the series, there is just enough of a cliffhanger to make the reader curious and anticipate a continuation.<br /><br /> The only disappointment I feel is that the series is ended. As another reviewer wrote, that it was good that it ended where/when it did because it ended well, and if it would have went on, it would have stopped being good.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I can't believe this movie is 25 years old. The best thing about it, though, is that EVERY time I watch it, I laugh out loud. Very few movies have done that for me, and if I knew how to get in touch with Mr. Hanks, I would personally thank him.    Surrounded with a cast of characters that are every homeowners' repair nightmare, Hanks and Shelly Long attempt to revive a lemon of a mansion. The movie is worth every penny if just for \\"the kitchen scene\\" and \\"Tom on the scaffold\\".     I really don't want to give more away, than to assure all who might have not seen this gem, or, know Tom Hanks only as \\"Forrest Gump\\" or from \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\", that in the early and mid-eighties Hanks showed a comic genius streak that I wish he would try to retrieve once more.
1608191664|5.0|As with most books made to elucidate the inner workings of \\"free markets,\\" Conservatives and free market fundamentalists won't read this, and may react defensively to the title. Progressives like me on the other hand, find these titles alluring and the information confirming. Nonetheless, if you are looking to add to your arsenal to defend free market zealots, this is another arrow for your quiver.

0399250573|5.0|the final mission was a good book. it was emotional roller coaster ride.  The familar cast of characters. Alex is now 15 and he is threw with MI16. Scorpia is back and are going to use Alex to blackmail the british goverment. So they set a trap and Blunt falls for it. Alex is in his school looking older in the school drama and rowing club till one day a sniper tries to shoot him in his classroom at school.  He ends up going to a school in egypt with jack in tow. Smither's going with him. was a little disappointed in ending and will miss Alex. I have enjoyed the series.

B004M6BQ9W|4.0|I really expected this movie to be crapola. I wasn't going to watch it, but I did and I am glad. It was actually really good. It reminds me of Coyote Ugly a little bit, but in a weird Broadway way. Christina plays a seemingly young and innocent girl that needs money, and she ends up waitressing in an supposedly seedy establishment. By working there she becomes entranced with the show and fixated on becoming one of the dancers. She keeps pushing until Cher finally says \\"okay\\". It gets better from there with jealousy, sabotage, a love interest, and with Christina overcoming the obstacles.
B0041KKYEW|1.0|I was misled into thinking this film might be about ballet and Tchaikovsky. Well up to a point it is but if you think to watch it for the ballet or the music be warned. This is a psychological thriller with strong emphasis on sexual perversion, lesbian scenes, jealousy and murder. The dancing as far as it goes is terrible using cut and paste techniques rather like Invictus to disguise the fact that the actors are not dancers (or rugby players as in Invictus) and the arrangement of Tchaikovsky's immortal music is ghastly. I found this film most unappealing with no merits at all. If perversion and evil is your scene then you may like it but just be sure you are not giving it or showing it to a ballet lover.

B001OQCV2E|3.0|I have to say that this movie was alright not really spectacular but the effects were awesome and its kinda predictable about one guy finding out about the end of the world and the dates, then they take it to the government and they don't pay attention until it finally happens and the person who discovered the whole thing survives...Kinda like The Day After Tomorrow..But there was one thing that bothered me...they showed the problems of the other countries who were going through the Tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, snow, etc like in China but they never showed anyone from Africa...and then at the end they all go Africa like where the whole world started...i didn't like that, its kinda like they just threw that in there at the last minute. But anyway... it was average
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|This was a horrible movie. Anyone could have pulled off Angelinas role. Just pile on 10 lbs. of mascara and desinger dresses-there you have it. She just walked around like a peacock and had people admiring her as she passed by- I almost puked.<br />Johnny Depp must have taken this movie on a dare because he wasn't any better. This whole movie was a waste of film. If you are into watching Angelina walk around and not do anything (no lie) I mean nothing this movie is for you.<br />This was definitly a look at me ego movie.
0545101417|5.0|The topic is depressing, but Suzanne Collins writing kept our attention for many hours in the car.  We have bought all 3 CDs of the serious, and listened to them anxious to get back to the story after every car stop.  Young adult books can be more interesting than adult books when driving in the car.  The readers seem to vary their voices more and the story line moves. Generally, they are better for keeping Drivers alert and passengers entertained than many adult books.  We are huge Harry Potter CD fans too!
0545123283|5.0|This review took me longer to write than I thought it would. I kept producing a disjointed mess. I finally produced something I am happy with, but be warned. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS OF [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver (Wolves of Mercy Falls)]].<br /><br />SHIVER and LINGER are obviously lovely books. They have a distinctive, monochromatic papercut look. With SHIVER, I didn't think of it as much more than nice packaging. Reading LINGER with SHIVER in mind, I realized how thematically tight the Wolves of Mercy Falls books are.<br /><br />SHIVER is the winter book. Yes, it takes place toward the end of autumn, but it's all about winter coming. Thus, the blue. LINGER is the spring book, even though it takes place at the end of winter. As Cole says in his first appearance, \\"[S]pring had come too soon.\\"<br /><br />Spring frequently represents rebirth, or new life. Sam has been cured. Cole has been infected. Isabel must move forward without her brother, who she helped die. Grace must move forward with Sam, who gave up something she wished for desperately in order to be with her. Grace's parents must face the fact that their neglect has turned her into an autonomous being.<br /><br />None of them are prepared to deal.  Sam wants to remain a kid, not responsible for protecting the pack.  Cole wants to remain a wolf, ignoring the pressures of human thought.  Isabel doesn't want to acknowledge what she wants.  Grace wants to pretend she has everything she wants.  Grace's parents want to continue to pretend she's a well-behaved little girl.<br /><br />Chick Lit Teens quoted Maggie as saying Grace's parents felt like they could safely ignore her since \\"she's yet to set anything on fire.\\" But now she has set something on fire. She's sleeping with a boy, and that gets their goat. They know parents shouldn't let their child sleep with a boy. Yet it's still a transparently false attempt at parenting. They still barely police her. They also ignore the fact that Grace is clearly sick. For all the good parts of spring, there's still spring fever.<br /><br />And oh, are there good parts of spring.  Sam and Grace's relationship is incredibly sweet.  They're just so into each other.  I do maintain what I said in my review of SHIVER - they have lives outside of each other.  Sam once more works at the bookshop.  He gets into arguments with Cole.  Grace hangs out and bakes with Rachel.  She explores the woods with Isabel.  The bits narrated when they're apart do help to show off just how adorkable they act together.  Sam makes Grace a little less guarded and she makes him a little less earnest (to use Cole's word).<br /><br />As for Cole and Isabel, they make wonderful foils to Sam and Grace.  They are sarcastic and lustful and definitely not optimists.  I'd already gotten to like Isabel in SHIVER, but it took me awhile to warm up to Cole.  I think I did because in his own way, he's as earnest as Sam.  He's so definitive about what he likes and doesn't like in addition to being a sharp observer of people.  But Cole tries to blunt himself because he isn't one to take the truth lying down.<br /><br />I am so curious as to what [[ASIN:0545259088 Forever (Wolves of Mercy Falls, Book 3)]] will mean for these characters.  And you can trust Maggie Stiefvater to make a book about kissing and wolves meaningful.e's still spring fever.    And oh, are there good parts of spring.

B004I9TQLI|5.0|This is a great movie, very touching and heartwarming (up to a certain point), about a tough and ugly subject - concentration camps during World War II. A young boy whose father is a commander in the Army comes upon another little boy wearing striped pajamas inside a fenced compound. The boy thinks the people wearing pajamas are all farmers with glorious lives (as portrayed by the soldiers), not understanding what is really happening to these people. It's a sad and profound story through the eyes of a child about the consequences of war and what we choose when we alienate any group of people based upon race, religion, or creed.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 (I believe) for harsh theme, some violence.
0439023491|4.0|CATCHING FIRE begins awhile after THE HUNGER GAMES ends. Katniss has developed a new routine, providing for her and Gale's families with both her winnings and her hunting, as well as trying to bring more prosperity to District 12 by spreading her money around. But while Katniss would enjoy fading into obscurity, the world doesn't want to forget about her. So she receives a visit from the President, telling her to ramp up the silly-girl-in-love act while on tour with Peeta . . . or else.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins knows how to move a story along. She adds a bevy of new characters to those already established, but I never felt lost. I do feel worried that I'll never know the exact fate of some of these characters, which will probably make me think terrible things happened to them. The government is worried about rebellion, so it's a bad time to show any spark. And though Katniss tries to keep her head down, her actions keep igniting the people.<br /><br />I don't think I would like this series as much if it were from Peeta's point-of-view. I like Katniss's coldness. She's a good person, but she's also ruthless and practical. She lacks political savvy, but her other survival instincts are dead on. It would be very easy to hate Katniss from another POV, but it's hard not to sympathize with her while inside her head. Her own qualities also allow her to appreciate the qualities that make other Hunger Games survivors formidable, if sometimes unpleasant and dangerous.<br /><br />Collins is brilliant at humanizing her characters, even the ones that oppose the protagonists. However, their main opponent, President Snow, is somewhat disappointing. He's just evil, with no attempt at roundness. I want to know what makes him tick, since he's at the root of everything. I know Collins can deliver more with him, so I hope to see that in the conclusion.<br /><br />I also hope to see more of the rebellion. My main problem with Collins is I feel she has a tendency to take the easy way out.<br /><br />While CATCHING FIRE is a children's book, the violence might be a bit extreme for the under-ten crowd. Collins ramps it up even more, and some scenes even made me a little queasy - and believe me, I've read some sick stuff. The premise pretty much guarantees it's going to be a violent novel, but it never hurts to give an extra warning.<br /><br />Despite my quibbles, CATCHING FIRE is a wonderful book. I have no doubt that everyone who enjoyed THE HUNGER GAMES will find the sequel as engaging. I also encourage fans watch or read BATTLE ROYALE, which uses a similar premise but emphasizes different themes, particularly exploitation.<br /><br />From In Bed With Booksut.<br /><br />While CATCHING FIRE is a children's book, the violence might be a bit extreme for the under-ten crowd.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|I love all the Angry Birds! This one is probably my favorite, but I wish there were more bird variety. I really hate the red ones. They are so hard to work with.
0545123275|4.0|Sometimes (okay, all the time) I fall behind on my blog reading. While reading Renay's YA Fabulous, I came across the Rejectionist's review of SHIVER. The Rejectionist's main issue with the novel is Grace, who she terms an Enfeebled Heroine, a la Bella Swan. To wit, \\"Grace has literally no interests outside of her werewolf boyfriend and COOKING[.]\\" I can totally get behind being tired of Enfeebled Heroines. But did I see Grace as one?<br /><br />First, I love debating gender issues. My favorite show on TV right now is Dollhouse, which is fraught with gender issues. The setting is a high class brothel and the main characters are either high class prostitutes or pimps. There's an interesting blend of misogyny and feminism, the show getting some things oh-so-right and others oh-so-wrong. The stories are entertaining, but the discussions it engenders are the real treat: rich, combative, and multi-layered. What better tribute to a show that revels in perception, memory, and point of view? So when I normally don't address other's reviews, I thought The Rejectionist's was worth highlighting. It helped me think more critically about how I viewed Grace. And since some of the comments got nasty, I want ya'll to remember: both of our interpretations are correct, and neither of them are.<br /><br />SHIVER opens with Grace being attacked by (were)wolves. Her behavior is inexplicable. She doesn't stuggle or panic. She simply relaxes and lets it happen. It's a creepy and off-putting opening. Maggie Stiefvater lets the reason for her behavior unfold slowly, and never shoves it in the reader's face. Sam picks up on the wrongness, but chooses not to push the issue. It's a unique treatment of the subject, as most books that contain it can't help but shove it into the foreground. To me, it's the key to Grace's character.<br /><br />Grace is the victim of child abuse.<br /><br />Her parents don't hit her. They don't tell her she's stupid, or a slut. She's got food, clothes, and a warm house. But she's alone most of the day. Her parents ignore her. They don't relate to her. Shortly after the attack, her dad forgets her in the car and she ends up in the hospital. Yes, parents make mistakes. Parents who pay attention to their children don't forget they're in the car.<br /><br />Grace has grown up perceiving herself as unimportant. Before the attack, her only refuge was reading. She likes to do it outdoors, having developed a relationship with nature to replace the lack of human contact. After the attack, she focuses her attention on the wolves, particularly the one who saved her. The yellow eyed wolf saw her as important, something worth saving, which allows her to see herself as important. She has trouble making friends, but ends up with two close friends, one of whom shares her love of the wolves.<br /><br />Then, when a peer's death puts the wolves in danger, she risks her life by going into the wood when the hunters are out in order to help them. The wolves are her family in a way her parents aren't. Throughout the novel she wants to save Sam and his pack. She sometimes works harder to save the wolves than Sam. She works to find Jack Culpepper, whose behavior puts the pack at risk, and to find the cure.<br /><br />Let's count her interests other than Sam and cooking: reading, exploring nature, hanging with friends, saving the wolves. I think that's not bad for a teenager, particularly one in love. She's sometimes withdrawn and blank, but I saw that as a symptom of the abuse rather than a weakness of characterization.<br /><br />Now we come to the main thing I focused on while reading SHIVER, the thing that had me thinking, \\"I can't believe this was published by Scholastic! Squeaky clean Scholastic!\\" SHIVER is sexy. Stiefvater's BALLAD and LAMENT are sensual. SHIVER is sexy. Sam is the reticent one in the relationship, the one who knows he doesn't have much more time as a human. Grace is the one who knows what she wants and goes after it. She pursues her relationship with Sam ardently. She's the agressor in the relationship, the one who pushes things forward. That's not the usual portrayal of teen girls at all. Am I entirely sure it's healthy for a young, emotionally fragile girl to become deeply involved with a boy, especially a boy who may be forced to abandon her? Actually, I'm pretty sure it's not. But it makes for an intriguing romance, particularly when Grace and Sam both approach it maturely and find healing with each other. (Sam's issues are another essay.)<br /><br />I thought SHIVER was a sexy romance with an new style of werewolf and a supporting cast I looked forward to seeing more of. Grace was the understated center, working to save the wolves and become a normal girl, caught up in the newness of having her obsession obsessed with her when not even her parents thought she was worth thinking about. But I must admit, she doesn't kick anyone's ass. Then again, she's a bookworm junior in high school - not the type of person known for kicking ass and taking names.<br /><br />From In Bed With Bookse relationship, the one who pushes things forward.

I'm glad I listened to her, since Florence + the Machine now seems to pop up everywhere!<br /><br />Florence Welch's voice is simply incredible.  Best of all, it's set to songs with slightly off-beat lyrics that make me want to dance.  The songs vary in genre, but fit well together.  Despite the variety, Lungs feels like a cohesive whole.<br /><br />\\"Howl,\\" \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise it Up),\\" and \\"Girl with One Eye\\" are my favorites . . . at the moment.  It keeps changing.  None of the songs are losers; I often listen to the CD straight through.<br /><br />It's well worth buying the actual CD to hear the detail lost in the mp3 version.

0547258305|4.0|As a child, Lady Katsa killed her cousin when he reached out to her, because something in her feared his touch. Now, her uncle the King, uses her to intimidate his nobles - tourture and death are Katsa's trade. But she's tired of it, and working behind his back to do good deeds. This puts her in the path of Prince Po, a man Graced with fighting. Together, they attempt to solve the mystery of who kidnapped Po's grandfather and why.<br /><br />At first, it's hard to remember all the country names and positions. But soon enough Katsa and Po are on the road and things start moving quickly. Even with the page length, it's hard to imagine how much occurs in GRACELING. Kristin Cashore keeps the action and revelations flying fast and furious. And for those not into fight scenes, there's a wonderful romance between the oblivious Katsa and perceptive Po. (I also enjoyed the relationship between Katsa's cousin Prince Raffin and his assistant Bann. At least, I believe there's a relationship between them.)<br /><br />I enjoyed Cashore's characters. Katsa is somewhat atypical for a heroine, wanting neither marriage nor children. She makes a reasonable argument for not wanting either, but doesn't deny herself a relationship when the opportunity comes to make one work. Each of the surrounding characters have interesting personalities as well. The perceptive Bitterblue is a favorite of mine, so I'm happy that Cashore is hard at work on a novel about her.<br /><br />GRACELING explores prejudice, child abuse, and other dark subjects. But it does so while maintaining a light, adventurous tone. It gives weight to the reading while leaving it a fun experience. I certainly enjoyed the novel.<br /><br />From In Bed With Books
B001A50716|5.0|\\"Arizona Dream\\" is a quirky little movie (made in 1991, released in Europe in 1993, and not in the US until 1994) directed by Emir Kusturica that starred Johnny Depp in the early part of his career, alongside veterans Jerry Lewis and Faye Dunaway, and rising contemporaries Lili Taylor and Vincent Gallo.  The film had a very limited showing here in the States and for years went without an official US DVD release.  In 2010, Warner finally came out with a US release under their Archives label, but their version is the original VHS release that inexplicably edits out 21 minutes from the original theatrical version -- what a shame.  In contrast, the non-US region 0 release featured here includes the full 140-minute theater version, in 16:9 widescreen, and in English with optional subtitles.  In short, this is the version to get.    The movie itself features Johnny Depp as a young man named Axel who is working for the Department of Fish and Game in New York Harbor tagging fish, but seems to yearn for some greater understanding of the world and people.  His cousin Paul, played by Vincent Gallo, tricks him into paying a visit to Arizona to be the best man at the wedding of his uncle Leo, who raised him.  Axel is briefly pursuaded to work in the showroom of his uncle's Cadillac lot, but is soon captivated by a visit from  eccentric mother Elaine (Dunaway) and her daughter Grace (Taylor), and goes off to stay in their house in the desert.  The rest of the film follows Axel's romance with the older Elaine, who longs to become untethered to the world with dreams of flying, and their mutual involvement in a love triangle of sorts with Grace, who herself dreams of and repeatedly attempts suicide.  Axel tirelessly builds flying machines to help Elaine, Grace sabotages them (needlessly so, since they never work), Leo tries to rescue Axel away from them, and as Elaine becomes ever-more unhinged, Axel finds his affection transitioning from Elaine to Grace.      The overall tone is both tragic, as the characters struggle to understand and are thwarted in realizing their respective dreams, and absurdly comic, in their misguided efforts to do so.  The entire film has a dream-like quality, as people sometimes find themselves levitating and Axel continues to see a flying flounder from his dream about an eskimo family depicted at the start of the movie (the film also bears the subtitle, \\"The Arrowtooth Waltz,\\" named for the Arrowtooth flounder... I only wish I could get past Kusturica having the flounder flying vertically, rather than correctly on its side as a flatfish), and there are recurring dramatizations of this dream in which Lewis and Depp take on the roles.  Unquestionably an indie-arthouse flick, the quirkiness of the movie's characters allow the actors to shine -- Dunaway, in a performance that she would later infamously claim was \\"brilliant,\\" IS brilliant; Lewis renders an understated display of his comedic chops; Gallo gives hilarious performances renacting scenes from Raging Bull, North by Northwest, and the Godfather; Taylor is excellent as always; and Depp is wonderfully reined-in, reminscent of his role in \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\"  There's also a cute self-referential moment when Gallo mentions Johnny Depp, with Depp sitting quietly and unphased in the background.    I don't know what 21 minutes the Warner edition edited out, but if any of this sounds like your thing (or if, like me, you saw the movie when it first came out and were dying to revisit it), you'll want this full-length version.  It's an unassuming, quirky, imperfect, little masterpiece of filmmaking.

Instead of using real quotation marks and apostrophes, they use inch marks and foot marks. It looks terrible. The margins are tiny and the text is packed onto every page, making the book only 253 long, hard to read pages (when properly set it should be at least 350 pages). Yes to Jane Austen, no to Tribeca Books, who basically are just ripping off a public domain book and typesetting it horribly.

160024842X|3.0|I read THE LOVELY BONES in the ninth grade and loved it. I picked it up because I knew it was getting a lot of buzz and felt it deserved it once I was done. I enjoyed seeing the world through Susie's eyes, as her family dealt with her death and her killer seemed to escape justice. I have not read it since, so I remembered little about the details of the story when listening to the audiobook, but they came back quickly.<br /><br />As for audiobooks, this is my second one. They seem popular, but I'm still not sure they're for me. For one thing, it takes longer to listen to the book than it would for me to just pick it up and read it. I listened to THE LOVELY BONES in my car, driving from my apartment to my home and back, but I kept missing little snippets when something happening on the road took my attention from Alice Sebold's voice.<br /><br />As for this audiobook in particular, I have a love/hate relationship with Sebold's narration. She's rather dull. No effort to distinguish between the voices of different characters or to add emphasis to dramatic parts. On the other hand, her lulling voice makes the worst parts of THE LOVELY BONES that much more horrifying. I felt like crying as her family realized Susie was truly dead with the discovery of her hand-knit winter hat, soaked in her saliva - her mother's love aiding her murderer. It's a scene already wrenching in print, but Sebold's flat, emotionless voice makes it more thematically naturalistic.<br /><br />However, the aural presentation slows the novel to a glacial pace. I remember the digressions being charming in the text, fleshing Susie and her world out. It fit the narration of a young girl, that she would be somewhat flighty and need to explain little bits of the story to explain the whole thing. It also fit with the idea of a dead narrator, one who has all the time in the world to tell her story and has lived her life - all she has to tell is her past and what others do, necessitating that the two weave together. I remember Susie's death happening so quickly. In the book, she warns you what will happen in the opening lines and her brutal rape and murder is complete by the first chapter. You've been put through the emotional wringer before the book truly begins. In audio format, this takes around 20-30 minutes. The digressions became distracting, making me think, \\"Is she dead yet?\\"<br /><br />THE LOVELY BONES is a great story, and I look forward to seeing the movie. But I must recommend the book version over the audiobook. Perhaps the story would've been better served in this format by an abridgment or a different narrator.

Unquestionably an indie-arthouse flick, the quirkiness of the movie's characters allow the actors to shine -- Dunaway, in a performance that she would later infamously claim was \\"brilliant,\\" IS brilliant; Lewis renders an understated display of his comedic chops; Gallo gives hilarious performances renacting scenes from Raging Bull, North by Northwest, and the Godfather; Taylor is excellent as always; and Depp is wonderfully reined-in, reminscent of his role in \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\" There's also a cute self-referential moment when Gallo mentions Johnny Depp, with Depp sitting quietly and unphased in the background.<br /><br />I don't know what 21 minutes the Warner edition edited out, but if any of this sounds like your thing (or if, like me, you saw the movie when it first came out and were dying to revisit it), you'll want to find one of the full-length versions. It's an unassuming, quirky, imperfect, little masterpiece of filmmaking.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Truly amazing game, this is easily the best $2 I have ever spent on an application. The developer updates it constantly, and is easily reached on the forums.  Immense depth and bug free.  BUY THIS APP!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|There should be support for reading books download from another source, as well as the ability to use a local dictionary (e.g. ColorDict). The ability to add support for lookup in user defined wikis would be great too.    Highlighting text spanning more than one page can be difficult or impossible.  Regarding selection of text, is being able to copy a sentence no more than a few times a day such a problem for publishers? This would be useful for quoting books.   Otherwise this app is the best reader I've used, though the first point makes it necessary to have another reader installed.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I have been playing video game consoles of all types for years. Lately the PS3 is my console of choice. Let me tell you that unless you have a home theater 7 channel surround sound cranked up you cannot believe what is really on the soundtracks of your games. You hear footsteps coming close. Guns being reloaded nearby. Monsters breathing around a corner. On games like Burnout Paradise when you drive by a construction area you can hear air compressors running and other noises from the area. Sounds i never heard on a blutooth or some other headsets- both USB wired and wireless. You can control the sound independantly for soundtrack and in game chat with other players. bass boost and stereo expander. Very comfortable after a 10 hour session. OH- it also works on the xbox 360.
B003MPHQRK|5.0|If your house is like mine, Someone plays videogames... Actually everyone plays games. Our whole family loves the Xbox Kinect and the Nintendo Wii, but the Playstation 3 is pretty much where the \\"adults\\" go to play. The serious games are there and so is my wife. On her downtime from work she plops herself on he couch and watches movies or plays Final Fantasy XIII. Lately she's gotten addicted to the Xbox 360 live games but that's because she says she can stop any time due to them being puzzle games with no plot. So why doesn't she?       Well, back to the point of this. I noticed the Assassins Creed theme on the ps3 changed to a FFXIII theme.  Also, on the Xbox, her avatar still physically looks like her (Tiny, skinny, glasses, black hair) but it's wearing a Vanille outfit and her quote changed to \\"Hi, I'm Vanilla-Val\\". A hint I think!       I ordered this as kind of a joke gift, but after seeing it the joke was on me. It is fantastic! Beautifully detailed and very poseable.        It doesn't feel fragile, although her wand-sticky-thingie fell apart at the glued joint(fixed with a new drop of superglue), the rest of the doll is solid and durable.       The articulation joints don't stand out like they do on most action figures. They are visible, like in the knees, but they aren't distracting from the overall look like they do on most collectible figures.       Again, the detail is amazing and even when our four year old got his hands on it, Vanille didn't break or lose color chips, much to the relief of my wife!       The stand it comes with is well articulated but pretty crappy. It's designed to not be seen, just give support. Vanille doesn't really need it because she is well balanced and poseable enough to stand on her own, but I'd use it anyway.       Haven't found a need for the additional hands. its either slightly open hands or slightly less open hands. Kinda useless. Also, her other weapon needs to be strapped on her back, looks silly without it.So, yes my wife broke open the box, and that means means the collector value can go up a tiny bit for those sealed ones that will never be opened. Who buy toys to sit on shelves in boxes? I never understood that but to each his or her own. My wife has sealed collector barbies like that and it drives me crazy. She says this isn't a barbie though, and should be taken out and posed and admired.        Bottom line, the most hated character on Final Fantasy XIII is the best action figure. The entire series has this level of detail but Vanille really stands out with her bright colors, slight smile, and posability. At the comic store there was a Lightning and a Snow on display but they seemed stiff, less poseable, and slightly grumpy.        I am not a fan of FFXIII. I can't wrap my brain around the gameplay or the weird character and weapon upgrades, and I think this chapter in the series was truly aimed towards gamergirls. But my wife loves it. The shame of it is that, like most Final Fantasy characters, they have one game and thats it. We already know what a waste that is, but we also how a sequel can be terrible.
B00001W9G0|4.0|White bread WASP boy Robert Redford meets left-wing Jewish girl Barbara Streisand during the heady days leading up to, encompassing, and following World War II.  Their initial romance is rather sweet.  Streisand's character has had a crush on Redford's since college days--as Redford's guy is not only a goyishe Adonis, but an effortlessly brilliant writer to boot!  I loved the hilarious scene where she hustles her drunken crush into bed!  Their courtship proves fun and full of heartfelt emotions, but their ensuing marriage a complete disaster.  I was unable to feel sympathy for the girl once they were married--she was a complete nag!  No matter what he did, this poor schmuck just couldn't make this girl happy and find some way to lasso the moon in such a way as to complete her socialist utopia.  Geez Lady--you should have found some way to give this poor guy a break!
B002ZG976U|4.0|From my wife Sarah: If I could, I'd give this movie 3 1/2 stars. Still, if you like musicals, Cher or Christina Aguilera, this movie is definitely worth viewing. While there are some serious flaws with this movie, it's got some great points.<br /><br />The theme: A small town waitress with no family or prospects leaves for Hollywood and lands a waitress job in a burlesque style club. She fights her way into the show. The club is in danger of closing since it's balloon payment mortgage is about to come due.<br /><br />Here's the good and the bad.<br /><br />GOOD POINTS:<br /><br />1. The music sequences are extremely well done. The visuals are beautiful. The dancers are fantastic. The dancing is almost a cross between Bob Fosse style and the old movie Cabaret - but more modern and more sensual.<br /><br />2. The singing was fantastic. No one can doubt that Christina Aguilera can bat it out of the park when she sings. And Cher fans will love her two musical numbers.<br /><br />2. Cher can act. I've always been a fan of her movies. She has the best developed character in the movie. Her friendship with Stanly Tucci's character was believable and sincere. She's always a pleasure to watch. She can take a shallow script and add depth to it just by her expressions.<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD:<br /><br />1. The theme is simplistic and it's been done before - for decades - with variations but always pretty much the same. The story was very tired.<br /><br />2. The script was basically shallow. Christina's character was shallow. The decisions she made were unbelievable because there was no depth to her character or her relationships.<br /><br />Her love interest was shallow. There was just about no chemistry between them. No heat, and no longing. They came off as superficial pals. It seemed to be a very immature relationship. It was hard to care about whether they ended up together.<br /><br />Christina's relationship with Cher was shallow. It was supposed to look like mother/daughter bonding. It was necessary to explain some of Christina's actions. It didn't work so it made other things seem unbelievable.<br /><br />3. The music though incredibly well performed, won't leave most people humming or singing the songs. Others may feel differently, but for me there were no numbers that were particularly memorable such as in some of the great musicals like Chicago.<br /><br />Despite all of the above, I'd still recommend watching this movie if you love musicals, Cher or Christina. I'd just rent it before deciding to buy.<br /><br />Moms and dads, please note that this movie is not for kids. The dancing and costumes are far too sensual for them. Also, though sex isn't explicit, it's implied between various partners of multiple orientations, several times throughout the movie. There's also a dancer who is alcoholic, and all the dancers and leads drink pretty much constantly, including doing shots a lot.ns. It didn't work so it made other things seem unbelievable.       3.

0143038419|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  This is the first book of hers that I have read and I feel she is a good writer.  Self absorbed? Well, that's what the whole ride was about. But, in my opinion her sense of humor(self-sarcasm) keeps the book balanced.  There is a feeling that she is on a quest to better herself and I think that created for me an open mindedness for her journey and what she was trying to achieve ... that is until Bali.  Heck, she didn't even contact the man she planned to study under before she got there.  I think when she got to Bali she just went with the flow and took a vacation.  Eat, Pray and Party? She gave you the impression, from the failure of her marriage and subsequent affair, that she wanted to learn how to she could \\"love successfully\\", and hence the LOVE destination.  I didn't feel like she ever got to her destination.  It sounds like she finally addresses this in the new book \\"Committed\\".

B0042816YK|5.0|I read through some of the other reviews, but I absolutely loved this movie! (I love movies based on true stories.) I'm sure a great deal was missing and to really get the full picture you needed to read the book. But I would recommend this to any woman who is in her 40's (even 30's) that has experienced life and different relationships. The characters in this were truly believable. I hate to stereotype, but the \\"want-a-be\\" actor she gets mixed up with and thinks she is love with was so dead on. Her explanation / analysis in front of an audience of this kind of love was truly believable. (Think about people in your own life who have ended a realtionship and jumped right into another one without taking time to heal, etc.) I tend to be an extremely giving person and I did not look at this from the angle of her being a selfish human being. Why? Well a two hour movie is not going to give you the complete picture without reading the book.     The movie doesn't really develop her relationship gone sour with her husband and I would hope the book explained / had more detail on this. I wasn't making an assumption this non christian suddendly decides as her last resort sto pray to God (it was very apparent she lacked this in her life) for help and then tell her husband it's over. There is always alot more to a story. My guage was that the movie picked up pretty much at the end of a relationship and that the main character was not willing to work on it. Once again we are missing the \\"rest of the story\\". So you have to pick up her journey from there.     Talk about courage. Imagine, as she stated in the movie, she has always been in a realtionship with someone since 15 and now she is not in any relationship and completely leaving her comfort zone. She's not moving to another state - she is leaving the country!! Everyone she knows, everyday surroundings, all of it! Think about taking that kind of a risk in todays world as a single female. And along this journey they portrayed that she met some truly good people Vs. those trying to harm. Talk about luck and finding goodness in others. Once again the movie portrays the more sunshine piece of this and not the difficult / pissy situations she encountered by going to 3 different places she was not familiar with. Imagine having a great time in Italy, being happy and then uprooting yourself to India with no guarantees of any sort. (If you want to analzye it here is this needy person who was looking for anyone to fulfill what was missing from her life and now she is on a quest to find peace within herself that doesn't necessarily equate to being with someone. Here was a dependent person who now is independent. That is a leap).       This movie conveyed a sense of real people with real emotions. I cried when the character from Texas finally opened up to her and explained why he needed to forgive himself. And I have no doubt that he truly gave her the nickname \\"Groceries\\". It was brilliant when her ex-husband to be conveyed to her that he had no idea what her issues were. Pathetic yes from the standpoint that people fail to truly communicate with each other in life. The characters in this were believable. Even the Brazilian gentleman she meets. I would bet  it was true that this guy was hurt so badly by his ex-wife that he hadn't given his heart to anyone in almost 10 years.    Sure based on some of the reviews not everyone will like this movie. But it you have taken chances in life and moved from your comfort zone you may have a totally different reaction to this movie and a different level of interpretation. In closing another interpretation - I was so very disappointed years ago when I finally watched \\"The Way We Were\\" with Barbara Streistand. I did not think it was a love story at all. I saw this woman who continually gave to someone and so desperately wanted their love and they would never love her the same. When it was over I couldn't believe this movie was ever hyped as a love story. Maybe one sided. Food for thought -  when you read reviews please remember everyone has their own opinions / interpretations based on their own life experiences. Read more than one review before you make a decision.    When this movie was over I was reminded of how grateful I am for what I have in my life and the good people I have met along the way. And how fortunate I was that I had found true love.
B002ZG976U|5.0|.  Saw this 10+ times in the theater. Cher looks fab ! ! ! She and Christina are awesome performers.    Movie moves very well with 1-2 slow spots. Fun without being too cheesy.

I still watch it at least once a week.

B0009GV9LO|5.0|Do NOT be fooled by its date for the setting and performers are timeless! The story of TOSCA is the on going story of the inconsistencies of abusive governments that are systematically designed to impose fear on its citizens; a story still true today. Marton, as always, moves the audience with her fire, play and tenderness consistently found in her voice that reflects her countenance. Together with Aragall on the stage of the Verona ruins this marriage of voices and acting talents cannot help but transport the viewer into their dilemma. Two artists, one of voice, the other of paint, fall in love under the oppressive ruling control of Scarpia; truly a dastardly villain who seeks only the conquest in Tosca with the support of the church. As her lover lends his support to a friend of the Napoleon overthrown Tosca is thrown into compromise. Puccini masterfully weaves the emotionally distraught moments of these desperate lovers while Marton and Aragall provide a TEN STAR performance in honor of Puccini as well as their audience. It was this opera that inspired my writings.  Find emotion in books as well, for books are the transportation system that stimulates our imaginations; currently abandoned children within:  [[ASIN:1453887229 Hear the Calliope: A sentimental journey on the Earth Ride]]  [[ASIN:1453869328 Legacy: Let the games begin (Volume 2)]]  [[ASIN:1456303600 Reason Void of Reason: Spirituality Honeymoon Style (Volume 3)]]  [[ASIN:1456392050 BREATHE: Noumenon (Volume 4)]]

B000FFJYCU|5.0|As a fan of car racing sports, and especially Formula One, this 1966 leading-  technology Film by the late (\\"Great\\") Director John Frankenheimer has no equal.   Filmed almost 50 years ago in Super-Cinerama and with 70mm Panavision wide-film,   this was the FIRST movie to put you in the driver's seat using special cameras   affixed to the cars. Today this is common practice in NASCAR, INDY Cars or F.1, but   in 1966 this was a REAL REVOLUTION. Take a seat, fasten your seat belts and prepare   yourself for a ride in Monaco (Montecarlo), Spa (Belgium) and Monza (Italy)   speedways. Classic 1960's Formula One. Unforgettable !!!

I have had my case for almost 2 months and its pretty beat up under daily use. I wear it less oftn than I would like to because its soft and can't stand a lot of wear anymore.

She likes to make the different animal noises and point out the eyes and tails and so forth.  I'm sure eventually we will get to the text!<br />However, I'm disappointed that the text has been moved.  It used to be a picture of a brown bear with the words \\"Brown bear, brown bear what do you see?\\"  Then you would flip the page to a red bird and the text would be \\"I see a red bird looking at me.  Red bird, red bird, what do you see?\\"  And so forth throughout the book.  Now the fist page says \\"Brown bear, brown bear what do you see?  I see a red bird looking at me.\\"  Then you flip the page to see a red bird.  Reading the other review here on Amazon I can see I'm not the only person that bothers.  L.

Chloe M. is great, maybe a bit sweeter and more likeable than Eli, but also far more vicious. The juxtaposition of the bond between the Owen and Abby and the violence is more pronounced, and I like that. In any case, as far as remakes go, this one is stellar.

0553386794|3.0|With the production of the much-anticipated HBO series, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a novel that is definitely coming into its own.  Whether that is a \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" thing remains to be seen, and I have the impression that the series might just be better than the book.<br /><br />I am not going to rehash the plot or characters.  Over 1,000 reviews cover that territory and well.  Suffice it to say, Martin does little original work here.  The characters are familiar archetypes through and through, the dialogue is often tinny and predictable, and he has a very irritating tendency to repeat words and phrases needlessly.  If I read \\"milk of the poppy\\" or \\"Knight of Flowers\\" once, I read it a thousand times.  And his proliferation of lords and ladies both great and petty with endless descriptions of their heraldry makes one wonder if anyone besides nobility lives in Westeros.  Further, the most casual glance at any good history book will quickly reveal where he found much of his inspiration.  The Dothraki are Central Asian nomads, the Lannisters the rough equivalent of the Borgias, the Greyjoys the Vikings, just to name three.<br /><br />So, if all of this criticism is accurate, why three stars?  Simple.  \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a fun read, overall.  It has enough regal plotting and counter-plotting to satisfy any armchair Machiavelli, enough action to engage interest, and - let's face it - who doesn't enjoy a good melodrama from time to time, just an old fashioned yarn to pass the hours?  And a couple of the characters with literary roots like Tyrion Lannister (Poe's \\"Hopfrog\\") and Jon Snow (a kind of sword-swinging \\"Pip\\" from \\"Great Expectations\\") do have moments where they rise above the writing to assume a kind of memorability.  Further, those scenes with the \\"Black Brothers\\" of the Night Watch manning their \\"Wall\\" against an evil menace from the north are quite well done and stand out well in sharp contrast to the cavalcade of jaw dropping political sometime-idiots populating more habitable climes in this fantasy world.<br /><br />I do have to applaud one thing, though.  Martin is faithful to an accurate Middle Ages morality where \\"true knights\\" were an idyll, the reality usually something far more earthy and far more ugly and brutal.  He also does not allow any of his characters to be \\"Galahad,\\" at least not without many moral failings along the way and conflicts of conscience which come off as entirely credible.  And this is refreshing indeed.  If anything makes a \\"A Game of Thrones\\" stand out from its genre, it is the author's absolute refusal to indulge \\"happily ever afters,\\" \\"good beats evil every time\\" or cheesy \\"Deus ex Machina\\" tricks.  And to that, I say - \\"Well done.\\"  Mediaeval life for highborn and lowborn, even wrenched into a fantasy genre, was a generally nasty affair, and Martin sees and writes it as it generally was without so much as a flinch.<br /><br />If you are a fan of what many would call \\"serious\\" fantasy, like Tolkien or Howard, you might want to check \\"A Game of Thrones\\" out of the library to see if it whets your appetite.

He skips town on his bail and doesn't make his court date which sets in place a series of events that would culminate in their house beign taken away.  Ree sets out to find her dad and bring him back--which in turn sets in motion significant violence from parties who do not wish him to be found.<br /><br />What is so great about this movie is the way it depicts abject poverty, the relationship between a daughter and her siblings, mother, and a cadre of down and out and addicted relatives and friends.  Ree is forced to be tougher than she really wants to be both in language and appearence.  The most poignant moment in the movie was when she sat with her mom who could not or would not answer her and said \\"Mom--tell me what to do.

B00447G2PM|5.0|I've purchased a few 3D movies and careful of what I purchase because of the high prices.   The 3D was a great experience.  I use this as a demonstration for 3D because of the vivid color and great depth both inward and outward of this documentary.  So far I've purchased Polar Express (again great 3D) Coroline (another good 3D) Open Season, and I have Monsters and aliens which came with my Samsung 3D glasses.  Monsters and aliens was again a great 3D effect.  The future of 3D may advance technologically but I am quite happy with what is out there NOW, and enjoying it all the time.

0756404738|5.0|It took me four days to read Part 1 of Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicles. Part 2 was read from start to finish in one long marathon, not pausing to eat or use the bathroom. I realize it must have taken the author a very long time to write this story and I almost feel badly finishing it in one sitting, like chugging a bottle of very old, fine red wine, but the story was simply too irresistible to put down. I suspect many readers of the first book liked it for its faint blend of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, but Book 2 made any allusions to those stories look more like illusions. Kvothe as the anti-hero is much more refreshing than Potter, who everyone always knew would do the right thing. Kvothe is also much more than Bilbo or Frodo, who always had the help of a great wizard on their side. In many ways, Kvothe's story could be Gandalf's origin-fable, had Tolkien had the inclination to write it. And Bast is more like a violent version of Tom Bombadil (I'm sure we'll hear more of Bast in Book 3). Finally, the tension between Kvothe and Denna rounds out the story for me; not in its romance but in its non-romance.   Having read the first two installments of Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicles, I realize I am in the hands of a master storyteller; one I hope won't lose the thread. I feel sure that he won't, since Book 2 was infinitely better than Book 1 (and Book 1 was amazing!), but I can't help think of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, and how badly it went after the third book. Tehlu help us all, I'm hooked!
B000002MUW|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums by Madonna, and by anyone really. 10/11 songs are 5 stars. I only think the Don't Stop song is o.k. I really like Sanctuary, Survival, Secret, & Forbidden Love. Those songs are the best songs ever to be recorded by her. (IMO). I picked up Madonna after Lady Gaga came on the scene. At first LG reminded me of Gwen Stefani, but as time progressed she reminded of Madonna, and so I decided to pick up Madonna albums since she was/is the \\"original.\\" I'm really happy I did, and this one is one of her best. If you like Madonna or just like some of her songs, then you need this album.
0061906220|5.0|I went to Grandparents Day at my grandson's school, he is in Kindergarden.  Grandparents are invited to visit their grandchildren during their library time.  During that time a teacher from another class comes in and reads a book.  A fourth grade teacher and three of her students read \\"Pete the Cat - I Love My White Shoes\\" to our group, they did a fantastic job.  I loved the book so much that I went home and immedately ordered the book.

B004J4WQ46|5.0|This is by far the album I have been most anticipating for the past 5 years, and it did not disappoint. In my opinion, this is the first album the strokes have come out with that can appeal to the masses. It is a little bit more pop than the previous albums, but the strokes' sound remains exquisite. Although it is not my favorite album by the band, it is definitely a fun album and a must buy for any music fan. The only downer is the fact that they are now looking to cater to the masses, which means  bye bye small awesome venue and hello packed stadium. For the old school fans it is bittersweet, but obviously inevitable. You cannot keep such an incredible band trapped in one scene. These guys definitely should be global, and they will be after this album, Hopefully they give us another dose before 2016.<br /><br />ps. If you haven't already, check out their solo projects. Albert's band, Jules solo work, fab's little joy and Nikolai's Nickel Eye all came out with stellar albums in the last 5 years. Enjoy!
B002G1YPH0|2.0|Just plain too big. My Antec 300 case is plenty big for most coolers, but this one is just too big and obtrusive.  Ended up using the OEM cooler.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album has what every pop album needs, extremely high energy with substance lyrics. This is my favorite pop album in history! I love every song and the energy it brings. Every song actually means something and the artwork, the cd cover, and cd artwork, and etc., just makes this a perfect album. There were no standout tracks because I love every song from \\"Hung Up\\" to \\"Like it or Not.\\" I was not a Madonna fan because I'm a \\"straight black guy,\\" but after this album, IDC about any ridicule I receive from anyone, because I'm going to listen to Madonna no matter what. 5STARS MADONNA!
B002ZG976U|5.0|completely satisfied
0439023513|5.0|Loved this book and the entire series.  A must-read for all over age 13.  I bought the book to read and give to my grandson.  My daughter loved it as much as I did.  Grandson hasn't read it yet.  Books are so exciting you have trouble putting them down!
B004HYGF18|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album. Albeit a little bit expensive for an 11 track cd, it makes up for it because every song on the album is great. A real bang for your buck! Enjoy!

1594133379|5.0|This is a fascinating account of a young woman's journey through a devastating stroke, her experience with the medical system and with people's responses to her, as well as her efforts and plan to regain her life. Very inspiring and supportive for care givers and for those who have had a stroke. What I as a care giver liked was her description of treatment given to stroke victims that was not useful, too quickly paced or demeaning. I was grateful to get the \\"Forty things\\" she \\"needed most.\\" This is well worth the price for everyone, especially for understanding the way the two sides of the brain work. Enjoy.
0439023491|5.0|Fantastic book! I would recommend it to anyone over age 13.  I read it and gave it to my daughter who read it and loved it.  She gave it to her 14-year old son to read.  Grandma and daughter loved the entire series.  Grandson is too busy with hand-held technologies to read it yet!  Can't wait till the movie comes out.<br /><br />Book was of high quality.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Better than the original. Good variety of new additions. Can't wait for new levels. Would have liked to use the blue bird more. Monkeys are not too nice
0061537969|5.0|This is by far, one of the best books I have ever read. You instantly fall in love with the narrator, Enzo, and his ability to be so human-like and so dog-like at the same time. I especially liked how Enzo communicated with Denny, Zoe and Eve. He had his own special relationship with each of them. There are some wonderful one-liners in the story that you will find yourself re-reading, because they are so powerful. I am currently reading this book for the second time, and I think I may be enjoying it even more this time.   Don't pass this book up. You will really enjoy it(but have some tissues handy)!
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Heading up a group of mercenaries called The Expendables, Barney Ross (Stallone) goes to a South American island called Vilena to help rid it of a corrupt general and the former CIA operative who manipulates and finances him.<br /><br />From the outset this film has plenty of guns, explosions and fights and the other mercenaries, played by Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Randy Couture, more than hold up their own with their knife, gun and fighting skills. This has an `old skool' action film feel to it, with plenty of cheesy lines, unbelievable stunts and the odd cameo from action stars of the eighties and nineties; but it seems to work and you don't mind any of this in the slightest. If anything, this tongue in cheek aspect to the film actually adds to it.<br /><br />This was co-written and directed by Stallone and for all the wooden acting on offer, you can't help but be drawn into the action and enjoy the explosions, blood and stunts. This doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should you, it will keep you entertained for the duration and delivers up plenty of bang for your buck. Don't expect anything too high brow and you will enjoy this just fine.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0307477479|3.0|This book represents Jennifer Egan's awesome capability to write in different styles.  She can change the dialogue and cadence of each chapter to enable the reader to go inside the skin of the present narrator. When she writes in third person, at first I was sure that she was referring to a prior act, or was she?  The problem with this novel was too many characters and a confusing story.  I had originally expected the story of Sasha to flow and be recognizable in the various vicissitudes of her life as each chapter progressed.  Not so.  If there were not definite clues, like the chapter headings, I wasn't sure if she were providing a flashback or we had moved forward with her life or another character, such as Bennie, Scotty or Drew.  Egan has us follow a has-been punk rocker and Sasha, the kleptomanaic over four decades which should have been enough.  Instead, we are assaulted with too many characters circling around them, in and out of their lives.<br /><br />When I was deep into a chapter, I became comfortable and felt I had a handle on Egan's themes and foreshadowing.  And then it would be lost with an introduction of another character, I think, or a separate idea.  I hope no one downloaded this to your Kindle because the Power Point presentation was fascinating but I would assume be unreadable on any e-book. As I have said in other reviews, if an experienced reader or reviewer has difficulty understanding what's going on, it's not all the great.  For instance, i tried to stay with the music theme as it would integrate with obvious time periods. But then I wasn't sure if she was exploiting Sasha's tragedy or was this a satire?  At times, I was mesmerized and then became detached from the characters and thus, the writing.

B004L49K20|5.0|You have to listen to this cd a couple times before it grabs you, but when it does, it does NOT let go! (In my experience the best CDs require more than one listen through before it becomes clear just how good they are.)  One by one each song on this CD has had me singing along.  Im totally hooked now.    These new songs definitely fit right in with Duran's greatest songs like Hungry like the Wolf, Is there something I should know, Girls on Film, etc. Some of Duran's work since that time has been less than stellar, but not this album!  If you liked Duran Duran back then, give this CD a shot.  You wont be disappointed.    Btw: there is a deluxe version of this cd that has 2 extra songs that are really good. (same price) One of them is called \\"Early Summer Nerves\\" which is turning out to be my favorite song on the CD.  I *think* Best Buy may be the only place to get the deluxe Cd but Im not positive. (No I dont work for Best Buy or anything, thats just where I got my copy of the CD)
0375842209|5.0|This is a beautifully written book, that makes the minds eye see just soo much. The imaginery is quite astounding, the narrator dark,sad, yet witty, some of the one liners are very funny. Its a very interesting way of looking at Germany during the Second World War, i was impressed it was written with young adults in mind, to help understand what happened at that time
B004J4WQ46|5.0|It's a typical Strokes album in the sense that it takes several listens to start enjoying it, and several more to start loving it.     They took some necessary experimental steps in order to step away from all the criticism received after First Impressions of Earth (which was still a great album). Each song is a monster of its own. While it goes into a slightly experimental directions, the classic Strokes songs remain. Taken For A Fool, Under Cover of Darkness. This is why it's a I title it the perfect comeback album. There are two sides of fans to the Strokes, one who strictly wants the classic Strokes sound, and the other, which craves a new direction.     There are a lot of 80s influences on the album, but the Strokes know how to add their own twists.    No time to continue this review, but I would give Angles a 4.5/5

0307595579|5.0|I've only read the first book so far, but it is very good. I couldn't wait to put a review on here in regards to the amazing quality of the books themselves! They look and feel great, and I love how they are covered in cloth instead of that papery stuff most hardbacks are. The extra book is really cool as well. Absolutely worth the price!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is great.  one of the best games for moble phones.  Definately 5 stars.  Its a shame that there are so many morons out there who cant figure out how to install the game,  then blame the developer (who has nothing to do with your phones 3rd party software settings)  and decide to give it one star.  Review the software,  dont blame it for your inability to use your hardware.

0670022411|5.0|I love this book! The characters are very well developed and the story is quite fascinating. A nice twist on the traditional vampire and witch lore that will draw you in and make you long for the next book. I had a very hard time putting this book down. Congratulations to the author for such a creative effort.
B004RQ5WUG|5.0|Panic! At the Disco's debut album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, was edgy, dark, emotional and filled with raw energy.  Their sophmore release, Pretty Odd, was basicly the exact oppisite, with it's nostlgic, mellow and happy vibe.  While Pretty Odd was like the Fever album's alter ego, Vices and Virtues is more like it's older brother.  It is not a repeat of the Fever album by any means but it has the same kind of magic that Fever drew you in with and is a very strong, well put together album.  Overall, Vices and Virtues is pretty energetic and upbeat, it makes you want to sing and dance along with songs like Hurricane and Sarah Smiles but also has a couple really strong slower songs like Always and the Calender.  Give it a listen, even if you are sceptical after Pretty Odd, you will be pleasently suprised at what the two remaining members of Panic have done here.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I'd gradually been watching more and more of old Supernatural episodes at the fitness club on TNT to the point of trying to coincide my workout with when they are on! I finally came to the conclusion that I needed to just start buying the seasons and watching them since I enjoy it so much! My husband and I tend to not be into the same thing when it comes to TV, but Supernatural has the right balance that keeps him interested and keeps me wanting to watch more. Way less than downloading each episode and you get the bonus features as well. We are very happy with the purchase! I'm already watching websites to see if they are coming back for a 7th season!
030726999X|4.0|This is the third book in the trilogy and a very appropriate conclusion to the storyline. Lisbeth Salander, my favorite character of all three books, the perpetual victim, turns things around. After she fights for her life, rescuing it from the grips of death, she continues the fight, rescuing her life from the lifelong pattern of victimization. I liked this book, because, instead of cringing with Lisbeth's repeated victimization by the system, I was happily cheering her on. This book is the perfect conclusion to the story. The only flaw is that there are no more books.

031261246X|3.0|Zero Day is a story with a devastating massive cyber attack at its core, and a plotline involving two computer security experts trying to deconstruct the attack while it's happening.    I liked the topic and the pace of the book. It kept me entertained and interested, yet it was short enough to hook my ADD self on it, for most of this past week. Part of my daily job is to imagine and describe the effects of potential cyber attacks on the software product that I work on, and I will be recommending this book for the more skeptical of my colleagues. Unsurprisingly, what I liked the most is the realism of some of the technical details of the story. To be perfectly honest, the credentials of the author in that field were my biggest motivation to read the book.    (SPOILER ALERT)  On the other hand, I have two pieces of criticism for the book:  1- That the virus indiscriminately attacks not only office computers - believable - but also avionics systems, nuclear plants and industrial robots reminded me of the laughable leap of imagination that the 1996 movie Independence Day expected from its viewers. Computer viruses have to go through the same cycle as regular software: they have to be developed, tested and deployed. Viruses that attack infrastructures are achievable to repeat a line from the Russinovich's AuthorsCast interview, but they very likely require a professional software team with serious engineering effort and non-trivial resources and funding - unlike the loose group of virus writers in the book. Readers who do not know any better could be mislead into thinking that such attacks are within the reach of small groups similar to the one portrayed in the book.    2- I was also surprised by the simplistic nationalistic overtones of the story (\\"us/US good, them bad\\"), a point that another reviewer here brought up as well. A bit too Hollywood for me, especially with the obligatory cameo appearance of OBL (really?). The world has more shades of gray than the clichésportrayed in Zero Day I'm afraid. The narrative seemed to echo some of the more outrageous US news headlines from the past years and that was borderline insulting to the intelligence.    Three stars.
B003WMX3SY|4.0|This is a great case, there are a few things I would change, e.g. the orientation of the carrying handles, but as far as building a computer, this is great. I've never had such an easy time putting a computer together, the motherboard mount is on rails and slides right out the back of the case, as does the power supply mount. the power supply can be mounted at the bottom or the top simply by rearranging the rails.     On low the fans are quiet though it really makes a racket when they're all on high. I'm going to mount two more to help keep my CPU cool but my Phenom II 1090T is idling at 37C with all the fans on low and the stock heatsink.    This case is BIG, make sure you have a power supply with long enough cables or you're going to need extensions, I use a cooler master 800W silent pro gold. Cable management is a bit of an issue but I've got mine tied to the yellow beams reinforcing he case, it's not pretty but it works. And those pictures don't do the LED's justice.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|This is a very enjoyable disc with lots of high energy and upbeat classic tunes spanning a golden era in pop/rock.<br />Jeff Beck acquits himself more than adequately of paying homage to Les Paul's legacy and some of the classic songs from the rock and roll era. Also great to hear the old Yardbirds Chestnut, \\"Train Kept A Rolling\\" getting a rare live outing. Listening to this CD is like stepping back to 50's or the early 60's, and evoking a bygone golden era.
B0041T52S6|5.0|*Scott Pilgrim* is amazing. Edgar Wright is one of the most refreshing, original auteurs out there today. He's playful and irreverent and inventive. *Shaun of the Dead* turned the zombie film on its head, and *Hot Fuzz* was ... possibly its own category altogether. With *Scott Pilgrim*, Wright has brought to the screen a comic book that was a comic-book version of video games. And it is perfect, one of the best book-to-screen adaptations I have ever seen.     The attention to detail is astonishing. It wasn't until I turned the special trivia feature on the DVD that I caught half the things Wright had slipped in--the number of the various exes (especially the 7s hidden in Gideon's logo), the choice of music, an item of clothing. The casting was perfect. A lot of people say that Michael Cera just plays the same character over and over--and I disagree. His characters may have something in common--they are generally awkward young adults--but he provides subtle variations. Also, his comic timing and line delivery are excellent. Having read the comic books, I'm amazed at how much more humor Cera brings to a line taken straight from the book just from his inflection (e.g. \\"BREAD MAKES YOU FAT????\\"). Whether this is from Cera's mind or with the help of Wright's direction, I don't know, but he's amazing in the title role. The supporting characters are all also well cast--and look *exactly* like their counterparts in the comic books. Alison Pill as Kim Pine is a standout, but all the secondary characters are well cast.    The soundtrack is also wonderful and playful. Sex Bob-omb's songs are written by Beck, and it shows.     I can't wait to see what Edgar Wright does next.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Pros:   * Overall the processor is extremely fast and reliable...  * Overclocks Extremely fast and easy.  * Low voltage compared to my Q6600 (between .95-1.3 depending on Turbo and frequency)  * Have overclocked to 4.6Ghz and 4.9Ghz when turbo kicks in. Totally stable and runs only 2-4degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature during full throttle and runs at 75-82 degrees Fahrenheit (21-30C) during idle PC work (internet surfing, etc.) and up to 50C or 145ish F. Very cool for the speed and transistor count. I have experience with a $100 X4 AMD running at 4Ghz and when this processor is set to 4Ghz it runs circles around AMD. (I realize the price difference but do not be fooled when your friends try to one up you with a 4Ghz AMD and this spanks the 6-Core as well)   * According to Sandra Utilities at complete stock settings with mem set to 1066(had bad mem) it was fastest score on list and I rated in at 800th place out of every benchmark in world! and at 4.6Ghz with new ram running at 1866 I was rated the 270th fastest score in world.  I was rated at 117GOPS. Freaking AWESOME! My Q6600 only scored a 36GOPS running at 3Ghz... So huge improvement!      Other Thoughts:  * For basic overclocks between 4-4.4Ghz it is as easy as typing in 44 in the multiplier and hit save and close. DONE! That is it... For 4.5-4.6Gh you need to increase voltage a smudge and save. With my Gigabyte UD7 I simply set the Vcore Voltage to \\"Level 1\\"(Small increase) and save. Still very easy. For 4.7Ghz-5.2Ghz you will have to Learn how to adjust many settings- (Turbo On/Off?, Proper Vcore, and proper mem timings to go with the those speeds. All doable, but time consuming in the beginning. Find the sweet spot and you are off. This is assuming you have a $50+ dollar air cooler or H70 Water block.    If you have any questions about Overclocking, etc, let me know.     My system is as follows:    * Cooler Master HAF X (AMAZING CASE)  * GIGABYTE GA-P67A-UD7   * G.SKILL Ripjaws X (17000) 8GB (2 x 4GB)* COOLER MASTER Silent Pro Gold Series RS800-80GAD3-US 800W (completely silent)  * EVGA 570GTX Super Clock  * Prolimatech Megahalems Rev. B with a push/pull setup using Cooler Master 120mm Green LED Case Fan - (R4-L2R-20CG-GP 90CFM. (This is an AMAZING cooler and beats my brothers H70 water cooling setup and is completely silent at 18DB)  * Vertex 2 for OS and 3 WD4 500gigs in Raid 0 for data.... No bottle neck here :) Vertex 2- 270Mbs and my raid is 400Mbs

0810994739|5.0|These books have made my second grade grandson a reader.  They are funny with age appropriate vocabulary and plots.  He can't wait for us to buy number 3.  He has also started reading other \\"chapter books\\" since reading the first 2 Wimpy Kid books.  Before reading them he thought reading was \\"boring\\".
0525423273|4.0|On the surface, this book will seem similar to a lot of non-paranormal young adult books on the market right now--girl at a new school, mysterious boy, massive crushing, will-they-or-won't-they. The story itself is fairly predictable, but Perkins' writing is sharply observant and witty, and she has created a protagonist who is relatable, likable, and familiar. I knew this was a cut above the average young adult novel the minute Anna starts describing her father, a bestselling novelist who may or may not be modeled after a real novelist whose name rhymes with \\"Schmicholas Schmarks.\\" Perhaps the recommended audience for this book wouldn't catch the reference, but I laughed a long time and was immediately hooked.    Anna has been sent away to boarding school in Paris, away from everything and everyone she knows. The book follows her year at this exclusive school, focusing mostly on her attraction to a fellow student. Her longing is palpable, and the chemistry between Anna and the student kept me turning pages, making me late for work because I *had* to find out what happens. But unlike most other novels in this genre, Anna is not *defined* by her crush. She has interests and wants that aren't just for the cute boy to like her. She's fun and quirky, and the reader could understand why other characters in the book would be drawn to her. In addition, Anna's friends at the boarding school are well-fleshed out, different, and sympathetic.     This book swept me away and made me feel like a teenager again, with vacillating emotions and that particular self-centeredness that comes with adolescence. Perkins does an admirable job of making the reader feel what Anna feels. She's captured the young adult voice in a believable and engaging manner. I look forward greatly to reading more from this author.
B000001GXC|5.0|This disc can only be awarded the highest recommendations. Great sound, fantastic playing by the Berliner Philharmonic, conducting of the highest level. I especially love the slow movements of both symphonies, never heard them better. Work of genius performed at the utmost level. Do yourself a pleasure and hurry to check-out!  Again, highest recommendation!
B001UW58YK|5.0|The blu-ray starts off with a grand view of the stately arena that buble uses for this concert. the stage is well lit and effects throughout the show helps accompany the songs. the band and musicians are placed well on the stage and does not distract from the viewer watching and listening to buble himself.<br />The picture quality as most have commented is astoundingly sharp. blu-ray quality at its finest. the audio quality is also superb and matches the sharp graphics if not even more perfect as it elevates the mood perfectly. I blasted the volume on my lcd tv to 70% of maximum volume and the sound still sounds perfectly clear without the 'noise' that I experienced with some other modes (component cable and others not HDMI).<br /><br />The concert contains a lot of my favourite songs from buble as well as some others that I'm starting to like even more. If you're a buble fan, you can't go wrong with this one. If you're a blues and jazz fan, then this blu-ray concert is a great addition to your library.<br /><br />Buble himself sings perfectly in this concert. He shows some of his humour as well which livens the experience. Josh Groban even makes a cameo to a great comedic effect and an impromptu duet?<br /><br />If you're coming back from a hard day at work, you pop this in and get swayed to a more relaxing atmosphere. It also works if you're prepping for a date and get yourself in a good mode prior to going out. Whatever the case may be, get ready to fly and swayed to great music.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|This IS the ultimare box set for The Godfather. The packaging and films are wonderful!! I'm proud of Paramount for not releasing another mediocre DVD like they did with the others. The picture quality is perfect on these DVDs, Remastered by Coppola himself. The Sound quality has an all new 5.1 Surround Sound Mix that does not disappoint! The box itself is a nice smooth black box, the \\"The Godfather\\" shining in gold. My only nit pick is that all the cases are slim cases. But don't let that stop you from buying this wonderful set.
0375831002|5.0|*The Book Thief* is narrated from the point of view of Death, and follows the life of Liesel Meminger, a young girl in pre-WWII Germany who has been taken in by a couple after her mother can no longer afford to take care of her. Sorrow, poverty, and abuse form much of young Liesel's life, but even with all the tragedy, there are amazing moments of love and beauty and the resilience of the human spirit. Zusak's writing is gorgeous and visceral. I just wanted to drown in the prose. The story is told in an unconventional, often nonlinear fashion, and it's fresh and original.    The subject matter can be bleak, but Zusak manages to imbue the bleakness with beauty and hope. This is a book about the grittiness and fragility of life, so precious even in its mundaneness, about how one person's bravery and selflessness in the face of evil and corruption can change an entire life.    I was incredibly moved by the book and sobbed through the last chapter. I was left feeling drained yet so lucky to be alive, grateful to have let this book into my soul. This is easily one of the ten best books I have ever read.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is an amazing app.  It loads very quickly and has an amazing selection of stations. The only downside is one of my favorite talk stations is not available but it is a Clear Channel station and it seems none of theirs are available. I'm sure that has more to do with CC and not the makers of this app.  Regardless, this is a fantastic program that does exactly what it says it will.
B001I5M9SC|4.0|The setting is picturesque. The atmosphere is very relaxing with the mountains as backdrop and the serene settings. The open air concert might have added to open acoustics.    Andrea Bocelli here sings greatly as he always does. However in my personal opinion, I do not feel as though those songs which are duets are the best Ive heard from him. Such as The Prayer, while this version is still good, it cannot compare to the greatness when he sang this with Celine Dion or even Katherine McPhee. It is the same with Somos Novios, I felt his duet with Katherine McPhee or Christina Aguilera is still even better than this version. Its a slight shame that his singing counterparts here are not exactly as famous as those aforementioned, I would have preferred an All Stars Duet, that would have made this blu-ray perfect.    To throw it out there, again perhaps the open air and mountainous landscape tweaked the acoustics that it bounces off the landscape creating a not so perfect delivery. Then again, the source for the blu-ray would have been direct feed from the microphones or sound systems so I don't really have a proper explanation. It's just after being spoiled with hearing his many versions of the songs here with many other great artistes that I find a lot of the versions here are not his epic best. Its still great to listen to and those that are not familiar with Andrea's voice will be blown away hearing him for the first time. I for one knows theres a lot more to come from Andrea so I will await the next blu-ray concert to see if its up to expectations.
1932100660|5.0|As a long-term survivor, on long-term chemotherapy since 1997, the research in the China Study and its implications runs counter to most of the suggestions that I received year from well-meaning, medical sources, specifically, regarding high protein diets and supplements from animal sources.  The China Study has affected my nutrition for the better, and you won't have to become a fanatic to improve yourself.  I've passed it on to people, I care about.  Read it, talk to medical people, and judge for yourself.
B004RLN3QG|5.0|Dust Bowl is an amazing CD.  I have been listening to Joe for about a year now and his new CD is his best one yet.  We just saw his show in GR and he is the most amazing guitarist in the world.  The songs on this CD have great depth and emotion.  He is the very best out there!

B004L49K20|5.0|First off, I am a near-lifelong Duran Duran fan, and I have been disappointed with most of their music since \\"The Wedding Album.\\" Not so with \\"All You Need Is Now.\\" Even after three or four times through the CD, I'm still wanting to hear it again.    The album has a thematic style to it that reflects a more sophisticated approach not just to the themes, but to constructing the songs themselves. Each song has musical and intellectual layers to them that make the songs familiar and new at the same time without sounding like they were put together to try to attract a certain segment of the audience. This is truly the \\"deepest\\" album Duran Duran has put out since \\"The Wedding Album.\\"     Fans who are looking for \\"Rio II\\" won't be disappointed, but I think it's much deeper than just \\"Rio II.\\" It has a lot of the same energy \\"Rio\\" had, but with the more well-rounded and developed themes of \\"The Wedding Album\\" with a little bit of \\"Notorious\\" mixed in for good funky measure. It is simply the best Duran Duran album to date.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is absolutely the best mp3 app out there. The search function has never let me down in over 500 searches &amp; downloads. The only critiques I have are that the app needs to include a Current list of top 50 for each category, in addition to aggregating compilation albums so they are listed as a single album after downloading instead of around 15 separate albums. Makes it kind of annoying when I want to listen to a soundtrack, and have to create a playlist to do so because the songs are not grouped together under one album.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|I love her voice and I love almost all of her songs on this album. To me it brings memories back even from the 70's because her songs seem to be timeless, yet it is as if i have heard them before but in a good way, they are like returning friends. But one thing I find a little bit distracting is her use of the english language. Where you at sounds like spoken in french because she leaves out the \\"are\\" and the t at the end of at is almost not there which sounds like way u a. And no one gonna love you leaves out is. Most people will say that this is the american way of talking,singing and nobody cares about that but I find it distracting because I really like her voice but it should sing a little bit more sophisticated because that is what she is and this album shows it. Music A  use of english language D
B0042U94UQ|5.0|What a movie. I have watched it many many times and will watch it many many more!!! Everyone needs to buy this wonderful movie. I laugh everytime I watch it.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|The first part of the book was engrossing and I couldn't put it down.  At that time, I planned to give the book 5 stars.  Unlike many reviewers, I even enjoyed reading Julia's chapters. However, the second half was a let down.  I really didn't care about Julia or her story and thought parts of it were unrealistic. I think the second part deserves 3 stars at best.  I therefore averaged them to get 4 stars.    Like many others, I would like to see this book rewritten to focus on Sarah's life only.  Alternatively, it could include Julia in a minor role as a journalist, but omit all her marital problems.
B003L77TZI|5.0|This is a great cd. It gets me going. Song 3 is all about the sweet stuff. Can not say enough good things about this cd. Right on!!! Keep up the good work.
B004LWZW0Q|5.0|i went to see this film yesterday with my 13 year old brother i was laughing alot the movie was really funny i loved it it was so much better then the first one i never read the books but since ive seen both films i cant wait to see if they make a 3rd diary of a whimpy kid the theater was packed all the little kids were laughing the movie showed me that its not hard for brothers to get along i totally recommend it go see this movie its just a awesome funny kids film
B002ZG997C|4.0|While 'The Book of Eli' will certainly seem familiar at times to those who remember 'The Road Warrior', 'The Book of Eli brings enough new to the table to carve out a nice spot for itself among other post-apocalyptic films. Denzel Washington is in top form here in this smart action film with a lot of heart and soul.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that I didn't see the end twist coming which is a rarity for me, especially considering the clues that are dropped throughout the film. Of course, it's easy to see once you've seen it. The film has a slick look with a very narrow color scheme giving it an almost sepia tone or black and white look at times. This is a good thing because it makes you focus on the story and not a lot of parlor tricks.<br /><br />I can not recommend this film enough for action fans who want a little more than explosions and senseless violence. The only reason I'm giving this 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 is that I thought the story wasn't all that original despite having some nice twists.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|Is essential if you are a lover of anime (Like Me !) have this movie. Unites all the ideas that a good movie should have.   I recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a good anime.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|Reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen's 'Golden Voyage of Sinbad' without the mythical monsters, 'Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time' delivers the goods where so many of these silly costume adventures fail. A nice mix of good vs. evil story and some exciting parkour action sequences make this film very exhilarating and entertaining. I found it humorous that Ben Kingsley appropriately played a homage to Torin Thatcher who played the sorcerer in another Harryhausen classic 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad' and the inspired rip off 'Jack the Giant Killer'.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal aptly plays the hero and all supporting characters fit as well including a colorful role for Alfred Molina. Even if you don't usually like these types of films, this one is an easy and fun ride. Recommended to all costume adventure or Harryhausen film fans. Even though there are none of Harryhausen's creatures, this one surely has his heart.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Amazing app, many versions to choose from, some of which comes without  the audio. Allows you to search for the location of a phrase or word and also provides devotional plans to choose from.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Nothing is getting done in my life.  I'm totally caught up in this excellent book.  Great story development, excellent characters, beautifully written, perfect pacing.  Truly a must read.
044654759X|5.0|This book was such a quick read, I couldn't put it down.  The character shows great strength and determination to get away from her abusive husband.  I could feel her anxiety, her distrust in new people.  She finds her spirit again and knows that she is so much more than what her husband would have her believe.    Loved this book!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|A long-time fan of Pink Floyd and David Gilmour, I've always regretted missing the epic live shows, especially those in the '70s and '80s. This concert DVD captured such fabled performances tremendously. if you've never seen a Floyd show live -- or if you want to relive the memories -- this DVD set is a must-have. The musical performances are, as usual, excellent and practically recitals in their flawless execution; the stage show/lighting/circular screen imagery and other pyrotechnics are exemplary, as you would expect. The set includes all the classic tunes from DSOTM through Division Bell. The only drawback, in my opinion, was the bonus material and behind-the-scenes footage, which was surprisingly amateurish, especially when compared to the excellent work done on David Gilmour's \\"On an Island\\" DVD, which I highly recommend, particularly for the documentaries. But the performances and stagecraft are enough to earn five stars easily. Don't hesitate to order it.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Love the game but I can't play again until May, July, and October 2011 :(.. Also I was planning on uninstalling amazon but from these reviews I guess I can't...

B002L5GQGY|4.0|If you like Bonamassa, you will love this DVD.  Worth the price for Sloe Gin and Just Got Paid alone!    But I found the whole endeavour rather overblown.  Bonamassa seems to hold too much reverence for the venue and the gravitas of playing it.  In 2009, he was not some up and comer - he was already one of the greats.  It only takes the two guest appearances - especially Clapton - to see that.  Indeed, the guest appearances are unnecessary and just drag down the rest of the show.    Sound is great, the camera work is good, too.  One of the benefits of the big production is the fun of having both Anton and Bogie drumming and the horn section.  But - if you're a fan - and sitting with a giant smile splitting your face as you are wrapped up in this fine performance, take a look at the audience.  Why do they not share your joy?  It seems like most of them are season ticket holders to the London Philharmonic pops series and this was one of the series concerts.  Amazing lack of being in touch with this astounding music.  So 5 stars for the performance, but loses a star for pretension and the pathetic appreciation of the crowd.    If you're a Bonamassa fan, then you should have this.  But even more so, you should get the Live at Rockpalast DVD - a completely different feel in the intimate club setting - and Joe will blow your mind.

0307394549|4.0|I have had this book for over a year and have tried about 1/3 of the recipes in this book.  I followed Martha's instructions exactly for the first couple recipes I tried.  However, I found that her cookies had way too much butter, which both made the cookies flat and made them taste overwhelmingly of butter (I love a good butter cookie, but not for every single recipe!)  Now I reduce the amount of butter in every recipe by about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup and the cookies turn out perfect!  I also have the oxo cookie scoop (medium) which helps the consistency of the cookies.  A lot of these recipes can be frozen for last-minute snacks/guest/etc. - my favorite is the cinnamon, peanut and chocolate chip cookie.  Just shape it into cookie balls, freeze them in an airtight plastic bag or tupperware, then pop them in the oven (frozen) whenever you need them.  Delicious!      This is now the only cookie book I use, and I intend to buy Martha's cupcakes and pies & tarts book immediately!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I happened upon this album on You Tube, and my life has not been the same since! I've grown mentally, spiritually, and I reach higher for Love! I can't stop listening to Janelle Monae! JMo is what we call her around my house! My two year old and four year old dance to her music and rock out on top of the coffee table in our living room, and I don't mind at all. I feel that are Souls are awakened by not only the music, but her amazingly,bold lyrics! We need Janelle Monae in the Music Industry! She completely shuts down those hollow, thoughtless artists that don't have any creativity, purpose or meaning in their music.I believe she was sent from the future to help us now! Wake up and listen!!

B001TH7GT6|5.0|Quality is great.  Value for price depends.  I bought a couple of weeks ago when price was below $5.  Now, price is $11 plus.  At this level, still a decent value.  If it drops again, it is a steal.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I bought this to replace an ancient VHS version.  What a pleasant surprise.  THe movie itself was much richer and included scenes I hadn't seen before.      The real bonuses were the various commentaries on the creation of the movie - they brought out a pallette of insights and subtleties to look for and appreciate.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I've read through all of Anne Rice, I've even read all of Twilight, and I have to say I'm happy to have a \\"paranormal\\" book to read that beats both.  I have to throw in the word paranormal because this book is about more than just witches.  While the vampire / witch relationship starts to border on the sappy it never goes too far to make me groan.  In fact, I think she threw in just enough romanticism to make that part of the book compelling.    I saw a few reviews that thought the book was boring.  The beginning of it is.  I started to read the sample and gave up. Thankfully I had a friend reading the book at work and he told me how great it was and to keep giving it a chance.  It didn't take more than the first few chapters for it to really get going.  So, I'm glad I stuck with it.    If you love history then you should also like this book.  I enjoy a well written researched book that combines fact with fiction.  Some of my favorite Anne Rice books were the ones where she really went into the history of things and brought that into the storyline...like Pandora.  But, I know others who thought that these were her most boring books.    I can't wait to read books 2 and 3 and for that I give this 5 stars.  I'm super annoyed that I DO have to wait.
0307593495|5.0|reading this series from the start! Mankell's Wallander is a character infused with depth, insight, and personal tragedy - i was sad to finally surmise that this was the last book of the series, but happy to know there are all the previous titles to explore... while hardcore fans may be disappointed this new fan is excited about the possibilities and plots that await! Mankell paints portraits in the mind's eye that remain for quite some time, and i'm now a confirmed and determined reader of his work!

B00382S9N2|4.0|Sweet, unabashedly sentimental coming of age in the Catskills tale.<br /><br />The dancing is hot, the acting is a mix (Grey and Orbach are VG, Swayze tries hard, looks<br />great, but is a better dancer than actor ).<br /><br />The ending feels very Hollywood, which is too bad, because the film seemed to promise<br />more complexity in its gently satirical look at early 60s America in the first half.<br /><br />Plus some very creaky, cliche sub-plots start to invade as well.<br /><br />Yet the story is told with an honest and good heart, and there's a reason it's become<br />a mini-classic.  Do I think it's a great movie?  No.  But can I understand why a<br />generation that grew up with it cherish it? Absolutely.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|This album is true to its title, balanced between slower songs and rave-ups. They proved they could do rockers with Accelerate - a full album in fact - and after 30 years and 14 albums, have nothing to prove to anyone. To paraphrase Keith Moon, R.E.M. remains the best R.E.M.-type band out there.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|First, I will add the positives of this app. No annoying ads. Quality graphics. Great performance. Lots of cool new changes from previous Angry Birds versions...and really who can dislike Angry Birds? ;)<br /><br />Here is the problem I had over the last two days forcing me to uninstall the application from my Motorola Xoom. All seemed OK after I played it the first time and exited the application. The following day I woke up to see the game launched itself overnight on my Xoom and froze the system to the point where I couldn't exit out. I pressed the 'back' button several times until I got the Angry Birds \\"Are you sure you want to quit?\\" message, selected the check mark button (indicating \\"yes\\") and it just took me back to the launch screen of the game. I tried this over and over until I finally had to force a reboot on my Xoom just to get out of the app.<br /><br />To be sure this wasn't some err on my part, (a chance I didn't fully close out of Angry Birds somehow the night prior, causing it to run in the background all night)...Sadly no, throughout the following day (yesterday) and today the application just launched itself intermittently. Again, I had difficulty exiting the application. It must have launched itself a good six times before I had enough and reluctantly uninstalled. :(<br /><br />I hope the devs whether it's Rovio/\\"Fox Digital Entertainment\\"/\\"Blue Sky\\" take a look at the reason for this and work on a fix because it seems to be ok (SO FAR) on my other Android devices. I will report back if I notice the same issue on them--so far, it only seems to be an issue with the Xoom.

B003Z0D4SM|5.0|What a refreshing change from the usual American centric mystery pap. I loved this book and \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\", which I just finished. I am looking forward to reading the 3rd book in the trilogy. I had fun looking up places in Google Earth and Stieg Larsson's character development is truly amazing. I didn't find it necessary to know anything about Swedish politics, although I do remember some of the historic items mentioned.

159420229X|5.0|I just finished Moonwalking With Einstein and highly recommend it.  I find myself rereading the chapter on the OK Plateau and Memory Palace just to pick up the techniques Mr. Foer used to improve his own memory.  I am also in the process of checking out his references for further review and study, such as the books on memory written by the ancients and Tony Buzan's work.  I rarely check out the bibliography but I found \\"Moonwalking\\" inspiring and worthy of continuing.  (Note:  As was probably mentioned previously, this isn't a manual, this is a memoir.  However, there is plenty to learn through this engaging story.)

0062064304|5.0|It always amazes me how much work goes into the design of movies, and it leaves me incredulous at how much actually gets left out. I can't say I know what the attrition rate is, but judging from the book, less than 10% of all the concepts, sketches, props, sets and whatever else gets used in the final cut of the film. Looking thorough all the items, you have to scratch your head and wonder why such brilliant pieces didn't get used.    This book is a very worthy compendium of all the design and art that goes into the making of a movie. You will not be disappointed in purchasing this book.

0142000655|5.0|The riches fill up fast and frequently in East of Eden, so much so that you're almost certain to call it one of the best books you've ever read long before you approach the end (which won't take long either).  I feared how I'd react to a book so venerated - now, at 29, I'm long past the ability to read a book I'm \\"supposed\\" to read and appreciate the dimensions of.  Besides a love of great writing, what makes East of Eden so easy to read is a nimble grasp - if not an embarrassing ease - Steinbeck seems to have on the fundamental understandings of life.  I can't remember the last time I read a book like this that truly made me think, \\"Holy crap, the secrets of life are in here!\\"<br /><br />Here's what it does right, I think, right off the bat.  It's not Adam Trask, the conflicted, haunted protagonist at its center, it's his brother, Charles.  In the early pages of the novel, Adam and Charles get in a fight for which Charles is to blame.  Yet as you get to know the two of them, something about Charles' rage and loneliness is compelling even as he sits in the background of the novel.  East of Eden moves in and around their relationship, then moves away, as Adam falls in love with Cathy, which does not go well.  Yet with each movement through Adam's life, the book cuts a little closer to the nature of what makes each person tick.  Not just tick, but feel, think, and keep moving.<br /><br />There are themes in East of Eden that are important, that I want to talk and talk to anyone who has read the book about, but I think it best you read them for yourself.  What I will say is that ultimately what makes East of Eden the most humane, insightful, perhaps best book I've read is that every truth is grasped through a character, specifically conceived, always presented as an individual, never spared the difficulties of life, and never responding as any other character would.  East of Eden is beautiful, brisk, orchestrated like a magnificent concert, but what it is above all is the human experience, in all is breathtaking complexity.  The book had won me over long before it follows Adam's son Cal into the deep ambivalence of his own thoughts of good and evil, a man who, as one character puts it is \\"packed to the brim of every good and evil instinct a man's ever had.\\"  That it becomes Cal's story is the coup de gras - a statement that life is never more vital and beautiful than when it's full of contradiction and uneasy answers.ience, in all is breathtaking complexity.

B000JQU1VS|3.0|This was an easy decision to read The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I mean after all it was free, I knew the stories from growing up and the movie was pretty decent too.  I had forgotten the fact that this book was actually a compilation of short adventures of Holmes and Watson.  Overall these adventures were pretty interesting and definitely not easy to solve.  I wanted to solve the mysteries but because some of them were so outrageous there was pretty much no way to figure them out before Holmes told you how he solved them.  Out of the 12 adventures I think there were only one that I figure out before the explanation.  These are definitely worth reading as they involve good characters, nice intrigue and quite a few crazy twists in the plot.  My only suggestion is that you don't read them as if it is one book.  If I could read it over I would read them one at a time, taking a break between each adventure because the outrageousness sometimes got to me a little.    If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle. I would love your suggestions and comments. Check out my profile for the website.
0316017922|3.0|This book was assigned to me for an in-school reading book. At first glance, the book seemed exciting and this hypothesis held true for a good portion of the book. The book made me think a lot more into the success stories that I have heard of and also my own upbringing. I thought deeply about all of the small advantages that I may have received in my life without even knowing it, that may have made me much more successful that I was intended to be. Another point that Gladwell made that I found interesting was his \\"10,000 hour rule.\\" This rule states that in order to become an expert in any field, one must spend 10,000 hours practicing and perfecting the art. Gladwell gives many examples of professionals that have reached this milestone of 10,000 hours. However, the one problem that I find with the rule is that it is possible to have 10,000 hours in a field and still not be an expert. To me, Gladwell underestimates the natural talent that you must be born with in order to succeed in the your field of choice. Also, throughout the book I feel as though Gladwell continues to repeat himself. When giving an example, Gladwell will make his point and then repeat it about four or five times. This gets to be a bit annoying throughout the book and I feel like I would have enjoyed the book a good bit more. Although there are a few annoying points in the book, overall I did enjoy it. I recommend the book to anyone interested in success stories or deeper thought into them.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This was a great movie, for all ages.  Very well presented, and gives you a little idea about the behind the scenes life of horse racing. Any little girl or little boy who loves horses will love this movie.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|My Samsung Galaxy S Captivate will not allow the install and does not even give me a \\"settings\\" option. The \\"step by step\\" directions completely fail on all three Android phones. Apparently AT&T is determined to lock-out Amazon from providing apps to anything Android. Just about 30 minutes ago my \\"Techie\\" neighbor tried on his Android phone----no success. It's back to App-Brain I go for whatever I need. I'm tired of messing with something that simply does not work!
1439107955|5.0|Dr. Mukherjee gives a fascinating detailed history of the origins of the Hematology-Oncology subspecialty starting with the first successful treatment of children with Acute Leukemia by Dr. Sydney Farber, in Boston.  He relates the hardships and struggles of a group of scientists, who through collaboration and hard work, developed the cooperative groups and the National Cancer Institute for a systematic review of the new drugs and their  possible combinations in order to cure cancer.    The book emphsizes that success only comes after several failures; and the still long road that we need to conquer.  Gives not only an example of how to fight cancer, but also  all the misfortunes and maladies that affect our World.    Dr. Mukherjee gives a short reference on Dr. Cornelius Rhoads, from the Memorial Sloan Kettering, who admitted injecting cancer cells in Puerto Rican  in the early 20th century.  However, the books emphasizes many of the pioneers in Medicine who started the foundations in finding a cure against cancer.    This book is obligatory not only to cancer physicians, but to all persaons who have the hope that through study, work, critical thinking  and compassion, we can conquer not only cancer but all the maladies of  our modern World.
0756404738|5.0|If you loved the first book, the second is just as great.  Perhaps a little slow for some readers who are looking for more action, but the character development and Rothfuss' superb writing style make this a hard book to put down.  I tore through all 1000 pages and now have to suffer the excruciating wait until the next chapter of this excellent story comes out.  Please Patrick, don't pull a George RR Martin on us.  We want to know how this story ends.    Truly one of the greatest fantasy novels of all time.  I rank this (and NoTW) up there with Lord of the Rings and A Song of Ice and Fire.
B004SBX112|5.0|all i have to say is that it is about damn time that rovio offered an ad free version. this is precisely what we needed. now i can play without those annoying intrusions.
B004NS710C|3.0|If you're looking for fluff without an original thought (or line) to be found, plus stuff blowing up and Chris Pine briefly without a shirt, well here's your movie.      Unstoppable is pretty badly written and rife with every action-movie cliché in the book (suits and/or fat guys making decisions that put people at risk?  Check.  Buddy team of heroes... one old, one young, formerly combative but now in sync, each with personal/woman issues?  Check.  Spunky chick  wisecracking and helping to save the day... from a safe distance?  Check.  Everything bad that could possibly happen all happening at once, plus a town that stores all it's fuel near the most dangerous train-track curve?  Yep.).      But it is what it is and it doesn't pretend to be lofty or deep.  So if you just want an exciting action flick - this will work.  It's slow to start but it does build to a few tense moments, and Chris Pine, Denzel Washington, and Rosario Dawson are all easy on the eyes.  We enjoyed it, without ever wanting to watch it again.    BOTTOM LINE:  Worth a rental (NOT a purchase) if you're looking for an action-adventure.
B0040JHLM2|5.0|I've been running for just 3-4 years, and I've only run in, first Brooks (Adrenaline) and then Asics (2150 and Kayano 17), but this shoe is easily the best fit and feel.  I'm a neutral runner with a normal-to-high arch and this shoe provides excellent support.  I am currently training for a marathon and I believe the Adrenaline is my ticket to a decent finish!  Happy running!
B004AKCME8|5.0|If you have read the books and loved them as much as I have, I'm sure you were eagerly anticipating the arrival of this movie. After missing seeing it in 3D in theaters (which i regret heartily now that I've seen the film) I rented it and absolutely, 100% fell in love with it. I'm 20 years old, and I literally watched it about 3 or 4 times the first week I had it. That's how much I enjoyed it. Caution though: it may be based on the books, but there are several differences between the film and book versions (the basic storyline remains the same through everything, regardless.) Honestly, though, the differences don't even matter because the film is just stunning. The graphics are to die for, the soundtrack is perfect for daring owl deeds, and the characters are enchanting on the big screen. If you are one of the sticklers that likes novel-based films to be exactly like the books, you might not enjoy this one. If, however, you don't mind some small tweaks to characters and details, I can guarantee that you will adore this movie!
B004QMYKSG|5.0|Yeah, this album is the straight poop!  Picked it up from the bands website in Nov or early Dec 2010.  I can't believe it took Amazon and Itunes soooo long to jump on this little gem of an album.  I first heard the song Spank on Album88 88.5 Georgia State Radio!  I immediately found more about this New Zealand band.  Definite 80's vibe on some of the songs.  I love the interplay between the male and female lead vocals. I also love the fuzzed out sound on some of the songs.  Absolutely love Spank, The Sun, Girls Like You, No Way, and Frayed.  Most of the other songs are top shelf, as well.  Great first album!!!  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!
1579125549|4.0|This was a good book for my 5 year old, as well as me. There are 1 move, 2 moves and 3 moves checkmate puzzles. My 5 year old could solve the 1 move checkmates, so I moved him to the 2 moves puzzles. Those are a bit of a challenge for him, as well as for me sometimes. However, the thousands of puzzles are without background or context, hence it is difficult to notice patterns or tips. Hence all in all, this is a good book to keep them busy when you run out of ideas about what to teach the kid next.
B0037QGS0A|3.0|Chloe is about a housewife who suspects her flirtatious husband might be cheating on her, so she hires an *extremely* attractive younger blonde-haired woman to actually make moves on the husband to see if he falls for her.  Now THAT'S just downright cruel, my friends, haha.    This means the two women would occasionally meet up somewhere, like at a restaurant or at the workplace, and the blonde-haired woman would discuss what kind of moves the husband made on her the night before.  Now I absolutely MUST warn the viewers- she tends to get really dirty while detailing what exactly took place involving the husband, so be prepared for that.      Also be prepared to witness some scenes that border on strong sexual content.  You'll be shocked, believe me.    The premise sounds intriguing, yes.  However the storyline itself has some flaws.  For one thing, there's nothing really particularly different about the storyline that warrants your precious time.  It's entirely cliched and predictable.  Right down to the way the wife believes her husband was being unloyal at a restaurant and feels betrayed as a result, and reflects on the incident on the car ride home- it's nothing you haven't already seen on plenty of Lifetime Movie Network films.    There ARE a few nice twists that take place along the way.  I won't spoil what happens but let's just say, the attractive young blonde isn't as innocent as she appears.  Not that anybody in her line of work would be normal or innocent anyway, haha.    I hated the ending though.  It was terribly disappointing.  I expected a HECK of a lot more than what we got.  Other than that, it's just an okay film with some obvious flaws.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Miss the pigs...dig the new look!  Graphics upgraded, looks good, different good.  Finished  original and seasons!  Done with 1 st level...can't  wait for next! Good job so far!
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|I'll keep this short and to the point.. hopefully.   I think this movie had a problem with inaccurate marketing. Yeah the tsunami scene was pretty amazing (unfortunate timing in relation to the Japan quake and tsunami) but this wasn't a CGI effects driven flick, as the previews would have had you believe. It's a much quieter personal film dealing mainly with Damon's character's personal struggle with his psychic gift/curse. In short, a very good \\"story driven\\" film. Not a pop corn CGI flick.
1439153663|5.0|It has been awhile since I've read a real page turner. I just could not put The Kitchen House down. The characters were complex and compelling. This gothic Southern tale was both dark and uplifting. For a first novel, Grissom really impressed me with her storytelling ability.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|An obvious choice to open the app store with a new free angry birds that is everything and more than its predecessors, congrats amazon on a solid start
014241039X|5.0|I read this 25 years ago and I still remember where I was when I did. A couple of the \\"tricks\\" played in the book stuck with me. When I recalled it recently I bought it for my daughter. I told her she'd love the book, but she wasn't sure. She started reading anyway. She's now been up more than an hour past her bed time, visiting downstairs every 20 minutes with eager updates on what is going on in the book and now has finished it. I let her stay up because yeah the book is that good. She asked if there were any more Twits books. Afraid not, but there are other Dahl books!
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Unfortunately, I've had to download this twice. Its as much fun as other angry birds but after a couple days of playing it stops working. I sent a messsage to Amazon and they were no help. I've never had a single issue with angry birds downloaded from the android market. So far, not happy with Amazon.
144937980X|5.0|Great book with easy to follow examples.    Perfect size for an easy chair with a glass of white(or red) wine.    Some books are just more fun than others and this is one of the fun ones.    ENJOY!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|It's a fantastic app with thousands of stations. Well worth it. HTC Thunderbolt. It even has a station from Antarctica. Sound quality varies depending on bandwidth (some up to 192 lbs in ACC WMA or MP3) .
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game.  The original angry birds were Awsome but this is even better,  but the only thing is that it needs more levels
B0001611DI|3.0|This film was an interesting view into consumerism interwoven with horror and humor.  It shows how people have a belief that if we have material means met, our lives would be better.  The original Dawn of the Dead delivered on this idea.  People found this movie popular because of the fantasy of \\"owning\\" a mall. The film went further to show that even with mall ownership, the characters were still flawed and bored with having everything (all except the character Fly Boy Stephan).  The premise of the movie was totally excellent.      Many people cite the fact that the \\"blue-face-zombie\\" look was not scary enough.  That may be true but the major flaw of the film was the use of the same zombies in multiple scenes (another continuity problem or lack of money to pay more people.)  For example, the lead zombies (the nurse, the guy holding the gun, etc.) showed up when Fran, Stephan, Roger and Peter got to the mall.  They were in the scene when the main protagonists pulled the trucks up to the mall doors (those zombies were outside.)  When our heros drove around the mall in the Volkswagon to secure and lock it down, those zombies were inside.  When the bikers opened the mall to looting at the end, those same zombies were there.  That didn't make sense because the main characters \\"went on a hunt\\" inside the mall after locking it down thus destroying those zombies earlier. The viewer is left to wonder if the zombies were twins because they showed up with Stephan after he became a zombie at the end.      Most people forgive much of this because it was a low budget film. I still consider this a good film because of its humor and overall message.  People who watch George Romero films look to his films for the message AND the guts.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|I liked this movie. It was very subdued but somehow still suspenseful. People that expect the typical Hollywood happy ending will be disappointed as well people that like movies in which the main character dispatches a army of enemies all by himself even after the standard car chase and crash. This movie seemed realistic. Clooney is no James Bond, just a spy trying to get out of the game. I found his character believable and realistic. There weren't any likable characters in the movie but in life sometimes there are no likable people around. Needing a character to like is more a flaw with the viewer I think than the movie.
1439102724|1.0|I own and have read every book by Jodi Picoult and loved them all except her latest -Sing You Home. Although the subject of infertility, invetro fertilization and what to do with fertilized eggs in the event of a divorce is interesting, the charaters had no depth. That Zoe and Max fell out of love and surprise, Zoe found out she is a lesbian even though she never had feelings toward another woman in her whole life is ludicrous! I usually can't put a Picoult book down, but I had to make myself read this one hoping it would have something I could like or relate to, but it didn't. The ending was just not believable. Jodi, please, please write a better book next time!
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I've only had this mic for a few days. I wanted the mic to plug into a DSLR to conduct video interviews. Specifically, I am using a [[ASIN:B0035FZJHQ Canon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens]], with Magic Lantern installed. Magic Lantern is a software hack for a few specific Canon DSLR cameras. For others who may have a T2i with ML, I was hoping to get clean enough audio by plugging this mic directly into the camera that I would not need to record to a separate source and sync audio in post-production.<br /><br />As mentioned in at least one other review, if you are hoping to use this mic with a DSLR as a one-stop solution, you will need a 3.5mm stereo male to mono female adapter. This way it will record dual mono to both the left and right audio channels. I got mine at Radio Shack for under three bucks, but you can get one on Amazon too: [[ASIN:B000O7AW98 Cables To Go 40634 3.5mm Stereo Male to 3.5mm Mono Female Adapter (Metallic Silver)]]<br /><br />This review may only be applicable to those running Magic Lantern. ML disables the horrible Audio Gain Control present on the T2i (and most DSLR cameras), enabling for much cleaner audio recording. At first, I was not getting loud enough recordings. I turned up the default analog gain via magic lantern from 23dB to 32dB, which helped a lot. I also experimented with a tiny bit of digital gain. Thanks to the incredible adjustability of magic lantern, I was able to dial in a sweet spot for this mic.<br /><br />I also own a [[ASIN:B003QKBVYK Zoom H1 Handy Portable Digital Recorder]], and connecting this stereo recorder directly to the DSLR produced far superior results. You can adjust the input levels directly on the Zoom, so there is no need to make any changes to my camera's gain levels like there is with the Audio Technica. The audio is noticeable cleaner from the Zoom H1 as well and it is more versatile because it can be used to record in many types of situations, rather than just one person who is wearing the lav mic. Yes, it costs about five times more than this lav mic, but at $99, it is still pretty cheap. Plus, it can also be used as a stand-alone recorder. It also has a battery indicator level. As mentioned by lots of reviewers, the Audio Technica has no battery indicator and in fact, no lights at all, so you must remember to turn it off when you are finished.<br /><br />For those trying to find decent audio to go along with the stunning video produced by DSLR cameras, this is not a bad choice, and certainly very affordable. For those with more money to spend, I would consider the Zoom H1 at $99, or even the Rode Videomic Pro, which comes out in April for $229. But for the price, this is a huge upgrade over the onboard sound recording captured by most cameras.n just one person who is wearing the lav mic.

B003UESJHY|4.0|I watched the Fighter after I saw the trailer at the movies.  Mark Wahlberg is great; he's fit, he's tight and he's taugh  but he's not good and that's what makes the film work in my  opinion.  The Director did a really terrific job getting the  feeling right in this movie too, he wasn't too lean when it  came to the \\"tough\\" fight sequence at the end of the movie  and by that I mean he played it so realistically that I almost  thought I was going to scream if Mark's character doesn't win  that fight.  Mark was brilliant in it and I think, for most who  will eventually see this movie that they will agree with me when  I say that even if Mark's character looses at the end it wouldn't   have made that much difference to the movie because it was a   really good movie throughout and the ending didn't impact the rest  of the movie like they do with lot's of movies.  This movie doesn't  hinge on the ending, it makes a lot of sense to say also that if   the Director had thought of it he wouldn't have let the character loose  like he did through the win which means the better you are at punching the  stronger you seem but the weakest man lost instead of winning!  It's a great movie but a sad movie and if you like the underdog winning  you will love this too.
0553386794|1.0|I had high expectations for this book. And it sucked. Not just a little bit, but a lot.  I am a long time fan of Tolkien and the Fantasy genre, in particular.  I laughed out loud when I saw reviews comparing Martin to Tolkien.  There is absolutely no comparison and I'm sure J.R.R. would roll over in his grave by those comments.  It was not terribly well written but it did have possibility.  And then came the needlessly large amounts of graphic rape scenes.  I felt like (and after reading the passages to friends and discussing it with other readers who agreed) it was put in there for either shock value or some very sick personal reasons.  There's no need to have a graphic depiction of the deflowering of a 13 year old.  Just none.  And this isn't a \\"feminist\\" issue like another reviewer stated.  If your only excuse for the depiction of so many rapes is that anyone objecting is a \\"feminist\\" then that is just sad and pathetic.  And several children (at least, I stopped reading halfway through!) were brutally murdered or people tried to murder them.  This book was depressing to me.  It did not inspire me to pick it up and read more, it left me depressed and wanting to burn it.  And I've never felt that way about any other book I've ever read.  So please be warned if you are sensitive to any of these issues.
B002M3SP28|5.0|I kept coming back to this book over and over again. The storyline is very gripping. The characters portrayed in the book are very real. They are not out to become super heroes but to give their best in becoming successful in their mission. Truly enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|The Lost Symbol is an average book when compared to Angels and Demons and the Davinci Code. I was a huge Dan Brown fan when I ordered this for my Kindle and often while reading it I asked myself \\"when is this book going to end?\\" The story line took quite a while to set up with pretty meaningless character dialogue until about half way through the book, where you finally see some action. At that point and only that point, the book becomes a page turner. I was kind of upset that there wasn't more symbology, but you can't have everything. Overall, I thought the Solomon family secret was more interesting than the Masonic aspect of the book. All in all it was an okay book, but worth the read if you're a Dan Brown fan or a history buff.

B000VLOKQI|5.0|Ok, this is from a very biased but long-term, hard core Who fan.  I think this is a good companion to The Kids Are Alright.  If you haven't seen either, watch TKAA first, then if you want more, watch this. TKAA covered the glory days.  This also covers that time period, but adds to it the death of Keith, Cinncinati, the Kenney Jones era, farewell tour, Entwistle's death -- the rough times. Plus, the wonderful arrival of Zak Starkey, Ringo's son, the rebirth of the spark in Vegas 1998, and the redemptive Concert for New York in 2001.<br /><br />This has far more talking heads, less music.  Lots of new Townshend and Daltrey material, plus many of the usual suspects from the band's family and history - Richard Barnes, Shel Talmy, Chris Stamp, Dougal, Curbishley, plus some celebrity musicians like Noel Gallagher, Sting, Eddie Vedder, The Edge.  But great stuff for anyone interested in The Who.  Are they the 4 best musicians ever, as one reviewer disagrees with?  Who cares?  Together, they are one of the most powerful and entertaining rock bands you'll ever see.  Townshend is a musical genius. And a very entertaining drunk (for that, watch the Concert for The People of Kampuchea or the videos for 'Face Dances').
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is very good because it is like the real angry birds game, but it is angry birds rio and rio is a movie.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I zoned out of the movie TRON: LEGACY, however the music was amazing--it was easily the best part of the film, or more correctly, it IS the film.  Had the movie reached the level of passion, gravity, mystery and energy of the soundtrack the film would have ruled.  As it is, just get the music and imagine what kind of movie could have been.  In other words, the music tells a more compelling story.
B003AMK8IY|5.0|Chuck keeps getting better every season! This one especially really demonstrates why Chuck is such a great show. They're not afraid to keep evolving and moving forward. So many shows have grown stale after just a few seasons because they are afraid to change! The characters in this season continue developing and growing while still maintaining their original personalities. It's truly a show full of wonderful talent on all fronts. Never short on humor, while still bringing action and the appropriate amount of romance, Chuck never fails to satisfy my craving for some good TV.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Great game to play, but freezes often.  And it overrides and closes Screebl, causing the screen to constantly dim and/or shut off.   Only gets three stars because of those points ...and Amazon Appstore issues.  But....excellent game and worth downloading.
B004IJZFP4|5.0|This new version of one of the best rock guitar records is fantastic. When I 1st. played it I wasn't to sure of some of the cuts. The Grind, Too used to the high end guitar that screams the opening rife but than on the 2nd. listen WOW! perfect take.  I am not sure maybe this version of this encredible record should have been the 1st. release. The free flying guitar playing on the extended versions is way Tommy Bloin still today graps listeners and guitar player and makes them shake thier head because his carree was cut way too short and what music we all missed.  This is a must have by anyone that that simply loves great music and encredible guiatr playing, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, eric Clapton, Ronnie Montrose, all great but you know they loved Tommy Bolin, This record you can feel Jeff Beck, Clapton, Page,  But Tommy truly is and was a origianal guitar play from one of his 1st. notes by the feel and tone you know that it is Tommy Bolin,. Thanks TRommy for the music you gaVE US AND jOHNNY bOLIN FOR KEEPING IT ALIVE.   I have to tell you that I was blessed to have seen Tommy twice live in concert, 1st. Time with the James Gang (Hooked on Tommy after that show, Oh, and James Gang Bang is a record all must own as well) I would love to have a Live James Gang record with Tommy) 2nd. Time Solo Private Eyes tour, Right after Thanks Giving in Davenport, Iowa. one of his last shows.    Keep Tommy Coming, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, What are you waiting for?????????????????????

B002QH2NUA|5.0|Great show, great band - never tire of McCartney and McCartney never seems to tire of pleasing audiences. His band is superb! Especially enjoyed the flawless superimposing of the 1965 Shea Stadium version of \\"I'm Down\\" with the contemporary version. Amazingly creative editing. Love the range in age of the audience. Timeless songs. Ageless performer.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|In this movie Clooney stares at you and you stare back at him for 90% of the time.  In between scenes, to keep your attention, they show him having sex with Claire (Violante Placido), boobs exposed etc etc.  And in the end he kills the big-bad guy who is trying to kill him and dies.  Havent watched such a turd of a movie in a long time!
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|Series is great; I loved watching it in HD on TMC. However there's a grain pattern on many shots on the blu-ray that was not there on the HD broadcast. Think the 1000 pattern pixel blinks, that resemble mosquitoes on the 300 blu-ray. Not nearly as distracting as the 300 release and it's only on some shots, but is this what we were promised for HD releases?
B004L49K20|5.0|From the funky synths, to the catchy chorus, there is a whole lot of Duran Duran here to enjoy.  What can I say?  They are back.<br /><br />Dark twisted upbeat melodies, effortlessly flow from track to track. Great production value, with underlays of deep bass, strong vocals, and great synthesizers.<br />This is one of those albums, where you just throw it on and kick back on the couch and just relax.  It may not require deep and intensive listening to enjoy.<br /><br />Catchy and atmospheric, and best of all, easy to listen to.  I can recommend All You Need Is Now to just about anyone.  It's a really really good album.<br />I love that it maintains a great cohesiveness all the way throughout, painting a picture - solemn, yet upbeat and hopeful. In the song Leave a Light On, you can tell exactly where they wanted to focus this album.  The focus is for the future, and this is the future.  People will look back on this album 10 years from now,  it's just that good.<br /><br />Duran Duran is back, and with moments of pure musical brilliance.<br /><br />5/5
0061537969|5.0|This book just gave me an overall wonderful feelings...

B00005B1EX|5.0|\\"Live insurrection\\" is the first solo live album from the Metal God Rob Halford originally released in 2001. Recorded during the \\"Resurrection\\" world tour 2000-2001 in support of Halford's debut album, \\"Live...\\" is a complete 2CD/27track live album capturing songs throughout the singer's career; most of the tracks of the \\"Resurrection\\" debut are featured live on this release plus highlights of Halford's 90's group \\"Fight\\" and of course a long list of \\"Judas Priest\\" classics. Closing the package are reworked studio versions of \\"Heart of a lion\\" and \\"Prisoner of your eyes\\" plus a new-at the time-studio track \\"Screaming in the dark\\".<br /><br />The line up on this live album is the same that cut \\"Resurrection\\" in the studio, featuring US guitar hero `Metal'-Mike Chlasciak, drummer extraordinaire Bobby Jarzombeck, guitarist Patrick Lachman and bassist Ray Riendeau. The band's performance is indeed amazing going through Halford's 30 year music catalogue with incredible precision and fluency. All riffs, melodies, solos and drum patents are faithfully recreated on these recordings while Rob's vocal performance is outstanding hitting all notes with accuracy and sustain.<br /><br />Some of the performances as well as cover photos of this album seem to be taken from `Halford's show at the `Rock in Rio 2001' festival. Still this live album is not the audio equivalent of the \\"Halford-Rock in Rio\\" DVD released three years ago as \\"Live insurrection\\" features a more extensive track-list and considerably different performances of the songs. Overall \\"Live insurrection\\" is amongst the greatest heavy metal live albums released in the new millennium and it is still a thrilling listen, ten years past its release.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I'm a little shocked, to say the least!<br />I kind of knew that that our food didn't come from the most clean or hygienic of places..but this?!<br />What bothers me most is the monopoly that these huge food companies have over our food productions and distribution.While I'm not the paranoid kind, I can see why such companies and use a stranglehold on us in dire situations.<br />While illegal immigration is not a valid point here...it does have implications in the long run. In Nebraska,Wisconsin and Iowa we do see large companies hire illegal aliens (exploiting them and bringing crime, poverty and complexity into this society).<br />Moral of the story for me:<br />I'm going to go a little more organic.<br />I'm going to question the way big business handles our food.<br />Thanks for such a great documentary.
0452295548|5.0|An excellent book in new condition.  This is an exciting story by a neuropsychologist telling her own story of having a stroke and recognizing it as it was happening. Not at all dull.  Very informative. A fine read.

Also, did you know there is a childrens movie coming out called \\"Rio\\"? Not sure which came first, the movie or the game.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I first watched this on Netflix.  If you really like this mini-series, I recommend the DVD over Netflix version.  DVD version is widescreen, plus many scenes were cut down for the Netflix version--possibly the Netflix is the TV version and the DVD is the complete version.  Definitley worth the money for Richard Armitage fans.
0525423273|5.0|There's no doubt that you've seen a million posts up already gushing their love about this book. Yes, this will be another review where the blogger feel head over heels with Anna, and will re-read it many upon many times. And I know with all the hype, some people might get it, and not love it as much as they thought they would. Honestly, if it wasn't for a couple bloggers who kept telling me I had to read it, I probably would have overlooked this book at least for a while.<br /><br />What I love about Anna is that she is one of the best well-rounded and realistic characters I have read in a very long time. She is not perfect. She is not a doormat. She is not too cool for her own good. She is just a regular girl who is experiencing this whole new adventure in a new city. I've never been to Paris, and I doubt I'll ever get the chance to go. But Stephanie Perkins writes that place so vividly, I felt like I've already been there. And hey, if I ever want to go re-visit, I can just jump back into the book ;)<br /><br />Then there is St. Claire who you're already sighing a bit over when you first meet him. BUT St. Claire is just an average guy. He's not tall, dark, brooding, and acts like he's the biggest badass around. He's short, funny, laid back, and if I were at that school I'd either be in love with him or his best friend. I prefer the in love part, but you can tell he's just one of those guys who would sit next to you and strike up a conversation no matter who you are.<br /><br />The romantic part of this story is obviously swoon-worthy and the part I really enjoyed. The attraction to St. Claire is there, but it is so well plotted. There are so many \\"almost\\" moments just like in real life. The relationship really does grow in this strong friendship that the two form throughout the school year. The host of friends Anna has were never just in the background to me. They were all so clearly individual and entertaining. Even everything above isn't the only reason why I loved this book. I loved seeing Anna grow from the girl she was when she stepped into that new school in strange city to the girl she became at the end of the story.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkin's writing flows so easily, I was seriously about a hundred pages into the book, and didn't even realize it. She is so well in tune with Anna, you really do feel everything she writes and what Anna goes through. Another thing I wanted to add in is something I've noticed in a lot of books lately where the mention of sex or cursing sometimes goes a bit overboard. What I like about this book is that it was there when it needed to be there. Nothing was over-done.<br /><br />So basically my name is Amber and I am an Anna Fangirl! If you love a wonderfully well-written contemporary novel then you have to get this one. For being a debut author, Stephanie Perkins has blown me away and made me an instant fan. I will definitely be picking up anything she writes next!eeing Anna grow from the girl she was when she stepped into that new school in strange city to the girl she became at the end of the story.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|OK; it's not the Tenth Anniversary \\"Dream\\" cast, but if you like the musical it's well worth purchasing.  There were some performances I liked better in each one, but these failed to detract from my enjoyment of either whole production.     I believe the criticism of Marius is far too extreme, and certainly not something which detracts from my enjoyment of this performance.  However least I be too forgiving, I must say that none of the 25th performers are up to Phillip Quast or Ruthie Henshall (this comment made me go to You-Tube and listen to Ruthie sing \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" and Phillip sing \\"Stars before finishing this review).  That is not to say The 25th singers were in the least wanting.  I thought the young Cosette was better in the 25th, and the Inn-Keeper better in the 10th.    All -in- all a great disk to add to any library.;
0670022411|4.0|I needed an escape and this book did that MOST of the time. I listened to it - have not read the hard copy. I had to stop and listen to something else a couple of times because the main character got irritating (very whiney and immature even though she presents herself as such a strong feminist). Also, the whole story is about the romance between the two characters, perhaps as expected, but just be ready...romance and the constant repeated expression of their love is the pivotal point. The main characters constant expression and re-expression of their love was irritating AND it felt very \\"Twilight-y\\" and \\"Catholic-y\\" because of their continued delay of carnal satisfaction. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot and thinking \\"this is so unrealistic\\" about the romantic interpersonal interactions (which I realize is ridiculous because this is a book about witches, vampires and demons!) The magic and preternatural conceptions were believable enough for fantasy - for the vampires more than the witches - for the witches it is not as good as the Harry Potter series - but believable enough. It does not end - as a previous reviewer stated - it ends at the climax of the story so just be forewarned. 4 Stars because it did capture me for a long while - lost one for the conflicting conception and development of the main character (for my irritation).
B002ZG980U|4.0|This movie is stunning to watch.  The effects are mesmerizing, like dreams themselves.    The way the movie handles dreams is wonderful (although the technique of having characters explain them is a little clunky).    But there are some problems.    First, the male characters are (mostly) one-dimensional.  I love Leonardo DiCaprio, but his relentless intensity gets tedious.  His sidekick's stonefaced stoicism is also a little wearisome. Cillian Murphy's unwavering astonishment is appropriate for the character, but it leaves him shallow.    Much better are Eames, who has several sides, and Watanabe, who evolves interestingly as the movie progresses.    (The two principal females evolve wonderfully.)    But worse than this is the POINT of the whole thing.    All these amazing worlds with their interesting conflicts and tensions are all created so a BIG CORPORATION CAN BE BROKEN UP?????????    Puh-leeze.    Yes, the whiplash world-changes are interesting in themselves, but the final resolution is a big let-down.    OK, the resolution of Cobb's family problems is mildly engrossing (though predictable).  Likewise the return of the ancient Watanabe to life.     But the corporate theme is simply silly.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Kids inside a candy store might not be inspired to eat all the stock if there was someone watching over them making sure they paid for it. Those on Wall Street were those kids and, unfortunately, as the regulating body watching over Wall Street was slowly dismembered during 30 years of deregulation, they went wild proving that what is good for Wall Street (the companies that benefited from selling high risk deriviatives -essentially high risk loans packaged together and \\"sold\\" to pension plans and others as \\"safe\\" in the ultimate example of conning their customers)is bad for United States and world economy.<br /><br />Director Charles Ferguson provides systematically detailed proof of the ultimate swindle and how every time Wall Street introduced \\"new\\" products to make profits as deregulation continued there was a new economic crisis that pulled the world economy into a giant black hole of massive debt, lost jobs and further erosion of the economic gains made by the middle class since World War II.<br /><br />The makers of this documentary point out that virtually none of these CEO's who drove their own companies into the ground, contributing to the destruction of pension plans and other retirement funds were prosecuted--in fact they were often rewarded by companies \\"firing\\" them with millions of dollars of compensation for gambling in a high risk environment. Ferguson's damning documentary narrated by Matt Damon also documents the results of that destructive high risk behavior and reward system that paid those within Wall Street for perpetuating a con job on investors and the general public.<br /><br />As Ferguson points out in his documentary many of these people were rewarded in other ways by administration jobs within government (which is akin to hiring criminals to watch over criminal activity). People complain about the pharameutical industry and the lobbying that they do with government officals and doctors but the real people we need to be concerned about are those on Wall Street. There is a 4 to 1 ratio for lobbyists for various Wall Street interests to each and every representative in government. They are essentially \\"buying\\" our government and then be allowed like those children in the candy store to gobble down every item in the store. Once that child gets sick and vomits all over the store we, the American people have to clean up the mess and pay for it (unlike the UK, France and other countries though our government isn't smart enough to ask for concessions from industry bailing out a failing system without asking for anything--controls or controlling interest--to prevent it from occurring again).<br /><br />\\"Inside Job\\" provides an excellent document of what went wrong and what continues to be wrong in our government and in Wall Street. The confusion that what's good for Wall Street is good for our economy continues to dominate thinking in our government when the opposite has consistently been proven. Those who have run our government for the last 30 years (it doesn't matter what political party they belong to)and people like Alan Greenspan who have argued for LESS control suggesting that the market would control itself (uh-huh)have missed the point; greed rules and greed will always cause those with no common sense to allow criminal activity within Wall Street. What's good for Wall Street is ultimately bad for the world economy.<br /><br />Extras include deleted scenes, a featurette on the making of the film and audio commentary by the makers of the film.<br /><br />\\"Inside Job\\" is highly recommended.There is a 4 to 1 ratio for lobbyists for various Wall Street interests to each and every representative in government.

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I LOVED this movie!  I cannot believe the overall rating is only 3 stars.  Unbelievable! The minute I left the theatre, I was calling my friends to see if they wanted to go the next night and see it. I wanted to see it again for at least a week afterwards.<br /><br />This movie is simple and elegant, which unfortunately is unusual for the 21st century, but I found it to be VERY refreshing.  There is mystery, sex appeal, comedy, romance, drama and action throughout the entire film.  And the storyline is actually BELIEVABLE, something else that the 21st century has abandoned.  I'm a 30yr old woman and I have to say, even I couldnt keep my eyes off Angelina. And what woman could take their eyes off of Johnny?  They were a brilliant combination!<br /><br />I will say that when I went to see the film, I had other expectations of the movie, based on what I saw on the trailers but I was pleasantly surprise to find out my expectations were misplaced.  That alone made the experience of the movie much more pleasurable.  I didn't know everything that was going to happen because the trailers had all the good parts of the movie in it, like just about every other movie I have seen.  I rarely go to the movies because I dont feel like paying $30 to eat popcorn and sit with strangers who may or may not talk through the movie and cant pause it if I have to go to the bathroom, when I can easily wait a few months and spend $5 to rent it.  I go for movies that I think would be better in a theatre.  This is not a movie that I would have needed to see in a theatre, HOWEVER, I am very glad that I did.<br /><br />For me, its a MUST SEE.
0670022411|1.0|Really, really, really bad.  I love fantasy novels.....but I guess I'll just stick to R.R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson and Patrick Rothfuss for now, because this woman cannot write herself out of a paper bag.  I never skim a novel, but I found myself on page 200 wondering when something was going to happen.  There seemed to be no point to the painful drawing out of the story line.  So once I started skimming I was able to deal with it better.  If you skim from 200-400......then it's slightly endurable.  I had to finish because I hate not finishing a book but I really couldn't believe how horrible this book was.  It felt like some romance novel I used to read in high school without the sex and decent cheesey plotline.  NOTHING HAPPENS!!!!!!  I hated both of the main characters......Do not waste your time.....RIDICULOUS......
B004SBS8LA|2.0|game is bright and vivid  but it keeps crashing at 11 fix it i would love to keep playing because angry birds is a lot of fun
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The book has a bit of a clunky start--but do not give up!!!  The world created here is amazingly deep and clear.  I loved the characters--both the main characters and the secondary--and I was impressed with the author's ability to blend just the right amount of romance with suspense and paranormal.  Very well done.  There are a few times when I worried that the author might take the story on a road too dark or depressing for me to follow, but Harkness never let me down.  I was thrilled to read a story with such a rich historical awareness and a strong sense of the way that history, science, and literature blend to create our conceptualization of the world.  Can't wait for the next book in the series.
0143038419|1.0|I don't support non-fiction, autobiographical literature featuring immoral,narcisistic authors. Why do people want to help her pursuit of fame and fortune as a writer by purchasing this book? It was loaned to me, and I couldn't wait to get it out of my house. The author is so self-absorbed and self-pitying that it is stunning. Her first husband is one lucky man to be rid of her, and hopefully he overcame the psychological damage she caused him. Our world is in real trouble when this trash is so elevated that it becomes a movie.
B004TNGLW0|5.0|At first I was shocked by the outrageous asking price because I didn't realize that they were going to provide a humidor to keep the $999.00 disc safe from the effects of dehydration. Now I don't have to go out and buy a humidor for the dvd which would have added another $600-$1200 to the total price of keeping this timeless classic moist and supple. It is strange however that the label on the DVD was not designed to withstand humid environments as it got soggy and fell apart after several weeks, seems like a $1000 DVD should have water resistant labels. Either way I would totally recommend it to a friend or co worker!

B003TJR2HS|5.0|The dock extender works as advertised.  My iPhone would not fit into any of my many iPhone/iPod accessories because of the case I added to protect the phone.  This extender solved the problem and it works perfectly.  It raises the phone out of the cradle just enough to provide adequate clearance.  Charging, playback, synchronization functions all work as if the iPhone were directly connected to the cradle.
0670022411|4.0|I loved this book that was an adult version of Harry Potter and Twilight with a dose of history and romance.  Intimidating 500+ pages until you pick it up then you realize it's not long enough.  Great read.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|\\"Sucker Punch\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Close your eyes. Open your mind. You will be unprepared. A young girl's dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality. Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will, but Babydoll has not lost her will to survive. Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls--the outspoken Rocket, the street-smart Blondie, the fiercely loyal Amber and the reluctant Sweet Pea - to band together and try to escape their terrible fate at the hands of their captors, Blue, Madam Gorski and the High Roller. Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual arsenal at their disposal. Together, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man, their unbelievable journey - if they succeed - will set them free.     The cast led by Emily Browning (as Babydoll), Abbie Cornish (as Sweet Pea), Jena Malone (as Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens (as Blondie), Jamie Chung (as Amber), Carla Gugino (as Dr. Vera Gorski), Oscar Issac (as Blue), Jon Hamm (as High Roller / Doctor) & Scott Glenn (as Wise Man) is great. The directing by Zack Snyder (also produced) (who also directed \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" (2004), \\"300\\" (2007, also wrote the screenplay), \\"Watchmen\\" (2009), \\"Legend Of The Guardians: The Owls Of Ga'Hoole\\" (2010) & the upcoming \\"Superman: Man Of Steel\\" (2012) is great. The story by Snyder & the screenplay by Snyder & Steve Shibuya is great.     The music by Tyler Bates (who also did the music to \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\", \\"300\\", \\"Watchmen\\", the upcoming \\"Super\\" (2011), \\"The Darkest Hour\\" (2011) & \\"Conan The Barbarian\\" (2011) & Marius De Vries (who also did the music, recently to \\"Kick-Ass\\" (2010) is excellent. The cinematography by Larry Fong (who also did the cinematography to \\"300\\", \\"Watchmen\\" & the upcoming \\"Super 8\\" (2011) is great. The film editing by William Hoy (who also did the film editing to \\"300\\", \\"Watchmen\\") is great. The casting by Kristy Carlson (who also did the casting to \\"Watchmen\\", \\"Legend Of The Guardians: The Owls Of Ga'Hoole\\", the upcoming \\"Happy Feet 2 In 3D\\" (2011) & \\"Superman: Man Of Steel\\"), Michelle Allen (who also did the casting to \\"Red Riding Hood\\" (2011) & Lora Kennedy (who also did the casting, recently to \\"The Town\\" (2010) & the upcoming \\"Superman: Man Of Steel\\") is great. The production design by Rick Carter (who also did the production design, recently to \\"Avatar\\" (2009, for which he won a Oscar) & the upcoming \\"War Horse\\" (2011) is excellent. The art direction by Patrick Banister (who also did the art direction, recently to \\"Orphan\\" (2009) & the upcoming \\"The Thing\\" (2011), Todd Cherniawsky (who also did the art direction, recently to \\"Avatar\\" (2009), \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" (2010), the upcoming \\"Now\\" (2011) & \\"Oz: The Great And Powerful\\" (2013), he also did the set design to \\"The Polar Express\\" (2004), \\"Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events\\" (2004), \\"War Of The Worlds\\" (2005), \\"Monster House\\" (2006), \\"Superman Returns\\" (2006), \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" (2007) & \\"Beowulf\\" (2007), he also did the production design to \\"Ginger Snaps\\" (2000), \\"Ginger Snaps: Unleashed\\" (2004), \\"Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning\\" (2004) & \\"Splice\\" (2010), Stefan Dechant (who also did the art direction, recently to \\"Avatar\\", \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" & \\"True Grit\\" (2010) & Grant Van Der Slagt (who also did the art direction, recently to \\"Night At The Museum: Battle At The Smithsonian\\" (2009), \\"Tron: Legacy\\" (2010), the upcoming \\"Rise Of The Apes\\" (2011) & \\"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\\" (2011), also did work on \\"Watchmen\\" (set designer) is excellent. The costume design by Michael Wilkinson (who also did the costume design to \\"300\\", \\"Watchmen\\" & recently to \\"Terminator Salvation\\" (2009), \\"Tron: Legacy\\" & the upcoming \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Parts 1 & 2\\" (2011 & 2012) is excellent.     This is a great action-packed ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat and your heart racing. This is an entertaining and fast-paced ride. Zack Snyder has made another great movie that is right near \\"300\\", \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" & \\"Watchmen\\".

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love Angry Birds, and who doesn't? Angry Birds Rio is another great installment of a great game. My kids, 15 and 10, love having it to play when waiting at restaurants, stores, and other boring places! We play it on my Droid Incredible and have never experienced any lag time or problems with adds using any of the Angry Birds games, and this is true of Rio as well. Amazon App store installed easily and the game installation was also a breeze. Love that Amazon saves directly to the SD card, as I always have to move apps from phone to SD manually for most items on Android market.

1591843790|5.0|I read through this book in less than a week, taking notes on all the great examples of how to create a better work atmosphere and enchant your customers, regardless of whether you are a manager or an employee.<br /><br />Guy Kawasaki has an engaging writing style that makes you want to be friends with him, and he even says that this is one of the steps towards enchanting your followers. He makes sure that you see real world examples of how other have applied these steps and how they worked out.<br /><br />Enchantment is not just about creating a customer base, it is about connecting with your followers and making sure you know what they really want. Remember to listen.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone, from entrepreneurs to CEOs. It will show you a way to make your brand and your identity a little more exciting, and definitely more engaging.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|This is one of those films that divide the audience. The spread between one and five star ratings here is impressive. Many of the one-star reviews were written by people who had no clue what they had seen. No arguing with that, but one wonders why they want to write reviews. Most of them have no argument other than that they did not understand anything. Why not just go home and be quiet?<br /><br />This is really a horror film, but it requires a basic level of cinematographic literacy to notice that. I am myself not entirely comfortable with the open-endedness of the script. I will accept critical voices that find theoretical fault with the plot.<br />Terrible and weird things happen and are not explained. We can figure out our own theory and are probably expected to do that. Is that legitimate? I will leave that open, which implies that I would have preferred a less open ending.<br /><br />A man narrates events that he observed as a younger man. He was a school teacher somewhere in a village in North Germany, probably Mecklenburg (though the lack of dialect in a farming village is a little irritating.) The village is ruled by the Baron (a Junker with marriage issues), his administrator (an immigrant from Bavaria, the only one with a dialect), the pastor (a harsh but basically loving man), and the medical doctor (a monster, as we will find out). The economic structure is rather feudal. We are in the run up to WW1. What starts now will change everything for ever. We feel an ominous threat hanging over daily life.<br /><br />Things happen, e.g. a trap is set for the doctor, who barely survives a horse riding accident; a little boy is abducted and beaten; a farmer's wife dies working in an unsafe working place. These are the things that we are told about, by the narrator. The narrator divides his job with the camera. The camera tells us other horrors: the pastor's cruel punishment of his children, the doctor's verbal abuse of his householder and physical abuse of his daughter, the baron's attempt at verbal intimidation of his wife, the administrator's violence against his children..<br />Things are not fully explained. Is the open ending realistic? You bet. Most mysteries in life remain unexplained, at least for a while, and when the explanation is there, the ones who wanted it are sometimes not taking notice. That does not require me to be happy with it.<br /><br />Austrian director Michael Haneke is one who upsets film audiences and who likes to confuse them. I loathed his Funny Games, while I was quite impressed by his Cach&eacute;. This film was an Oscar candidate for best foreign film, but it did not win.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of futuristic novels or movies. And while there are certain aspects of this series that certainly poke into the science fiction realm... the majority of the series is much more focused on the storyline and relationships between each of the characters. With such vivid descriptions and rapid character development you are quickly immersed into a story that you will never forget; a story that will plunge you into the deepest, darkest corners of human dignity, courage, survival, and love. You'll fall in love with every character and every relationship.    From beginning to end I could not put the books down. I was consistently surprised over and over again. These books will be, by far, at the top of my favorites for a long time to come.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Inside Job discusses how the world was convinced that deregulation was the answer. The movie/documentary starts off by showing Iceland, a productive country which had strict regulations against pollution, and a huge public sector was persuaded to privatize their financial sector. The movie lays blame on Iceland's collapse on deregulation.<br /><br />The movie doesn't go easy on anyone including President Obama, who promised financial sector regulations, but never fulfilled his promise. This movie doesn't discriminate against the left or right, and is well balanced in that respect. The interviewer doesn't let anyone off the hook, and always brings up the \\"R\\" word to the interviewee. The narrator, Matt Damon educates us on how the top private sector financial bankers have been hired by government to make sure regulations that have been stripped through the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act are never brought back, and how deregulation is defended at every turn. There are also a lot of entertaining cut scenes with music that keeps the movie entertaining. The movie is one of the best documentaries on the collapse, and is very clear and simple to understand. The blu-ray quality is HD throughout.

Don't get me wrong I love all Disney movies and I enjoyed so much Toy Story 3 & Princess & the Frog, but something about this movie that I just can't get enough. I love all of the characters! It's funny, classy and will definitely take your heart away! I'm like a little girl telling all my friends and family to watch this movie. It's an amazing movie for all ages, I really love it.

0891419063|5.0|Top notch first hand accounts of war are hard to swallow. These men are heroic. These Pacific WWII battles were bloody and ruthless. The soldiers were put through tremendous stress of every kind. They went up against a fanatical, well equipped, disciplined Japanese army. They performed in ways that make us so very proud and leave a giant frog in your throat holding back the wave of emotions so justly provoked. Sledgehammer is a private in the Marines. Considering what he's asked to accomplish and endure he is amazingly humble, unjaded, self-effacing and yet fully capable of describing the battles, his own actions and those of his \\"brothers\\". He is equally classy in NOT indentifying by name those soldiers whose actions in battle are shameful but he does not hide it from us either.<br /><br />We have some really beautiful (trying to find the appropriate word) accounts of the Vietnam War and some new writing recently on Korea but first hand accounts of a realistic nature about WWII, particularly the Pacific theater are far fewer. One reason may be the extreme trauma that the men went through has made it much harder to explain and express.<br /><br />Mr. Sledge finally had this published in the 1980's. He has continued to reach new readers now for almost 30 years. It's a well paced, deeply compelling personal history. He reflects on his actions. He explains everything in gruesome detail yet he somehow does not lose his humanness, maybe innocence that is almost impossible to believe he retains. He's remarkable and we're richer for the book he's written.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|For anyone who has seen this show, it is a classic tale of love, forgiveness and humanity. Even if you're a traditionilist and have seen the show with its original cast, the performers here are just as good and needless to say, the music is timeless, classic, and inspiring.
B00000JTB2|4.0|A very good archival gem from the past. Great Blues guitar playing. I wish that Albert would have shut up and just played. His remarks and asides are irritating and you can see that he had a big fat ego. Stevie just laughs it off and plays.
1573229725|5.0|Sarah Waters' \\"Fingersmith\\" is nothing short of the work of a genius. The plot twists you never see coming, the two sympathetic main characters all bring this author's world to life like few books ever have to me. One cannot really write a proper review without giving anything away, and THAT would be criminal to do so, but suffice to say Waters' thorough research brings to life a long-forgotten era in England, and her two heroines are such a rare treat I wish I could forget I read the book and do it all over again.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|As so many have commented, this is a great sci-fi series.  Some people should have been fired at Fox for their 15sec attention span.  I have become a fan of Castle and it's characters so I went searching for prior work of Nathan F., I was not disappointed.  Really enjoyed the mix of humor and the characters are so interesting.  Sad to see once again those in charge at Fox shot themselves in the foot by cancelling this series (remember Dark Angel).  This one could have gone for some time.  Glad to join the large fan club of Firefly!!!!
B004G6009U|2.0|i absolutely loved princess and the frog, i thought Tiana was the most independent, insightful, and real princess of them all, a great role model for my daughters, then \\"tangled\\" followed. Disney has decided to produce a princess movie with yet another stupid blond princess, who is \\"waiting to be saved\\". where are the powerful, and intelligent princesses at? where is the message that education is power? or working independently is what you should do? there isn't any! not only does the princess in this story wait for her savior, she waits for a thief, yeah Disney that's a great message, i can't wait for my daughters to grow up and come home with felons. i am tired of Disney taking classic tragic tails and turning them into garbage. these tails where tragic for a reason, beacuse they had messages and morals behind them, Disney doesn't include any of them. Disney you worked wonders with princess and the frog, what the hell happened? the only good part of the movie was the lantern scene, otherwise this movie was pretty tragic when compared to the princess and the frog. i still have to buy the damn movie or my daughters will throw a fit... Disney i hate you.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Director Lasse Hallstrom has given us a truly remarkable film about a loyal dog, inspired by the real story.  Transporting the locale from Japan to Rhode Island, HACHI is a beautifully crafted movie that truly captures the unbreakable bond between a pet and his master without descending into maudlin...it's a major accomplishment.<br />I find nothing wrong with this film.  It's obvious that the dogs are the real \\"stars\\" but the humans are fine as well.  Richard Gere proves his versatility and is supported by Joan Allen, Sarah Roemer, Jason Alexander et al.  The score by Jan Kaczmarek is beautiful; the cinematography is gorgeous.<br />i suggest you grab a box of tissues and savor this remarkable tearjerker.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|works pretty well on hardwood or tile but not on carpet.  Had to go over the same spot several times and then sometimes it still wouldn't sweep it up.  Would not recommend.
0312600844|3.0|I agree with many of the negative reviews.  The book is certainly needlessly long.  Take, for example, the second to last chapter, the reprise of Patty's autobiography, where we get an extended visit with her family.  This rolls on for 75 pages or so. These characters contribute very little to the overall story, and by the time they reappear here in the story, I had to strain to remember who they even were, they'd disappeared so thoroughly for the past several hundred pages.  It was especially ill-placed in the story, given that a reader like me had set aside an evening eagerly looking forward to the last 150 pages or so, where I anticipated a good climax to a great story and instead read for an hour about characters that were peripheral to the story.<br /><br />Other criticisms--the political-speak is clunky.  I imagine that Franzen's politics and mine might be more or less in alignment, yet his attempts to put politics into the novel came across as forced at every turn.  This seems to really represent a greater flaw here.  Franzen doesn't trust the reader to know anything on his own, so he feels the need to spell out every little item in endless detail.  Give the reader some credit.  Put some ideas in dialogue.<br /><br />At times, though, Franzen really nailed things.  As a UVA alum, I can attest that Franzen nailed the student body there, the odd combination of innate ability with empty-headed right-wing politics that serve to prepare for careers in greed.<br /><br />Why brilliant?<br /><br />Franzen is, to my mind, a master of human storytelling.  Quite simply, I felt for Patty and Walter, their human failings, their frustrated sexuality, misunderstandings, and mistakes in raising their children.  It really does seem to resonate with the American human condition in the new century, for whatever that might be worth.

B003EYVXTG|1.0|Welcome to a film where not much happens. Not in the beginning. Not in the middle. Not at the end. Not ever. I'm thinking that the working title for this film could have been something like, \\"Cavalcade Of White Trash Tweaker Hillbillies On Parade In Their Natural Element\\" or something like that. It was kind of like a National Geographic Special but one that's gone even further off-the-grid than usual, right here at home in the good ole USA where in the backwoods and hollers of the Ozark Mountains, meth is the new moonshine. Geez, I was seriously planning to buy a vacation home in the Ozarks but after watching this film, I better call my real estate guy there, Cletus, and tell him to forget it now because it really looks like before I move there I better become a tweaker or a meth cook first if I ever want to fit in with everybody else in the neighborhood and MAN, that fitting-in part ain't gonna be an easy thing to do because these people apparently hate and distrust strangers just about as much as they hate and distrust their own blood kin and in THIS movie anyway, (and the old Li'l Abner comics, I'm pretty sure) apparently everybody in the Ozarks is blood kin to EVERYBODY and don't nobody trust nobody NO HOW! What a fun bunch! Foreboding, beneath-the-eyebrow glares and sinister, kill-you-soon-as-look-at-you stares abound from every single stereotypical, white-trash, male or female extra on the screen! And the sun 'most never shines in them there Ozarks 'cause apparently, \\"Mr. Sun, your kind ain't welcome 'round these parts.\\" ***SPOILER ALERT*** Here's the plot: \\"Have you seen my father?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"Have you seen my father?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"Have you seen my father?\\" \\"No.\\" which FINALLY, after WAAAAY too much of THAT, eventually turns into, \\"Have you seen my father?\\" BANG! POW! BOOM! WHAP! as the blood-kin-on-blood-kin, thumping-up party lustfully begins! \\"Hey, I got your missing father right HERE! Take THAT! And THAT! And THAT! And THAT!\\" Then, just before somebody can bust a cap in her noggin, (more than likely with some sort of hundred-year-old muzzleloader or something like that 'cause I am telling YOU, these here is some damm backward livin' folk!) the tweaker cavalry shows up, TAH DAH, and saves the none-the-less still depressing-as-hell day. Oh yeah, don't forget the bag of free money from out of the blue. Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure the sun WAS shining for that bag-of-money scene.

B00005U122|5.0|WOW.  I read most of the reviews.  Looked good, but kept waffleing.  Loved Floyd when I was younger and Waters' solo albums.  Finally clicked and got the DVD last night.  Can't believe I hadn't added this to my library earlier.  Lots of old Floyd numbers (You know them all), one really old one (you might not know), lots of newer Waters stuff that'll make you think.  If you like Pink Floyd and appreciate Waters creativity, don't hesitate.  Get yours.  You won't regret it.

0800141660|4.0|Despite the fact that much of Austen's language from \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is not included in this film, the spirit and soul of her characters and plot remain. Since this was Austen's first attempt at writing, much of her language is stilted to the modern ear and Ms. Thompson's rewrite for the screenplay makes it flow in a more sensible fashion. It's filmed in loving detail by Ang Lee, saturated in light, Kate Winslet's Marianne and Emma Thompson's Elinor shine in their roles as siblings and the complications that arise from that relationship. A \\"new\\" sister, Margaret, is added to explain the culture of the period as she blurts out questions that the modern audience may be thinking to have the family answer.<br /><br />Imelda Staunton and Hugh Laurie as the Palmers are a wonderful foil to the rather silly manners of the day and Greg Wise provides a delicious villian as the rogue Willoughby. Hugh Grant as love interest Edward is underplayed; this role was cast before his big splash in \\"Notting Hill.\\" And Alan Rickman as Marianne's suitor was just lovely.<br /><br />Yes, this is chick flick-no explosions, no one killed, no blood. Just a story about human relationships, overcoming adversity, and a bit of romance.
1582701709|2.0|I purchased this for my sister for her birthday, based on a recommendation from a mutual friend.  My sister lost a son in Iraq in 2005.  She says she appreciates the thought behind my purchase, but thinks that saying out loud \\"I want my son alive again\\" over and over is not too realistic and that she doesn't believe in this kind of stuff.  I am disappointed that she didn't like it and that I didn't research the book before purchasing it.  :(
B000026EV6|5.0|Suede kicked off the Britpop explosion of the 1990s with a series of classic singles (The Drowners, Metal Mickey, Animal Nitrate, Stay Together) that were filled with embarrassingly outstanding B sides and a classic debut album. They returned with 1994s Dog Man Star, which is their undoubted masterpiece. The album was written and recorded as the band was falling apart, and guitarist/co-songwriter Bernard Butler famously departed just before the album's completion. When it was released, it was overshadowed by the latest offerings from Blur and Oasis. It was unfairly overshadowed. It is a brilliant, moody, yes, occasionally pretentious record, but early Suede actually wear pretentious quite well. The album's dark, somewhat insular mood made it a world removed from the brash, fun music that their contemporaries released at the time. There are so many highlights of this album from which to choose, but The Wild Ones, Daddy's Speeding, New Generation, The 2 of Us, Black or Blue, the amazing Asphalt World, Still Life, and \\"hidden track\\" Modern Boys are all outstanding. This is a very interesting record, that becomes increasingly compelling with repeated listens. Listening to this makes you wonder what songwriting team Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler might have been capable of in the way of immediate follow ups had their partnership not fractured. Suede would go on to Britpop success with Coming Up, and Anderson and Butler briefly mended fences as The Tears (whose record is also terrific) a decade later, but still...

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Runs great on my Archos 101 tablet. Almost looks 3D compared to the prior angry birds games. I love trying to save the birds from the Rio movie and now I want to see the movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a great new version of Angry Birds.  It isn't just an &quot;upgrade&quot;, in fact it has new game elements.  People who are giving this game one star just because they don't like that's app store are bring silly.  It's a good game.  And I for one have no issues with the app store.    Its probably because of the Amazon atp store that this game is FREE with NO ADS!!

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I purchased Vol. 1 of a number of boxed sets of highly-rated TV series to resell at my shop. On one exceptionally slow day, I could find no \\"make work,\\" so I randomly selected a dvd to take a look at. The zombies must've been with me that day, for it wasn't more than a few minutes until I was hooked. I had no clue at the time who had produced it or on which cable outlet it appeared. I just knew it wasn't done on a shoe-string budget, nor was it appropriate for television (I wonder what time this program aired on AMC?). Incredibly, I actually found myself getting ticked-off when (much-needed) customers dared to enter my domain!     I finished watching the last episode the next day and, as soon as I got home that night, I went online to order the COMPLETE series. When I found out this was the ONLY one out of the dozen or so I ordered that just had one season under its belt, I almost blew a gasket.    At the risk of ruffling the feathers of the few who gave \\"Walking Dead\\" low marks, I'll say this: If you like zombie  movies, there is a 100% chance you will love this series. If you can't stand zombie movies, there is a far better than average chance that you will love this series! The acting is a-one. The subplots are intriguing. Direction is professional.      Guess we'll have to wait until Autumn to see the next episode? Sure hope they get a whole lot more in the can next time around. This thing is Awesome with a capital \\"A,\\" and I'm being redundant! Let them zombies roll, 10-4.

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this film, great entertainment value.  It is refreshing to see a caper/intrigue film that doesn't rely on sped-up action sequences to maintain interest.  Unlike the bombastic (and reality-challenged) Bourne films and similar, this is a character-driven film.  It is a pleasure to watch Depp in particular; the pitch of the American math teacher in Venice is pitch-perfect and hilarious.  Despite the poor British accent, Angelina Jolie plays the leading lady well.
0316017922|4.0|March 27, 2011  Dear Malcolm Gladwell,   Your book, Outliers, has brought to my attention as to the length of degree that time and place determines a person's success. The various claims and information that you have taken into consideration proved that the time a person was born and where the person grew up greatly affects the success they will have in the future. Taking advantage of that success is a whole other story, as you have said. The purpose of me reading this book is for my Senior English class where we are currently contemplating the question, to what extent do time and place define a person? Throughout the course we are studying religions, diversities, and other various topics that participate in how a people live and how they reflect on their life. Overall, time and place are the essentials as to how a person is defined. Success, which is determined on time and place, also contributes a major part in how a person is defined, as it is intelligently described in your book. I greatly enjoyed reading Outliers; the points you are making about how success creates an outlier deeply explains how time and place causes a person to be more successful than others.    One of the chapters that I found interesting was the chapter about Harlan, Kentucky. The concept of the culture of honor fascinates me for I never knew that being aggressive and more assertive was inherited through genes. I understand that being brought up in the south has influences on the way a person behaves, but I never realized that a person living in the north with southern ancestors could have inherited the same personality. After reading your chapter about culture of honor and cultural legacies, proves that a person can inherit a gene for aggressiveness. Due to this assertive behavior, people with the culture of honor are more prone to reaching success because they have the drive and the attitude to defend themselves and to achieve their goals.    Another chapter that I found informative was the chapter about the reason for the Korean plane crashes. The respect that the co-pilots show for their elders should not be presented when flying a plane. It must be understood that the pilot is just as likely to make a mistake as a co-pilot. I'm glad you addressed this because it shows a lot of how culture plays a part in everyday life and how important it is to voice one's opinions even if it is expressed to his or her elder. I feel that the cultures such as the Koreans need to learn that a person's life is more important than showing respect towards elders. Once they started to practice more communication skills, their crash rates lowered, making them more successful. This chapter proves that sometimes culture and tradition can get in the way of being successful.    I also enjoyed reading the chapter about the IQ's of Langan and Oppenheimer. Because Oppenheimer grew up in a wealthier area than Langan, he had more experience with asserting himself, resulting him to go farther in his career with an extremely high IQ. Langan had an equally high IQ as Oppenheimer but because he was raised in a poor farm setting, he did not take advantage of his intelligence and to prove to others that he was capable of greatness. In this chapter you are trying to state how the place where a person grows up in determines success. Although Langan did not have the skills to force his opinions due to the fact that he was brought up in a lower class community, he was not able to achieve the potential success he could have gained from his intelligence. Being brought up in a higher class community, such as Oppenheimer, people are taught to voice their opinions, causing more success for the future. I think it is interesting that the way that a person is brought up and taught to act, determines how much success they will gain, no matter their IQ level.    I can personally relate to the chapter that focuses on the success a person will have due to the time of the year they were born. In my early elementary years, I found myself lagging behind all the other kids in my grade. After reading your book, I realize it was due to the fact that I was born in July and the cut-off date in my school is early September, making me one of the youngest kids in my grade. The older kids who were born in late September or early October had an advantage over me because they had more capabilities to comprehend more information than my age would allow me to. I'm glad I read this book because now that it was the time I was born that was affecting my learning, not my abilities in general.    The book Outliers has really informed me about the factors that lead to success. It never came to mind how time, place, and culture affect the rates and possibilities of success. I am thankful that I was fortunate to read your book and am looking forward to read another one of your works in the future.   Sincerely,  Jess Hamilton
B000R7HY0K|5.0|A temptation some critics have with great director is to build them up only to tear them down. They often have a point as you don't want a director to get too big an ego and Tarantino does have his failings (e.g. the climactic scene in [[ASIN:B0002849JI Kill Bill 2]]).<br />However, what once a director has been knocked off his pedestal, critics then see everything else he does through a lens of failure.<br /><br />This film, although not as vivid and brilliant as Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown is still a good film with enough decent dialogue and plot to make for very entertaining viewing. And as a homage to road movies such as [[ASIN:B0000695JO Vanishing Point]] and [[ASIN:B000803PRC Bullitt]] it succeeds in having both good car chase sequences AND a good plot to go with it.<br /><br />So, if you're dreading that this film is going to a lemon and think that it should be overlooked, then do remember that Tarantino is still a first class director and is much more worthy of your time than the works of 90% of the other movies out there.<br />Maybe directors do lose their edge with time, but a bad album from Abba is still better than a good album from Bucks Fizz...
0670022411|5.0|I won't repeat story line, etc. The rest of the reviews have done that.  D. Harkness uses humor, good writing, and a slow, in-depth build to create a fun story. Slow is not necessarily boring. I liked the buildup...the background...the sometimes subtle humor. As for witch Diana Biship's 'impossible' characteristics, WHY NOT? In this alternate reality setting, Harkness can do as she wants with her characters. Superman was 'super' too and he's quite a successful character. Witch Biship breaks through social and outside-imposed boundaries as she discovers her super-self. And discovers love for Matthew. Perhaps readers who want strict 'reality' should read the work of other, less imaginative authors. And it's clear that more books are forthcoming. The story isn't over. Yea!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I've heard about half of 2008's [[ASIN:B0018QOIXU 19]] and enjoyed most of it. So here I am, reviewing her second outing, making this the first review that I've written on anything Adele, period.<br /><br />ROLLING IN THE DEEP -- This song has grown on me immensely. At first, I wasn't crazy about it, but what really stuck out as bad was the chorus. Not so anymore. Good song. Builds nicely. First single. ****1/4<br /><br />RUMOUR HAS IT -- Just simply don't like this one as much as any of the others. The chorus is very repetitive but I love the ending which took me a while to catch! ***1/2<br /><br />TURNING TABLES -- Decent, but not mind-blowing. ****<br /><br />DON'T YOU REMEMBER -- Simple, yet it works. I really LOVE this one. The chorus and the wonderful bright bridge are the highlights for me. *****<br /><br />SET FIRE TO THE RAIN -- Pleasant and has the best Adele note I've ever heard near the tail of the song. ****1/4<br /><br />HE WON'T GO -- Good song. Kinda catchy. Better than SET FIRE TO THE RAIN (that one is a little repetitive for my tastes). ****1/4.<br /><br />TAKE IT ALL -- This is definitely the first stunning track on the album I heard initially. Pretty breathtaking. ****3/4<br /><br />I'LL BE WAITING -- Oh my. This one is upbeat and fun. And not in an empty, mindless way. It fits right in with the break up songs, but it has more of a positive outlook on it all. ****1/4<br /><br />ONE AND ONLY -- A good mid-tempo about wanting the one for you to forget their past and just be with you. I love the verses here. ****1/4<br /><br />LOVESONG -- Very simple yet quite effective. These words seem like they can only come from a Taurus (Adele and I have the same zodiac sign). Strangely enough, this is a cover originally sung by the band The Cure. ****1/2<br /><br />SOMEONE LIKE YOU -- Well! I have the live version and heard that in full first, and must say that this version is very close to it, but the main difference is that this version is much faster which I like more. But otherwise, this song is nearly identical to the live version that took place in Adele's home. ****1/2<br /><br />I found the beginning to be kinda weak and the middle and end to be the strongest part of this collection of songs. Adele is back and better than ever! Some of these tracks really surprised me!! Lastly, I'd like to say that this is yet another break-up album.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|This film is so manipulative, guys and girls, but it's also so much fun. If you're in the mood for romantic comedies that don't shy away from rampant sentimentality and that go for those big finishes in which the romantic score soars on cue, then LOVE ACTUALLY is your huckleberry. I won't beat around the bush. I love this movie, love it for many reasons.<br /><br />First, it takes place during the holidays, a time when - according to these characters - one must tell the truth and one is allowed those extravagant gestures. Director Richard Curtis's inspiration for this film originated from when he languished at the L.A.X. airport for hours and - by dint of witnessing all the folks hugging and kissing - arrived at the mini-epiphany that \\"Hey, love really is all around.\\" LOVE ACTUALLY, featuring a legitimately all-star cast, tracks its many characters thru the four weeks leading up to Christmas as they struggle and find and lose love. There are at least nine story threads - I just tried counting them off in my brain - and they occasionally interweave.<br /><br />All story arcs not being equal, Hugh Grant is featured in the flashiest one. He plays the new British Prime Minister who arrives at his bailiwick and is instantly smitten with the earthy food caterer (played by a delightful Martine McCutcheon). To give Hugh his props, hands down the best moment in the film is when his Prime Minister stands up to the semi-slimy U.S. president during a press conference. Two other prominent threads revolve around the unexpected romance between a reserved writer (Colin Firth) holidaying in France and his quiet Portuguese cleaning woman and Liam Neeson's grieving widower left to raise a young step-son who's fallen in love with a girl in his school.<br /><br />But love isn't all bright and heady, exciting and new. Sometimes, it's melancholy and dreadful and gut-wrenching. Emma Thompson is phenomenal in a supporting role, playing a wife of long standing who is suddenly ambushed by her husband's infidelity. Laura Linley sacrifices her chance at romance to be there for her needy institutionalized brother. Keira Knightley is the focus of unrequited love, and she and Andrew Lincoln provide my second favorite moment from this film. The sequence at the door step in which a luminous Keira is silently serenaded by Andrew Lincoln's cue cards is simultaneously heartbreaking and romantic as fucl&lt;.<br /><br />Rowan Atkinson has a nice cameo as a jewelry salesman, and it's probably best that Curtis refrained from portraying him as literally an angel (Curtis admits this in the audio commentary). Bill Nighy steals all the scenes as the aging and very blunt-talking rock star who gets one last shot at glory with his Christmas jingle. The sub-plot with that British bloke raring to go to America to find true love, I didn't think that was going anywhere. But damn if it didn't have a nice payoff. I think the only one left I haven't mentioned is the arc with the two actor stand-ins, and now I've mentioned it. That one also has its sweet moments, which is rather a coup, considering that a segment featuring a persistently naked couple engaged in simulating the deed could be construed as a bit sleazy.<br /><br />LOVE ACTUALLY is a sprawling narrative which covers a wide romantic spectrum. Don't be put off by the huge cast because you'll find yourself invested in quite a few of the characters. This is absolutely a chick flick, but, for the manly men, the funny does come in frequent like clock work. Hugh Grant is again very good, with his Prime Minister dance and that bit where he goes down the block, knocking at every door, looking for his food caterer. I do have one neggy, though. I think it's stretching it a bit that Colin Firth's writer and his Portuguese girl can be in such conversational synch while speaking two different languages and not comprehending each other. But perhaps the point is that love is universal and can hurdle silly obstacles such as language barriers and Colin Firth being very British and therefore a bloody cold fish. See what I did there? I reasoned it out and so saved the movie's internal logic. Huzzah!<br /><br />My favorite line here, by the way, is sub-titled: \\"Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.\\" Heh.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus features: Audio Commentary with actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, and Thomas Sangster and director Richard Curtis (worth it alone for Hugh's good-natured but relentless ribbing of Colin Firth); 10 Deleted Scenes with intro by Richard Curtis (totaling 00:37:14 minutes); \\"The Music of LOVE ACTUALLY\\" - Richard Curtis introduces the songs used to score the film and then the DVD cuts to the actual scenes featuring these songs; and Kelly Clarkson's music video \\"The Trouble With Love Is.\\"riers and Colin Firth being very British and therefore a bloody cold fish.

1591843790|5.0|I first heard about Guy Kawasaki as Seth Godin mentioned him in one of his blog posts.  Like all of the people Seth talks about, Guy has something really special... Drive, passion, and the will to change things in the most compelling manner ever.    I cannot define clearly how I feel now that I've read \\"Enchantment\\". I have gained a huge amount of knowledge but didn't put it into use yet. Not because I'm afraid, but because we're Sunday evening!    The book is clearly written, without any boring fluffy words, but with a sharp sense of humor very close to mine. I love fresh approaches and non-periphrasing, so it was a huge bowl of inspiring air.    I felt a strong connection with it as I read it. It grew so big that...     This book is like a hangover, without the headache! It's a party without naysayers, a wedding without gossip. Can one ask for more or better?    Guy has written many succesful books, and I know why they were and still are so appreciated: he enchanted readers!
0515141429|3.0|This was a pretty good adventure/thriller/action book, but I have to agree with some of the negative comments I've read from other reviewers.  It does require an inordinate amount of \\"suspension of disbelief\\", especially considering the number of murders that occurred in this small town over a very short period of time (including federal agents and cops)...and the state police haven't been called in?  Or the Feds?    But my biggest complaint is the unbelievable amount of driving that takes place --and is described in incredibly painful detail-- throughout the story.  He drives here, he drives there, he drives here again, then back to there, then over here, then there, and every drive is described in excruciating detail, the speed, the road surface, the landmarks he passes (again and again), the speed bumps, etc., etc., etc.  C'mon, get on with it!  There's a story waiting to be told.

B003Y5H54W|3.0|Let me start by praising the look of this film, especially its nightmare fairy tale wilderness village and Peter Jackson-inspired sweeping landscapes.  The designers create a lush, evocative screen image that captures the imagination without overpowering the actors.  Without doubt, I haven't seen a better looking film than this one in quite some time.  Even the costume and makeup people keep the actors looking good without forcing an artificial glamour.    I'd rather start that way because I refuse to become one of those critics who savages somebody else's film because it doesn't suit my tastes.  I'm not among this film's target audience, and chances are, if you've fallen in love more than once or watched more than seven horror films, you aren't, either.  This film reaches out for people who enjoy uncomplicated romances and have a very low scare threshold.    Director Catherine Hardwicke knows her young, wide-eyed audience, and delivers what they expect from a romantic fantasy with horror overtones.  Pretty, willful Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) embodies 21st Century America in medieval Bavaria.  She loves Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), a woodcutter who broods around the forest like an unemployed Robert Pattinson impersonator.  But Valerie's mom (Virginia Madsen) thinks she'd enjoy a better life with the prosperous but uninspiring blacksmith, Henry (Max Irons).    But a werewolf besieges their village.  When the wolf slaughters Valerie's sister, village life unstitches.  Unscrupulous Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) starts hunting witches, while Valerie discovers her uncanny connection to the monster.  Is Peter or Henry the wolf?  Or gentle Father Auguste (Lukas Haas), simpleton Claude (Cole Heppell), or Valerie's reclusive grandmother (Julie Christie)?  Veteran filmgoers know the answer is \\"none of the above,\\" but the revelation genuinely surprised me.    This film accomplishes all its goals, and accomplishes them stylishly to boot.  If it didn't reward an adolescent view of love and worked as hard on creeping dread and psychological horror as it does on \\"boo\\" moments, it would achieve possible greatness.  Unfortunately, it pitches to its audience's expectations, and no higher.  For what it is, Hardwicke presents a pretty good film.  You decide if \\"pretty good\\" is good enough.

B001U7ADZ4|5.0|Most of the music lovers who admire John's music probably already have each of these individual albums.  But for those new fans who have come to know him via \\"Battle Studies\\" or \\"Born & Raised\\", this would be an ideal way to \\"catch up\\" with his earlier (and some of his greatest) artistic expressions in a very economical way.<br /><br />For those friends of yours who may not be into his music (some of mine were turned off by the tabloid press so did not even explore it), This purchase is the perfect way to introduce them to his versatility and greatness, and his growth as a singer and musician.<br /><br />John is definitely not a one-note/one style wonder.  I think that is frustrating for music critics, as they are always looking to \\"categorize artist\\" or want them to have a \\"signature sound\\".  For me John does have a music signature of sorts, but it is not the \\"size of a period at the end of a sentence\\" in diameter, and that makes many critics uncomfortable.  He can \\"autograph his  body of work\\" any way he wishes, and it is still integrally himself.<br /><br />These three studio albums certainly showcase that versatility.<br /><br />I wish there could be such a combination for his \\"live albums\\"....as you get another dimension and perspective on his brilliance from that of the studio albums.  For me, studio album versus live album is comparable to viewing his talents though the lens of the customary notion of a three dimensional universe (studio album) versus that of a string theory universe that has at least 10 dimensions (live album).<br /><br />Since we do not have a three-in-one package for live performance albums...this package will have to do.<br /><br />Buy it for yourself if you are not familiar or buy it for friends with whom you would like to share the love :)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001U7ADZ4 Continuum + Heavier Things + Room For Squares]]

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I watched this movie about a week ago, and rarely, and I do mean RARELY cry. Even my wife gets mad at that fact. But this movie, [[ASIN:B0031RAOVY Hachi: A Dog's Tale]] made me cry for well over one third of the entire movie. I haven't cried that much since I was a baby. (I'm 22 years old at this time.) And just to let you readers know if you were wondering, I have seen a large amount of films. (I have a personal collection of over 300 DVD's alone, and that's not counting my UMD or VHS movies either) And this one movie out of the hundreds that I have seen, is by far the saddest movie I have ever watched, or probably ever will watch. It is based on a true story from Japan, which lends to its impact. If you haven't already seen this movie, SEE IT NOW, even if you don't know if it's worth it, because it is. Believe me.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I'm rewriting my review of the Michael CD partly because I feel the emphasis on vibrato in the Cascio songs in some of the reviews of Michael has led to overlooking other important characteristics of the songs, especially of \\"Keep your head up.\\" This song displays MJ's signature vocal qualities including his perfect pitch, and his ability to seamlessly transition between normal voice range and falsetto. The listener may not always know when he's gone into falsetto, or when he's back in the upper reaches of his normal range. \\"Keep your head up\\" features a good bit of MJ's falsetto and many transitions between normal range and falsetto.  Another signature characteristic of MJ's songs is what I call \\"breath grunts\\" which are audible expulsions of air before or after a word. The effect is similar to the sound one would make before saying \\"uh\\". It's a plosive sound rather than a vocal sound. They are entirely spontaneous and unscripted. There are many of these sounds throughout \\"Keep your head up.\\"  \\"Keep your head up\\" is a powerfully uplifting and inspiring song, indeed one of the most soothing and positive songs I've ever heard. With the song's emphasis on love, it is absolutely characteristic of MJ's music! The vibrato in this song varies but is most pronounced in the opening verse and is consistent with MJ's use of vibrato in his recorded songs (compare with \\"She's out of my life\\"), varying from virtually none to a good bit. Vibrato is a quality a good singer can vary at will, not an unvarying constant, unlike MJ's perfect pitch which is always evident in his songs, and which can't be imitated. A singer either has perfect pitch or he doesn't. If he doesn't his pitch will go flat or sharp at times. MJ's pitch is never flat or sharp in any of the songs on this CD, or in any of his other songs.  This and the other Cascio songs display enough of MJ's signature characteristics: perfect pitch, his ability to transition seamlessly between his normal range and falsetto, andspontaneous unscripted sounds to establish their authenticity for reasonable people. Granted the songs on \\"Michael\\" aren't as perfect as they would be had MJ released them himself, they are nonetheless head and shoulders above anything else except his previous recordings. I have changed my rating from 4 stars to five stars upon further reflection and analysis.

B004M6BQ9W|5.0|I wanted to see this movie when it came out in theatres but didn't because it got panned by critics and I didn't want to waste $15.  But after seeing the mostly positive reviews on amazon.com, I decided to rent it over the weekend.  I loved it!  So much that I watched it twice before my rental expired.  The cast (Cher, Christina, Stanley Tucci, Kristen Bell, Dianna Agron, McSteamy), the music, the choreography are awesome!  The story's predictable, but not a deal breaker.  Rent it.  You won't be disappointed!
B001LF2WCC|4.0|This is a movie adaptation of Frank Miller's Graphic Novel. Based on a real event, \\"The Battle of Thermopylae\\". Very Entertaining. Visually Stunning. A must see.
0756404738|3.0|---Possible spoilers ahead----  I found the first book of the series breathtaking. There was magic found inbetween lines. Apart from minor flaws (like the draccus episode which was far too long) the book was mesmerizing. Maybe because I was expecting so much of the second book, that it left me disappointed. The second  book starts where we left Kvothe. The first part of the book is rather entertaining and I enjoyed Kvothe`s adventures at the University (even though it was nothing new  we hadn't seen in the first book) and his stay at the Maer's castle was good paced and thrilling at some points. But afterwards the second part gets somehow more unfocused and boring. There are several sidequests that drags on far too much like the bandits hunting and others a little bit dull like the Lethani training. Kvothe changes from boy to man and he becames more arrogant, conceated and somehow distant. I do not have the same empathy I had for him on the first book. It is also kind of strange that after his bizarre sexual encounter with Faelurian, his sex life changes completely. From being mostly shy and clumsy while dealing with women and being only interested in Denna, suddenly his sex appeal and apetite is aroused and all the women fancy him.   The main plot does not advance much further either. We still do not know much of the Chandrian and that sucks.    But the book is really good written. The prose at some points is sublime but I have the feeling that the book could have been much better if the plot had been better paced (on the second part) and less episodical.  The good thing is that I am not going to eat my nails while waiting for the third book, even though I will probably read it.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This was an excellant series.  It made me aware of the terrible conditions faced by the Marines in the Pacific theater.  The action was so well done it was hard to believe it was a movie.    I highly recommend this series for anyone interested in movies of this ilk.      Fred
6304708521|3.0|I find it diverting to watch the Beatles do just about anything, so I can't complain about an experimental film that basically says, \\"Here Monty Python, we're not really comedians, just musicians, so YOU take the ball from here.\\" (And a decade later we had George financing Python's first feature film `The Life of Brian', a true comedy classic.)  For me, the Beatles films served mainly to inspire the creation of more Beatles songs. Paul took a lot of heat for this project since it was not exactly a roaring commercial or critical success. But he kept the boys together and busy and writing and recording new songs--so good on Paul.  What really irks me is that some influetial critics, like the late Ian Macdonald, insist that the Beatles peaked with `Sgt. Pepper' and declined thereafter. I agree that they perhaps peaked with `Pepper'; I just don't believe there was EVER a decline afterward. The heart of the `Magical Mystery Tour' [MMT] album is `I Am the Walrus', an out-and-out masterpiece that rivals anything on `Pepper'. The only reason why MMT ever seemed a bit of a dip was packaging: The non-album `Yellow Submarine' deprived MMT of excellent tracks such as `It's All Too Much' and `All Together Now'. A charity album swiped the George Martin version of `Across the Universe'. And `Lady Madonna' and `The Inner Light' were left off.  In fact, the Beatles' material from that era was so good that you could add `Strawberry Fields Forever' and `Penny Lane' to `Pepper' as a prelude (as they were originally intended) and `All You Need is Love' as a `summer of love' addendum, and there would still be enough left over for a glorious MMT sequel to `Pepper'.  The `Hey Jude/Revolution' and `White Album' period that followed was anythjing but a \\"coming down.\\" Next came the `Get Back' sessions, which provided all the material required for an absolutely brilliant `live' album featuring the raw feed of the 6 best tracks from the rooftop, but this opportunity was squandered. More brilliance followed with `Abbey Road', their most sophisticated studio album and George Martin's favourite. \\"Coming down, Mr. Macdonald?\\" I think not.  Then in 1973 came the greatest pop album-set of all time--'Black Box' (1973) alias `The Black Album', with a mind-boggling 46 tracks. Except that--the music was never released in that package. You have to put it together yourself because EMI/Apple ain't up to the task. The Beatles as the `Beatles Releasing Collective' could be said to have recorded more-or-less separately but released collectively right through to 2010. You can bring the resulting six album-sets + into existence yourself. There was never a `coming down', and it was never over.

030746363X|5.0|I'd like to thank Tim Ferris for making this book happen.  The diet itself is more like a lifestyle - easy to follow & maintain on a daily basis.  The blog readers post very helpful comments too!  I've done atkins, south beach, different cleansing diets, and variations of them too.  This slow carb diet was like a breath of fresh air.  The tips on getting the most out of an exercise in the least amount of time was ideal for me as a working Mother.  I like the book so much, along with the 4 hour body too - that the only gifts I gave away for christmas this year were these two books!  I have been following along with the recipients so we motivate each other.  (the hardest part was actually just getting them to read it)  Just get the book, open it, and you'll be hooked too.  It's a change for life - don't spend another day in your current state... when small changes will fix everything.  By the way - I'm someone with a fast metabolism and always have to eat every 2 hours or I get the shakes, hot flashes, and just can't concentrate (dizzy, lightheaded).  After 3 days on the slow carb diet - I can go 5-6 hours without food with no problem - and I'm eating less than before.  THANK YOU
B00008O31H|3.0|Sure, they have a big, thick buzzy guitar tone ala ZZ Top/Hendrix, but so what? The album consists of simple, repetitive blues riffs and, for the most part, unintelligible lyrics. For instance, on the opening title track, is he even saying actual words or is he just making sounds?? You really have to strain throughout the album to make out what he's saying, and the droning quickly becomes irritating. Personally, I don't see what the fuss is all about.

B004EPYZU8|3.0|The main inspiration for SUCKER PUNCH seems to be a little cult film named [[ASIN:B00003CXKS Dancer in the Dark (New Line Platinum Series)]] starring Bjork. Indeed, a few of Bjork's songs are sprinkled into SUCKER PUNCH.  Think of Zack Snyder's latest as a high fantasy, computer-generated, girl power version of DANCER IN THE DARK.  Even SUCKER PUNCH'S ending scenes are similar to that movie.    Like Dancer in the Dark, the main character of SUCKER PUNCH escapes into a fantasy in order to cope with her situation.  The movie is highly episodic.  The main character Babydoll doesn't stay in her fantasy continuously, like the trailers make you believe.  Instead, she comes in and out.  And when she's out, the movie is kind of a teeny, tiny, tad boring.

B004LSJCJM|5.0|Joe just keeps  getting better. This go he really brings the  whole package. Wonderful CD art and the sonic of the recording   are warm, tight and dynamic.  The song writting is stellar, the playing is blistering. Joe has  hit his stride singing this maybe be his best.   His love for Zeppelin really shines on Slow Train, Black Lung Heartache,   and the heavy BCC feel of Heartbreaker is sickness. The song Dust Bowl   has a feeling like Robert Plants \\"Big Log\\". I could go on and on as  this album grows on me more each day. I love how Joe keeps it HEAVY  and real after many album releases and success. Super special talent.  Thank You Joe Bonamassa your killing it !!!!!
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|A dozen well thought out songs, with plenty of side musicians to make it all sound interesting.  Patti  Smith chimes in with her subtle power on the last track, \\"Blue.\\"  Michael Stipe sounds smart and so does Peter Buck's playing. Solid performance from the guys of Athens, Georgia.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|As a former engineer on CSX now injured,  I remember our famous runaway in Ohio that this was loosely based on. I also remember since I was involved in the chase the runaway train CSX had in Rochester NY. I and my conductor at the time were asked to leave Lyons NY and try to chase it down. So I can tell you from experience this is an intense situation and Denzel and Chris did a great job letting you feel how intense a situation it is. I have a few issues with technical errors involving the use of the automatic air brake in place of the independent. For those unaware the brake handle that Chris Pine uses on the curve when Denzel tells him to use the independent brake is actually the automatic. For those unaware the automatic brake is basically the train brake which requires the air hoses to be connected to be of any significant use; otherwise, in many instances you would have less braking force than if the independent/engine brake was used. Another technical error relates to the alertor or \\"deadmans\\" feature, not only does it apply the brakes when it goes off it also kills the throttle (unless the feature is totally cut-out). I could give more technical issues that bothered me; however I really had fun watching this movie and am able to look past this. I recommend people give it a chance. The railroad talk was not bad and actually resembled some conversations I can remember having myself with conductors. If you want more railroad related questions answered email me at bob_flammia@yahoo.com, have fun and enjoy this really fun movie!
B001992NW4|5.0|One of the first horror films i ever saw and it's still great today. I guess it is a bit slow by today's standards, but I think it's still very effective. The Blu-Ray master is very well done. Great buy!
0756404738|5.0|It does the impossible and improves on The Name of the Wind.  This isn't just a great fantasy novel.  It is a great novel- period.  However, it is pretty much required that you read The Name of the Wind first: [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]]  Think of watching Godfather 2 without seeing the first one.  Its certainly do-able, but much greater enjoyment comes from reading them in order.  Strongly recommend this book- I loved it.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|I just picked this up on Blu-Ray and I have to say it was every bit as good as I remember. Great performances, direction and a very eerie and effective look and feel. Nicholson is scary as hell. This is in my top 10 horror films ever. Kubrick is the master.
B002PMV9K6|2.0|For me, and this is just me, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a clunker. The plot is slow, plodding, and the whole storyline just kind of lies there. I received my copy in brand new, pristine condition, but after one viewing, I gave it to our mobile home park's \\"trash and treasure\\" auction. The book just HAS to be better than this one.
B0041KKYD8|4.0|This movie is strong, violent and not for the faint of heart. I had seen and liked the old one, but had a feeling the remake would wimp out as far as how graphic it would be. It did not that's for sure. It's more graphic as far as the violence, and while they have less of the rape scenes, they are more effective. I watched this with my girlfriend and her face was hidden for most of it. Powerful movie.
B004HYXW1O|5.0|It's not always easy to match a good, solid first album and the public's expectations after it, but The Script has been able to maintain and in my opinion even improve the quality of their sound with this second release. And funny enough, I almost didn't purchase it! I initially came across the CD on Amazon and hadn't known there even was a second album out, so needless to say, I was excited. But there didn't seem to be many tracks and the few clips I heard left me hesitant and wondering if it was worthwhile. I ended up purchasing the version with bonus tracks with a gift certificate given to me, and I am really glad I did. I would have missed on on some great music by a band that has easily become one of my favorites.     Although I very much liked the first album and found their style very versatile, I wasn't sure if I was completely sold on the fact that it was fully their own, simply because some of their sound felt familiar and reminded me of things I had heard before. Having said that, Danny's voice was distinct. I recognized it as Breakeven played faintly in a store (I had never heard the song before, and had only heard part of The Script's \\"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\\" on the radio once). And I look back and think the variety was good for them and was part of their appeal. But this second album was like a concretization of their own signature sound and a great reinforcement of that fact. I also think this album is a bit more consistent in terms of style, while their first album was perhaps more diverse.     In all fairness, I have to admit I still haven't fully warmed up to the last three songs on the album (four technically, but two are the same, just slightly different versions). When I initially listened to them more attentively, I was reading the lyrics at the same time and was a bit disappointed that the album ended on somewhat of a down note, but I still really love the album overall and am enthusiastic about giving it 5 stars. I also think I can grow to like the other songs I haven't listened to enough yet.     ~    I won't give a thorough review of each song as I think it's best to discover them yourself, but here are a few short comments:     \\"You Won't Feel a Thing\\" wasn't one of the songs I was drawn to most initially. It felt a bit chaotic at times when the chorus hit (may not be a song to discover when you are tired or stressed), but it has actually become one of my favorites.       \\"For the First Time\\" was the first official single off the album and it is a good song, though not necessarily one of my top listens.     \\"Nothing\\" is a great song that captures the desperate, delusional and pitiful state of someone after a break-up who is drunk and is convinced if they just go to see the person or confess their love (alcohol and confessing of love: rarely a good combination!), the person will change their mind. So they dial the number and speak the words, only to be hit with the harsh reality of silence at the other end of the line. A song that is both sad and makes you want to laugh because of its realistic nature (the 2nd verse paints the picture well).     \\"Science and Faith\\": Good chorus and good solid song about love and how it is one thing that cannot be explained through science but is simply felt.    \\"If You Ever Come Back\\" is a hopeful song about possibly regaining a love that was lost. Great chorus to sing along to.    \\"Long Gone and Moved On\\": The poor guy! lol Another good solid song that displays more of a raspy tone in Danny's voice.    \\"Dead Man Walking\\": Great melody and catchy chorus that I find myself singing when I'm not listening to the album.    \\"This=Love\\": Universal song about love and how and why it keeps us going and doing the things we do.     \\"Walk Away\\": One that I need to listen to more. It has good rhythm but doesn't seem to deviate as much melodically. It is also not the most uplifting song.     \\"Exit Wounds\\": Have not listened to this enough yet but think I can grow to like it.\\"Bullet From a Gun\\": Once again have not listened to this enough but will give it a fair chance.     ~    I was really pleased with the album when I first started listening to it, and now, after having had it for a while, am still loving it. It is great to be able to enjoy a second album as much as the first, and perhaps even more. It's a good one to put on, let play and enjoy. In my opinion, those of you who enjoyed the first won't be disappointed with Science and Faith. Great lyrics, melodies, and Danny's distinct voice that you know and love.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I'm starting to wonder if we're seeing the same movies as the critics nowadays. Or at least, if we're getting different cuts of movies. Because I've often found myself walking out going \\"Did I see a different movie than the critics?\\"<br /><br />Of course, Snyder is no stranger to critical disdain. He may be the most misunderstood director out there. True his films aren't for<br />everyone, but if you look close enough you may just find something there. And Sucker Punch is the biggest example of how big a visionary he is- Here he manages to bring to the table a satisfying and exciting new vision.<br /><br />I was in right from the opening scene. A cover of Sweet Dreams set to a fantastic and tone setting scene depicting her abuse from her wicked stepfather. WHAT an opening scene.<br /><br />We are then transported to Mount Pleasant Insane Asylum, once a performing arts venue. Baby Doll is just a drop in the ocean of how<br />many beautiful girls who can dance. Baby Doll doesn't know this until she saves Rocket, another one of the girls. There she meets the rest of the gang, and the sexy Goski, a doctor who has a form of therapy- dance. When Baby Doll dances, she can slay dragons, fight robots, wield swords, etc. The girls love her- but as it stands, she's dancing... to escape from the asylum with the girls.<br /><br />The concept may not sound dazzling- but wait till you see it. Sucker Punch is what its title states- a conceptual sucker punch. Nothing can prepare you for what you will experience. You are in the world with Baby Doll- you feel as if you are experiencing Baby Doll's therapy with her. Snyder totally does a great job with this aspect, and as a theatre nerd and dance lover, arts as therapy really hit home because it's very true, and I've experienced that euphoria from being a performer.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic, and Emily Browning is great as both an action chick and a confused, disturbed girl. Cugino is sexy and adds her usual charm to her role. Hamm as Blue is easily the best, as his villain is certainly convincing.<br /><br />Add to that, one of the best soundtracks ever put to film. Working with Tyler Bates, Browning covers a few songs, and quite a few others contribute too. And Bjork's \\"Army of Me\\" has never sounded cooler.<br /><br />I was skeptical- Snyder has struck gold with 300, Watchmen and Guardians, but could he manage to make one of his original ideas spark?<br />As a result he can- and he did. Do NOT be a puppet of the critics- experience Sucker Punch with an open mind. Touche, Zack Snyder...<br />Touche.n is certainly convincing.

B004CR7TE2|4.0|Overall this laptop sleeve is very well-made, good stitching and nice piping around all the seams.  The fabric actually looks more expensive than it probably is.  My 15 inch Macbook Pro laptop slides in it perfectly.  Nice zippers with a bent, thumb-like design which is very nice.  Overall, its a great minimal design and will protect your laptop very well.    There are three things that I don't like about it which are entirely up to my personal taste and cannot be held against the product.  First, I now know that I must have handles, at the very least, to carry a laptop around.  It's just too heavy and uncomfortable to hold the bag from the bottom, and I regret bringing it on this three-week business trip that I'm on.  Next, the side pockets do stretch out to accommodate the power cord and anything else you want to bring with you but I just don't like how that ruins the clean design line - again, this is my personal taste.  Lastly, I don't like the yellow \\"e\\" that is painted on the side (I guess it's the logo).      If you know that you can do with out handles or a shoulder strap, then this bag is fantastic.  However, if you are like me and don't like carrying the whole bag under your arm - then it's not for you.

B0041KKYEW|4.0|Darren Aronofsky's BLACK SWAN isn't an original film.  Its premise--a young woman experiencing a breakdown amid potentially supernatural occurrences--is a staple of the horror genre.  This is, however, Aronofsky's take on such a film, his personal stamp on a certain style (much as he did with the superior film THE WRESTLER and the sports genre in general).<br /><br />BLACK SWAN follows a ballerina's embrace of \\"Swan Lake.\\"  Nina Sayers has the White Swan role down pat; but she has never really let loose enough to take on the role of the Black Swan.  Thus, her understudy, Lily, comes into the picture.  But the relationship between the two is complicated: part friendship, part rivalry, part sexual attraction, and the tension escalates into a breathtaking finale that is predictable but nevertheless stunning.<br /><br />Natalie Portman easily deserves her Oscar; her performance is on-pitch and captivating.  Mila Kunis, who has never truly overwhelmed in a serious role, is surprisingly adept here; she manages to be seductive, charming, and scary, all in one scene.  Winona Ryder, as the \\"older\\" ballerina Portman is replacing, is equally chilling, as is Vincent Cassel as the stereotypical demanding boss (though his performance is anything but cliched).  Barbara Hershey is a surprise delight as Nina's caring-possibly-psychotic mother.<br /><br />The script is a little flat, which is intentional; this film is as much an homage as it is a stand-alone piece.  Aronofsky isn't aiming for the skies, and that is what makes BLACK SWAN so compelling: it's a small slice of insanity, with some truly disturbing scenes and some fantastic performances.  If it isn't the best expression of Aronofsky's artistic vision, it certainly deserves status as a \\"personal favorite\\" among his fans; either way, it is an above-par psychological thriller that deserves most of the praise that has been heaped upon it.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell places 'the right place at the right time' philosophy under a microscope and takes the reader on an exploration of the finest of details as to what exactly makes \\"success.\\"  The answer is described by Gladwell's simple words, \\"success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages.\\"  I would add to that, an imperative piece to the puzzle is a person taking full advantage of those advantages that have been presented.

0756404738|3.0|After reading The Name of the Wind I couldn't wait for this to come out, eager for more. When about half way into the book I caught myself I started skimming through several pages, which isn't a good sign at all. The pace was painstakingly slow at times and as the progress bar on my Kindle kept creeping further down the line I wondered when something was finally going to happen. It didn't.     Several things were quite sloppy in my opinion, either Rothfuss removed a lot of stuff to trim the book down or he didn't write enough to tie it all together. All in all I felt disappointed after the first great novel and hope the third is going to be one big action-packed finale instead of more excruciating details of every forrest, town, tavern and person Kvothe walks along. There's a reason I never liked reading Tolkien, and this book was starting to approach it.

0316017922|3.0|Outliers is a fairly mediocre book. It basically just outlines the obvious keys to succeeding in life. The only reason that this book is interesting is how the author presents these ideas and the examples he uses to back up his claims. One chapter is about how 10,000 hours is the typical amount of practice needed to attain success. This really is not a new idea, it's essentially regurgitating the same old idea that you take out what you put in. Maybe it's just me, but that is pretty much common sense. Gladwell did make a good point in that there is much potential out there in people left untapped and will remain like that because the way our society works won't allow it. Chris Langan was a very intelligent man who won't have his potential realized simply because he was not as deceptive as Robert Oppenheimer. It's a good read because of it's execution, not it's content.
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|I was hoping Depp would put on anything but a pirate costume and do something reminiscent of his old days, but he didn't. Don't get me wrong, the acting was as you'd expect and there are moments of his usual humor shining through but the story is exactly as expected with Jolie's character throwing in the only small, and at the end, almost inconsequential twist. SPOILERS AHEAD As soon as Depp is introduced both my girlfriend and I said that he would end up being Alexander. And surprise, he is. I can live with that, you don't see too many unknown real surprises in movies anymore but the trip is usually the enjoyable part anyway, not where you end up. This is not the case with The Tourist. I was bored, and besides dreaming of our own trip to Venice, so was my girlfriend. And she just sat through what has to be the eighth time she's watched the entire last season of Deadliest Catch... The Tourist isn't worth your time, which is the first time I have EVER said that about any film Depp has been in. Go get The Switch, expected destination but an interesting ride at least.

B004DK5CYM|5.0|I love horses and I love true stories, so this movie was the greatest for me!  So many horse stories don't do a good job of filming horses especially when they use more than one horse for the leading role.  This movie was fantastically filmed to be true to the story of one horse who is a true legend and the owner who believed in him! I saw the movie at the theater and loved it.  Seeing it again at home with horsey friends was just as good if not better.
0345347951|1.0|Like all sci-fi clunkers, CHILDHOOD'S END is a cool concept that the author executes poorly. An alien race appears in the skies above Earth and imparts upon man the knowledge to end all material suffering, war, inequity, etc. At first religious zealots stand in the way of progress, but their resistance amounts to nothing.<br /><br />Sound familiar? Well, up to this point, it is, but then the so-called plot takes a turn: the aliens are prepping the human race for its final evolutionary stage, which is collective incorporation into a universal energy called the Overmind.<br /><br />Now, in the hands of a capable writer, these elements might be very exciting to explore, but Arthur C. Clarke (who few dare to criticize because he co-wrote a book that's more famous for its theatrical version) has too little interest in imbuing the story with the mortal weight it deserves to pull it off. The result is a very boring 210-page read with a slow beginning, even slower middle...and by then you're just eager to finish the book and move on to something better.<br /><br />Clarke's first mistake is his lack of a central character. His second is the lack of empathy he has for what few named characters he has; the reader gets the feeling the human race deserves what's coming to them. His third is the uninteresting way in which he describes first contact with an alien race. His fourth is his complete undermining of the book's theme by stating it without actually showing it. His fifth is his omniscient narrative voice, chronicling the end of mankind, giving no inkling of a plot until three-quarters of the way through the book. His sixth is the nihilistic ending. His seventh...oh, you get the idea already.

While it's not an exhaustive or formal examination of all design patterns, it does a great job teaching you about the design patterns that you are most likely to encounter on a day-to-day basis. The style of the book is relaxed and conversational, which helped me retain what I was reading easily.<br /><br />If you are looking for a solid introduction to design patterns, start with this book.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The title of this review is spoken by one of the participants in the video....his name escapes me, however his point resonated, well after watching this documentary. You can glean from the other reviews the jist of the story. I would simply add my 2 cents that if you only watch one documentary this year, this one will be well worth your time.     No political party is left untouched in this review, and one may even conclude that the Tea Party and Democrats have more in common, to be concerned about with our government, then what appears on the surface.     Two excellent books (and there are many good ones)that go well with this DVD are: \\"All the Devils are here\\", McLean & Nocera and \\"The Big Short\\", Lewis. The first adding depth to the DVD with additional examples and history and the latter describing how those that made \\"big\\" money during the 2008 meltdown could not believe the opportunity was so available.    Watch this documentary...it will challenge your thinking.
B0049OSQ18|4.0|After a discography laden with concept albums, song suites and journeys into progressive folk-rock, The Decemberists use \\"The King is Dead\\" to tighten things up and concentrate on songs. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable album that highlights their brightest components in a folk-rocking context. The tangled lyrics and thoughtful structure are all still their, just this time unencumbered by awkward or forced transitional periods.<br /><br />The focus this time is on Americana; \\"The King is Dead\\" takes cues from Neil Young and The Byrds as well as early R.E.M. (Peter Buck is a guest on several songs here, as well). In fact, \\"The King is Dead\\" often sounds more like an R.E.M. album than \\"Collapse Into Know\\" does. Guest vocalist Gillian Welch adds terrific harmonies to such \\"Reckoning/Document\\" soundalikes as \\"Down By The Water\\" and \\"Rox In The Box.\\" It also showcases multi-instrumentalist Chris Funk, who slides from everything from Pedal Steel to Bouzouki and reveals him as The Decemberists' secret weapon. It's Funk's instrumental work that gives vocalist and main writer Colin Meloy the wide variety of canvas that \\"The King Is Dead\\" paints its portrait of Americana on. In my opinion, their best offering today.

B004L49K20|5.0|Simon Le Bon's vocals, Roger Taylor's drumming, Nick Rhodes' keyboards and John Taylor's bass guitar work fuel the impressive \\"All You Need Is Now\\" to be sure - it is certainly a Duran Duran album. Without listening too closely, though, the listener might just mistake them for a younger, hungrier set of musicians inspired to score hits and garner critical acclaim.<br /><br />It seems that the move from the majors to the indies - and away from collaborations with contemporary hitmakers with questionable talent/intentions - is just right for the British pop-rockers. Thirty years into making records and Duran Duran sound fresh, assured and absolutely driven to craft witty, often socially-conscious tunes that offer more than catchy choruses and glossy studio wizardry.<br /><br />The energy flows like wine in a bistro. The frenetic, haphazard title track pours over into \\"Blame the Machines\\" and \\"Being Followed,\\" two songs that speak to contemporary failings and frustrations. The former waxes on the soul-crushing reality of living in an increasingly interconnected, yet frustratingly impersonal (and stupid) world. The latter waxes on the dystopia that modern society is unfolding into - a siren-filled police state with increased video surveillance and nearly vanquished privacy and individuality. \\"Paranoia - the only valid point of view\\" coolly sings Le Bon. The tracks are masterpieces.<br /><br />The muscular, highly impressive \\"Other Peoples' Lives\\" expands on these themes with astutely observed lyrics that both skewer and lament the era we now live in - one where people have been fooled into living vicariously through the likes of \\"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\\" or \\"Jon and Kate Plus 8\\" rather than forging their own identities and ideas.<br /><br />These are not songs that rock so much as pulse and groove, but solid melodic foundations are consistently bound up in invigorating vocal and instrumental performances. \\"Safe\\" and \\"Girl Panic!\\" sway and twist with a savvy that is nothing if not evocative - whether deliberately or not - of well-crafted 80s pop, yet their overall presentation is neither dated nor hampered by ties to the decade when Duran Duran got its start.<br /><br />Its production and volume should have been pared down a few notches, but \\"Mediterranea\\" remains a cool, relaxing ballad, as does \\"Leave the Light On\\" with its unshakeable, brilliant melody and arresting vocals from Le Bon. \\"Too Bad You're So Beautiful\\" is also an intelligent, cheeky slice of adult pop.<br /><br />\\"All You Need Is Now\\" is a major move forward for one of the most underrated bands of the past few decades. Offering a great many solid, well-oiled tunes that endear themselves easily, Duran Duran prove they are no nostalgia act but consummate craftsmen of top-notch pop.<br /><br />4.5 starswhether deliberately or not - of well-crafted 80s pop, yet their overall presentation is neither dated nor hampered by ties to the decade when Duran Duran got its start.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I purchases these 'phones because I've started listening to a different genre of music that features very low frequencies and the ol' laptop speakers weren't cutting it. I read the reviews and the ratings and this product seems to be the strongest for the price.<br /><br />I haven't been disappointed. I work in a sometimes-noisy office and they do a great job of blocking out external noise. I have a big head (an Irish potato head as it's been called) and these fit comfortably for long periods. If you need to wear them for more than 3 or 4 hours straight, the tops of your ears may ache a tiny bit, but they're well designed and nicely padded.<br /><br />The headphones themselves have a solid feel to them. The earpads are soft and the whole unit just feels like something that's intended to hang around for a while. One note on the look of the product; they are studio monitor headphones and that is printed in gold lettering across the top of the headband. But hey, I get to look like I'm running a sound board for a band. The fact that they fold into themselves (the ear pads come together and push up toward the head band) is a plus, though I don't know how much use I'll get out of the pleather carrying bag.<br /><br />The drivers are very responsive and efficient. Between the insulation from outside noise and the excellent quality of these large drivers, you can turn the volume of your source down quite a bit and still get plenty of sound. There aren't any noticeable holes in response and both bass and treble is handled equally well.<br /><br />I highly recommend these if you're looking for reasonably-priced audiophile gear.

0385340575|5.0|Lee Child books are like those old Lay's potato chips commercials: Betcha can't eat just one - only in this case, betcha can't read just one. It's not my fault the author makes the books so addictive. Just take the opening line: \\"Suicide bombers are easy to spot.\\"                Now who doesn't want to keep reading with an opening like that?                Here's the entire first paragraph of the book:    Suicide bombers are easy to spot. They give out all kinds of telltale signs. Mostly because they're nervous. By definition they're all first-timers.                Well that first paragraph is all it took for me to be hooked.                Child's longtime hero, Jack Reacher, is riding a New York City subway train at two in the morning when he spots a woman, one of five passengers on the subway, whom he believes to be a suicide bomber. She has many of the signs on the list of ways to identify such a person.                 So what does Reacher do? Quickly get off the train like most folks and hope that the woman doesn't detonate herself before you can escape? Of course not. But he keeps ratcheting up the tension until it's almost unbearable.    We looked straight at each other for the best part of ten seconds. Then I got to my feet. Braced against the motion and took a step. I would be killed thirty feet away, no question. I couldn't get any deader by being any closer. I passed the Hispanic woman on my left. Passed the guy in the NBA shirt on my right. Passed the West African woman on my left. Her eyes were still closed. I handed myself from one grab bar to the next, left and right, swaying. Passenger number four stared at me all the way, frightened, panting, muttering. Her hands stayed in her bag.                            I stopped six feet from her.                            I said, \\"I really want to be wrong about this.\\"                She didn't reply. Her lips moved. Her hands moved under the black canvas. The large object in her bag shifted slightly.I said, \\"I need to see your hands.\\"                            She didn't reply.                            \\"I'm a cop,\\" I lied. \\"I can help you.\\"                            She didn't reply.                            I said, \\"We can talk.\\"                            She didn't reply.                If you look up \\"page-turner\\" in the dictionary, you should see Lee Child's picture. Gone Tomorrow is a thriller from its gripping start to its exciting climax.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|...Or it least in My Opinion.<br /><br />I know what your thinking, Not another teen movie ! Well, and your probably right. That was exactly my idea when I first heard of this film. My thoughts were : Ok, it's gonna be cheesy, boring and completely unbelievable. I was having a headache, I didn't have anything to do and I wanted to watch this movie just to kill time. However, I have to say this film has got me by surprise ! I guess I underestimated this movie a lot which only proves that you really shouldn't judge the book by its cover.<br /><br />Olive (Emma Stone) is a highschool student in California. She's unpopular, anonymous and completely lost in a 6000+ Highschool. However, because of one single lie Olive's life, reputation and popularity is going to witness some drastic changes.<br /><br />I don't want to give any spoilers. I think this movie is a \\"great\\" Example on How one lie could lead to another and another till things get really complicated. It's also a good story about how \\"Rumors\\" can really be deceiving. At first I didn't really \\"sympathize\\" with Olive it's true she didn't mean for this whole thing to start, she was put into the spot light unwillingly but she didn't do anything to stop it, she actually made it bigger because of some unwise, stupid choices but then I forgave her for it because she saw her mistake eventually.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who's currently in high school, I'm sure they will feel very related to the entire story. If your out of high school already, I would suggest you give this movie a try, I'm no longer in HS but watching the film, I had a lot of memories of my HS days the whole gossip, drama and stupidity of teenagers. It just brought back a sense of nostalgia.<br /><br />Overall, great movie and I liked the message behind it. I know some things are made way over the top like there's NO way a school principle is ever going to allow a group of students to yell insults publicly in front of the school building to a particular student's face, but once again it's a movie and even though it won't happen in real life sometimes unspoken words could hurt more than spoken once.<br /><br />I have to agree With Olive, I totally think Pop-Rallys were stupid I'm not so much of a poprally person either but we gotta go out of class so all's fine ;)face, but once again it's a movie and even though it won't happen in real life sometimes unspoken words could hurt more than spoken once.     I have to agree With Olive, I totally think Pop-Rallys were stupid I'm not so much of a poprally person either but we gotta go out of class so all's fine ;)
0307266303|5.0|\\"Born to Run\\" is really two books in one. The first part is about human physiology and the history of running. It begins with Christopher McDougall's quest to answer a simple question that he asked his doctor: \\"How come my foot hurts?\\" When his doctor game him an answer that he didn't want to accept (he wasn't really built for the sport and should find another type of exercise), it led McDougall to discuss running with leading sports-medicine specialists, legendary running coaches, shoe industry executives, and elite endurance runners. Eventually, this also led to him running a 50 mile race that practically no one had ever heard of before.    This is where the second part of the book begins - and this part will immerse you so thoroughly in the final race that you'll be breathless by the time the runners reach the finish line. But before detailing this grueling race in the Copper Canyons of Mexico (with of the best long distance runners in the sport pitted against the reclusive Tarahumara Indians), McDougall entertains you with other running races, like the 1995 Leadville Trail 100 mile event (where running sensation Ann Trason takes on all comers - men and women).      He also vividly describes an unusual cast of some of the best ultra runners (runners who race distances longer than a marathon), including: Caballo Blanco (a mysterious loner who lives among the Tarahumara tribe), Scott Jurek (seven time winner of the Western States 100 Mile Endurance Run), \\"Barefoot Ted\\" McDonald, and Young Guns Jenn Shelton and Billy \\"Bonehead\\" Barnett.    While writing about all these incredible characters, McDougall manages to convince you that each of us was born to run - that it's in our genes. He interviews anthropologists who describe persistence hunts where our ancestors ran down animals for food - not because they could run faster than their prey, but because they could outlast it.    McDougall also lets you in on a secret: everything you've been taught about running is probably wrong. He describes how the shoe industry over the last 40 years has done nothing for runners to make them faster or less injury prone. He quotes Dr. Daniel Lieberman, a professor of biological anthropology at Harvard:    \\"A lot of foot and knee injuries that are currently plaguing us are actually caused by people running with shoes that actually make our feet weak, cause us to over-pronate, give us knee problems. Until 1972, when the modern athletic shoe was invented by Nike, people ran in very thin-soled shoes, had strong feet, and had much lower incidence of knee injuries.\\"                McDougall gives alarming statistics about injuries (every year \\"from 65 to 80 percent of all runners suffer an injury\\"), and then points to other surprising evidence:                In a 2008 research paper for the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Dr. Craig Richards, a researcher at the University of Newcastle in Australia, reveals that there are no evidence-based studies - not one - that demonstrates that running shoes make you less prone to injury.                          Even more shocking, McDougall offers a study that proves that runners who wear the top-of-the-line running shoes are more likely to get injured than those running in cheap sneakers. So what can you do to enjoy running more and injure yourself less? McDougall has lots of suggestions, so pick up the book and find out.                You'll be intrigued by the physiology portion of the book and so thoroughly inspired with the racing descriptions that you'll be unable to put the book down until the final climatic chapters. Even if you've never run in your life, the race in the Copper Canyons is inspirational and motivating. The book features super athletes who think nothing of running 100 mile endurance races; but it's also full of advice for casual runners and suggests what they can do to run injury free. At its core, the book is about all humans and why each one of us is ... Born to Run.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I love this movie.  I thought the story was good and the romance was very romantic.  Angelina was magnificent; she does glamorous very well.  Johnny Depp was great; he can play a wide range of different characters with unerring talent.  I loved Timothy Dalton & Rufus Sewell also. This movie will be on my keeper shelf.
B001HN694K|4.0|\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is the Tim Burton re-imagining of a classic children's book in true, weird, brilliant spectacle.<br /><br />We meet up with Alice more than a decade after her first trip down the rabbit hole, where she must fight to try and make her life her own despite societal convention that forbids her to do so.<br /><br />The plot of this particular script is probably more geared toward the young adults (specifically young women) in the audience - but anyone familiar with Tim Burton's movies would easily recognize it's not necessarily a kid's picture.<br /><br />This probably earned it a PG rating (with help, no doubt, from the hookah smoking caterpillar.)<br /><br />The weird world of Carroll's fantastical Wonderland seems tailor made for the equally strange sensibilities of Tim Burton, and indeed he toils this fertile ground with glee. The end result is both fantastic and freakish, leaving the movie goer feeling as though they literally did fall down a rabbit hole themselves.<br /><br />Burton also makes the very shrewd decision to back away from the very obvious temptation to make Johnny Depp's Hatter the centerpiece of the story - instead he focuses the action (rightfully so) around Alice, played by Mia Wasikowska.<br /><br />By doing this, he keeps us in the POV of the outsider to this strange and magical world.<br /><br />In the theatrical release he also utilized the 3D effect less ostentatiously as one might imagine - and this added to the effect of bringing the audience into the action rather than just watching from the sidelines. Those expecting to jump out of their seat didn't. It's far more subtle than that, which is probably why \\"Alice\\" has been getting mixed reviews on the utilization of the medium.<br /><br />When Alice is above ground, the scene is quite classic, with muted, pastel colors in regards to dress and to people. The only real splash of vibrant color we get is through the natural surroundings, which draws our attention (much like Alice's) away from the place she's supposed to be.<br /><br />Once she's below ground, however, the colors are eye popping - but it's not quite beautiful. Wonderland is tainted by the Red Queen and it shows in the scary dark places that threaten to take over.<br /><br />Nothing becomes truly beautiful (read: safe) until we finally see the White Queen's castle and its surroundings.<br /><br />Some may find this less than lush portrayal a bit dark, especially for younger audience members.<br /><br />While most people were looking forward to seeing what Depp did with Hatter, what we actually saw was a mix of many of his previous characters. He doesn't really bring anything new to the table. He had the eccentricity of Willy Wonka, the bravery of Captain Jack and the vulnerability of Edward Scissorhands.<br /><br />That recall actually detracts away from his performance as Hatter, but - as stated earlier - the women of the tale effectively steal all scenes they share with him.<br /><br />Mia as Alice is brave, stubborn, smart and strong. She utters, \\"Lost my muchness, have I?\\" and proceeds to prove that assessment wrong.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter sinks her teeth into the nasty Red Queen, who demonstrates cruelty and fragility sometimes in the very same scene. Her polar opposite, the White Queen (as played by Ann Hathaway) is far more ethereal. Hathaway mixes humor and grace and makes her limited time on screen quite memorable.<br /><br />Crispin Glover delivers a more duplicitous portrayal of Stayne - Knave of Hearts, an opportunist to the nth degree, but he too plays second fiddle to his female co-stars, which delivers more of a mixed review for the whole of the actors themselves.<br /><br />That a female scribe penned this particular tale should surprise no one as it is the ultimate feminist tale.<br /><br />There's familiarity for the original tale, but also the story is made current with the more mature dilemma Alice now faces with an unwanted proposal from a Lord everyone assumes she will want to marry.<br /><br />These are the expectations of a young woman in her particular station, expectations Alice herself wants to reject.<br /><br />In Wonderland, she faces the same conundrum - whether or not to do what is expected of her or blaze her own trail. The only problem is that blazing her own trail could in fact jeopardize all her new friends.<br /><br />How screenwriter Linda Woolverton reconciles these two differing odds is inspiring.<br /><br />The redemptive value of Alice in Wonderland is that it reaffirms that we can do the impossible if only we first believe that we can. This is the underlying theme that carries us from the very first scene all the way to the last. It is an excellent message for kids of all ages.lf wants to reject.

B002VECM4A|4.0|There are some movies that are so dark and so gritty you almost have to muster up the presence of mind to even watch them. Such is the case for 2009 Best Picture nominee \\"Precious\\", about a black girl in Harlem who has to overcome an abusive mother, an incestuous father, obesity, illiteracy and bearing two children by the time she is sixteen years old.<br /><br />Based on the novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire, this drama is not unlike a tiny sprout attempting to push up toward the sun out of the broken concrete sidewalks of the inner city. It unflinchingly takes on taboos and stereotypes, while simultaneously making you fall in love with a very unlikely heroine.<br /><br />Make no mistake. This is a powerful hero's journey that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences acknowledged with six Oscar nominations. These included best picture of the year, as well as Best Lead Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Directing, Best Editing and Best Screenplay Adaptation.<br /><br />The strength of this story relies a ton on the two nominated actresses - newcomer Gabourey Sidibe in the title role, as well as Mo'Nique, who plays Precious' abusive mother, Mary. Their relationship is the catalyst for every challenge that Precious faces in her life, and both of these actresses deliver a heart wrenching, painfully cutting depiction of abuse, hatred, resentment and yearning.<br /><br />Our story starts with Precious in her public high school. She's a daydreamer, which gets her through the bitter reality she faces when she goes home to face her mother. Mary is the stereotypical inner city welfare mother who has no interest in making any attempts to better herself or her family. She just wants her check, and she's willing to put up with just about anything to get it.<br /><br />This includes allowing her man to sexually abuse her daughter. Director Lee Daniels makes the very shrewd decision to only show us the barest glimpses of the violence; this content is a bitter pill to swallow without any unnecessary details that would border on exploitation. Instead it takes you right up to the brink of your tolerance and then allows you - like Precious - a welcome reprieve from the depravity one only need hints toward in order to get the full effect.<br /><br />That is why we see things from the POV of Precious as she daydreams of a life far, far away from the situations she is unable to escape except in her mind.<br /><br />The beacon of hope comes from a no-nonsense teacher named Ms. Rain, played with the appropriate amount of toughness and tenderness by Paula Patton. Precious is taken from the public school system and placed in an alternative education atmosphere - which means she's surrounded with other girls not too different from herself.<br /><br />They all have their own crosses to bear, not to mention chips on their shoulders.<br /><br />But somehow in this motley crew we see Precious begin to blossom. After she gets over the initial resistance learning to read and write, she finds that she's not so stupid after all - and that those insults she had endured from her mother were wrong, very wrong.<br /><br />All those daydreams and fanciful thoughts find their way into her journal once she is given the tools to use one, and this sets that bound bird inside her heart free.<br /><br />It is with acceptance from these new people in her life (including her social worker Mrs. Weiss - played convincingly by a surprisingly plain Mariah Carey), that Precious begins to grow and blossom ...a little sprout reaching for the sun.<br /><br />There are scenes that will break you. There are scenes that will anger you. There are scenes that will make you cheer, and scenes that will break your heart. But at the end when you're looking back you'll see that Precious summed it up eloquently with:<br /><br />PRECIOUS (V.O.)<br />The other day I cried, felt stupid.<br />Guess what...* that other day.<br />Thas why God or whoever make new<br />days.<br /><br />Indeed.<br /><br />It is with that mix of vulnerability and strength, defeat and determination that carries the audience through these very dark passages through the human experience. This has everything to do with lead actress Gabby Sidibe. We hang in there because she does. We find strength to endure because she does. We never give up hope... because she doesn't.<br /><br />So when she breaks down and demands who is going to love someone like her, the audience is ready to embrace her and say, \\"I will.\\"<br /><br />Gabby can feel very accomplished to have brought such an amazingly complicated character to life, especially for her film debut.<br /><br />Which is why she was nominated.<br /><br />Mo'Nique's bravery to attempt such a detestable character has been rewarded several times in addition to her Oscar win. Few of us can fathom the courage it took to bring such a flawed character to life with such dedication to character integrity.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|Worked fine for awhile, but now will not open. Not sure if an update was pushed or not. I tried rebooting phone and checking task manager.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am not a person who will watch a movie twice but I have seen this movie at least 15 times and I never tire of it. The story line is excellent, the setting is beautiful and the ending is romantic. I don't think I will ever tire of watching this movie. Every character is refreshing and real and it makes you wish you lived in their times.  I wish there were more movies like this one.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Running this on an original moto droid and it runs fantastic, even with the higher resolution and graphics.  I enjoy that it departs from just killing pigs and has a variety of enemies and tasks.  Knocking free caged birds, knocking out monkeys, there is even a boss level.  Whereas I lost interest in Seasons, this version is fresh and fun to play.
B001DSNELK|5.0|Got this box set sent to me in Australia.  Arrived after a few days , in perfect condition..  It was better than I expected , as I have bought some Gift sets before and they are light as a feather and the detail is not so crash hot !!  This is a well put together box set , and the Bust is really nice , even the packaging is nice to look at !!  I havent even opened it as Its for my collection , and its right at the front now :D
B003EYVXXW|2.0|Two stars because it looks so good.  If you want to see contemporary campus opinion on religion dressed up in ancient garb, this is the film for you.  An epic set in ancient Egypt turns out to be nothing more than a diatribe against Christianity.  No wonder the film did poorly in Europe and worse in the US.      It bombed because it's not good.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio is a huuuge step up from the first game. The graphics are improved, there is a great deal of intricacy to the levels, and the collectables make the game very challenging.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is one hell of a blade. Agatha is my wife, I'm using her account. This knife is everything you hear about. Yeah the sheth kinnda sucks, but if your getting the knife to review the sheth then I can only emagine how much you would even use this knife at all. Yeah you can buy another sheth and even put other handles on it....so? For the price and if you know how to use it, you cannot beat it. If you buy this bad ass knife for a survival knife and then bitch about the sheth or handles I can tell you now, don't depend on ANYTHING someone else puts the word \\"survival\\" on it to keep YOUR ASS alive or safe.Great knife, great price, Amazon delivers again.
B004G5ZXVQ|2.0|It looks like I'm in the minority here, but I liked their last one better. I've listened to this one three times now and for the life of me, I can't remember any of the songs. They used to have a knack for writing catchy stuff that was still to the left of center, but there's a blandness to this that I just can't get past. Sorry, REM fans.
B003QNXPUK|5.0|Im pretty picky about my screen protectors and how they go on. Generally I dont like to put them on because I am so picky about them. Also since Im a bachelor, my house is kind of dusty as well O:)<br />I put my invisible shields on the phone this morning in less than 10 minutes! It was so easy and they are practically invisible! There is a small piece of dust that snuck in but for how small it is, I'll deal with it.<br /><br />It also came with protectors for the sides but I decided not to use them just because I'm not as concerned about the metal. It's more the glass that worried me.
B004BRP7R4|2.0|I am a huge Groban fan.....seen him in concert a few times and own all his music. I couldn't wait for his new CD to come out and am extremely disappointed in the new direction. I can only listen to one song on this album and even that isn't great. He still has an amazing voice, but the song choices were bland. I hope he goes back to what he used to produce and give us something to listen to and enjoy again.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Awesome. Watch disc 2 first, then watch the, by far, best concert ever: The Odean in London. Then enjoy the remastered BTR album with a great set of headphones. True Bruce Fans will find it Awesome!
1452101248|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting the US release of this book since its UK release last year.<br />I have the (UK version) of the first Ottolenghi book, which is easily my favorite cookery book of my (embarrasingly large) collection. I've never been let down by one of his recipes, and I've made most of them.<br /><br />I was so excited to receive this in the mail, and I can say that the wait for this book was worth it.<br />The photography is gorgeous, and for those of you who like a picture to accompany every recipe, you got it.<br /><br />I love how the book is laid out in chapters by main ingredient. This is especially helpful for those who belong to a CSA/Veg Box scheme and are looking for something to do with the chard/cabbage/leeks etc.<br /><br />The commentary on each recipe is thoughtful and helpful. The flavor combinations that Mr. Ottolenghi uses are thoughtful and interesting, and often allow us to enjoy a vegetable in a way that we had not previously. I often feel like I'm doing my body a favor by making one of his recipes, given that they feature abundant quantities of fresh vegetables and whole grains.<br /><br />I've never written a review on Amazon before, but I do rely on them heavily when making purchases, so I wanted to pass on what a gem this book is.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I originally found this dvd at a garage sale and picked it up for my oldest son.  We all enjoyed it so much that I purchased two more through Amazon for my other two sons who are big fans of this group.  The special effects on this dvd are so spectacular that it takes your breath away and the singing is totally awesome! Worth every penny!

B0037RDPEG|3.0|me... me... me... well, maybe it's not a surprise that it's all about the ME - after all it's the story of a woman trying to get her life and her self back on track - looking for God or her inner voice posing as God.    I sort of like the description of Italy - and India when it comes to that. And at the end of the day it wasn't a total waste of money and time buying and reading this book.    In a nutshell it's okay to read it, but you won't really miss a thing if you don't. As said before, this book is highly overrated.
0756404738|4.0|I was anxiously awaiting this sequel, and purchased it soon after release.  I will say that it was enjoyable, but I found some of the plot \\"twists\\" extremely abrupt and not necessarily in keeping with what I enjoy about this author's writing.<br /><br />If you, like me, feel the NEED to follow the continuing story of Kvothe the Bloodless, then buying this book is a no-brainer.  However, I think I read on the author's blog that there was some drastic editing, so at times it feels a bit like they chopped a chunk out of the story (I feel like this author is skilled enough that he would have lead in to major plot turns a bit more subtly, so I am thinking things were either added or subtracted with too much haste).<br /><br />That said, the purchase of the next sequel will will also be a no-brainer for me, and I was certainly not looking forward to the pages of this book running out.  It's a clever and interesting story, something we fantasy readers see too little of sometimes!  I am now anxiously awaiting day 3!
B0000844MR|5.0|As the title hints at, I consider THE DARK CRYSTAL a PG-version of Farscape. That said, I only got into THE DARK CRYSTAL when it came out on UMD. TDC is one of those movies you have to be in a certian state-of-mind to throughly enjoy. Even as a 'Scaper, I am impressed with the puppetery. The funny thing is that THE DARK CRYSTAL is the only Jim Henson / Creature Shop production that I have on DVD.
B00005JMCN|3.0|Perhaps I approached this film with expectations that were too high, since I was not only insanely in love with this horse, but I actually saw him win the Santa Anita Handicap (along with his stablemate Kayak II--totally ignored in this film). My father, the Sports Editor of the Los Angeles Examiner, took me to see all of Seabiscuit's races at Santa Anita that year. I was a horsey child (unfortunately other people's horses!), and I shall never forget the true \\"Seabiscuit Madness\\" that suffused the California air (until it was swept away by a different and insidious madness in 1941).<br /><br />I recently read and enjoyed Ms. Hillebrand's book, \\"Seabiscuit,\\" but I found the film wanting on several counts: the endless \\"clearing of the throat\\" and preachiness before the director finally arrived at the point of the story: the eponymous Seabiscuit; and the director's seeming inability to relate the rest of the story in a coherent way. What should have been high drama emerged in a curiously static manner. (I was also disenchanted by the gratuitous profanity that added little to the tale [cf. its mature and necessary use in \\"The King's Speech\\"]).<br /><br />On the plus side, the cinematography was excellent; the horses, who upstage the talented actors, are magnificent. Unfortunately, the film simply could not live up to memories of the real Seabiscuit, my \\"first love.\\"
B004SBS8LA|3.0|ik trying somthing new was good but this ruined how everyone enjoyed this game. no more enemys, its just become logic now. but still a good game.
030745455X|5.0|Quotes-\\"It was no report. It was a cover-up. Zalachenko was more important than Agneta Salander. He could not be identified or exposed. He did not exist\\"<br /><br />  In THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, the second book of the best-selling Millennium trilogy by Steig Larsson, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, along with a somewhat corrupt police force, investigates three brutal murders.  Initial evidence found ascribes the miscreant to be protagonist Lisbeth Salander, a socially inept computer hacker. Blomkvist, who became good friends with Salander during THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, feels certain though that these horrific murders have something to do with the investigations his magazine, Millennium, has recently been conducting about sex-trafficking. Throughout this astute glimpse into the world of Sweden's atrocious human and sex trafficking, events of Salander's dark past become clear.  Along with the central story of how these sleuths delve into the convoluted world of criminal behavior, FIRE has many intricate sub-plots, such as a rekindled love affair and internal changes occurring in Salander.<br /><br />FIRE is a great read for anyone interested in murder mysteries. Also, this shockingly realistic novel includes non-fiction aspects, such as criminal investigations and sex-trafficking. One of the most unique aspects of FIRE, and the entire Millennium trilogy, too, is the pace Larsson unravels the story. Even though this book was highly enjoyable, I would say that it is very much inferior to TATTOO, which granted, is a tough act to follow. Still, I would give this book a 5.0 out of 5 stars!
0981951244|1.0|A disappointed product. Too shallow and common sensical. Listening to the CD, but don't find the author a great presenter.    Anthony Robbins also is a Salesman, but he is more stimulating and has more to offer.    Try 7 Habits, Dale Carnegie, W. Clement Stone, and Think & Grow Rich.    Don't waste time and money!!
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I used this app when I wrote using my old Palm Treo. I bought the android version when I got an evo - initially disappointed with the new version, dataviz has brought the app up to speed. And if you look at a lot of pdf's, the pdf reader is better than Adobes.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|I think this is Angelina's best film, hands down.  She just becomes Gia and you forget you are watching a movie.  I absolutely love her performance.  I totally connect with her character because I feel that I resemble some of her qualities.  I also loved Mercedes Rhuel as Gia's mother.  Her character actually reminds me of MY mother.  This is an incredible movie, well written and very well acted.  U go Angelina, make more movies like this and stay away from Tomb Raider!!
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|This is a great antidote to those thrillers where every explosion has to be bigger than the last. It takes a little time to get going, but even the slow bits are still fun. The supporting cast is especially good.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Just a few thoughts...<br /><br />What else can be said about Titanic (1997)?  After nearly 2,200 Amazon reviews, here's one more.  I give this movie a 5-star rating.  It won 11 Academy Awards.  It's sad, interesting, entertaining, suspenseful, scary, and romantic all rolled into one.  The acting is great.  Kate Winslet plays the role of Rose very well, but I think the best actor in the whole movie was Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson.  Billy Zane, who played Cal, also did a great job.  He's my favorite character in the whole movie.  Really, every actor did a great job - Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Bernard Hill, everybody.  The script is great, the special effects are great, the story is great.<br /><br />For MANY YEARS after this movie came out, I've been hearing Celine Dion's song playing everywhere.  I must say it drives me nuts.  Some songs just get on my nerves.  That's one of them.  An overdone song that's played WAY too much over the airwaves.  You can't go anywhere without hearing it.  And you know what?  It doesn't fit in with the movie too well, in my opinion.  Too commercial, too much of a sellout.  Now, the musical score by James Horner was good and fits the movie well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great epic movie that I highly recommend.
1439156816|5.0|I have to admit that I was skeptical at first. Another book on writing? I'm not even a big fan of Stephen King's novels. I got this from the library and was captivated by King's unique voice and humor that I had to buy my own copy. I return to it again and again for insights on the writing life.    King combines writing advice with his own personal story and experiences, his successes and failures. And he does it with honesty and sincerity. He tells readers not to bother if they aren't coming to their writing with serious intentions. That honesty is what makes this a book that every writer needs to read and own.    [...]
0743298039|5.0|I checked out the audio book version of The Thirteenth Tale from the library several years ago simply because the title intrigued me.  It became one of my favorite books ever.  I love the writing style, love the storyline.  I have recommended it to quite a few people over time, and they have all loved it.  I ordered the audio book from Amazon to listen to on a long car trip a couple of years ago, and am now listening to it again while on the treadmill. The only other book by a living author that I have read more than once is The Stand by Stephen King, and that was a long, long time ago. The readers are perfect, and really bring the book to life. I keep watching for a second novel by Diane Setterfield.  In the meantime, I'm still enjoying The Thirteenth Tale.
0312360258|4.0|Don't let the bad reviews scare you away from this book. So many people can't remember what it's like to be a 16 year old going through puberty and dealing with high school. This book was fun and can't wait to start the 2nd one! The first part of the book I was a little hesitant and kept comparing it to the twilight series. Once I got a couple chapters into the book I stopped comparing and was able to appreciate it for the fascinating book it is. It's not a book you take seriously, so just read and let your imagination have fun with it.
0670022411|5.0|What an amazing read. Many reviewers have called this book \\"bulky\\"...to those who love the story the bulk is what we hang on for...I love the elaborate details of Diana and Ysebeau's first meetings and the elaborate pictures painted by the author...would not have had this book any other way!
B0000C9JFO|5.0|I stumbled upon this movie and I truly enjoyed it. I will admit that I watched it due to Audrey and although she was not in it as much as I expected I just have to say that this movie is a treat. I recommend it more for those in their 20s and 30s though. I do not think that the carefree lifestyle would appeal to an older crowd.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This is a great upgrade from the free version. Unlimited tagging is great plus all the other features you love are here. I got it as the free app of the day but it is worth the price tag.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|My question is why do I have to give them a credit card, to get a FREE app. If sonething is free, well ????  Total BS on the part of Amazon with the new  requirements!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a great addition to the series. It keeps the same basic concepts but changes the game play enough to make it feel like a new game. Get it while it's free but it is still worth the buck.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in a long long time. Very well written, excellent actors, and based on a true story.  It does make you sad how corrupt sometimes even the highest levels of government can be, but that is something we already knew.  Wish there were more people like Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|awesome addition to the angry birds games. I like the graphics and the new plot. saving birds is neat. I have had 0 problems installing or playing the app works great. thanks for making it free
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I'm in shock that Adele only has two albums.  I'm in awe at what 21 has to offer!  She is wonderful.  I hope she comes out with a box set of live performances.  She's the freshest sound out there at this time!  Love her music!
1439107955|5.0|Vendor was prompt and order as advertised with great price.  This book is an excellent chronological synopsis of the history of discovery, treatment, and cure for cancer.  It is very well written.  A little bit of medical background makes it an easy read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle works great on my Archos 101IT!  My only wish would be to be able to set up reading &quot;modes&quot;,  like night, dim, bright,... instead of having to switch between the black and white background and tweaking the brightness, but that's a minor inconvenience.
0375850864|5.0|My boys loved this book.  Rebecca Stead weaves a compelling story, and its setting in NYC made it all the more fun for us.

B002ZG98FU|5.0|This movie took me by surprise.  I adore Rachel McAdams, but I thought it might be a little cheesy.  The surprise was that I laughed out loud throughout the movie, and it takes a lot for me to laugh out loud. Definitely buying this one for my collection!
B000007OTH|5.0|Could not find this recording anywhere.  Amazon obtained it with no difficulty and sent it promptly.  I will be using Amazon to find classical music DVDs in the future
1400052173|5.0|I heard about this book when the author was on satellite radio and I immediately rushed out to buy it.  I'm halfway through this amazing story.  So wonderfully written.  I had no idea what history was behind the He La cell.  The author has done a fantastic job putting together all the pieces.  I would highly recommend this read.
0316017922|2.0|Although I believe Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell, had good intentions, I do not exactly buy into his explanation of the factors that contribute to success. Gladwell almost had a condescending tone throughout the book that downplayed natural ability and talent. For example, the \\"10,000 Hour Rule\\" that is referred to in the book says that if anyone does any task for 10,000 hours, they can be an expert in that specific task. This is disheartening to me because it is saying that talent and ability is irrelevant, all you need is time to be successful. Even though it is logical that after 10,000 hours you should be at least close to an expert because that is a very long time, it should not mean that talented people will not be successful if they do not practice as long. Similarly, in the beginning of the book Gladwell examines Canadian ice hockey players and claims that all of extremely talented players were born in between January and March. He is saying that since the players were born between January 1st and December 31st the older boys were bigger and more mature, therefore identified as better players. I believe that this is a very interesting point. As a young child I was put in the higher math classes in elementary school and ever since I have been in honors-type classes. I was born in November, early in the school calendar, so does that I was not put in these classes because of my intellect but because of my birthday? I understand that there are small things that may bring about advantages for certain people, but I think that is a matter of luck, not an explanation for success. I do not appreciate the way that Gladwell is seemingly trying to find excuses about why people are successful even though there may not be an excuse, just pure talent and luck. Statistically, I appreciate his findings and think that he does make valid points, but I think his analysis of data is slightly exaggerated. Overall, I found the book interesting, but I would not recommend do not believe in self-success and the idea of putting your mind to a task will bring you success.
0525951652|5.0|Another enthralling story by Ken Follett. At least as good as Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. All are page turners of the highest caliber. I had not read any of his earlier works of fiction, but I do intend to do so. These three books have made me an avid fan of Ken Follett, and I would recommend any of his books to anyone interested in hearing my opinion. Can't wait til the next book in the Century trilogy is available for ordering.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|Awesome movie with amazing action sequences, beautiful girls, a killer soundtrack, and a mind-binding storyline. Do not listen the critics. They want every movie to be as banal and unwatchable as King's Speech.

B003GEDLW6|5.0|Not much to add, that already hasnt been said. I love listening and riding to this music - car or bicycle. They used to remind me of Scooter/Prodigy with a drum and bass twist. But now I think they are taking their music to another level. Prodigy tried, but struck out. We'll see how Pendulum does. I just hope they dont forget what got them here.

0070511136|5.0|If I was only able to buy one book on sales in my life, then this would be the book.  I have been in professional sales for over 20 years and I have read a ton of sales book and this is the best.  It teaches you the actual mechanics of selling by showing you how to ask the right questions of your prospective customers.  The question format uncovers needs and locks in your relationship with your customers.  Whenever I get into a funk I go back and review this book.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
1594202842|5.0|I didn't expect to end up liking Ms Chua or taking away anything of value from this book.  From the reviews I had read else where, I was expecting her to be a dragon lady/mommy dearest type.  She is neither of those things.  She is a warm and caring mom who very much loves her kids.  She has amazing insight in to children and realizes that being your kids best buddy is not a good way to parent.   I loved this book!   Its highly entertaining and easy to read. I grew to really care about what happened to all the people in the story.  But the main reason I liked it so much is that it helped me to understand my own tiger mom better and let go of the resentment I've been harboring for her for most of my adult life.  My mom is 1/2 chinese btw.  I didn't even realize she was a tiger mom until I saw her so clearly in this book.  I now know that all the pushing and critical remarks were her way of motivating me and getting me to reach my full potential and not settling for average.  She did what she had to do to, I see that now and I am successful because of her.  Left to my own devices I would have barely made it through school, gone to a crappy college and never have gotten in to medical school.  I am where I am now because of her and I am grateful.   I give Amy Chua all the credit for my much improved relationship with my mom!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I didn't get into \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" until I received the first season on DVD as a gift. I was pleasantly surprised with what I watched: a wonderfully crafted story filled with rich and unforgettable characters. Though it may look like just another teen show, the classic vampire mythos is alive and well in this series; adult vampire fans will want to check it out. While not as gritty as \\"True Blood,\\" there's enough action, violence, and quite a bit of on-screen death to keep anyone from getting too bored.    The tale about \\"girl-meets-vampire\\" may sound familiar to many, but note that the original author, L.J. Smith wrote the books back in 1991, and the TV adaption only started airing since late 2009.     I highly recommend checking this series out! You will not be disappointed!

B000002LTU|4.0|Back in the late nineties I was absorbed in the electronic music/rave scene collecting every genre from drum and bass, trip-hop, house and techno.  Sometime in early 2000 I came across this album in Amazon and it was one of my first wish lists adds.  The idea of the great Miles Davis producing a hip hop album perfectly fit my sensibilities.  I imaged it fit someone between Portishead and Goldie, with some Mark Farina mixed in.  I never did purchase the album back then but I never forgot it either.      Lately, due in part to my expanding SACD library, I've had a much more focused view on the classical jazz works.  While diving through the crates I came across this infamous cover.  I had to pick it up.      So, first off this album is Miles vamping off some fairly ordinary, occasionally cheesy, passable hip hop production.  There is a little rap, or rather MC'ing, but nothing that is overly distracting although it isn't good either.  But that is mostly beside the point, as is much of this album.  It's pleasant to listen to for sure.  Certainly not nearly as rewarding as his classic pieces, but an enjoyable diversion during late night drives, etc.   However, the importance of this album will always be that it was his last project, and this last project did hint at the next, and probably appropriate, direction Miles was taking.      I can't help thinking, as I'm sure a lot of you do, what if Miles had a chance to record with like minded musicians such as The Roots.    I can't imagine these last sessions demonstrated his perfected hip hop expression, but just maybe with the right collaborator.... We'll never know.   So we are left with this.  An imperfect album that none the less, entertains.  It's got a groove, it's a got a great soloist.  It's got a place in my Miles collection.
B003UESJHY|4.0|Known as the \\"Pride of Lowell (Massachusetts)\\",  Dicky Eklund's (Christian Bale) primary claim to fame is his 1978 boxing match with Sugar Ray Leonard, where Eklund knocked down Leonard, who eventually won the match. In 1996, Eklund, now a crack addict, is in front of the cameras as an HBO film crew is making a documentary about him, the focus he believes (falsely) to be his boxing comeback at close to age 40. For the past ten years, he has also acted as one of the two trainers for his decade younger half brother,Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), who is known primarily as a brawler used by other boxers as a stepping stone to better boxers. Both their careers are managed by their domineering mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) who believes it better to keep it all in the family. Because of his crack addiction, Dicky is unreliable. A move by Dicky and Alice at one of Micky's fights makes Micky come to the realization that his boxing career is being stalled and perhaps even under-minded by the two, who are only looking out for themselves. This stance is fostered by Micky's new girlfriend, college drop-out and now local bartender Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams). As Micky tries boxing life without Dicky and Alice - much to their anger - he has to figure out where they fit into his life, especially as they do not get along with Charlene, if at all. These decisions become all the more important as Micky moves up the ranks and is given a shot at the world welterweight championship    While on the surface The Fighter seems to be juyst another boxing movie it is in reality much more. The film focuses on family relationships and on what it means to be a hometown legend. Director Davis O. Russell and producer Wahlberg have created a film that richly desrved the Oscar nominations that it received. The film provides a  look beyond the sport into the lives of the people and their problems and triumphs. The acting by the entire cast makes this film one of the must see films of last year.    TheBlu Ray disc comes with a wealth of special features including a commentary track by Russell, two featurettes: one a detailed look at the history of the project and the making of the film; the other a look at the town of Lowell, Massachusetts and its boxing history. A series of deleted scenes some with Russell commentary are also presented.    The Fighter was one of the surprise hits of 2010 and deserves a wider audience which it may well get in this excellent DVD package.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I purchased this album after hearing Dogs Days Are Over just once. One song after the other unfolded and I had a new favorite album. Every single song is amazing. Girl With One Eye is ridiculously good (the end is out of control) and makes me want to sit Florence down and beg her to venture deeply into the blues, but yet I can't give up the other songs on the album.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|If you are familiar with only one song from \\"Les Miserables\\" you will do yourself a huge favor to hear the rest.  This DVD has the excitement of the live performance, with incredible talent.  Alphie Boe in the lead role is remarkable!  His voice has brought me to tears.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  Unfortunately Nick Jonas is out of his element here, but two cheers for a valiant effort.  I have watched the entire DVD at least six times in as many weeks and am still moved with each viewing.  Highly recommended!

1439156816|5.0|The second half of Stephen King's 'On Writing' should probably be required reading for every aspiring author.  In fact, it's one of those rare writing books that makes me want to go back and re-read chapters again to make sure I see clearly what he is saying...to mix a metaphor.        The first half of the books is memoir.  If you're a Stephen King fan, it'll be interesting.  I think it does a good job of explaining one of the big mysteries of Stephen King's career: why he writes the stuff he does.  As far as sheer writing skill, Stephen King is amazing.  I think people will be assigned his books to study a century from now.  If he chose to write Fantasy, he'd be another Robert Jordan.  If he he chose to write straight fiction, he'd be up there with John Irving, nudging Tom Wolfe's chair from just below.  But he likes cheesy monsters, dark basements, chills up the spine.  But forget all that, when Stephen King is writing about people he is at his most engrossing and truthful.        The second half, though for me is the meat of the book.  I could go on at length about all the useful stuff in there but I'd practically have to transcribe half the book.  Instead, I'll call out one thing that's valuable and one that's misleading, I think.      First the good stuff.  One of my real struggles as a writer is knowing what to take out.  I'm terrible at cutting my own work.  I know no one else can do it, only I know what's important to the plot but I get lost staring at a 174k novel and trying to figure out how to cut out 34k of words I literally sweated out sometimes.  King doesn't make it easy but he lit a light.  I can see it, it doesn't illuminate everything but it gives me something to work towards.  It's all about taking out unnecessary words.  Sounds simple, doesn't it?  So is his 'magic formula', I think he'd be ok with me sharing it with you here:   The magic formula is First Draft - 10% = Second Draft.      Sounds too simple, maybe.  And it doesn't tell enoughbut then it's a magic formula, you have to figure out how the trick works for yourself but King has several great chapters showing how and what he cuts. That's the most valuable thing I learned from this book.  Now I just need to find a way to apply it to my books.        That was the sweet, now for the sour.  One of the misleading, maybe even destructive pieces of advice is to not outline.  He advocates just writing, pure right-brain, id-spewing writing. He doesn't worry about his endings and, I hate to say it, that's a big flaw in his writing.  If you've read enough of his books you'll maybe agree with me that Stephen King writes terrible endings. He writes great climaxes but after that...pppffft. Limp.  Listen, every writer is different. Let me emphasize that:  EVERY WRITER IS DIFFERENT.  What works for one won't work for another.  That's the agony and art of writing, discovering what works for you.  There is a lot of good that comes out of that trance-like writing you get when you're in the zone, when your subconscious comes out, (or your Muse or whatever you want to call it) and the words flow. Yes, yes, a thousand times yes, follow that feeling. Don't break it for anything that doesn't involve blood or fire.  But for many writers, structure is important.  Knowing your ending is important.  Outlining your novel can solve a heck of a lot of plot problems and I speak from experience there.        But that's just me.  The book is wonderful, it belongs on your bookshelf.  In fact, a 10th anniversary edition was just released.  Buy it.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I would love to read this book, unfortunately I am on a budget and can't afford $12.99 for a kindle book.  My personal limit is $9.99, then it has to be by an author I truly love to follow.  Sorry, no sale here, not at that price.
B004G5VFOU|5.0|You have to keep the previous remaster of this album, because the two bonus studio tracks on the 2001 reissue are not on this new one. They were both produced by Guy Stevens and from the original sessions for what was going to be a Winwood solo album. So, thanks Universal for making me keep something for 2 tracks you could have EASILY fit on disc one of this new set.    - Vincent G. Marino
B004HGBUVG|5.0|As always, Lucinda has another hit out for us all to enjoy!  Be sure to get the special edition and decide for yourself.  I have been listening to both CDs and keep going back to the Kithcen Table the most.  If you enjoy raw vocals this one is for you.  I think it is Lucinda at her best and it won't disappoint a true Lucinda fan.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific is emotionally charged and horrying at times as you go inside the world of the US Marine during World War II. The series lets the viewer feel what these extraordinary men went through and the amazing courage they had to display while facing obstacles from both the enemy and nature, all the while struggling to obtain final victory. The men who fought in the Pacific as well as in Europe are nothing less than heroes, and should never be forgotten, and great works as this and Band of Brothers will ensure that never happens. Everyone should own this film!
1439153663|1.0|I have no idea how people compared this book to The Help.  This book is poorly written and the plot is a s dumb as they come and entirely unrealistic-----it was a complete waste of time and money and was only good for starting my fire!!

1844137864|5.0|Awesome book! I have been a fan of Banksy's artwork and was excited to have this book.  The artwork is great, as usual, and the quotes, letters, and other things in addition to his artwork make it a really enjoyable book.  The description said it was slightly used, but when I received it, it was practically in brand new condition.  Very happy with this purchase.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Like original, only you don't hurt pigs, smoother and better graphics, less lag, etc. The storyline is more unique and entertaining. More fun and new villains to beat. Overall best of the three.
1597801585|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly! (I ended up buying Shipbreaker and Pump Six.)    Paolo does a great job working the tomorrow of rising sea levels, copyrighted designer seeds - and no more oil.    Very good read!
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|This is much better than the trailers make it out to be.  I remember watching the previews for it and being upset.  When I was young, I grew up watching the original A-Team.  It used to have re-runs everyday after school.  This was one of my favorite shows with Hannibal, Face, Murdock, and BA!  They kept a lot of hommage to the original, but updated the special effects.  This was a feel good action flick. Just go into this with an open mind, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The acting was decent.  The casting was pretty good. (They actually got Liam Nelson to play Hannibal! What a coup!)  The characters were similar enough to the original.  It had an air of familiarity.  I enjoyed this very much.
B00001QEFU|1.0|This remix is terrible sounding, what you need is the original disc, I have the original 1985 roadrunner disc which is made in japan, it sounds waaaaaayyyyyyy better then the remix. I think there is also 2 other versions which came out in 1985, get one of those 3 and not the remix which is one of the worst remasters I've ever heard. It will cost you a pretty penny (50-100$) but its well worth it. I would give that version 5 stars but amazon doesn't have either of the 3, probably due to the rarity of them.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Read some of the reviews before I purchased this on DVD. The reviews said it was so-so and not to expect a lot. I bought it thinking it might be an ok family movie to watch. The movie was so much more than that! Yes, there are parts that seem slow, but that just gives you a chance to breathe - and perhaps question. It's a REAL movie - not a full adrenaline rush where you can't explain much of the plot later. We all moved from the dinner table to the couches and left the dinner plates to be done AFTER the movie finished. That's how good it was! We will be watching it again tomorrow!

B001EN71DG|5.0|The Star Wars trilogy began in 1977, and after over 30 years it continues to be a pop culture icon.  George Lucas' mastery of storytelling and special effects has changed the way movies are made.  From space battles in the middle of nowhere to dramatic lightsaber battles between father and son, the special effects are like none that had ever been seen before, and inspiring everything that we see today.  Not only has he changed the way movies are made, he has also changed the way movies are watched.    Before Star Wars, movies were all thought provoking emotional dramas that tied you to the protagonist. Lucas changed that by taking the focus off of the heroes and putting the focus on the story as a whole.  With action drama, and romance, it is a perfect mixture of cowboys and aliens, or as Lucas likes to call it, a \\"space opera.\\"  George Lucas has created movies that continue to inspire and provoke fans and critics alike.  From parodies to festivals, and video games to action figures, Star Wars has created a legacy that has yet to fade from history.
B0032Y8XH8|2.0|With such great reviews from others, I thought I should try this cd out, but I have been very disappointed overall.    --Good about CD---  Sonically average/above average    --Bad about CD---  1. Lyrically deficient. Most songs are repetitious and lack insight. They are one-sided. I was expecting Bob Dylan-like quality, but this is far below.  2. Occasional explicit language.  There should be a warning on the CD to indicate this.  3. Lacks variety.  Most of the songs sound like reworking of the previous one.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|This version is missing text.  As others have noted, whenever there is a quote from a newspaper article in the story, the text is missing.  The entire legend of the \\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" which does much to set the supernatural tone of the story, is missing!  I'm only in Chapter 4 and have counted 3 missing passages already.
B000A896J8|3.0|I have no Idea what the movie was like, It was for region 2.

While it certainly isn't bad, it's not the highest quality I've heard.    Elvis is in great form for this concert. His voice is strong and clear and he puts a lot of energy into his singing. A great concert from the King.

0451457994|4.0|First and foremost, I'll say I have not seen the movie. Only thing I knew going in was that the movie is a classic, and HAL turns evil. Needless to say, I had some surprises waiting for me.<br /><br />What I enjoy about good science fiction is how the author can make the most fantastical events seem not only possible, but downright plausible. Compared to say, Star Wars, space travel in 2001 is difficult, slow, and impossible when looking at moving beyond the reach of our own sun. This all is shaken when an alien artifact is found on the moon, and is indisputably declared 3 million years old.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention 3 million years old? Let me back up a moment. The book starts 3 million years ago. Forget the 10,000 years Asimov spans with his Foundation series; here we've got 3 million crossed in the span of a few opening chapters. It's an enjoyable bit, watching as aliens effectively guide the evolution of man, alerting them to the ideas of tools, and therefore inescapably, warfare.<br /><br />Of course, here I am expecting some sorta space shuttle with a killer AI program, and instead I get cavemen and alien objects on the moon. Loved every second of it, too. I want good science fiction to give me ideas, things to ponder over or wonder about the implications. An alien object waiting for us on the moon, which gives out a signal when dug up? What does it mean? Is it a warning? A guide? Will spaceships arrive to Earth, and if so, in how long? Will they be friendly? Ready for war? Or do the aliens even still exist 3 million years later? What sort of empire could endure for that long, what with us silly humans ready to nuke ourselves into dust within a few years of actually launching into space?<br /><br />Anyway, the HAL segments actually intrigued me the least. Maybe by now I've just read and seen too many rogue AI stories to be surprised by this one. From what little I know, this segment is much longer in the movie, and given the variety of topics covered in the book, this is probably the strongest and wisest area to expand.<br /><br />It's after HAL is disconnected that things get really interesting. I'm sure there are plenty who don't like the ending, but I LOVED it.<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />Gimme big. Gimme epic. Gimme a reprogrammed man with god-like powers arriving at Earth, blowing up the moon, and floating amid the debris trying to decide just what to do with his new home. That image is awesome, the potential stories following incredible.<br /><br />*/spoilers*<br /><br />Was the book perfect? Naah. Slow at times, outdated in others, and its emphasis on difficult, yet tedious and uneventful, space travel had more implications when every shuttle launch was a risk.

1140418041|4.0|Having been enthralled by A Room With a View, I expected a similar experience with Howards End, especially since it is hailed by many as Forster's masterpiece. By the time I reached the climax, I discovered that the piece did have quite the impact on me. Forster's critique of the social tenets of turn-of-the-century life in early 1900s Britain is certainly progressive. It is positively eye-opening, if one is willing to imagine the stir it would certainly have make upon readers in Forster's age. While not even coming close to being as good from start to finish as A Room With a View was to me, Howards End seems to be the most important of the two novels.    Because of the lack of immediate page-turning storyline, patience is certainly the most important virtue a reader requires when approaching this novel. However, Forster's writing style is extremely easy to follow, which helps to delve into the story. This is helpful because the story seems to drag for a majority of the novel, leaving the reader wondering where in the world Forster is planning on taking them.    One of Forster's core beliefs concerning the novel was that plot was of minimal importance. Plot is simply to serve as a means-to-an-end--it is a device simply utilized to suggest a broad social critique. When the novel is concluded, it becomes clear this is the case with Howards End. Characters such as Leonard, an insurance clerk of the lower echelon of Britain's socioeconomic ladder are presented as incredibly complex, but developed briefly and not touched upon for large chunks of the novel. Leonard lacks intelligence concerning fine art, but not or lack of trying. After encountering Forster's two protagonists who are of a high-art, liberal (and borderline feminist) persuasion, Leonard desires to increase his knowledge of art and fiction, and begins to resent his simplistic wife, who represents everything he loathes within himself.    Leonard's complexity comes to us in the span of two short chapters and is not touched upon for most of the novel. I had a sense of him being key to the conclusion of the story (and was correct!), though I had no idea how. Because of his disappearance from the plot, much of the novel, especially the middle bits, seem to needlessly drag. I almost began to hate reading the novel, but the last one hundred pages turned brought me back around and caused me to love the story, and the points Forster made.    The core of the story deals with political struggles. The liberal Schlegal sisters alternate between being disgusted by the aristocratic and conservative Wilcox family and admiring them. The Schlegals are introduced to the Wilcoxes before the story even begins. They start to constantly intersect the Wilcox's affairs both intimately and casually. The first chapter describes to us how the youngest sister (Helen) hastily becomes engaged to one of the youngest of the family. The engagement quickly turns to be a sham. Besides, with their alternating world-views, would it have worked out anyway? After this, the Wilcox family becomes a constant physical, emotional, and even spiritual presence in the sisters' lives, fueling the banter of ideas between the two clans. The Schlegal sisters (mainly the older one, Margaret) come under their influence and begin to question their own ideals, such as the belief that women should someday be allowed employment the same as men.    The banter between the two families serves as much of the entertainment of the novel, but because of the length of the book, it becomes exhausting. Luckily, Forster saves his reader from utter boredom with the final third of the novel. This concluding section tackles taboo (for the early 1900s) subjects such as pregnancy out-of-wedlock, and how societal reactions negatively impact the pregnant woman in question. Many pieces written circa the same period (the book was published in 1910) would be undoubtedly condemn this type of woman as a harlot who is not fit for Christian society.Forster remains hopeful on the subject, treating it with compassion and acceptance. He urges his society to do the same, which for the time was quite a bold statement.    Like all Forster novels, Howards End is tame when compared to what is being written today. However, if this novel is read for the time piece that it is, it should be an all-together inspiring experience. It is comforting to know that people such as Forster existed in a time of intolerance. His works were anything but groundbreaking.

0060899220|4.0|In Medium Raw, Bourdain's follow-up to Kitchen Confidential, the illustrious (Did I say \\"illustrious\\"? Perhaps \\"infamous\\" would be more poignant.), he makes known his surprise of watching his first memoir climb to the top of the New York Times Bestseller List. He describes the book as \\"something I'd written with no larger audience than New York-area line cooks, waiters, and bartenders in mind.\\"<br /><br />The book certainly reads this way, and it manages to create a glimpse of an arduous \\"rags-to-riches\\" (however minor those riches might be) story. The language is very specific to the culinary field; however, it is not difficult to figure out what certain terms mean based on their context. That being said, Bourdain tries his best to fill in uninformed readers, but fails to find appropriate times to do so, describing things like \\"mise-en-place\\" (the organizing and arrangement of meal ingredients) long after they've been referenced several times.<br /><br />Perhaps this is the only annoyance in the book, but it is one that extends beyond just terminology. The hectically busy, drug-soaked lives of the short order and high-end restaurants Bourdain came-to-age in are described in a frenetic manner, immersing the reader with just how unbelievably fast-paced the industry is. Since the same descriptions pervade the \\"Day in the Life\\" chapter, which describes a typical day of Bourdain's as executive chef at Les Halles (where Bourdain worked at time of writing), this section bored the hell out of me. Perhaps if this chapter were one of the opening ones, it would have been more effective.<br /><br />Also, anyone who has worked in the restaurant business will probably find themselves nodding off a few times, though not because the writing is lackluster--Bourdain's obnoxious attitude toward everything is comical, witty and wildly entertaining. The heart of the matter is that other people in the restaurant industry, from the busboy to the head chef, will most likely be fully awareof the idiosyncrasies of the industry. I've only spent one summer of my life preparing short-order meals and even I found myself wanting Bourdain to get on with his stories several times.<br /><br />Gripes aside, the book is fantastic, and the writing style and general observations on everything food related (and some things related to pop-culture and junky life) make this work what it is. Bourdain's reflections on what food means to him and why it is important to everyone's lives produce sparks of brilliance. Even the \\"fringe\\" dishes that many people would not seek out on a daily basis (or monthly or yearly or ever), take on an almost holy appearance in Bourdain's words.<br /><br />While about 75% memoir, the other 25% of Kitchen Confidential is dedicated to such subjects as how to create professional-looking dishes in your own kitchen and how to properly seek out restaurant food. Bourdain doesn't burden the reader with any recipes, but offers up easy ways to dress and garnish almost any type of food. After reading the chapter, I tried one of the ideas and it worked perfectly. For those who couldn't cook their way out of a paper bag, or those who believe boxed dinners to be a form of cooking, these methods won't provide them with any suggestions. That being said, if you can't cook at all, you're probably not even going to bother opening this book.<br /><br />The chapter describing how to seek out and properly order the right type of dish at the right type of restaurant is one of the best things this book has to offer. If you're looking for something to \\"shock\\" you, you're probably not going to receive gratification (unless maybe you only order well-done steaks), but you'll certainly benefit from Bourdain's spiel. The simple wisdom in this chapter includes several brilliantly observations that most people simply neglect to think about:<br />* Never eat at restaurants with dirty bathrooms. The restroom is the easiest room to clean in a restaurant, so if it's dirty,imagine what the kitchen looks like.<br />* Stay away from Sunday brunches, as it's mostly recycled food that's about to go bad.<br />* Never order fish on a Monday, as you're most likely eating food that's been sitting around for quite a while.<br />These are just a few things. Bourdain certainly doesn't try to lure his readers away from eating restaurant food, but encourages them to be more proactive in shopping for their needs. Knowing the best days of the week to eat out is certainly advantageous to most people.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to everyone except for people who do no cooking whatsoever outside of microwavable meals. Ironically, it is perhaps these folks who need the book's inspiration the most, but I don't forsee them receiving it by reading descriptions of culinary greatness. The orgasmic way Bourdain describes his first encounters with eating really good food is something that can only be attained by actually ingesting brilliant dishes for oneself. Everyone else though--stay-at-home cooks, professional chefs, short-order cooks, fast food employees, memoir lovers, travel channel watchers--should definitely pick this one up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire continues Suzanne Collins brilliant series - The Hunger Games. As with the first book I could not peel my eyes from the this book for two straight days. It is another quick read in the same vein as the first Hunger Games book.<br /><br />Keep in mind though - for younger audiences - this book is even more brutal than the first book. A particularly well-described whipping scene comes to mind.<br /><br />Collins tells a great story that you won't want to put down but don't expect it to shatter any literary boundaries either.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|If you have played Angry Birds or Angry Birds Seasons you know what to expect gameplay wise, nothing has changed here.  Graphically, the game looks flashier then its predecessors.  There are a few new additions/changes including a more comic book style way of telling the story and the introduction of bosses.  Golden Eggs do not make a showing and are replaced by Golden Fruits which do no offer additional levels.    Overall, it's much improved.  But that doesn't make it necessarily better, especially if you were wanting something more than a graphically improved Angry Birds.
B000ICLRIE|3.0|I have had the 4-disc Director's Cut edition of this excellent movie on DVD for some time now, and I was hoping to replace it with this Blu-Ray copy. Unfortunately, this release, while it does have the entire movie on a single Blu-Ray disc (which is definitely a plus), seems to be lacking all of the excellent special features that were on the 4-disc DVD release. This was a rather unpleasant surprise.    BUYER BEWARE: You will NOT be getting the special features listed in the product description, which appears to have been copypasted directly from the 4-disc DVD set.    That said, the movie itself is excellent (enough has already been said about its superiority to the theatrical version of this film) and it looks better than ever with this Blu-Ray transfer. It's worth upgrading to the Blu, just know that if you're a special features junkie, you're going to want to hang on to your DVD set.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I've been using Shazam since I first got an Android phone (April 2010) and it's always been my go to app when I need music identified.  For the most part it's incredibly accurate, but once you start trying to identify more obscure artists you'll start hitting a few dead ends.
0670022411|2.0|I hate to write a less-than-glowing review, as it is obvious there's a genuine and passionate audience for this book. Some people really enjoyed it, unfortunately I wasn't among them. I read the reviews, saw the handful of negatives and figured they were not likely going to be my opinion when there was such a glut of positive feedback. Sadly, I was mistaken. A lot of readers appear to be impressed by the historical references in this book, and perhaps drawn into the whole salem witch trials lineage/fantasy of a world just beyond human awareness where Witches, Vampires and Daemons live among us, hiding in plain site. I found that interesting as well... until the book changed directions on me.<br /><br />The first few chapters drew me into what appeared would be the storyline, a witch, with a powerful lineage, abandoning her family's history and choosing to make her own path through life without magic. Eventually, her efforts clash as her powerful lineage begins to emerge. It gets interesting... and then? The book goes on and on and on into a completely different direction full of mundane details about horseback riding, and sipping lots of wine (and describing how it smells) and the characters seem to be always dragging their hands through their hair. A detail that became a bit of an annoyance to me as I read along. Why? It just didn't seem to fit with the first few chapters, did nothing to enhance the plot, didn't do anything for the characters and seemed like pointless filler.<br /><br />There's a romance of sorts that tumbles out after the book's first few chapters, and the focus falls impossibly into details of this chaste relationship for many many chapters. Loose ends never get tied up, the most interesting parts of the book appear abandoned and mundane explanations of cuddling and kisses soon takes over. Occasionally, the book teased with the possibility of a return to the original plot, however, this was just a tease.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this story, but even the historical mentions did nothing to rescue the book for me. I found the characters very under developed, their motivations appeared to come from no where and the romance, for me, was arduous. I enjoy suspending disbelief, but this took too much effort for me to finish. If you're seeking a bit of a rated G romance novel with a dash of Witch, Vampire and Daemon thrown in for a fantastical twist, this book will likely be right up your alley. It is a very easy read and is likely a good fit for a variety of ages, from early teens and up. Just not a good fit for me.rical mentions did nothing to rescue the book for me.

B0007Y08PQ|5.0|I love this film.  It has a light-heartedness that makes is unique to the genre.  Anthony Zerbe and F. Murray Abraham are outstanding in their roles.  Picard's love story adds to the charm of the film.  Hard core Trekkers might object to items in the plot, but I believe that first time viewers will be drawn to the series and want to see more.  I am a long time fan of the Star Trek genre and will be as long as I am alive.  I like all of the movies for various reasons, but Insurrection and its picture of paradise will always be among my favorites.  As the old TV commercial says, \\"Try it, you'll like it!\\"
B004L49K20|5.0|Duran Duran's All You Need is Now is the type of album where if you're not a big fan of the group,and you're just looking for a great album to listen to......This is the one to purchase! I happen to like this band, but haven't purchased anything lately except their greatest hits. I purchased All You Need is Now, and haven't stopped playing this since I got it. For me, this is the best album of the year. and Duran Duran's best since Rio. Mark Ronson truly helped in bringing this band to new heights. This is one of those rare albums where every song on it is great.Pick up a copy and Enjoy!
B001PPLIEG|2.0|I had second thoughts about the title as soon as I typed it.  I thought, \\"Oh, no.  What about the original Casino Royale version with David Niven.\\"  But, then again, nobody considers that a REAL James Bond movie.<br /><br />We really regretted the $12.99 that we had to pay for a used copy.  The plot, the action, and the dialogue were completely impossible to follow.  From the very beginning, Bond movies have always been known for clarity of plot and brilliant and beautiful presentation of setting, action, and dialogue.  In this movie, the sets and scenes were uniformly dark, which made any of the action hard to follow.  A dark theater and a 40 foot screen might have helped a little.  In a lot of the fight scenes, Bond and his opponents were dressed identically.  \\"Which one is the bad guy?\\"  \\"I don't know.\\"  Many times we had to back up to clarify something -- and it didn't!  And all of the foreign dialogue...  Whose idea was it to put the subtitles in YELLOW on WHITE?<br /><br />I really miss Russia.  Most of the plot was centered around Bolivia.  It had the feel of a cheap knock-off of License To Kill -- where the bad guys were South American drug dealers -- hardly world class supervillians.  But, come on!  Stealing water?  That's on the level of Star Trek IV - Save The Whales.<br /><br />I realize than we are trying to 'reset' the Bond series.  But the opening credits and song were horrible rather than dramatic -- they never said James Bond.  In fact, the Bond Theme was not played until the closing credits -- was that to imply that ONLY NOW is he going to be the Bond that we knew?  There is a hint of that when he discovers that he likes the drink that will later become a 'vodka martini, shaken, not stirred.'<br /><br />Needless to say, WE were shaken, not stirred by this movie.
B004QYTRRS|4.0|I'm a fan of Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie so I definitely wanted to watch this. I wasn't disappointed, I really loved the storyline, characters, and music in the movie. I was not expecting the ending either so it was nice to be surprised. Only complaint was that I wasn't that fond of Depp's hair in this. Especially when he's got the white suit on, he reminds me of those caveman commercials where they had that hairdo and suits. Overall, great movie and worth watching
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the challenges of this game.  Three stars were obtainable in the first level without any helps, but they weren't easy. I really enjoy the amount of logic that one must use in this game. Keep up the great work!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|the graphics are spectacular,this is by far the best angry birds release yet. i recomend this app to anyone and everyone,trust me when i say you will definatly enjoy thos game
1847879071|5.0|I got turned onto this book through the author's website (which didn't look legit, but it awesome).  THe book is easy to read, easy to understand, and MUCH better for me as a visual learner than the textbook required for my stats class.

When I looked up the price on here, I found out I am now out $10 for getting the wrong product. But, on the other hand, my Sharkie (white version) is great. Exactly what everyone says-an indestructible military grade self defense marker. Buy one, but make sure you get what you ordered.
B0034G4OVS|1.0|How did anyone like this movie?  What a waste of my time.  The plot was so over the top.  And the wolves?  Please!  I have to admit I did get alittle laugh from the movie.  Thank goodness I saw it for free on Roku or else I would have wanted my money back.  It was easier to watch it by fast forwarding every few minutes or so to get to the dumb ending.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This transmitter works exactly as advertised. Up and running with an SD card in no time at all. Sound quality is very good with no static. This is a great item and small size lets it plug in just to the side of the gear shift on my car. Learned to run through the menu operations in about 30 minutes. Delivery was super fast. Very Happy With this purchase.
0060899220|2.0|Bourdain certainly knows his way with food, there is no question there.  Additionally, he is very funny at times.  However, as a human being he is not only filthy and foul, he takes great pride in it!  With complete disregard for law, humanity, decency and anything but his own gratification he drags the reader through his world of crime, drugs, sex, more drugs, more crime, etc.  Honestly, the person Bourdain reminds me of the most is Richard Kuklinksi, aka. The Ice Man (a Mafia serial killer).  Strangely, I think Bourdain would approve of that comparison.  Creepy.
B003O5MO2A|5.0|The church on the cover is Saint Pauls Episcopal Chapel in Vista, NY. I know because I grew up about a mile hike through the woods behind it. Also went to church there.     This album is the best BOC. Period. Having seen them live since Soft White Underbelly in NYC.    If you want to know what it was like in the day, this is it. Forget the 'fear the reaper' crap - this is the original manifestation of the incredible rock and roll band Blue Oyster Cult.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|I use a headset instead of speakers on my pc, so I am probably more picky than your average gamer due to the large number of hours I spend wearing a headset.    The good: This headset is very comfortable, looks nice, seems reasonably sturdy, and has a very long cord. The mic sounds clean and clear.    The bad: The inline amp has a constant hiss that cannot be completely eliminated. The amp pulls power through the USB connection so I tried using just the mini-stereo connector without USB but apparently that is not an option. You need the amp to hear the audio, so you are stuck with the hiss. Muting the mic, turning off the \\"expand\\" switch did not help either. I also tried hooking the USB connection up to a usb hub, no improvement.    I find it slightly ironic that my cheap logitech headset had better audio than this headset which cost twice as much.
B000002J09|5.0|Alot of Zeppelin fans didn't purchase this album when it was released because they didn't know it was a Zeppelin album. Due to micommunication between Jimmy Page and Atlantic, no mention was made on the cover that this was a Led Zeppelin album. The story goes that Atlantic didn't want to spend any money to correct the mistake and the album was shipped out anyway. Those that did purchase the album based on the cover, were disappointed to find that there was nothing on the album resembling Led Zep III's standout tracks such as Hats Off to (Roy) Harper and Tangerine. Instead, first time listeners were confused by the odd time signature of (13/8)? of the opening track (Black Dog) with no lyrics explaining the title of the song (Black Dog). Regardless, over time this album has found a small cult following among those that have stumbled across it through word of mouth and mark down bins. If you loved Coda, you should give this one a chance.
B000001DTM|5.0|I always think I don't like this album because, musically, it's just a hair too far that side of pop, but then I always find myself reaching for it first when I want to listen to U2.  It really does have an exceptional percentage of really good songs.  So, I guess I'm lying to myself and I should just admit it's one of my favorites.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|very fun!!! and just as addicting as the other two angry birds! i played until i beat the whole 2 unlocked levels. Cant wait until the new months unlock!
B002ZG99TA|1.0|I'm a big Denzel Washington fan, but this movie is dull and void of any real acting. You can see the predictability and lack of real emotion on Denzel's face as he goes through the motions of pretending to be in a life and death situation not only for himself, but for unsuspecting people at the end of the big bend in the railroad. Denzel would have been better off staying away from this movie and Book and Eli, as I would have and you will if you do.
0312600844|4.0|This is a complicated novel that weaves in a number of stories. If you are patient you will be completely pulled in and find it hard to put down.  I think there was one section in the beginning where I thought I was losing interest but as I went further those pieces fit in beautifully.  Very engrossing.
B000Z7S5FU|5.0|This duo is just meant to be. They are so authentic and the music they created is like drown from their heart. So there is no doubt that they are so moving and heart touching.

B000ICLRIE|5.0|There are enough reviews about the movie so I am going to point out the only thing that really matters to me... \\"Is this a true Blu-ray movie?\\" YES it is!!! I have yet to see 300 on Blu-ray but out of all the movie I have seen this is by far the best looking movie. When it would show any of the scenery I would pause the movie, my friend and I would just stare at the tv because the graphics are just mind blowing, the picture is sharp and the color is beautiful. This is true blu-ray and the picture is amazing.
B004NSVE3W|4.0|What a guy, that John Green. He knows young people, how they tick, how they whine, the pace of their lives, their desire for control and their hope for chaos. And not only does he know all of this, but he knows how to make it a funny, touching story. Ultimately, the plot of 'An Abundance of Katherines' is as skinny as its protagonist, lately a prodigy named Colin, who's really just a kid lookin' for love after a lifetime of rejection. But that's ok, that skinny plot, because it fattens up nicely with the help of goofy characters, obnoxious situations and a lot of math. Bravo to Le Green!
0143038419|1.0|In case you don't know it, the universe revolves around a woman called Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of this breathtakingly narcissistic book.<br /><br />I picked it up under the impression from the film trailer that it was a Gossip Girl-type romp of a novel that would be a bit of fun and while away an hour or so.<br /><br />In fact, it is mind-numbing monologue  - involving a petition to God which begins \\"Dear God\\" and characters called Mr. Loneliness and Mr. Depression - in which the author tries to explain how she put her life together after a divorce.<br /><br />Apparently she is the only person in the world whose marriage has broken down and feels she has a duty to explain every detail to the rest of us.<br /><br />Gilbert comes over as the kind of flaky American in her 30s we are used to from sitcoms like Seinfeld and Friends, well-meaning but definitely someone to keep clear of.<br /><br />However, there is nothing funny about this book despite her feeble attempts at humor.<br /><br />Her explanation for her decision to spend a year in Italy (eating), India (praying) and Indonesia (loving) was simply baffling and came over as more of an exercise in self-pity than any search for spiritual solace.<br /><br />I managed to follow her through the Italian part before giving up.  If she could trot out clich&eacute;s about one country - spaghetti, pizza, sexy Italian men, 40-year-old Italian women covered in mascara, the Pope, Mafia etc.  - then she could certainly do so about another two and I decided not to go along for the rest of the ride.<br /><br />Not only is the book boring but it is badly written. At times it reads like an unedited transcript of a tape with casual comments in parenthesis (\\"Oh man -it's even worse than that.\\"), idiotic asides such as trying to link Rome to yoga by mentioning a \\"toga\\", a cringeful  comment on a painting to show she is not a culture snob referring to the \\"goofiest, giggliest Jesus\\" and a rambling self-justification on why she does not have children.<br /><br />According to the blurb, \\"Time\\" magazine named her as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. Thank God, this is a meaningless accolade because if it were true then we would be living in a shallow world indeed.named her as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008.

B002KKBVAQ|5.0|As you can tell from one of my other reviews, I think that Geomags are some of the best toys in the world.    They are fun, encourage creativity, and build small motor skills. In addition, you have to pay attention to how magnetic forces work, or your whole structure collapses in a pile. Of course, then you get to start over a little smarter, so it all works out.     Nope, this is not for kids who stick random things in their mouths. However, any kid of any age (starting at about 5 and up to well over 63...) can enjoy these, whether they are undertaking major projects or just goofing around.     This particular kit is useful because it has a relatively large number of plastic squares, which add stability to structures. All the parts can be combined with other Geomag collections to make greater and grander assemblages.
0393338827|5.0|The Big Short is a very important book. It will become a classic in its genre; it will still be read 100-years hence.     When I ask college students to explain what caused the greatest financial crisis in history, typically they betray a superficial understanding, \\"Too many mortgage loans were made to subprime borrowers.\\" End of story. They are clueless as to what really happened. The Big Short should be mandatory reading for all college students. It is written for the general public, and should be read by all who wish to understand the culture that nearly destroyed this country.
1401309666|5.0|The concept of the \\"Long Tail\\" is summarized by Anderson as follows: \\"Our culture and economy are increasingly shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of hits (mainstream products and markets) at the head of the demand curve, and moving toward a huge number of niches in the tail.\\"  Anderson demonstrates how technologies today are making it cost efficient for organizations to offer an almost endless variety of products, on behalf of a different niches and consumer wants.  I found this book to be a very interesting easy read; this book gives a very clear explanation of how technology is changing the business world.  I do not necessarily think this book is for business people only, I suggest anyone in this day and age read this book because it is filled with plenty of examples that can help the consumer as well as the organization.      Anderson uses different companies like Amazon, Google, and Netflix to show how selling less of more can actually be a successful strategy.  Rather than selling one product to as many consumers as you possibly can, focusing on selling a lot of different more undesirable products to a few people is proven to be more profitable.  Anderson discusses historical models which appeals to the masses then explains new types of markets and the different practices we see today that appeal to all.  In the past only the head of the demand curve was focused on but what Anderson talks about is further down the curve which the demand may decrease but never hits zero; this concept is better known as the long tail.  Anderson provides plenty of examples and statistics that support the idea that the 21st century is more focused on niches and the internet has made it possible for consumers to obtain anything no matter how weird the product is.  Anderson focuses heavily on the entertainment industry; one of the examples used to show how the music industry has changed is there is no more top hit singles rather a different hit single for each genre of music.  Anderson also discusses how the sales of book stores and record stores have strongly decreased due the convenience of different websites like Amazon and I-Tunes which offer a greater variety to consumers.  Anderson explains how the internet is becoming the main source of shopping for consumers and if you are not a long tail business you will simply not be able to compete and will not survive.  Anderson providers readers with two tips on creating a long tail business;\\"Make everything available and Help me find it.\\"    Anderson provides statistical data and examples to demonstrate how the internet and consumer demands are changing the business world and how selling less is more.  I would suggest this book to everyone because the internet is changing how we do business in every industry and is also changing everyday life.

I am debating gluing the support pieces in so that it can be a bit sturdier. I also plan on contacting Mattel tonight to see what they say about it. Besides the set not staying together, the booster (the grey part that makes the cars zip around) has ceased to work tonight. I've tried 3 sets of batteries and can't get it to power the cars more than 2-3 inches...and I tried all different weight cars.<br /><br />When this set is working, it's great. I hope that the problems being had are only by my set...

I´m getting used to it´s size now.    It looks really cool, it´s shinny and attracts attention.     Este reloj se ve grandioso y la caja de Swatch es ideal para ponerlo en exhibición. Tomen en cuenta que en vivo el reloj es más pequeño de lo que parece en las fotos. Si midiera 5mm más de diámetro sería el reloj perfecto!!
0670022411|5.0|Awesome new book! Loved it.  Actually, with this book I did something I don't remember ever doing before...when I finished it the first time, I began re-reading it from the first and read straight through again...and enjoyed it even more the second time around!  Can't wait for the second book in this new trilogy.  I'm very excited that this author has crossed over into the fantasy fiction gendre.  If you enjoyed the Twilight series and/or the Outlander series...you'll love this book!!

B00005NEUF|4.0|Around a year ago I read somewhere that one or two music magazines or some such had nominated The Strokes' \\"Is this it\\" as their album of the decade. \\"NME\\" was just one such magazine (it's a British publication). Wikipedia lists more such accolades for this album. Anyway, probably some years after this album was released, and just a few years ago I finally got around to buying this album...it must have cost me around $10 (one of those 'bargains' the chains promote sometimes), and since I loved the song \\"Last nite\\", I thought it was a punt worth taking. At the time, 2 or 3 years ago (or whatever), I have to say that I found the album a big disappointment. If I had reviewed the album then, I might have scored it 2/5...like a lot of albums, one killer song does not a great album make. Basically I thought that the entire album, apart from \\"Last nite\\" was \\"meh\\", as Lisa Simpson might say. So, for my final review on Amazon, I thought it might be 'cute' to revisit this album and fully expect to post comments like \\"If this is the album of the decade, it must have been a really quiet decade for decent music\\". I'm guessing my initial poor response to the album was that I genuinely like great radio songs...\\"Last nite\\" is my idea of such a song. Nothing else came close, though I do seem to recall a video for another single off this album and finding the music sort of okay...relistening to this album this week, I can't say that that lesser song stands out. Anyway, having recently listened to a lot of prog rock music, I have to say that the rest of the album is no longer \\"meh\\" to me. Now, I can actually point to other songs on the album and say that this song has some nice lead guitar on it, or the vocal melodies are catchy. Like Nirvana before them, The Strokes have some childishly simple guitar melodies and vocal melodies which are simply catchy. And that ain't bad. Like Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", which I also found extremely \\"meh\\" when I listened to it, revisiting this albumhas improved my perception of it...but nowhere near to the same degree as \\"Nevermind\\". I can't really see how this album revitalised rock music, but it is nonetheless a solid listen of pleasant and amiable enough songs. I'll put this somewhere in my list of the greatest albums of all time, but it's not in the same league as The Classics, despite gaining the tag from NME as \\"The album of the decade\\". It's on a par with The Vines' \\"Highly evolved\\".       As for the music, it's mid-tempo, with nice complementarity between the melodic vocals and the lead guitar. Australian band The Vines got bagged for wearing their influences of their sleeve, but towards the latter end of this Strokes' cd, you can make out some of their own influences. Again, what bumped this album up for me from around 2/5 to around 4/5 was just noticing how catchy and melodic the guitar and vocal parts were. Sometimes re-exploring an album can change your opinion of an album. On my first relisten of this album I gave it 77.5/100, but I liked it slightly more second time around...82.5/100...possibly 85/100 material. Album released 2001 and has a running time of 36:27. Odd fact...Wikipedia states that this album was first released in Australia...not sure why that would be so.      The classic:      Last nite - \\"/\\". Easily the best track on the album...a classic in fact, and a song which you really could view as 'revitalising rock', if you felt the urge to. Has a cool bass line and I like the complementary guitar tinkering. Also like the poppy part of the chorus.       The best songs on second listen:      Is this it - \\">[.]\\". Album opener. Intro of electro bubbling brook noises. Has a cool, slow drum/cymbal beat. Sort of pretty guitar note 'riff'. Dual guitars. Bass guitar meanders but not in a bad kind of way...the bass is actually not bad at times. Vocals sound a bit distant and the mood is one of world weariness. Guitar parts are pretty and the vocal melody is catchy at times.    The modern age - \\">[.]\\". This song seems to threaten breaking out into a killer rock rage, but never goes that way. Quicker drum beat. One guitar has note progression (seems biased to the left hand side speaker) whilst the right hand side guitar hums away. Vocal style is in the Lou Reed mould, I think. Lead guitar solo has a bit of static to it...unintentional, I'd say. Not bad as far as the guitar and vocal melody goes.    Hard to explain - \\"[.]\\". Electro pop intro with an electric sprinkler type percussion...a synthesiser, perhaps (speaking of sprinkler sounds...last year I bought the soundtrack to the slasher movie \\"Halloween\\", by its creator, John Carpenter...I never really noticed that sprinkler sound when I saw the movie...slightly annoying on cd!). The lead guitar sound and style reminded me of the Pixies' Joey Santiago. Vocals are nice and melodic, as for the lyric \\"Based in Carolina\\"...hmm...maybe this was the song whose video I saw and didn't mind the music of? There is what sounds like unintentional static on the left hand side speaker throughout the entire song. I like the different vibes that this song has on it.       The rest (in album order):      Soma - Melodic vocal and sort of oriental style lead guitar (perhaps). Has dual lead guitar. Not bad...catchy guitar at times.    Barely legal - Mid-tempo, melodic track. The vocal sounds filtered...with a coarse/shredded quality to it...intentional, in other words.  Lyrics are repetitive and seem to be sung from the perspective of a member of 'The slacker generation'. The \\"f\\" word is used in this song. Track has a little static to it (unintentional).    Someday - Interesting beat...the word \\"skiffle\\" comes to mind...probably for no good reason...I'm not even sure I know any skiffle songs! Melodic vocals and guitar. Noticeable bass guitar.    Alone, together - 1960s style drum intro (maybe I have something like \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" in mind). then you get a 1980s style guitar sound/lick...I can't really put my finger on what it reminds me of, but I probably have in mind English or Australian songs of the era...of the more 'hip' variety, perhaps, as far as that guitar vibe goes. It sounds sort of familiar, in any case. The guitar breaks sort of sound like something of the 1950s era, as filtered through 1970s rock acts.     New York City cops - Wikipedia mentions that both the album cover used in the Australian release was changed for the US release, as well as this song being dropped from the US release in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 11/09/2001.  The US release replaced this song with \\"When it started\\". ANYWAY, intro beat to \\"New York City cops\\" has an \\"Iron man\\" vibe to it. Some drum parts bring to mind Led Zeppelin's drummer John Bonham. A riffing track...sounds sort of familiar.  Other guitar parts sort of sound like a ukelele or something. One guitar part has a sort of children's melody feel to it.     Trying your luck - Bass guitar has a nice throaty growl/rumble to it. Guitar on the right hand side plays the higher notes...more jangly. Vocals are melodic.     Take it or leave it - Vocals are quite rock at times. Right hand side guitar is melodic. Noticeable bass. Outro is quite Ramonesy, or at least 1970s style glam rock...the last 1:12 minutes of the song and the last few seconds too, bring to mind these influences, as far as the riff and the beat goes.       Recommendations:      Just by the by, the other day I was in a chain store, and they played something which piqued my interest...I asked a staff member what the band was and they said it was The Strokes...it was something off of their new album, which is out now at the time of writing.  It was catchy and could be worth checking out.    Nirvana - Nevermind. 5/5. Like \\"Is this it\\",  a re-evaluation of this album by me has seen its stocks skyrocket. More of a rock album than \\"Is this it\\" though.    The Saints - Eternally yours. 5/5. A mixture of punk and post-punk kind of songs. \\"Know your product\\" is one of the all timegreat songs...it's in Kurt Cobain's top 50 records of all time. I like \\"Untitled\\" too, and \\"Orstralia\\". Has some garage band type songs too.     Stiff Little Fingers - Inflammable material. 5/5. Debut punk album. Along with Eternally Yours, it's the only 5/5 album for me in the genre.     The Vines - Highly evolved. 4/5. Released around the same time as \\"Is this it\\" and this band was proclaimed by the British press, especially, I think, as a \\"saviour of rock\\"...along with The Strokes. Like \\"Is this it\\", it has a killer song...\\"Get free\\". Up until I relistened to \\"Is this it\\", I held The Vines' follow up album, \\"Winning days\\" in the same esteem as \\"Is this it\\"...i.e. one killer song \\"Ride\\" and the rest of the album was just \\"meh\\".     The New York Dolls - The New York Dolls. 77.5/100. The latter half of the album is really good...faves include \\"Frankenstein\\", \\"Trash\\" and \\"Private world\\".     AC/DC - Let there be rock.  75/100. Probably the ultimate Australian pub rock kind of album...raw rock.     The Boys Next Door - Door, door. 75/100. Nick Cave's first band. Some odd yet catchy songs on their debut. Weird vibe. \\"Dive position\\" is a good example of that.     The Clash - The Clash. 75/100. I'd probably go for the US release by a small margin as I particularly like \\"Clash city rockers\\" which is not on the original UK release. Other good tracks include \\"Career opportunities\\", \\"London's burning\\" and \\"Police & thieves\\".
B0019N8P2W|5.0|i love daria as a middle schooler. the dvds are great!    they even include the two daria movies in it.      couldnt be happier :)
B004F77SHC|1.0|worst movies ever I have the first 2 on dvd and watched a copy of this one because everyone said how great these movies are and that eclispe was the best one yet well I have come to realize that these people telling me these movies are great must be high and on drugs. Worst acting I have ever seen and the vampire story is just plain stupid first of all they sparkle what is with that I just don't get it I love vampire movies and shows but this one didn't do it for me if you wanna watch a good vampire story tune in to THE VAMPIRE DIARIES on the CW way better acting way better story line also the guys are way hotter the Jacob or Edward first of all I know vampires are dead but does Edward really have to be that pale it makes him very ugly in my eyes I guess if i was 13 I might like these movies but I'm not and I don't Thank you and Have a Nice Day :(

0756404738|5.0|The only disappointing thing about this book is that now I have to wait for the third one with even more anticipation. These are the best books I have read in a while.
B00005OB0E|4.0|The Very Best of Diana Ross Love and Life is an excellent over-view of Diana's career - with The Supremes, and as a solo artist. Disk One starts off with \\"Chain Reaction,\\" then goes into some of The Supremes greatest hits.  Actually, \\"Chain\\" sounds like an H-D-H production, though it is written by The Bee-Gees.  After \\"Stop!\\" and \\"Reflections,\\" among other Supreme greats, the disk focuses on Diana's best songs.  \\"The Boss,\\" \\"Force Behind the Power,\\" and \\"Muscles\\" are some of the diverse selections on Disk One.  Disk Two starts off with \\"You are Everthing\\" with Marvin Gaye, then features some early, and then later Diana hits like: \\"Touch Me,\\" \\"I'm Still Waiting,\\" and \\"Your Love,\\" and \\"When You Tell Me That You Love Me.\\"  \\"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\\" with the Tempations, and \\"Someday We'll Be Together\\" are two Supreme tracks on Disk Two.  All-in-all, this is a beautiful package - songs and booklet are great (nice photos of Diana). A nice addition to any Diana-fan's collection!
1439102813|5.0|I didn't thinkI would like this selection from our book club.  This beautifully written, moving and insightful novel will rank as \\"the best of 2011.
0156027321|1.0|Wow. It's hard to believe that I was even a little bit excited by this stinking pile of garbage before I started reading it. It's very difficult to fathom that such a pedigreed, intelligent man as Yann Martel could churn out this kind of trash.    First off, Martel obviously is taking a contrarian stance just to grab our attention; he praises the zoo in the manner of many \\"You hear this is like this but it actually isn't\\" articles that appear in our magazines and newspapers. This is a tactic calculated to gain the audiences favor, as is the setting of the early part of the story, an exotic locale favored by housewife fans of \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\" the entire beginning of the book is designed to be a bestseller. You can practically feel it in his deliberate endorsement of modern yuppie values.    The second part of the book fails in a huge manner due to its slow pacing and absolute inability to move any thematic material forward in a meaningful way. Most of it is believable; a tigert is in the boat with him, he breaks his vegetarian vows, etc.but when he gets to the man-eating island with meerkats it is impossible for the reader to take it seriously. I know I didn't.     Finally, in the final section, Martel attempts a M. Night Shyamalan-like twist that ends up feeling stale and calculated. You can see it coming for the whole book. In the end, Martel is attempting to make his book into a cross between The Old Man And The Sea and The Matrix, both of which are horrible sources to draw from. And Martel's religious fundamentalism is nauseating; he attempts to lump atheists in with religious folk and declares agnostics to be false in their quest for truth. Ultimately I think we can all conclude that Life of Pi is the worst example of a book rigged to be a hit in Oprah's Book Club and that Yann Martel is an elitist bigot who should not be allowed to write books.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game is great.  It comes close to the original. I wish it had more levels.  It looks like we have to wait for a month for more levels. Then more in the upcoming months.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love it! Better than regular angry birds. It gives a new twist to an old fun game. Everyonw who plays angry birds should get it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The graphics are greatly improved.  There are many new levels to play.  One of the best games on Android. Simple but fun and addictive. I recommend this game to everybody.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|Clash of The Titans follows in the footsteps of the original movie. This movie does have excellent special effects. The gargoyles, giant crabs, sand wizards, Pegasus, Medusa, and mystical Gods are astounding to look at. The action adventure scenes are very reminiscent of those in The Mummy and Gladiator. The acting is good throughout the movie. The costumes are amazing. There really isn't a downfall to this movie: there are enough action adventure sequences, high drama, sub-plots, and sorcery to keep anyone entertained and intrigued. Those who enjoyed Legend, Stardust, and Harry Potter will really enjoy Clash of the Titans.
0743298039|5.0|One of the best books in the century. I finished the book a while back but decided to buy it as part of my. library collection
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these. My last paid like this wore out, I am hard on the, exercise etc., and I could not find any the last year or so. I have been using the ear bud type, which I hate. They do not fit in my ears right, and pop out all the time. These don't they fit just right. These sounds great, I am mostly listening to text and studies with the. I am completely satisfied and would recommend them. I bought 1 I should of bought 4-5. I think I will get some extras.
B000J4OYRW|4.0|If I wrote a lengthy review of this documentary, I'd only be repeating existing praise in different terms. So: If you're a fan, it's going to hook you, and you're going to smile throughout.<br /><br />Most memorable to me:<br />The hilarious \\"I'm With Stupid\\" video (extra).<br /><br />The bit about the film \\"It couldn't happen here. Precious little footage, but enough to acknowledge its significance/existence.<br /><br />The clip from the Performance tour of \\"Your Funny Uncle\\".<br /><br />Watching day fade to sunset, and then night, as Neil's interview progresses in front of a large window showcasing the London skyline: unintentionally artistic.<br /><br />Their first TV appearance (in Belgium) performing an early (Bobby O?) version of \\"West End Girls\\"... a 30-year-old Neil bopping about most uncharacteristically, and Chris smiling at the end. Priceless.
B004L49K20|5.0|What a great album from Duran Duran, you enjoy each and every sound on it!!! all the tracks are amazing!!!<br /><br />It doesn't get any better than this, this album is all you need NOW!
B0040JHLM2|4.0|This shoe is great for runners that over pronate slightly and roll inward slightly as well.      Laces up tight to fully support my foot without constricting the blood flow.     I tried on two other shoes (Pumas and Asics) prior to buying the Brooks and they just felt better. They 'roll' from heel to toe fluently and give a good return. After a solid run, my feet and my joints don't hurt. They just FEEL GOOD.    Again, I highly recommend this to distance runners that over pronate slightly.
0061733199|5.0|we bought this book for our boys.  they absolutely love it and take it outside with them putting into action some of the stuff they are reading about.  very cool!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Zombie novels are entertaining and if well written can be a kind of historical novel when one suspends belief.  There are many out there, but WWZ is not, in my opinion, one of them.   It is disjointed and incohesive and too long.  There are many interesting passages but none successfully relates to any other.  There is no character development, not even in the narrator.  It is difficult to empathize with any character.  If this were a novel about an actual historical war, it would be interesting to read of the happenings individualized around the world.   But the repetitious nature of WWZ is not as interesting.
B00004YX39|5.0|\\"Tonight when I chase the dragon, the water will change to cherry wine and the silver will turn to gold, time out of mind.\\"    Amazing. Simply a great piece of music from start to end. I can't separate this and \\"Aja\\" as both are wonderful. The crafting of this music is simply majestic. Listen to the bluesy cord structures in \\"Peg\\" and see how they have been toned right down right across this album as it captures the mood of the time.    You have to own this record and fall in love with it.
B004NELBPC|5.0|overall this is a decent app, it seems that they're able to get reports up before a lot of other bigger news sources.  they also do a good job of rolling out updates as the story develops.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This is a great movie - seen it many times but never saw the Director's Cut. This made it even more enjoyable
B004529NLG|5.0|Is very rare that my wife watch a movie with me, it does not matter the genre, is that she never has time, but this movie, she already has seen it 3 times, is that good!.  The 3D effects, the dance, and the music (must have Surround System to feel the bass) are awesome!  If you have a 3D TV, get this movie, it is a show off material.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|At least as good as Angry Birds Seasons. Tottally worth it for free. Its worth a dollar as much as Angry Birds Seasons was. Get it while its free.
0440241901|4.0|Can You Keep a Secret? completely captivated me. I sat down to read a few pages before bed and didn't put it down until I finished it hours later. I expected humor, and got lots of it, but I didn't expect to care about Emma as much as I did.<br /><br />Emma's your average girl. She's always willing to tell a little while lie or a lie of omission in order to spare someone's feelings or avoid her own embarrassment. When she believes her plane is going to crash, she tells the man next to her every secret she's ever kept. She goes back to her life, thinking nothing of it until she learns her plane buddy is the CEO of the company she works for. And Jack seems to delight in hinting about those secrets at every opportunity.<br /><br />Can You Keep a Secret? seemed so predictable until a huge twist made me question everything in the book so far. It was a wonderfully shocking surprise. The relationships between the characters were what made Can You Keep a Secret? so delightful to read. Emma and her boyfriend Connor. Emma and Jack. Emma and her roommates. Emma's parents and cousin. Emma's coworkers. Each character brought something special to the book, some insecurity or secret of their own, that really made them more than just side character's orbiting Emma.<br /><br />You love and hate Jack right along with Emma, but she seemed to fall too hard, too quick. She needed to fall for him so the twist would invoke strong emotions, but it was too Wham-Bam-I-Love-That-Man for my taste. Sex causing immediate love is a huge pet peeve of mine, so I would have rather it all worked out some other way. Of course, this immediate love goes to show Emma's issues, quite obviously as her roommate points out that she can't love him having only known him a short while.<br /><br />I will definitely be checking out more books by Sophie Kinsella after having be so thoroughly sucked into this one. Can You Keep a Secret? is a light, fun book that'll lead to both laughter, tears and questioning your own deeply hidden secrets.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|You've heard the hype now try it... Fun game that helps to pass the time when you are bored... nothing more to say... SERIOUSLY AMAZON? 25 WORD MINIMUM!
B0046IGOIO|3.0|Be careful with this CD, you have to like the Doors a lot to enjoy it.  Morrison's microphone is set way too high, leading to distortion as he puts his heart and soul into every lyric.  It is very off-putting as you usually expect the vocals to be spot on, this is almost to the point of disturbing.  I call this period in the Door's development \\"The Jim Morrison Beard Era\\" and almost all of the music they put out was skewed and not in a good way.  All in all I think their other live music is far superior to this one, but hey, the remaining members do have to make a living, too.  Side Note: Rock Me is pretty solid.  Sure wish they'd have let Albert sing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Smooth gameplay. A few minutes of fun. worth the download. If you like Angry Birds, you will like this. It is colorful and works on most platforms.
0061134007|5.0|I am a big mystery fan for a number of reasons and have found that many writers from the UK just seem to know how to write a great mystery book, more so than the writers from the US. I am aware of a number of good Scandinavian writers on the scene today but until I picked up a copy of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo\\" had never read one. I am sorry to say that I could not even finish that book so my introduction to this group of writers was a disappointment!<br /><br />However, a friend recommended The Redbreast to me recently and I thought I would give it try..WOW! Without going into detail as others have done, suffice it to say this novel has what I look forward to in a good mystery: a strong character that you can empathize with, a complex plot with many loose ends that all come together in the end and a nice atmospheric sense of place. Also, I usually do not enjoy a book that bounces back and forth between two points in time but found it an integral part of the plot in this instance.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to reading all the books in this series and plan on reading a number of the other Scandinavian writers as well. Who knows, I may even go back and give Stieg Larson another try!
0684823454|5.0|Like \\"A Customer,\\" I interrupted my reading of another biography (Jenkins) to read this. The author mentioned that \\"My Early Life\\" was one of Churchill's best books, along with \\"Great Contemporaries.\\" As a fan of Churchill's writing, I took the bait. \\"Contemporaries\\" was good, but \\"Early Life\\" was astounding. No one who has read Churchill will be surprised to hear that the book is laugh-out-loud funny in places. What a life, what experiences, and all before the age of 30. Whatever happened to him, anyway? I heard he went into politics, which would have been a shame except for the bit about saving civilization.
0316017922|3.0|A letter to the author:    Dear Malcolm Gladwell,   My Senior English class just read Outliers, and it has been very informative by taking a different viewpoint on how people become successful. Every English course in our school has an essential question, and this year it is: To what extent to time and place define a person? It has been very clear throughout your book that time and place define a person in many ways, especially contributing to a person's success. It showed that the opportunities people are given depend greatly on the time period and culture they were brought up in. That shows that in determining success a lot of it is due to luck, and the phrase \\"the right place at the right time,\\" holds true. One of the most interesting chapters for me is \\"The Matthew Effect\\" because it brings to surface a contributor to success that no one would ever think about. That is a perfect example how luck can benefit you because being born at a certain time of year helped the hockey players become successful. \\"The 10,000 Hour Rule\\" was also very interesting because I never knew the exact amount of time needed to be a master of a certain craft has ever been calculated. It showed many good examples but I feel the chapter focused too much on the work they put in without going into enough detail about the passion that is needed to spend that much time on one thing. As a reader, it almost made it seem like I could be the best at anything I wanted and all I would have to do is put in 10,000 hours. That is an incredible amount of time however, and I feel like that was perhaps not highlighted enough. In, \\"The Trouble With Geniuses: Part I\\" it was encouraging to see that incredibly high IQ does not always lead to success. It made me feel better knowing that you do not have to be the smartest person, as long as you are smart enough and have other creative and social skills. I think a lot of people give up if they feel they are not smart enough to succeed without realizing there aremany other factors that contribute to such. Overall, the knowledge I acquired from reading this book has definitely benefited me as I embark on my quest for success. I am a very motivated and driven person and know exactly what I want, and now I have a better idea of how to get there. I learned that especially in the music industry, which I hope to work in, social connections are everything.   -Carolyn McHugh
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|Great app for organizing and keeping track of things as they happen, however the terms clearly states they can use,  modify and distribute anything you upload for purposes of the site and sell to partners. Again, GREAT app... not worth it to me.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|This movie reminded of a flat soda, or beer.  In fact I needed a beer after watching it.   The best thing about this movie was Mila Kunis, whom is absolutely gorgeous and vivacious.  If you want to see a good movie about a crazy person, watch A Beautiful Mind, which is a million times better than this travesty.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm an angry bird addict and the graphics have greatly improved in this new addition. HTC evo works great. I do however find it annoying that my review must be 25 words.
B0041VIJQG|2.0|After reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews on this album I was anxious to hear it.    After hearing it I guess I don't get it.    I mean it's OK but the sound is sort of muted or muddied and the songs are sort of the same way.    It has some of the sound of Buddy Millers albums in there. Some of the sound of Robert Plants solo albums.     However seriously nearly any album by Buddy Miller or any album by Patti Griffin is WAY better than this album.    I thought maybe I was being too critical so I gave it to my wife to drive to work and listen to and she came back and said she felt the same.
0765326353|4.0|Things I love about this book:  -The world is rich and complex with an interesting weather system and unique animals & plant life.  -Many civilizations with detailed sets of rules.  -World is vast and open. Not stuck in one area for the entire novel.  -Novel is very long. You get your money's worth and a story that will last for many days of reading.  -Writing is clear and doesn't get in the way of the story. When you read, it's easy to forget that you are reading.  -Lots of interesting characters and mysteries.  -Magic system is unique and vast.  -History of the world and its deities is detailed.    Things I think need improving:  -Too many storyline splits near the beginning + chapter long flashbacks for one of the characters. I didn't enjoy part 2 as several seemingly unrelated character storylines were introduced one after the other. I wish the book had started with one thread that naturally split into the others.  -Main character's personalities are a little too serious. A lot of reviewers love Kaladin. I distinctly loved the contrast between he, Rock, and Syl. The three characters complimented each other quite nicely. A lot of fun could be had with the Jasnah and Shallan's relationship if Jasnah was more colorful, I think.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|\\"Penelope\\" really is a sweet, romantic movie with a bit of a twist. I'm fifty-two, and I enjoy it as much as my 25, 23, 22 and 14 year-old daughters. The casting is perfect, the story flows at a good pace, and, while it's a bit predictable, it's just quirky and fantastical enough to keep you intrigued. James McAvoy is the lovable bad boy, Christini Ricci is sweet and lovely (not her usual role), Catherine O'Hara is the caring, involved mom you love to dislike strongly. Supporting actors Simon Woods (Pride & Prejudice), Peter Dinklage (Elf) and Reese Witherspoon round out a great cast.
0307454541|3.0|I normally only review books I love (just don't want to put out negative, mean energy!), but the author passed away, so I'm going to review this in spite of my less-than-enthusiastic feelings toward it.<br /><br />The quality of the writing in this book is sometimes dreadful.  The sentence structure is frequently odd and phrases are sometimes repeated twice in the same paragraph.  It's sloppy, lazy writing.  I had the distinct feeling that Larsson wrote this while watching TV--his attention is only half there.<br /><br />The plot, however, is very compelling.  Even with the bad writing, I couldn't stop reading this book. I was intrigued, scared and curious.  There was no way I was going to stop until the entire thing had unravelled in the end.<br /><br />If you love a good thrill, pick up this book--you'll love it!<br /><br />If you love to read good writing and carefully crafted sentences, SKIP this book!
B004IFYMWK|5.0|There are certain indisputable facts relative to the case.  No Weapons of Mass Destruction were ever found in Iraq, despite the certainty with which Bush, Cheney et al. claimed.  There is no evidence that Saddam was trying to buy fissionable material in Niger or elsewhere, despite what Bush said.  More than 4,000 American soldiers, and  more than 100,000 Iraqis have died in the Iraqi conflict based on totally false claims.  Billions of dollars have been wasted on the lies.  There is no evidence that Saddam had anything to do with the attacks on September 11, 2001 or that he was connected in any way with Osama bin Laden or the Taliban.  Revealing the identity of a CIA agent is a criminal offense.  Do we need more?    I understand that many people do not like Sean Penn.  I'm not especially fond of his acting or his politics.  That is not the point.  To use the passive voice in claiming that the case has been proved false is an obvious evasion of the truth.  To smirk and sneer at the claims is not a helpful comment.    I thought the movie presented the case very well, and it makes me ashamed as an American that what Valerie Plame and her husband suffered has occurred.  Anyone who believes the movie used falsehoods should state their claims precisely; sneering and using more evasions are the tactics of the mentally lame.
0316017922|4.0|Dear Mr. Gladwell,  My high school English class just finished reading your very thought-provoking book, Outliers. Our class is set up so that everything we learn, read, and write revolves around the central question of \\"To what extent do time and place define a person\\"? We have used this question in topics such as religion, naming, and diversity. Our teacher chose your book because it talked a lot about how being born in a certain place at a certain point in time lead to either great success or a lack of it. This was extremely evident in the chapters the Matthew Effect, the 10,000 Hour Rule, and the Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes. For me, these chapters set up a very interesting way of looking at success apart from my previous view of just skill. Being a high school athlete I was really drawn to the research you did on the ages of the players on two hockey teams in the Matthew Effect. After reading the chapter and seeing the valid point you made about the oldest players in the leagues being more mature and looking more skilled at a certain period of time, I am baffled that I did not realize this playing in my own intramural leagues as a child. Now, looking back, I am in total agreement with your statement because at least in my leagues your point was entirely accurate. My only question would be whether this same point would hold up in a sport such as wrestling where the age factor is taken out and replaced with weight. This chapter had a perfect relation with my essential question because it seemed that time, in this case the birth date, when around the age cut off date of the league, led to greater success in the case of the mature players.   The 10,000 Hours Rule also fit in very well with the essential question. I found it fascinating how there is, usually, such a correlation between the completion of 10,000 hours and the success of the person. This was especially the case in your two examples of the Beatles and Bill Gates, where being in the right place at theright time allowed them to have the resources to reach 10,000 hours and then become very successful. I find it interesting in Bill Gates' story about how random and miniscule events that most likely seemed like nothing at the time to him, ended up playing such a part in his future success. For instance, the fact that he lived close enough to the computer coding station at a time where they let people use the very high-end technology, helped him reach his 10,000 hours and then in turn become successful.   The final chapter that fit in very well with the essential question was the Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes. In this case it did not so much deal with the time aspect of the question, but the place. I found it very intriguing in the way you tied in plane crashes to the ability of a pilot to speak his or her mind as well as the culture of the pilot. I did not know that there were actual rankings of a country's ability to speak up. I see this every day in a high school environment, where while lives are not on the line, a person's ability or inability to speak up when working with others can lead to problems both for the person and the entire group. I know I find it quite frustrating when a person refuses to speak their mind. This connection between culture and amount of plane crashes has lead to one question from me. It is, knowing that some country's have the ability to speak up more often than others, would it be right to only hire pilots from those countries, realizing that it could reduce plane crashes?   To end up this letter I would just like to say that I found book a very interesting piece of literature that could truly spark some impressive debates. I enjoyed reading the different topics and seeing them through someone else's point of view.
B004A8ZWTW|4.0|An orphaned girl, raised in a strict girls school, matures and finds herself a maiden at the manor of an area gentleman. A relationship develops between the two. Unforeseen circumstances cause her to flee the home, where she is taken in by others, telling her story. This film is carried quite well by Mia Wasikowska, and the technical aspects of the movie are all outstanding. It doesn't contain the slow moments that these period pieces often include, so the viewer remains interested throughout. A solid effort here that is worth the time invested.
0684857219|4.0|The item came in perfect brand new condition but it came a month late. If it wasn't for that I would give it five stars!!
B003Y5H50G|4.0|A struggling writer takes a pill that enables the user to access the parts of the brain that are not utilized, allowing him to function at an extremely high level. It turns out that this is an untested narcotic, and has serious side effects. He is pursued by others who want to benefit from the drug. This was a very engaging and original storyline, with the identity of a man following the writer a true mystery until the story is concluding. The spectacle of an individual opening up his mind, enabling him to devise clever ways to endure, and also to reach an intellectual level previously unseen, is cool. Nice work on this one.
B003ODL004|5.0|An exceptional score!  Hans Zimmer, Lorne Balfe, Christopher Nolan and Alex Gibson combine to produce an effective musical score that enhances an already quality movie.  The orchestral writing is dramatic and of Wagnerian proportions.
0451209338|5.0|This is my first introduction to Gabriel Allon and I must admit I am intrigued by him and the man who created him. The plot moves along quite well and as far as I am concerned, it is a real page turner. I found it difficult just to put my kindle down and go to work. I believe my wife thinks I am engaged in an unwholesome diversion. But, alas, it is not another woman!  I always appreciate a novel when I can learn something that I wasn't aware of before. Mr. Allon and Mr. Silva have informed me of the darker side of World War II. Just when I thought I knew it all, I know a bit more than I did before.    Kudos to the creator!
0205313426|5.0|I received my product in a timely time frame. IT was nice conducting business with you the service was great
1567184855|5.0|In this short, fascinating, and easy to read volume, you will find the answers to all those nagging questions... why are we here, what is our purpose, why do bad things happen to good people, what goes on between lives     if you only read one book on spritual development.. make it this one
B004SBS8LA|4.0|A bit repetitive repetitive... graphics are good and the tie in with the Rio movie is smart. Looking forward to more great games from Rovio!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This was a great game. The graphics were better than the original. It was fun to try to free birds instead of pwn pigs. GREAT GAME MUST GET!!!!!
B001RIY4WE|3.0|The actual movie transfer on this disc would rate five stars - a brilliant sharp image with great sound. Also, the writer-director commentary (from 2003) makes an excellent addition to the film.<br /><br />I have down-rated this disc due to the intrusive non-standard additions. Most irritating is the long delay when first loaded as the disc attempts to connect to the internet - since I didn't connect my player this results in an error message requiring a manual bypass. Then there are seemingly endless commercial snatches at the start of the disc, each taking up time before the arrival of the main menu. Extremely irritating is the DTS snatch whose volume level is far above the others resulting in a huge blast of noise.<br /><br />When the main menu is finally displayed you will see cute but non-standard menu headings resulting in more wasted time figuring out what these mean. \\"Skynet edition\\", indeed.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This movie is fun and entertaining for both children and adults alike. The stop motion animation looked great and in this day of computer generated images, the gritty, under polished charm of stop motion animation was refreshingly different. The voice acting was great and the cast was truly a Wes Anderson cast, complete with Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray. Overall I think this was a fun, charming movie that families can enjoy together.
0399250573|5.0|I read the first Rider novel when i was ten years old. I have loved the thrills and detailed action sequences. Alex has been a character I have idolized. I've been able to suspend belief and still use my brain with these books. Though Ark Angel and Crocodile Tears are both somewhat misses, the rest are solid reads, especially Scorpia and Snakehead. I guess you can say this ends not only the whole series, but my self-proclaimed \\"Scorpia Trilogy\\". Does the final Rider novel live up to expectations? Is it more violent? Is it better than the previous? Is is THE Alex Rider novel?  Yes.  The first quarter of the novel doesn't have Alex, but sets up the story very well. Two action scenes are well done and the violence kind of shook me-I didn't expect Horowitz to show this level of violence. That is a plus in my book. There is actually more than one villain. There are only five action sequences (a typical Alex Rider novel has about seven or eight), but there was more intensity, and the story takes the home front here. Though there are some cliches, Horowitz makes it clear with each page that this is the final Rider book.   The last 2 quarters are disturbing and thought provoking. And action packed. The psychological depth is well done.  This is definitely the most well written Rider book, if not as entertaining as something like Eagle Strike. Still, this is my favorite. Thanks Mr Horowitz, you've done a commendable job!!  P.S I agree that this isnt really a 10+ book but more of a 13+ book. Violence, excessive details and a complex plot. Not too bad though. I don't really care. This is a work of action art to be shared.
0805047905|5.0|The first time I ever heard of this book, I was reading it to a class full of 4 year olds (so I thought).  The kids knew every word in this book, and I ended up turning the pages while they \\"read\\" the book in unison to me.  It was so adorable.  I knew at that moment that this would be the first book that I bought for my future children.  And it was.<br /><br />My son loves this book as much as I do.  It's one of the first books he asked for by name.  He chimes in with the colors and animals and \\"helps\\" me read.<br /><br />We have lots of other Martin/Carle books, but none of them are as special as Brown Bear.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app, I use it every day on my drive to work.  I listen to Chicago sports radio daily and love it!
0142429112|5.0|I was looking for something to listen to on a 1000-mile drive and settled on this book because it sounded intriguing and it was (more than) long enough to cover the travel time.  The story is utterly engrossing.  Ten hours went by without my noticing.  I love the pacing; the world Harkness is building acquires depth and dimension slowly.  Nothing feels rushed, as if there is all the time in the world for the story to develop, and yet it doesn't seem to drag.  I can't wait to get back into the car so I can hear then next bit of the story.  Diana and Matthew, and Ysabeau, and Marthe are all appealing characters, with flaws and foibles and strengths.  I won't say they seem like real people - this is a fantasy, about witches, vampires and daemons, after all - but within their world they seem real.  Perhaps that's the key to why I like this book so much - it feels real and complete within itself, the sign of excellent world-building, which is a difficult thing to pull off.  If you would like to immerse yourself in another universe, with mysteries and political intrigue and love and history and bigotry and all the complexities that make people both frustrating and fascinating, give this book a try.  I may have to buy the Kindle version just so I can read it when I'm not by my CD player.  Since I wrote the above review, I have gotten the text as well.  I really can't wait for the next installment.
0060922583|5.0|This is a great book with lots of provocative and interesting cases and information.    If you possess an open mind, are seeking more information about the world in which you live and you understand that no one (on planet Earth at least) holds the absolute truth about reality and the universe (and you trust your instincts as much or more than the \\"experts\\") then this book is well worth your time to read.  The holographic universe is based in science and is supported by many well documented case studies by not only Bohm and Pribram but many other pioneers in physics, neurosciences, psychology, and metaphysics.  The book does contain a large amount of anecdotal evidence, but, unless you consider everyone who relates a personal experience that is outside the \\"norm\\" a liar, scam artist, or nut case, many of the cases are very compelling.    If, on the other hand, you derive your understanding of the world externally, believe only what your religions (including the religion of science) tell you are true, and are not interested in learning anything that may threaten your belief system and world view then this book is not for you.    I also recommend that you take the reviews here (including this one) with a grain of salt.  Everyone has an opinion, preconceived notions, and an agenda.  I did not read any of the reviews until I finished the book so as not to (potentially) bias my opinion before I read the material.     I find it a bit disingenuous of some of those who gave this book a rating of 1 star (or 0 if they could have) when they portend an understanding of scientific principles and then use one or two data points to rationalize their poor rating.  And for those who purchased the book and then complained that they threw away their money, I suggest they first go to the public library and borrow the book (as I did) if they feel the book may not be to their liking.    There is no end to the people willing to give you their opinion on something in an attempt to either persuade or dissuade you of the topic.  I suggest you examine the issues with an open mind and then let your soul guide you as to how much, if any, of the information resonates with you.
B000002HRE|1.0|How generous of James and Lars to give us a CD comprised of songs that weren't good enough to make it onto the original \\"Load\\". Of course, in retrospect, this was a work of genius compared to \\"St. Anger\\", but that's not saying much. Avoid.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|My 1st angry birds experience and it's more fun than I expected. I can't stop trying to free those birds! Works great on droid x.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Who could dislike free angry birds? I get tired of it after a while but then find myself playing again. fun game to come back to when bored.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Great service, arrived in 3-4 days. I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone who wants to buy great quality dvd's for a cheaper price.
075695195X|5.0|A wonderful and fresh fantasy. It reminded me a little of Pullman. This book was given to my niece as a gift, and after she read it, she passed it along to me. I am no YA reader, sad to say, but I loved this book. I loved the realms, and I loved the lack of simpering moralistic Brady Brunch-isms. The hero's motivations were, to me, most realistic. I hope this is made into a film.  This is a thoroughly good read, and I heartily recommend it to everyone of any age. This is a book I will enjoy reading again.
0446195529|1.0|Right up there among the worst books I have read in a long time. How many times can a super slueth and master spy be fooled and duped. Couldn't wait for this one to be over. Will be staying away from Baldacci for a while and away from the Camel Club series forever.
0143036424|4.0|Amazon recommended Craig Johnson's books because I read C J Box.<br /><br />Quick Set up: Wyoming lawman. Natural Wyoming background. Vic,sassy deputy with a foul mouth. Best friend Henry Standing Bear. Walt is his own man but fair. Shootings involving young men who were part of a prior heinous crime but hadn't paid the full price. Who's killing these boys?<br /><br />I read The Dark Horse first, which is #5 in the Walt Longmire series, then decided to read the rest starting with The Cold Dish. This first installment gets you acquainted with Sheriff Walt Longmire and others in his world. I thought the story plodded along at first,but then I decided it's the way Walt works so became more accepting of the pace. Although, does seem like a bunch of stuff happened within a couple of days so found myself wondering about the time line often trying to remember where we were,where we'd been.<br /><br />I gave the title four stars for content and character likability. The character development is what kept me going. I have to say, many times I was confused with who was saying what and the often implied meanings of some of Walt's thoughts. Sometimes I got bogged down with the constant descriptions of every body movement (crossing arms,arched eyebrow), which to me, is what slowed the story. But, every writer has his/her style. Johnson's seems to be methodical. Without being a spoiler, the ending was a tad unsatisfactory for me. I see where Johnson was going with the plausibility of connecting the shootings with the shooter's sad background, but just didn't feel right to me. Oh well. I still intend to continue with the series and look forward to Johnson's next new installment as well. I am a Sheriff Walt Longmire fan!
B000002B38|5.0|An amazing live experience from Pink Floyd: excellent audio quality in the CD version, also video quality in the DVD one. Probably their best live playing since the 1971' tours, absolutely unbelievable lights show, mixed at the best with band's play. You cannot miss this record, better if in the blinking light edition, if you like some brilliant and priceless piece of music history.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I got as far as young Kirk finding old Spock and, from that point until the end, the movie paused and skipped constantly.  Cleaning of the disc and dvd player proved futile.  The only conclusion I can form is poor workmanship on someone's part.  four stars for the movie itself but none for the copy I got.
B00406UK5A|5.0|Love the scenery and the fighting scenes of this movie.  It has the gruesomeness of the movie 300 but without the green screen effect.  It's more life-like.  The actors are great, each bringing their charisma to the screen.  I enjoy watching this movie with my husband but it's not suitable for children.
B004KA9VGA|3.0|I very much enjoyed the first half of the book, although thought it well and truly could have done with an editor.   Spoilers ahead!  I had no idea why the lengthy yoga scenes were included. Perhaps they will be important in the sequel, but even if that is the case, in my opinion they went for far too long. I kept waiting for them to be relevant.  I did not understand why the aunt spoke to the heroine so condescendingly throughout the book.   I liked the plot, but was unable to finish the book. I found the constant \\"Mon Coeur\\" from the hero just way too much to take and it seemed out of character with his initial portrayal.  In my view the portrayal of Wiccans was inaccurate, a shame considering the book's title. I have never heard of Wiccans who act in an evangelistic manner, trying to force people (and at that, not even of their own coven) to attend rituals.   Nevertheless, I am looking forward to the sequel and will buy it. I do hope there is a serious editor for the sequel and that superfluous material (please, no more yoga!) is not included.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fantastic as always. just as good if not better than the original. great graphics. Just never enough levels to feed the addiction. I highly recommend.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|The game looks great, nice new ideas. To bad Amazon App Store requires a &quot;purchase&quot; of a free app. Still a great app with or without Amazons requirement.
B00005Q4DW|5.0|Great action,already had the second one and wanted the first one,love the actress and the action-hope there's another coming,but apparently not.
B00008MJ8H|4.0|This music seldom rants, but it makes its points.  There is a quiet sadness to some of this music, as if evoking a time forever lost and things done and said that can't be taken back.  Cockey's Theme with the pan flute is one of my favorites, as is the Poverty piece.  Deborah's Theme seems a bit long and sometimes bland, but it has a haunting quality all its own.  There is also a nice pick of period music, especially during the Depression/Prohibition years.  The concert suite at the end does a nice job of summarizing the story in music, with some of its different orchestrations.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I tried to download the app onto my phone and after the install, I couldn't find the app.  Tried to do it again and nothing.  This doesn't work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app for all my Bible needs. All the most popular versions. Many can be downloaded for use when you have no signal. Plus you can use as audio Bible as well as Study guide.<br /><br />Only thing missing from this is a daily verse widget. Also I prefer Bible.is application for audio Bible because it's dramatized, making it easier to follow.
