B00AB7HESI|5.0|Spelling and problem solving wrapped up in a game with adorable graphics! I downloaded this for my nieces and nephew but it's even fun for me to join in!
B00GSQJJ34|4.0|I don't have it but my cousin does and it is the best. You can design Your car, your person, your barn, and get animals to keep. you can race.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is awesome. Challenges my brain a little and the kids also love it. We live the neon colors also!
B00CE03UOC|1.0|It's just another stupid connect the dots game but this one still forces you to pay for more levels and give your facebook information  to unlock all the levels. When an app costs money, you should have the full game, period. You shouldn't ever see pop ups begging you for more.<br /><br />And all these reviews. FUN. COLORS. NEON. ADDICTIVE. EASY. Just read through them. How did so many similar reviews pop up on so many identical time periods? It's like 80% of the people who decided to review this app all have the same vocabulary and review writting styles. Go figure.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It is a really good game. Though getting money is tough. The graphics are awesome. If anybody thinks this is helpful please the Appstore.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is better than any zombie movie ever made. The writers are at the top of their game and the director and actors are putting those words in to visual art.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally for kindla fire, been waiting forever!!!  So much easier to play than trying to see it on the phone. Thank you
B008602KQI|4.0|Great movie almost as good as the book.New and upcoming actors with a few veterans to help guide the way.
B0067RQYNW|2.0|Does not work.  Cannot open new doc.  Read only, apparently.  Serves no purpose, that I could find. It would be great if one could actually do some simple word processing.  Notes are better.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Liking the artwork and elements of the gameplay so far. The tone seems a bit grimdark but that may well be what the creators intended. Haven't made it too far past the tutorial but so far I'm willing to keep plodding along.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER<br />THIS IS BETTER THAN CANDY CRUSH<br />I LOVE MONEY SO THIS GAME SCREAMS ME!
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|love these guys. I'm happy to add this album to my collection. 5 stars and worth every one! buy them, you wont be sorry.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ah, it full of &#34;interesting&#34; things. Certainly widens one's knowledge base about sexuality. Actually it's a &#34;fun&#34; book. It's badly written which is sad, but readable.
B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|First, thank you Steve McQueen, John Ridley and Brad Pitt for directing, producing and creating the screen play for the novel \\"12 Years a Slave\\".<br /><br />Second, anyone who wants to know how utterly brutal most slavery was in the United States need only READ first-hand accounts of it which can be easily found in a local library, by doing a simple google search, or by viewing a thoughtful, accurate, and moving rendition of one of those `first-hand accounts'.  My opinion?  That perfect, brought to the big screen, first-hand account is \\"12 Years a Slave\\".<br /><br />Hands down, this is the best piece of work I have ever seen on American Slavery and, in my humble opinion, it tops the mini-series \\"Roots\\" which for many years has been the quintessential media authority on slavery in this country.  Yes, \\"Roots\\" spanned several generations and was pretty epic, but between the acting and how the story was told in \\"12 Years A Slave\\" it tops any other artsy or dramatic film that I've seen about being a slave in the American South.<br /><br />A note of caution:  this isn't \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\" or \\"The Help\\" - lol.  Though these last two movies mentioned discuss a period of America many decades after slavery ended, the point I'm trying to make by mentioning them is that \\"12 Years a Slave\\" isn't sugar-coated to be sweet, sappy or give you that warm, melodramatic, non-threatening feeling.  It is the truth and the truth can be a very hard and bitter pill to swallow.  I knew this movie would be difficult to watch, but I had no idea how difficult.  I wept throughout.<br /><br />The acting was superb by the entire cast and I hope there will be some Oscars received by the film, because it is deserved.<br /><br />There aren't enough stars in the sky to rate it.<br /><br />P.S.  After writing my review of \\"12 Years a Slave\\" on Amazon.com, I went back and started reading others' reviews and noticed that an excellent summation of this movie by another mentioned the film \\"Schindler's List\\" in his title as did I.  That should convey just how deep, visceral and important \\"12 Years a Slave\\" is.  No more \\"oh slavery wasn't that bad,\\" please.  It really was that bad.<br /><br />*t\\" in his title as did I.  That should convey just how deep, visceral and important \\"12 Years a Slave\\" is.  No more \\"oh slavery wasn't that bad,\\" please.  It really was that bad.<br /><br />*
B008OHV5QO|5.0|Love it. Love his music. This is the kind of thing you can listen to over and over and enjoy new things each time. This man has a message. The nostalgic journey he makes is one we all make at one time or another in our lives, whether physically or in our dreams.
B008Y5T5ZE|3.0|It was different, interesting, not particularly crazy about this type of movie, but Johny depp did a good job. Thanks
B0089LOG02|4.0|This novel takes a look at an idea in American history that should have worked more consistently than it apparently did.  During the late 1800s through the early 1900s orphans from the disadvantaged areas of the eastern US were transported by train to the Midwest to be adopted by families there.  Some families were good to these children, some only wanted cheap labor.  One of the two main characters of Orphan Train, Vivian, was one of these children, and we watch how her life turned out as she shares her story with the other main character, Molly, who has a similar background in the present, that of being shuttled from place to place.  I was engaged as these two girls dealt with what life handed them and the people who were meant to care for them.<br /><br />I might have given this a 5 rating, except that like so many contemporary writers Kline finds it necessary to resort to vulgar language in the modern sections of the story.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this series, season one gets you hungry and ready for more!  I love the suspense and drama. Great show.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Fun movie with a thin plot but do you really watch a movie like this for a great plot?!?! I've enjoyed the entertainment from the two Red movies so far and would continue to support based on these two.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to see it on Kindle. Playing it on the phone is not fun, and borrowing my kids tablet was an effort.
B003Q6D2BE|1.0|The voices and lips where not matching throughout the whole movie.  It was hard to watch and I did not enjoy it at all.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|what a great game this is a good game wanna have some FUN? play this game what a great game
B00CM7FLZ8|1.0|Clearly needs to be updated for 4.4. Running in the latest Nexus 5. Game installs fine, but force closes. Have uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail.
B00E38KGF4|4.0|This app shows a scarlet background and a shield upon it.  It is a simple but clear but clear depiction of protection.  It does show a type of lightning division within the shield and perhaps this is to further re-enforce the idea of the shield stopping harm from those behind it.<br />I could not say if this device is doing all that it promises as I am not the least bit technologically proficient, but each app I load causes a response if safe from this shield logo.<br />Roughly half a dozen or so times now it has stated a warning as I download.  It tells of virus, malware, adware and twice now a dangerous malware or infiltration. Once it removed it immediately and the others issued a warning to stop loading and remove the offending app.<br />I do regular scans, especially when I receive warnings.  I hope I am doing my best to protect my kindle as it is very important to me.<br />I have a Kindle Fire hd 7inch.
B001O03NCW|5.0|Plays clear and clean and a 'hoot' to listen to on my Kindle HD when I am not on the internet.
1451666179|5.0|Like the blog, it hits the spot.  I wish I could get my book back - loaned it out and it is going around my circle of friends!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting, fast paced and hard to put down.  Will get more books with this character.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|It is another teen movie from the late 1970s to 1980s but one with a slight twist that would remind you of the &#34;Twilight Zone&#34;, good movie! Rare to find.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Decent enough &#34;Star Trek&#34; flick, I suppose, but neither up to par with Jackson's other films or those in the previous Star Trek televison series, novels and motion pictures.  The acting, except for the actor portraying &#34;Scotty&#34;, is excellent even though these are not the actors that many of us older folk grew up with.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Loved playing the previous Magic games on my Xbox. Love the fact that i can take this game mobile. Good price too.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I wasn't sure how good #3 was going to be, as usually by the 3rd movie the some excitement is lost - but not with Iron Man 3, I loved it! I think it's my favorite of the Iron Man movies yet.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|This review is solely on the shipping method...not the movies themselves. The package did arrive on time as specified, however, the case that it came in was damaged. The area where it latches shut was almost shattered completely. Not a fan. Though, it did not damage any of the movies themselves which is the main thing I was concerned with. At least there is the outside cardboard case to put it in I suppose. Just a let down to open it and see that damage done.
B00EDLP6O2|4.0|THIS game is good when your looking for something to pass the time. The graphics are nice and the controls are pretty easy to learn.  The only thing that I didn't like was that I could being right handed or southpaw. I would recommend this game to a friend, no questions asked.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun and truly addicting game!!!!!!!! You know when you repeatedly come back over and over again for days on end! It is a fun and social game!
B008602KQI|4.0|Great movie to make you appreciate the freedom we do have. It also will allow you to think about your own life.
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|A lot of singing, I bought the album for Drakes rapping skills but nonetheless excellent music!!!!!  Very smooth if your in a relaxed mood.
B005P06AAO|5.0|Love it Im an Awkward fan the picture is clear disc now clean no scratches and each episode will have you tuned in for more
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Lots of action. Like Daniel Craig.train scene was a god way to start of the movie! Looking forward to the next Bond movie.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|Very good but not up to Justin's usual standards. A little too country for me and his voice is not quite as clear as it used to be.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What could we do without Facebook?  You can check in on Family and Friends and just about wish the whole world well.  Having this on my Kindle has been the best addition.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Beautiful story, wonderfully acted. Richard Farnsworth was magnificent. An odyssey filled with fascinating people and all based on a true story.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|My goodness, You have to have Google on your Kindle.  There's not too much you can do without a great search aid.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Not much fun in this one.  I think of Bond as playful.  Judy Dench is always worth watching and Javier Bardem is such a chameleon; how he can go from lover in one movie to monster in another is a marvel.  I still am not used to Daniel Craig's less glamorous Bond. I like the new Q.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|It's good movie I WACHED in the movie theater early, but is always good to wach that movie,I hope going to wach again.Exsellent movie
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Great calculator if you want one that works on the wide screen where the other popular calculator did not.<br />Tim Town<br />TheBIZRoom
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Everyone must see this.  Should be a requirement to watch before visiting sea world or similar institution.  Heartbreaking and mezmorizing.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I used to play the original on facebook.  Glad this one is on kindle.  If does take along time to level up because it's basically a waiting game.  I don't have any friends who play.  I wish there was a way I could get friends outside of facebook so I can level up faster.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I did not like the story of line of having kids kill other kids.  The acting and quality of the film were good.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a good read. It was typical Steven king. I would recommend this book if you like his work.
B0061US58C|4.0|The kids really enjoyed the movie.  they thought many parts were hilarious and are still quoting mater.  The graphics were very colorful and well done.  But this movie does not appeal to those who dislike NASCAR.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A fantastic read that follows the life of an orphan with many twists and turns. A must read! A gripping narrative!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I did enjoy the storyline of this book but I felt that it was lacking. The writing in this book seemed mediocre at best and not nearly as good as the first two. Roth is very good at giving great excitement in the action parts of the book but when it comes to the first half, I felt that I was reading a fanfiction and wanted make things up as she went along.
B003U4ZTNQ|3.0|Decent but not amazing 3/5 stars
0061122416|5.0|This book helped me in transition of changing my life.Turned my life around..just like that..amazing read.love this.Truly inspiring..wonderful.Great choice of everything in this book hahahe
B0040I09RM|5.0|Enjoyed the story. The way the characters are developed you feel like you know each one of them. I look forward to watching the next season , now for the third time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|&#34;So many words get lost. They leave the mouth and lose their courage, wandering aimlessly until they are swept into the gutter like dead leaves.&#34;<br />-Nicole Krauss<br />I have a burning desire to know more about Christian Grey! What happened to him?
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Lusty, fun read.  A bit over the top I have to say.  Ending was not realistic in this case.  Read trilogy.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Please download this game it is a good game and it runs well with the kindle fire<br />And good for the kid's
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Easy to read, and yet so profound. I enjoyed how much of the content seems like common knowledge that has been hiding under our nose. Dr Chapman definitely turns on a light, that I am sure will help the quality and longevity of my marriage. I will be sharing this book with family and friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game its very addicting, just one question, my friend has a wheel of fortune thing on their phone version, when is the kindle gonna have that update. But still, an awesome game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so worth the $7 it is so fun you can make whatever you want I made a waterfall and an under ground cave GET THIS GAME
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Most tablet gamers a blotchy at best but this game was really well designed and recommend it 100%. The only downfall I could think of is Maybe more costumes but that's not a deal breaker.
B00C2IJJDM|3.0|I was expecting much more from this but it is exactly what it says it is, blu-ray steelbook. That's it. No leaflet, no book, nothing special about it.
B00GT67UUM|5.0|This is a very refreshing game to play. Old school engineering style game at it's best.  This game gets your mind to think before you move.  Shows people the inventiveness of how to make old ideas New again.  Need more games like this.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Great story, hard to put down. And even though Lucy sleeps with Faber, she redeems herself. The ending was a little weak, but overall a great read.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved the book and I loved the movie. It was true to the book, the casting and acting was great, costumes, scenes were all true to the book and an excellent visualization!
B002UNMWAG|1.0|The first had humor but was primarily a serious and unique action movie. It was a huge success when it was put out on DVD and became a cult hit. This time around everything ridiculous about the first movie was given a shot of steroids and it is nothing but a caricature of the original. The secondary characters are either complete idiots or tools used to deliver the laziest one liners I've ever seen in a movie. This movie should ONLY appeal to 13 year old males. The amazing movie that was the original should be nowhere near this mindless waste of time on anyone's shelf.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It's a pretty good game with beautiful graphics and fun gameplay plus you surely can't beat the price of free ....... who can't afford free.  It plays great and smoothly on my Kindle Fire.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|This was another solid King & Maxwell hit. Couldn't put it down for long...it was that good. As I read I pictured the characters from the TNT tv series. I really liked the tv show which made this book that more exciting. You won't go wrong with this one.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|one of the best games I have ever played .  please make more of these games epic plxel llc it is one of your best games
B00GIZO674|5.0|Can't get enough, love building food games. Like clicking to cooking one food while making different plates. I buy only these kind of games.

B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Great story with the characters we have grown to love.  I am glad to see more of Edgar. Can't wait for the next one.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It is really bout the tears.  The toll paid by the survivors.  The strength and weakness of the human condition.  Enjoy.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Grandson loves Legos and minecraft great combination. Small box bit it was just enough.  Any Legos gift would have put a smile on his face.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful. Excellent graphics and game play. Wonderfully relaxing music. Requires time, patience , and thought. Absolutely worth paying for! Just finished chapter 1. Can't wait to see what comes next...
B008ANFRGQ|4.0|another piece of nice music art by steve vai.this album shines.steve vai has an incredible vision of music.and this album proves that.
B003GQM52Q|5.0|Action! Story keeps it iteresting too. If you like westerns, need to see it. Wyatt's story behind the US marshall worth telling. Love interests?
B000000H48|5.0|this is the most unhighly rated bands out there like king diamond.the best black metal your ears will ever here.he is the king of all metal.the awesome king diamond.the one and only.
B004EBT6HE|2.0|A rather shallow plot with most twists and turns quite predictable.  I've read many other of Follett's works with more enjoyment.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|im glad they put out a 25th anniversary edition for this album.this is megadeths first album thats on a major lable.great speed and thrash metal.disc number 1 is the album in its intiratly.disc 2 is a live recoding of the album.great for collectors are hard core megadeth fans around the world.
B00F031X62|5.0|Jimi at some of his best.  It rained the next day I think it was, when he was to play again, but show delayed, so he penned Rainy Day Dream Away then.
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|the great megadeth.this is a great album if you like speed metal at its finest.and its a 20th anniversary edition.very happy with this album.its a 2 disc set.very good and thick packagine.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|This band is fantastic--real musicians who love music and play and produce their own, not corporate like much music today
B00DCRE83S|5.0|jason newsted did a fantastic job on this album.it sounds a lot like old school megadeth.it really surprise the heck out of me.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Best of the trilogy; I would give 5 stars but predictable. If you have children, like Harry Potter, excellent to use to motivate children to read instead of video games. All 3 books a I suspect will be better than the movies although lead actress in movies is ideal for the part.
B00DCRE7M0|4.0|this is nothing like dream thearter.this will surprise you.this is some pretty hardcore metal.its all good.in your face heavy metal.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Who knew that Danny Torrance could get any better?!  BRAVO, might just have to go back to the beginning and start all over...SO GOOD!!
B007X4N0DU|4.0|some kick butt heavy metal.this is a pretty good band.this is my first album by p.o.d.i like listenting and learning about new bands and see whats out there.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|....oh wait, I did.<br /><br />Typical Hollywood political plot. Oh those evil republicans, they'll stop at nothing including killing the president to continue the war machine.  Still trying to figure out the waving of the white house flag instead of the stars and stripes during the dramatic scene.  I'm missing the meaning on that one.<br /><br />Another Hollywood waste of time.
B000002IRL|5.0|one of the best overkill albums to date.a great speed metal band and album.this album rocks.overkill has been around for a long time.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Each book by these fantastic authors is always better than the last one. I did not want to put it down, and I never wanted it to end. It would be wonderful to have another one waiting to be read.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like the device but if keep using it there are some annoyances,<br /><br />- I dont see TVQueue feature for youtube.com in browser (very annoying after got used to it in app)<br />- For me I need to unplug and plugin back in order to be detected in apps/browser. I dont find time to look more (may be a firewall issue but why it looses the connection from other devices after some idle time, chromecast itself says connected fine.)<br />- Their help site is a joke. all they have is shiny videos and content about basic product. I doubt google is very serious about this product either (like GTV)
B005544TRQ|3.0|Its not a bad series but has a few, unfortunately prominent,  phony, or obnoxious, characterizations plus its a bit soapy at times. Still it offers some entertainment.
014312336X|5.0|It was a gift for a friend who loves mysteries and the Orient and this clearly filled the bill.  He loved it and recommends it highly to all his friends.<br />I love it because it was &#34;as advertised&#34; in the descriptions and reviews and it made a perfect gift.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a fun and addictive game. So glad you don't need energy.  I am just starting but so far I like it.
0070511136|5.0|Practical approach based on their needs and not your own desires, interests, reasons...etc.  Recommended by our business consultant, has used for many of his clients with success.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This game is pretty awesome! It is a lot of fun for anyone who likes the turtles! I think it will be a little challenging for my 4 year old son but I know that he will still love it. Great game!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great! The only thing is that you need to spend a lot of money (for an app) to unlock everything. That's the only bummer.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|Great instant film! The photos have a great vibrancy and look, and it's a lot more fun to use at parties than Instagram. (Although scanning them to post and share online takes a little longer :D )
0062082841|5.0|Looking into the window of greatness. There's nobody like this man in Hollywood. Creative, imaginative, story driven, a great talent.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This figure is a must-have for any Sailor Moon fan. Although, smaller than I imagined it would be, the figure is really flexible and sturdy. She can be posed in almost all her poses from the show.
B008J9EYFG|4.0|Great album, nice listen to, easy on the mind. her abeyance is great diffidently Beth Orton  I Am very glad to have bought this CD
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works great. Wonderful picture quality. The easiest set up.Just wish there was more apps available, like Amazon Instant Video.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I could play this game for hours.<br />It is so addictive. At first I didn't really like it, then I gave it a real try and I got hooked.
B0018TLRTK|1.0|I could listen to his music for very long. I really liked him in the 80s, But, I grew up. and lost interest is him.

B000FC12SM|5.0|ANY COUPLE can benefit from this book.  It basically validates who we are as WOMEN AND MEN.  My boyfriend and I read it together and find ourselves laughing at some of the things that used to be problems.  I think it helps couples see the differences in a healthy way, instead of in a threatening way.
B00BWQW73E|2.0|This is not an in-depth look at Jeff Bezos and Amazon in any way. The book provides as much content about Jeff Bezos and Amazon as TMZ & the E Channel would provide. The book glosses over one subject after another - poor working conditions in the distribution centers; how distribution center staff are considered near-serfs by HQ staff; thumb on the jugular of staff by Jeff Bezos; scant details about the birth of kindle and the evolution of AWS and Amazon's streaming service; no comparison or mention how Walmart acquired Vudu streaming service and why Amazon is succeeding where Vudu is failing and not part of any consumer's thinking. And, a big miss between what Jeff Bezos advocates, we work for the consumer all the time, and the horrible consumer experiences Amazon customers have with OnTrac, a regional delivery carrier - there are hundreds of complaints by Amazon customers, yet Amazon has shown a deaf ear.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Had never seen it.  Was enthralled  through out entire production.  Alfie Boe was a magnificent Val Jean.  Have since bought every recording he has ever produced.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|This group is fabulous!  I hope a cd is available soon.  I could listen to them create the most entrancing beautiful music all night!

B00B0LPWU6|3.0|It's okay - pretty unbelievable movie - and I realize it's a movie, but it's also rather depressing and bleak in addition to the almost-horrific plane crash.

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Wow! Just got through two nights of watching a Blu-Ray 3 disc \\"History of the Eagles ... The Story of an American Band\\". Indeed it was! Perhaps many of you have seen it, as it was on Show Time for awhile, but this was my first.<br /><br /> It truly is the story of an American band. I was amazed at the parallels between their journey and my own while playing in a small-time Long Island band, Cottonwood sage, throughout the 70s. So much rang familiar ... we had everything but Linda Ronstadt!! [ and many several million dollars!] ;-)<br /><br /> First disc covers them through their break-up in 1980 and was my favorite part ... building on their influences from Motown to western-swing to Poco/Flying Burrito Brothers/JD Souther/Linda Ronstadt. Many segments stroked chords within me and were quite emotionally satisfying. Second disc looks at their solo careers, the Reunion in 1994 and right on to the present. Two things stood out to me; the bittersweet departure of Don Felder - a guitarist that I just now fully appreciated - & the nearly tragic end of Joe Walsh. The reunion literally saved his life.<br /><br /> All the great songs are here, Take it Easy, Tequila Sunrise, Hotel California, Desperado, Take it to the Limit, Rocky Mountain Way, and some new material that's pretty good, too. For me, it was pretty much my first time with the new stuff as I have been musically insulated during the 80s, 90s, and onward ... Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon, Glen Frey, Don Felder, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh and Don Henley - all featured. All the soaring harmonies! My only issue was that I wish there had been some more of Timothy's great songs.<br /><br /> Oh, third disc was a concert, or part of, from March, 1977. Vintage. Music to my ears. :-)<br /><br /> Great stuff! The highs & the lows; the friendships & the pettiness that few bands can avoid. Highly recommended to fans of the 70s era music!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Are you bored? Then download this game you won't get bored any more, it's addicting. You don't want to put down your phone or your tablet. Cute little minions too
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is a lot of fun, but I also can see why they call it candy crack you could get sucked in for hours.
B00GWYSQTU|5.0|This book needs to go to your kindle. It has all the tools you will ever need in order to succeed in life. The authors writing is very easy to read and enjoyable. I really like how did he go straight to the point and gives you all the techniques you will need. I am personally going to keep re-reading this book because it contains very valuable information.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|Great music that grabs your mind. I am impressed that this music is still around somewhere over the rainbow and able to be played for today's crowd.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|I loved this book.  Sheryl Seal really knows how to paint a great picture in Beyond Oria Falls.  This is the second book in the Dwellers of Ahwahnee and it's also the second book I've read by Sheryl Seal.  I look forward to more books by Sheryl and I highly recommend this author and book to everyone.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|I just returned from watching Catching Fire a week after it's West Coast premiere... Needless to say, I was blown away. This movie is the closest book-to-movie adaption I've ever seen. Easily.<br /><br />I was so blown away by this movie that I was glued to my chair. The relationship between Finnick and Mags, the relationship between Katniss and Peeta and Katniss and Gale.<br /><br />For the few parts that were strayed from the book, I didn't mind, as they were few and noticeably necessary. If every scene was followed in the movie, then it would be longer than anyone could endure.<br /><br />Catching Fire is easily the greatest movie of the year, thus earning an easy 5 stars from me.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Entertaining story line, not to hard to imagine this being the future.  Enjoyed the visuals as well as the plot.
B000JIJPZY|3.0|Cute design and activities but too small and not appropriate for babies who have started rolling and moving.  This should be recommended for 0-6 mos.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|This is truly a poorly marketed great movie. I had no idea of its existence, I almost missed it. What a loss would that be! I LOVE John Carter of Mars.

B00BOXZAJ8|3.0|I love Jim Sturges and can watch him in about anything, but this movie just falls apart.  It's pretty.  It has some interesting ideas, but either they edited out a lot or they just had a basic idea that they didn't have time or money to flesh out.  The  &#34;happy happy look at our bright future&#34; ending seemed forced.  Just felt like there was a lot not shown or given the chance to develop.  It was enjoyable but I wouldn't really watch it again...which is unfortunate since I bought the 3D DVD version.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This movie was as advertised. It was Independence Day with a black marshal instead of a white President, 3 wannabe scientists instead of Jeff Goldblum, and the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (Jungle Fury edition) instead of Will Smith. It was better b/c there was't a campfire scene, but Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum on screen together is a better ending than this movie had.<br /><br />Watched this streaming on my PS3 Amazon Instant video app in HD w/ 5.1 and it looked and sounded great, not a single buffering pause or pixel out of place. The technology is really impressive.

B000V63C4Y|5.0|Classic. A must for any serious jazz fan. Anyone not familiar with Jobim's music will find this the perfect introduction. Stan Getz is at the top of his game.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great game. I am really enjoying playing. Even though it includes in app purchases it is not necessary to advance in the game. Two thumbs up for this game.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again Mr. Hosseini has hit a literary home run. As with his previous novels, I was pulled into the story by the author's exceptional ability to make you feel that you are there.

B000FC12Z0|3.0|I think this was a good book. I did not get the characters that much, but it still was a good book.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Excellent  movie enjoyed the human interest twist that was presented.  I would recommend this movie to all my friends.  Denzel Rocks!
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|How did this script ever get approved?  All the character interactions fall completely flat.  Everybody talks about \\"The Chair\\" like a bunch of silly fanboys.  And the mirrored scene from Star Trek II (you know the one)- Oh my god, I thought I was watching some kind of parody!  They reused the most beautiful scene from any Star Trek movie and basically took a dump on it.  I think I was audibly groaning during that scene, but it might have been the actors - you could tell they thought it was retarded too.<br /><br />Things blow up, Spock leaps around like a jedi from revenge of the sith, Kirk flies through space like superman.  More things blow up, including the plot which makes no darn sense.  What an emberrasment!

B009NYF2GQ|3.0|Cabaret is a 1972 musical film directed by Bob Fosse. The performances of Liza Minnelli, Michael York and Joel Grey, and evocative musical numbers help Cabaret secure its status as a stylish, socially conscious classic that's culturally, historically significant.<br /><br />In the traditional manner of musical theater, every significant character in the stage version of Cabaret sings to express emotion and advance the plot. In the film version, just two of the film's major characters (The Emcee and Sally) sing in the club.<br /><br />In 1931 Berlin, American Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) performs at the Kit Kat Klub. A new British arrival, Brian Roberts (Michael York), moves into Sally's boarding house. A reserved academic and writer, Brian gives English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate in Philosophy. Sally unsuccessfully tries to seduce Brian. Brian tells Sally that on three occasions he has tried to have physical relationships with women, all of which failed. The pair become friends, and Brian is witness to Sally's anarchic, bohemian life in the last days of the German Weimar Republic.<br /><br />Later Sally and Brian become lovers; they conclude that his previous failures with women were because they were &#34;the wrong three girls.&#34; Sally befriends Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem), a rich playboy baron who takes her and Brian to his country estate. Its ambiguous which of the duo Max is seducing, epitomized by a scene in which the three dance intimately together in a wine-induced reverie.<br /><br />Sally finds out that she's pregnant and unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her.
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|This movie is advertised as modern remake of a classic.  However it is done in black and white and the actors are trying to talk with the original language.  We watch about 5 minutes and turned it off - what a waste of money
B0072OFM28|3.0|It's unheard of to recast a titular character in a television show. Andy Whitfield was credited with giving &#34;gravity and heart&#34; to the role of the famous warrior in the original Spartacus series. Liam McIntyre had the daunting task of replacing Whitfield. Its hard not to compare the two. McIntyre visually and physically fits the part. His Spartacus is a quieter more of an ensemble player than leader.

B00FAY6JDI|3.0|Cher's best-selling debut week of her career and her highest-charting solo album, Closer to the Truth on white vinyl is her first vinyl album release since 1991's Love Hurts and 1992's Greatest Hits: 1965–1992.<br /><br />Auto-tune formula has always failed to attempt to reinvent music with any organic life and feeling. Cher (and all of the electronic dance music artists after her) has exhausted (the exhausting) auto-tune formula. Cher is best when its closest to the truth of her voice. As one of music's most resilient singers, Cher has one of the richest (often imitated) influential voices and it is best heard without auto-tune.<br /><br />Musically, Closer to the Truth is a pop and dance record. The album showcases her where she reigns best: the first half is an uptempo EDM extravaganza that consists of lyrically substantive topics of feminism, individualism and self-empowerment, and progresses to a mid-tempo ballad-oriented second half which incorporates elements of soft rock and country and lyrics detailing personal feelings and relationships.<br /><br />Cher collaborated with Diane Warren, Timbaland, Mark Taylor (who produced her 1998 hit, &#34;Believe&#34;) and Kuk Harrell on this album. &#34;Lie to Me&#34; and &#34;I Walk Alone&#34;, both written by pop star PINK, and one featuring her vocals; &#34;Take It Like a Man&#34; featuring Jake Shears; and a song written by Cher & Shirley Eikhard called &#34;Lovers Forever&#34;. Originally intended for the soundtrack of the 1994 film Interview with a Vampire, it was recorded by Eikhard for her 2005 album Pop.

B00F2362IE|5.0|This is a fun game. My kids and I have enjoyed playing it. I have not experienced any problems with it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on Kindle, the best of both worlds. Love it!!  Best game, great conversation item.  Now I can start over since I'm stuck on iPhone app.
B000KIPT30|3.0|After a few months of using it, it still works fine. It is a no frills design and feels about as cheaply made as it is inexpensive. I use it to boost signal to people in my recording studio for tracking and monitoring. I wouldn't recommend it for more critical audio, such as mixing and mastering as the signal isn't clean or flat enough.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|As others have stated, this really is a great case. Obviously a case is a very personal thing and everyone is looking for something different, but here are a few reasons I like it.<br /><br />First, it's not just a hard plastic case. It has a little give to it and feels like it would absorb a shock better than the hard plastic cases. At the same time though, it isn't so soft that it sticks to your pocket liner when you try to pull it out. That is a problem I had with my previous case. It was silicone with a plastic shell, but the silicone stuck out on the sides and would stick to my pocket every time I pulled it out. I don't have that problem with this case.<br /><br />This is also a thinner case. Not the slimmest one I have seen, but it fits comfortably into my jeans pocket. It falls right in between something like the Otterbox Commuter and the Elago S4. For me it was the happy middle, because I didn't want a case that was too thick, but I did want a front edge/lip on it so that I could set it face down without scratching the screen.<br /><br />All of the control and port cutouts line up perfectly with my iPhone 4S, so no issues there.<br /><br />Overall, it's just a really nice case. Simple and not too flashy (which I like) while still offering good protection. I would choose this case again over cases costing 2x-3x as much. At this price I think it's a steal. I wish I would have started here rather than trying a $20 case (which I am now not using) first.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This is a great mellow listening album. The type of music to I like to sing along with  while in the car or doing chores.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is a challenging game to play and making sure you receive a star in order to move onto another stage in the game. As you play the game it gets harder as you go. You can play against your friends or just by yourself.

B004SIP9Z6|3.0|This was probably the weirdest movie that I have ever seen Bruce Willis play in, though he did play the same basic character that he has played in the majority of his movies; an honest cop who is out to get justice and protect the innocent, even if it takes his life. The entire movie was done in a comic book style, meaning that it was in black and white with only certain aspects colorized, such as a red dress, etc. Also, the movie was a bit disappointing because there wasn't a clearly defined end and it is far from certain whether the good guys or the bad guys won in the end. Actually, it was sometimes hard to tell who was the good guys. With the exception of a few notably good characters, it was the bad guys and the really bad guys.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There has to be a book four!! I can't wait to see how the movie is going to turn out!! Keep them coming E L James
0470876417|5.0|One of the best business books I've ever read. It is also designed in an interesting way: black and white cover and full color interior. This book is innovative in its content and its design, as well as being a collaborative work, where the multiple authors give credit to thousands of people. The model is particularly useful to think about new business ideas or to review and modify an existing business model.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This is a very fun game. It's not the hardest game to play but it is fun. I finished the game in a day due to it being so addictive. The graphics are great  and the sound is good also. Well worth the free download.

1401938906|5.0|I have a few more experiments to do yet, but I feel very compelled to review this wonderful book.<br /><br />First, she breaks down the LOA in an easy to understand FUN way, describing it in ways that I could grasp much more firmly then ever before--or perhaps something just clicked-- not sure, but I liked the analogies. Toilet training the puppy and the space heater, two good ones :)<br /><br />Secondly, the experiments are awesome. I can't wait to wake up each day to either begin a new one OR see what little blessings or miracles or my now increased awareness brings me each day.<br /><br />The first experiment I did twice, and both times little blessings and miracles (many little ones in fact) came my way. A friend that I have tried to reach out too and reconnect with for years wrote me and wants to build a relationship again, new health coaching client in my business that I did not seek out and popped up randomly at the perfect time, a date, lovely little compliments here and there. Perhaps it was just my heightened sense of awareness, but I don't care...I have now realized that tiny little miracles and blessings are all around us, happening each and every moment, but we rarely notice or SEE them.<br /><br />The second experiment was my favorite, it was the second day that really knocked my socks off- delayed though. I didn't even realize it at first. I decided to go with purple feathers instead of the yellow butterflies, that is what I wanted the universe to deliver to me.<br /><br />I had errands to do and was driving around laughing out loud about the purple feathers and wondering about them (a bit of self doubt, that is why I think it took about 28 hours to deliver. it was a very cold fall day, and I didn't know of any purple birds and even avoided a Michael's craft store to avoid &#34;forcing&#34; anything!). I decided to do a bit of shopping and browsing at a few stores in Georgetown, DC, after a haircut, since I am not normally in the area, and walked intoa West Elm.<br /><br />I really wasn't thinking about the experiment at all though, more about Christmas presents and looking at what was on sale. I walked over to the Christmas tree on display and loved how bright everything was. I ended up picking up a purple butterfly that was clipped on the tree next to the birds and owls and just remember thinking how pretty and different it was. I put it back (figured Id buy it on sale after Christmas!) and walked out, not really thinking about much except that I did not need any more ornaments!<br /><br />While walking briskly down the sidewalk I stopped as it dawned on me-- those were my purple feathers! When I got home I looked up the item online to see what they were made of, just in case I wasn't remembering correctly. Sure enough, under the description, the only thing listed is &#34;purple feathers&#34;.<br /><br />Take it for what you will-- but this was my moment of truth, my a-ha moment.<br /><br />I am working on #4 now...I will keep you all posted!
1936891026|5.0|I saw this author talk about this subject and this book on super Soul Sunday with Oprah Winfrey, and knew I need to read it! It's not just about art which the title might lead you to believe, it is about trying to accomplish something that means a lot to you. I have a couple of things I really want to accomplish in my life and keep hitting a roadblock created by me; now I know why and how to get beyond it.<br /><br />If you can't get out of your own way and accomplish your hearts desire, then you really should read this book. I'll be buying more for Christmas presents!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I am a confessed Grisham fan, but the quality of his books do seem to go up and down.  (I read them all anyway!)<br />This one is definitely on the up side!  A will that opens questions about the past, well done and a page-turner right up to the end.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I am a huge Stargate fan! I wish they could have continued the show- or at least made the third movie. I am glad my oldest child is old enough to watch these with me and can't wait till the other two are old enough too.

B00AECGQF2|5.0|Ok although this is $2.99 it is the best hair game ever. I have searched for four months for a good one but I couldn't find any good free ones. On Thanksgiving I finally restored to using coins for it. It is the best stop I've played at for like four hours the last two days. So even though it is $2.99 totally buy it, out if you don't want to spend money you coins(if you have any).
B009EBLCK8|4.0|Intelligent, creative, comical, and entertaining.  Great show and very fun to watch.  I like that I don't dumber for having watched it.
1451666179|5.0|Phenomenal book!! Allie Brosh is always capable of putting a smile on my face with her writings, no matter how poorly my day is going!  She is hilarious, and has a wonderful way of looking at everything around her and putting it to words (and pictures)

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read this year.  Sanderson masterfully creates both amazing characters and a beautiful world.  The dystopic version of America that he has created is both gorgeous and scary.  The characters, from David, who is the main character, to Steelheart who is the villain, are artfully done.  They draw you in and really get you to care for them or cause you to read in awe of the their immense power and cruelty.<br /><br />The creation of an alternate America, specifically, an alternate Chicago is also both interesting and, at times chillingly familiar.  The book is set in the not so distant future where some lucky few people are gifted with powers ranging from something as mundane as being able to charge a battery to the invincible power of being impervious to bullets and any other projectile.  These people, known as Epics, are believed by some to be the next step in human evolution and by others to be a curse to humankind.  The Epics, for the most part, seem to just to be there to terrorize the villagers.<br /><br />The Reckoners seem to be there to be the equalizer to the Epics.  These guys don't have any powers other than their minds.  They are there to fight back against the Epics.<br /><br />Overall, an amazing novel.  I absolutely loved it and plan to buy a hard copy of it.

B00CE03UOC|2.0|when you pay to unlock ALL level packs, it will give you a bunch of new levels but it will NOT unlock the VIP pack. to do that, you apparently must have a Facebook account so they can spam your friends with unwanted solicitations to spend money on the app themselves. so, really it only unlocks MOST and if you don't have a Facebook, you will not be able to unlock ALL of the levels. Dev, if that inconvenient policy ever changes, let me know via my gmail knmb323). other than that, the game is 5-star.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|It's something new and fresh to the music industry, unlike the cliches you hear on the radio today. Many argue that it doesn't live up to her previous albums, but this always occurs when an artist changes their sound. We don't want to hear music that sounds exactly the same, and this album is exactly what is is: something new.
B008JFUR10|5.0|When I first saw Pacific Rim in theater, I felt like an absolute kid again.  With that said I was big into Godzilla movies, the first being Godzilla 1985.  And even though in the passed years when it comes to giant monsters, let alone giant robot movies, us in America somehow makes them hit and miss.  Godzilla 98' would of been fine if it wasn't called \\"Godzilla\\" rather had its own name, Cloverfield was decent but the idea of the digital camera might be a bit iffy, and must I talk about the live-action Transformers movies?  Pacific Rim is really that one movie that we've been waiting for, it takes out most of the bad and leaves in most of the good of what to expect in giant monster and robot movies.  Though that's not to say there might be some minor problems with the movie you may experience, people say that the narration at the beginning was too long, some say that there's not much action, me I say there's not much to complain.  I actually felt that there was plenty of action, and even though the narration of the beginning might of been a bit long, it at least opens up showing one of the first monsters destroying the Golden Gate Bridge.  Wait a couple more minutes and soon you'll see the first full fight between robots and monsters.  I'm not saying that this movie will be perfect for everyone, but I am saying that this movie was no doubt perfect for me that even if I wanted to complain I couldn't think of one.  I go to movies like Pacific Rim for 2 things, action and destruction, that's all you really need when it comes to giant monster movies, especially ones that take inspiration from Godzilla films.  It does it right, more right than previous entries that's outside of Japan or anywhere from Asia.  If you're still unsure of the movie I at least ask you just give it one chance, this is no doubt a movie I'll enjoy for a long time, and a definite appetizer for the upcoming Godzilla 2014.

B005EIS5IW|2.0|Bought this to see how it worked on my Kindle Fire HD...it was tiny, some of it was hard to read and you couldn't enlarge it.  I was testing &#34;graphic novel&#34; possibilities, guess I won't buy anything more expensive.  As to the content, I've had all kinds of cats all my life, and this just wasn't that funny.  Save your money and your time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Worth every minute.  Held my attention for the entire trilogy.  Highly recommended.  One of the most unique interpretations of post-apocalyptic dystopia I have encountered.  The characters are rich and multi-faceted, and the plot pace is well balanced with detail.  Kudos to Suzanne Collins!
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I didn't go higher with the rating for a couple of reasons. One, the attitude is overwhelming, bordering on insulting cockiness. Two, while most everything in here is correct, some of the shortcuts alter the dish enough that it is no longer what you're supposed to be making. Third, unfortunately a lot of the recipes just plain cost to much in ingredients or call for ingredients that I would use so rarely that it's not worth buying. That said, I have learned more than I thought I would about food, cooking, and myself. Yeah, I think I'll up the rating a star.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun and entertaining, but this nonsense about having to wait to regenerate lives is very disruptive and annoying.  I don't want to puchase &#34;boosters&#34; or additional &#34;turns&#34;.  The game is supposed to be free and I object to having to pay for ANYTHING associated with the game as downloaded.  To my mind, that means the game isn't really free - it's just a come-on to get people to spend money.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I purchased the first season of this series from Amazon based on a recommendation.  Having never heard of it, I didn't have very high expectations - but I've been very surprised by the quality of this series.  If you like the super hero type show, then you'll almost certainly like this.  The plot is good - somewhat &#34;dark&#34; like Batman, though not quite that dark.  The acting is also pretty good.  The episodes have good cliffhangers - you'll always want to watch the next one.  Having read a lot of comic books as a kid, I found I was often thinking about the images and dialog in the comics while watching this (which is a good thing - it felt real while still being true to the spirit of those comics).<br /><br />Parental notes:<br />* They did a good job with keeping the violence to the non-gory type - but there is still a lot of violence and death in this series.<br />* The sexual content isn't explicit but it does condone a promiscuous sexuality that parents should be aware of before giving this to children to watch.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I have always loved to read Dan Brown's books.  I have read many other Dan Brown books and this one rates high as all others do.
B00868AF9O|5.0|When I first discovered it was about auto racing, I almost put it away, but I kept reading.  It's not about car racing.  It's a philosophical treatise on life from a dog's point of view.  His owner just happens to be an auto racer, so he uses racing metaphors because that's all he knows, besides love, loyalty and perseverance.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I've been looking for a great racing game, and this was recommended. It is a great game and graphics. My only concern was that it takes up so much space, and I don't think kindles have a lot of storage space. I had to delete some stuff.
B005BDZN62|5.0|My favorite musical in Blue-Ray so I had to give it 5 stars. But, it should be pointed out that the &#34;extra&#34; DVD with interviews is  disappointing because they they didnt interview leading actors/actresses who are still living.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is a good game. I think that it should be played in happiness. The only thing that would possibly be bad is the fact that everything is choppy, you sometimes glitch on a ride, and it's hard to get money. But it is a good game, it really is. Play it like a gang of a South American country's big cities.  - Max C.M.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|CANT STOP PLAYING EVEN THOUGH IT DOES MY HEAD IN LOVE IT CANDY CRUSH SAGA EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY IT GREAAAAAT
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Thestory line was well developed and moved along quite quickly.  The conclusion to the story was unexpected and was well thought out and delivered well.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|can't believe some of the scenes here Too bad the writers weren't more creative! Done before. stop at admiral loses ship and make your own ending.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I liked playing this game.  Some levels I got stuck on because it was a little more challenging but fun all in all.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I really liked the movie.....great premise, acting, special effects, plot, etc.....but was distracted throughout by Brad Pitt's slovenly appearance and matted, filthy hair. I can understand looking like a homeless derelict when you're portraying one, but when you're supposed to be a happily married, dignified former UN investigator with two sweet, young daughters, for God's sake, take a bath and clean up your act!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: I honestly think Brad could have walked safely among the zombies without the vaccine. Let's face it, if zombies discriminate between victims who are healthy or ill, they are definitely going to avoid one who looks (and probably smells) like he's been dead (and buried) for several days.<br /><br />Again, this was a great movie that provided all sorts of thrills and chills, but it was burdened by the revolting appearance of the 'star'. This became an issue in \\"Legends of the Fall\\", when Brad Pitt's disgusting lack of hygiene was publicly condemned by his cast mates. I guess some actors carry enough weight that they can simply show up and behave any way they want in a movie, like Marlon Brando in \\"Missouri Breaks\\", but when their appearance and behavior begin to seriously detract from the overall performance, it's time to wake up and smell something other than greasy, filthy hair......like roses, maybe.<br /><br />Let the flaming begin.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book And series was amazing. Can't wait for the 3rd movie to come out. I'm so excited. Can't wait for next year
0525953728|5.0|Great Read, exactly what you would expect.  Told in common every day front line language.  I loved the narrative, and the relationships with this guy and his team members.  Very entertaining.  Especially the part about the Good Idea Fairy.
B007REV4YI|1.0|The formula just seems to get really tired this time.  Bond seems older, grizzled, more of a boozer and pill-popper, and yet he's back in action attempting to apprehend a baddie who has one of the most implausible and ridiculous revenge plans ever.  If you watch a film and actually THINK about plot details then this one will bother you.  The ending really pushed the limits of believability, including the well-lit under-the-frozen-lake fight sequence which was both creepy and ridiculous, and the film just ended with a dull anticlimax.  I'm tired of the series with this one..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My children love this application. Great problem solving skills are used along with mental strategies. This skill could be used across the curriculums.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse has all the bells and whistles I found in mice twice the price (ha ha) plus a little tin of weights that can be slid into slots in the mouse to adjust the weight.  I always felt mice were too light, so to be able to make the thing have some heft really was fantastic.  Highly recommended.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I could have given this book one star because of the foul language, but if you have read King's work you know that he generally uses foul language liberally; I never could and still can't understand its necessity. None the less, I gave this book four stars (-1 for language) because it was riveting. I read it over the course of a week... I could not function until I completed it. I wanted to know what happened next, where the next twist would take Jake/George. I knew very little about JFK and if King's research is as he claims, then I learned a thing or two as well. Time travel, romance, suspense...no true &#34;horror&#34;, only realistic scenes in a time-travel kind of way and some tears to boot, even some references to his previous works' characters and settings, all in the brilliance of King's keen mind.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've been using these daily for months, and I highly recommend them.  They sound great, the range is fantastic, and the mic works well.  They're also large enough to wear without them pressing on your ears.
B00CKH9WOQ|3.0|Purchased this item new, box has clear signs of that it has been opened and slight damage on one of the corners. I will be saving the receipt to return this item if the other three I ordered come in the same condition. Will expect untouched product, not something that someone decided to beat it up a bit.
B008US4PBY|5.0|It's not cheap, but it does what it's supposed to flawlessly.  It's got a rather bright LED display.  I accidentally broke the case off when I tipped my PS3 forward, but it snapped back together and never stopped working.

B004EPZ034|5.0|This has got to be the cutest movie...for the whole family. The kids will laugh and so will the adults. It is a fun movie for all.
B00GKS2HN4|1.0|It's a good game and would get 5 stars if random ads didn't constantly pop up as you click around. This gAme easily should have taken 1/2 the time it did but I spent most of the time just exiting the ads and app store
B00013RC8O|4.0|This movie has two versions. The U.S. edition cuts out some great scenes. The U.K. version contains the much-talked-about Charlotte Rampling segment. The disc sold here has the U.K. edition on the back side. Flip it over and enjoy the original movie.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Great series! Dvd's came quickly and we had no problems with the DVDs. My daughter is hooked on Pretty Little Liars

B00AH3DCAA|5.0|I've worn this watch every day for three of four years now. I'm pretty rough on watches but this Invicta has worn well. It has a Swiss automatic movement, and looks and feels great. It's very comfortable on my wrist and keeps pretty accurate time. The only thing I don't like is that the paint on the black chrono dial now shows a few scratches Otherwise, it's as good as the day I bought it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|What a beautifully written book. It held my interest until the very end. I was so ready to read a book that did not have weird characters, or leave me wondering how an author could dream up such a odd tail. This one kept me in that wonderful land of expectancy and always wanting to come back for more. Hate it had to end, but what a beautiful ending!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This is a classic family movie and one of my favorite characters was the &#34;Child Catcher&#34; of course....&#34;come out children. I know your here somewhere?&#34;......&#34;lollipops, ice cream, cherry pie, treacle tarts and all free today!&#34; I grew up watching this movie and even though my tastes have grown to include many other genres, &#34;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&#34; is worthy to be added to your collection. Do it today!
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|The first movie was very much the best of the trilogy.  That being said, if you have seen the first two, you gotta give this one a look.  It has funny parts but I couldn't give it any more than an okay rating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun!!!!!! And I'll let you in on a secret you get a prize pod every day if you complete 3simple task in 24hours.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|A great movie for the whole family.  I enjoy movies with action that we can watch as a family.  The Marvel Comics movies seem to fit this need.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works seamlessly with iPad and tv. Easy install and no waiting for product to start streaming.  No problems and is intuitive to work
B00G32OER4|2.0|This movie lacks a lot of things. With Vera Farmiga's (Up In The Air, Dummy) and Lili Taylor's (I Shot Andy Warhol, Julie Johnson) involvement in this project, I assumed I was buying into a pleasurable viewing experience. Boy. Was I wrong. I was suckered into waiting until the painful end for these acting dynamos to throw out some sparks, but, I had no joy.  The plot is far-fetched, the acting is disconnected and uninspired, and the script is plain rehashed BOREDOM from other paranormal, dime-a-dozen flops save for the supposedly really scary ghost which *yawn* reminded me of the witch hag from Army of the Dead...only way less entertaining. Also, while the \\"Here a clap, there a clap\\" angle was intriguing in the previews, trust me when I tell you that the pay-off was not.  Just like World War Z, if you watch the movie previews or the trailer, you have pretty much watched the entire film. Ending on a somewhat positive note: Skip this one unless you just wanna see the Town Sheriff roll up to the haunted house in a sweet Mustang. The chronologically correct clothing and hairdos are a hoot too! Kudos to the individual(s)responsible for makeup,wardrobe and props.
B003XU7IFY|4.0|Nearly 20 years old and speaks loudly to today's political and economic problems. It doesn't provide a prescription for solving them but the reader comes away with a new perspective on the way governments and corporations work -- and for whom.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Great story! Depraved and debaucherous as it is, extremely entertaining. A first hand look for finance junkies into the crazy nineties
B00EAI9CSY|3.0|nice twist on the vampire theme. the title did not belong in my view, it had nothing to do with the movie except where they stayed.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|This movie is a classic.  If you like cult films, sci fi, or adventure flicks this is a fun movie to watch.  I also love the inventive creature designs, atmosphere, and quirky humor.  2 thumbs up!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|the CG stuff was awesome. the story yet another take on how superman came about, still a good movie, i just wanted more action than story
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I thought this book was really well written. The imagery used to spark your imagination was impeccable! The author knows how to tell a story and to keep you interested. I would recommend this book to anyone from their teens to thirties.
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Jennifer Aniston is a great actor, but her as a stripper was hard to believe, everything else about the move was great. very funny..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first and decided to give the book a try. Easy to read, good YA book. Story moves along quickly. Excited to finish the series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play. No glitches that I've found. Offers different play options. The adds are lame but it's a free game.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I LOVED this series but I hated the end. It would have gotten 5 stars if Veronica Roth would've kept Tris and Tobias together. But otherwise best books ever.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|The explosion scene was a good read. However, the rest felt like that long cross country drive listening to your mother-in-law's boring &#34;long story short&#34; endless rants.<br /><br />I found it difficult to stay engaged. The story left my mind wondering on other things causing me to have to go back and read again. My stubborn ways is the only thing that got me through this long and repetitive drug high.<br /><br />Cut out the fat, I want the meat. This 800 page book can easily be trimmed down to under 500. Yeesh!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Awesome game but can't sign in to Facebook. Pretty cool characters besides the ones from the movie. Roll tide roll
B008JFUO36|3.0|Oblivion(released April/13)stars,among others,Tom Cruise,Olga Kurylenko,Andrea Riseborough,Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.Oblivion is certainly a different film,and Cruise is back doing what he does best;playing the intense,somber but conflicted role we know him to o so well.While he and co stars have a lot to say and do,the ultra long story has just far too much to tell,as it jumps from one narrative to another and back again.It unfortunately drags the film down and us with it.<br />Speaking of which,we find ourselves in the year 2070.Earth is in total shambles and our hero is living high above the Earth with his female counterpart.They are singly manning the maintenance and security of the planet after its devastation involving a global conflict with aliens some 60 years before.There are gigantic water sucking machines that provide needed energy for the Earth colony on the moon of Titan,the largest of Saturn's moons.To aid the pair in their tasks are drones,round flying machines that help the pair cover the long distances involved in their jobs.They are monitored constantly from the &#34;Tet&#34;,a gigantic space ship,which is the transition platform for those heading from Earth to Titan.In fact Cruise and his colleague are due to leave their posts in two weeks,barring any complications.<br />Cruise has been bombarded for ages by memories of a woman he met on top of the Empire State building.One day they pick up a transmission coming from the top of that same building;the rest of which is buried deep beneath in the ground.He investigates to find out it has been deliberately programmed for transmission into space and for coordinates in a zone on Earth where there is no known life to speak of.Cruise cuts the signal,but shortly there after a space craft falls from the sky.Upon his arrival at the crash site he manages to rescue a woman from a stasis tube.A drone,also dispatched to the area from the Tet,kills the remaining survivors,much to his chagrin.The woman,as it turns out,is the self same one from Cruise's dreams.<br />Cruise returns the tube to his habitat high above the Earth.They bring the woman back to life and interrogate her as best they can.Her main concern is getting the flight recorder from her crashed ship.Reluctantly Cruise takes her planet side and both get taken prisoners by Scavengers,or Scavs for short.It is these people that Cruise has been told were of alien origin and the ones that still sabotage their equipment.The Scavs however have a different story to tell.They are not of alien origin but human,and have been fighting the real aliens for years;the ones from the Tet who invaded Earth originally.They(the Scavs)want to send a destructive device into the Tet and blow it up,but they need Cruise to program a drone for them.When he refuses they send him and the woman he revived back into the wilderness to find answers in a radiation zone no one has been able to enter.Along the way the two stop at the Empire State Building again where the woman rekindles his memories further,only to find she is his wife.Cruise's partner has sent his ship back down to him and sees the two in an embrace.When Cruise returns to the habitat she refuses his entry and reports him to their superiors.This has the effect of unleashing a special drone underneath the habitat which first kills Cruise's colleague then turns on him.He is saved by his wife.<br />The two flee but get pursued by three drones.Cruise manages to eliminate the three but not before he crash lands in the so called radiation zone.There his wife gets seriously wounded and  he finds out there are more caretakers like himself.In fact he witnesses one land and perform maintenance on a drone.It is in fact a clone of himself.While Cruise's official number is 49,this one's is 52.Cruise kills the clone,returns to the clone's habitat#52,greets his former colleague(obviously a clone also),and returns to Earth with a med kit to help save his wife's life.Armed with thisnew knowledge Cruise and his wife return to the Scavs and agree to help them defeat the aliens.Before they can get a programmed drone up and fling with the installed nuclear device,they are attacked by three more clones.Many people are killed,and its leader seriously wounded.The only option now is to take the bomb up to the Tet personally.Cruise puts his wife back into the stasis tube and blasts off to take her back to the Tet.Along the way he listens to the flight recorder which brings back more memories from his former life.Cruise now knows it was he who led the original expedition to Titan but was side tracked to investigate the Tet.Cruise ejected the stasis tubes on board before his ship was sucked into the Tet.The aliens then cloned Cruise and what would become his female colleague.The aliens sent thousands of Cruises to Earth to destroy the human population and left a few behind to tend to the planet destroying water devices.<br />Cruise manages to enter the heart of the Tet.When he opens the stasis tube it is the leader of the Scavs.Both Cruise and he detonate the bomb together destroying the aliens.Fast forward two years and Cruises wife and their daughter are now living in a remote cabin on Earth Cruise had built prior to his death.Out of some brush across a lake arrives some Scavs and Cruise,but the numbered 52 clone,the one we thought Cruise had killed.It seems his memories had been awakened by Cruise#49 and his wife's presence and he had been searching for her ever since.<br />There is much more to this plot,but as you can tell,it is long and very involved and we are taken back and forth,from one story to a back story,and back again and on and on.There are certainly some head scratching moments as when we get fooled by Freeman's presence in the Tet,and clone#52's appearance at the end as he&#34;reunites&#34; with his wife.Also when we view the back story and see Cruise eject the stasis tubes from his ship which is getting sucked into the Tet,we must ask:why wasn't the ejected section also sucked into the ship?Cruise has tried everything in his power to get out of the TET's grip and failed,but an ejecting part of the ship miraculously could break away of its own power? Hmmm.And there is also the question of clones,as in how many more were out there with latent memories of Cruises wife and when they came searching what would they do when they found their wife? Hmmmm.Questions,questions and more questions,with no answers.Or should I say a lot of plot holes that are quite deep?You decide.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include three featurettes,deleted scenes and commentary.<br />All in all while a nice looking film,it is more style without substance.Its long and involved plot gets you clock watching part way through and wriggling in your seat.This film is unfotunately not the sum of its parts.Nice try,but no cigars.3 -3 1/2 stars.new knowledge Cruise and his wife return to the Scavs and agree to help them defeat the aliens.Before they can get a programmed drone up and fling with the installed nuclear device,they are attacked by three more clones.Many people are killed,and its leader seriously wounded.The only option now is to take the bomb up to the Tet personally.Cruise puts his wife back into the stasis tube and blasts off to take her back to the Tet.Along the way he listens to the flight recorder which brings back more memories from his former life.Cruise now knows it was he who led the original expedition to Titan but was side tracked to investigate the Tet.Cruise ejected the stasis tubes on board before his ship was sucked into the Tet.The aliens then cloned Cruise and what would become his female colleague.The aliens sent thousands of Cruises to Earth to destroy the human population and left a few behind to tend to the planet destroying water devices.<br />Cruise manages to enter the heart of the Tet.When he opens the stasis tube it is the leader of the Scavs.Both Cruise and he detonate the bomb together destroying the aliens.Fast forward two years and Cruises wife and their daughter are now living in a remote cabin on Earth Cruise had built prior to his death.Out of some brush across a lake arrives some Scavs and Cruise,but the numbered 52 clone,the one we thought Cruise had killed.It seems his memories had been awakened by Cruise#49 and his wife's presence and he had been searching for her ever since.<br />There is much more to this plot,but as you can tell,it is long and very involved and we are taken back and forth,from one story to a back story,and back again and on and on.There are certainly some head scratching moments as when we get fooled by Freeman's presence in the Tet,and clone#52's appearance at the end as he&#34;reunites&#34; with his wife.Also when we view the back story and see Cruise eject the stasis tubes from his ship which is getting sucked into the Tet,we must ask:why wasn't the ejected section also sucked into the ship?Cruise has tried everything in his power to get out of the TET's grip and failed,but an ejecting part of the ship miraculously could break away of its own power?

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Such an amazing book by Grisham, yet again. I highly recommend it! Be ready to feel every emotion as you stay glued to every page.
140006922X|1.0|This book seems to present quite a biased outlook at the historical jesus. Aslan engagement with the majority of good work out there is really poor. Many of his quotation are a product of his \\"eisegesis\\" of other people's work.
B00DBOF5Q6|4.0|Describes survival and heartache in honest terms. It's not a book about heroes but human beings who are asked to endure unimaginable suffering. Highly recommended.
1616550414|5.0|This is the most beautiful gift Nintendo could have given to Zelda fans the world over. The level of detail, the concept art, the early versions of many characters, the ideas behind the designing of the games: it is a fascinating and invaluable look inside the spirit and mind of one of the greatest series in the history of videogames. The section on Twilight Princess is brilliant!
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|It was surprisingly captivating from start to finish.  I only recall one curse word, and there was no nudity!  The unexpexted surprises was too much for my six year old.  He didn't make it past the 2nd scene of the movie when one of the air mates jumped in front of the camera screen out of nowhere.  But, if you can handle the out of nowhere surprises, suspense, drama and breathtaking violence of alien creature vs. man's survival, then by all means, this is the movie to see! Definitely great movie for Sci-fi enthusiasts, and can be appropriate for elementary students 8 & up depending on your child.  My husband and I watched the movie first before we decided if appropriate or not...which was no big deal to go upstairs with my six year old and read him one of his favorite books!
B000HZGBLA|5.0|All I can say is that I wish Angelina Jolie had made more of these films. Yes, they aren't the highest quality movies, but they are fun to watch.  And, even if the plot and the acting gets bad you can fall back on the many qualities of the leading actress.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Great movie for the entire family. I love it & so does my 7 year old. Perfect for relaxing and just enjoying a great movie!

0141394811|5.0|Finally an opportunity to &#34;find out for yourself.&#34; He is candid, and that is what you hope for in an autobiography. Could it use editing and chapters? Maybe, but it does not and this adds to some of his major overall points and it is his book; get over it.  Will you get restless at times? Maybe. Are you looking for a linear and legendary narrative and hoping to critique based in your expectations? If so, stop and ask yourself if you know anything or wish to know anything about him. In the end, he tells us why &#34;you are so sick and tired,&#34; why fame can be fatal, and where he is today.  Themes: conspiracies surround him ALWAYS; abuse and schooling; preoccupation with mortality and body image; redemption and evidence of it; legend status immortality; social justice and hypocrisy (governance, music industry, food sector).

B003G4W49C|3.0|I honestly did like this book, and I got through it quickly. I enjoyed the action in the story and the cleverness of the characters. The ending, though, gave me a sense of finality. It doesn't really make me want to read the next books, even though it is obvious that more happens after the story finishes. The book all together was good though, not my favorite, but it's definitely worth reading.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game but I experienced some bugs and some other things like when you crash a hoverboard, it destroys coins! a bug I experienced was I came down onto a jump with coins and I jumped, but the coins went into a big pile and I missed all of them! plz fix this Kiloo then I will rate 5 stars.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I told my students all about a book that uses teenagers dying of cancer to twach us about living life. Quirky, yet accesible chatacters who deal with, and not gloss over pain make the reader want to find out what happens next. Also, unlike most YA novels, the parents are three dimensional with plausible reactions to heart wrenching struggles. This book has no superheros, paving the way for any kid to be one....
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|You should play the game because I am knocking out a bunch of robots in realsteel. I am busy playing the game right know and i just nocked out a robot.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It is a great entertaining game but it very frequently deletes data that I already had done (very annoying)but other than that It is a great game but I hope that fix this
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's just wonderful. Rich dialogue, spot on acting and location. Beautiful backgrounds. It's perfectly subtle. Characters are very well fleshed out.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|This game is fun and a good way to spend time<br /><br />WARNING:Highly addictive<br /><br />You should get this app if you were thinking about getting it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I was really hoping that this game would come out for mobile, and now it has! It's even better than I imagined it would be! Great graphics and the gameplay is so much fun that you'll end up playing for hours. It does take a while to install and also takes up some space, but it's COMPLETELY worth it in my opinion!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Awesome mouse. Very responsive, and the buttons feel like they are in natural places and they are very easy to reach. The 2 profiles that are stored in the mouse are very useful because you can have a gaming profile and a regular PC use profile. The software is not too shabby. I find all the programmable options very useful. For example, my regular PC use profile has all the keys programmed as Google chrome hotkeys to open tabs, switch between them, and go back and forth between pages. The only issue I had was the color changing randomly on two occasions but that's not a big deal since you can just go back in and change it back quite easily. (and I wish the mouse wheel and DPI lights would change color too, oh well!)<br /><br />Another great thing about this mouse is the macro record and play buttons. I didn't even realize what they were until I was playing Battlefield and I accidentally pressed the macro play button and my fully auto gun burst fired. Turns out I clicked the macro record button earlier and clicked fire 3 times so now macro play burst fires on my gaming profile. :) VERY COOL!<br /><br />I feel like I got a $100 gaming mouse for a third of the price so I am very happy and very satisfied with my purchase!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thus game helps me relax and forget about my stressors that have happened during the day. Never been much for television never been much good at games amazing I have gotten this far. What amazing fun
B00EHMG358|4.0|just regular, nothing special, good for killing time, what makes the series and protagonist so captivating is amiss in this latest book
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This is one good game. That's it it could have some better perks like 3 or so revives and more coins. And I think of this as constructive criticism for I am a buyer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|One of the best games I have but it's sometimes very hard to play. I get to the point of winning and run out of lives.
B000PC0U1W|4.0|Remember remember the fifth of November<br />  Gunpowder, treason and plot.<br />I see no reason why gunpowder, treason<br />  Should ever be forgot...<br /><br />In a future society a caricature of a totalitarian state, a young lady's eyes are opened to its reality; but the story is actually about the interaction between the protagonist \\"V\\" (Hugo Weaving) and the lady, Evey (Natalie Portman.)<br /><br />It is not just straight forwarded anti-government it deals with a cabal.<br /><br />As we travel their path we too may have our eyes opened.<br /><br />I like the inclusion of the sound track of \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" appropriately placed.<br /><br />I have watched this movie several times each time picking up on something subtle enough to evade the first viewing.<br /><br />\\"Ideas are bullet proof\\"
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I haven't read anything like this ever. Such a unique writing style and an amazing story. I'm glad I read the book instead of just watching the movie.
B008JFURKG|5.0|Naturally the first in a series is good because it is new. It is not easy to top the first. However it happens now and then.<br /><br />This is the further adventures of ex-CIA Frank Moses and crew. We have some new friends and meat old ones that we never expected to survive to be in (Retired and Extremely Dangerous) &quot;RED 2.&quot;<br /><br />This time a nuclear device has been misplaced and it is being pinned on Frank (Bruce Willis) and his old pal Marvin (John Malkovich).  Frank has to figure out who is who with the world full of terrorists, assassins, and corrupt government Officials.  This time they are not alone; Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) is just itching for more excitement in her domestic environment.<br /><br />Watch the movie as see if she gets the excitement she and we crave.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|loads of fun...but lame that you have to wait for friends to send you tickets to advance in the game.  as if its not hard enough to get past some levels as it is.... ugh
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very convenient in keeping me informed about temperatures (I need to know when it will freeze!)  It is also very dense, opening up to pages and pages of meteorological information and events happening locally and around the world, much more entertaining than I ever expected!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I didn't purchase the movie on Amazon, but I watched it recently, so I'll make this short.  Old Boy is as weird and as twisted as anything you'll see but it's to my liking a &#34;masterpiece.&#34;  Let's just hope the American version (when it comes out in the next few months) doesn't destroy the brilliance of this unique work.  Please watch this before you see the American version or don't see the American version at all.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|I was warned about the slow start, but I had no idea how long it would take for this to pick up. Once it starts going, look out! There is definitely a twist here. It's not your usual story. If you are into psychological thrillers, you will probably like it. The acting is decent (other than the awkward lesbian make-out scene). The story is intriguing. Everything looks natural enough that you feel this could have happened somewhere. That's the kind of story I like.
1455525839|4.0|Pendergast must rescue young Corrie Swenson again.  In this one a story told by Oscar Wilde to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle sets the stage for the whole book.  Corrie comes across this story in Doyle's diary and gets an idea for writing her thesis.  This takes her to Roaring Fork, Colorado where she immediately winds up in jail, and is facing a long prison term.  It is obvious that the powers of the town want her research squelched and are hiding a big secret.  On top of that there is a serial arsonist setting mansions in Roaring Fork on fire.<br /><br />It is up to Pendergast to get Corrie out of her jam and to help her solve the mysteries of Roaring Fork.  on top of that he needs to try to calm down Corrie's stubborn behavior and pig-headedness which keeps getting her into dangerous situations.  There is a lot of tense moments and the story is written in a very crisp manner that never gets boring.  The authors even have an &#34;unpublished&#34; Doyle Sherlock Holmes tale that reads a lot like the author's own style.<br /><br />This is not the best Pendergast tale but it is a very good one.  I give it 4 stars.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I have two of these excellent monitor arms, side by side.  My monitors float above my desk, keeping the surface free for what I need it. I can move them if I need to, up and down, left and right, turn them 90°. They are easy to install, and look nice.  What more is there to ask for?  One of them I've had for a years, and it is still going strong.  I highly recommend this product.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|EPIC. I get to a point when i am so overwhelmed by what is happening i have to put my ereader down for a minute and just enjoy what i have read. Highly recommend these books.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|It is a good way to entertain a young child for about an hour. All you have to do is hand them your phone with this app and occasionally restart it if the child turns it off.

0316204366|2.0|I've been a Gladwell fan for years and had the release date for David and Goliath marked on my calendar.  His prior books; The Tipping Point, Outliers and Blink are books that are hard to put down once you pick them up.  Unfortunately finishing David and Goliath felt like a chore, it took effort to finish. I kept hoping to find some Gladwell magic as I read, it just never materialized.  The book is well researched and professionally written but the conclusions are a stretch and they are supported by questionable statistics.  I highly recommend his earlier books but unfortunately David and Goliath is an \\"Outlier\\" that doesn't live up to the excellence that we have come to expect from Malcolm Gladwell.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun app. The feeding the jumping the games. The horse has great character. The paddock games are fun as well.  I would recommend this to other users.
055358894X|3.0|3.45 stars.  The overall plot (because of its twists and turns) and characters are superb, with the central character, Locke Lamora, being especially entertaining. He is both brilliant and hilarious.<br /><br />This book primarily is hampered by a lack of energy.  Until the end of the book, the stakes seem small, and the book is generally low on excitement.  For the most part, it felt like reading about a great chess match.  Even the city itself, which is well described, seems relatively insignificant, despite the fact that it is effectively a Venice dominated by five magical skyscrapers.  Some scenery descriptions were confusing and difficult to imagine, e.g., a box-like building called Echo Hole.<br /><br />A lesser complaint concerns unanswered questions with no hint about future answers.  Who erected the Elderglass sculptures?  What happened to them?  There is little development of &#34;big&#34; story arcs.  There is no hint that our central characters will have a future role in truly &#34;big&#34; things on a national or world scale.<br /><br />Regardless, I intend to read the entirety of the series if, for no other reason, because I want to see all the creative ways in which Lamora insults people.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was paid to buy this app. And I always wanted it for a lower price. This is great.word, PowerPoint, and excel are included.

B008OOYALE|5.0|Wonderful. The game is addicting and great. So many combinations of dragons and they look more real the bigger they grow.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I read this book years ago. I saw it in my list of previously-purchased books and decided to give it another go. Really glad I did. It is such an enjoyable read. I had forgotten most of the twists and turns and the delightful little details about the quirky places Neil Gaimann references throughout the story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved Mockingjay!  Great ending to a great trilogy!  Read The Hunger Games way back when it first came out--read about it in TIME. Finally took time to finish the trilogy after seeing Catching Fire the other day.  Great series!

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This is a great genesis movie that takes the Bond fan back to the &#34;original&#34; beginning. Sam Mendes does a good job of making this movie a more sophisticated action movie rather than simply an action movie. Daniel Craig seems to be coming into the part, the overall acting is strong by everyone in the cast, and it has great cinematography.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is really fun I love how it is like taking care of a real horse
B004AUHWLQ|5.0|I love this movie! Jack Lemon is a terrific actor. He is charming and funny and can hold the show on his own. He and Shirley MacLain have a wholesome chemistry that is believable. I love that this movie is somewhat racy, in its own way, for that period of time. And, of course, Billy Wilder is the best.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|All the comments about nudity are silly. It's just a scene to set the tone for the reckless lifestyle the pilot is living. Besides, Nadine Velazquez is quite beautiful in that scene.<br /><br />There are so many, but here are a few of my favorite scenes:<br /><br />The lead up to the crash. &#34;We're gonna roll it.&#34; Washington and Brian Geraghty were brilliant in that. Washington for his cool control and Geraghty for his aghast yet still maintaining professionalism and executing commands.<br /><br />Harling Mays enters the hospital ward. Classic modern day pusher. Bling, blending in. Seeing Goodman with Washington brought back memories of &#34;Fallen.&#34; You hate that cocaine is what makes them &#34;buddies&#34; in Flight, yet there is something about their relationship that also feels good. You know they have each others back.<br /><br />The hospital stairway scene with Washington, Kelly Reilly and James Badge Dale were great in that unusual scene. Dale philosophizing as a dying man was really thought provoking. His insight into why they had &#34;accidentally&#34; converged in that stairwell proved to be key to the rest of what happened in the move.<br /><br />Washington pays unexpected visit to his ex wife's home. Great scene showing how a drunk no longer processes decorum properly. Washington thinks he is being a great dad in that scene, but has actually brought terror into that home. I almost felt sorry for Washington in that scene. I knew he was lost when I saw it. Of course, like a good alcoholic, seconds later he was giving a sentimental statement to the press that indeed garnered sympathy.<br /><br />All the scenes with Kelly Reilly. Great actress. The British actresses Georgia peach accent was awesome.The real fun was racking my brain trying to figure out who the heck she was. I nearly kicked over the table when &#34;Caroline Bingley&#34; popped into my brain. Yeah, she plays a fairly raunchy character in the beginning, but there is still something pure about her and that plays out well in the final scenes.<br /><br />Washington finds the stash of booze in the adjoining hotel suite. Like a lot of viewers, I really prayed on that one hoping he wouldn't mess up the effort at staying sober. The long focus on that lone tiny bottle of destruction and then his hand swooping in to grab it was great cinema.<br /><br />Washington with Reilly outside her new job. Really a nice, hopeful, scene, but when she mentions the AA meeting, you know things are about to go downhill.<br /><br />The hearing scene with &#34;Miss Block.&#34; All the great men sitting there waiting for Washington to put them back in secure positions. The press waiting to confirm him a bona fide &#34;hero&#34; but his love and respect for all of the women in the movie, especially Trina, Nicole and Margaret, overcomes him and he decides it's &#34;now or never.&#34; Again, I was left a bit dismayed thinking about all the effort that had gone into patching things up for him, but the overriding thought was that him taking himself out of the sky with lives in his hands at the controls of jet airplanes was the right thing to do, despite the appearance that that is not why he did it.<br /><br />Overall, a 5 star movie for me because it was just so very different than any movie I've ever seen. Very entertaining and thought provoking.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|The game is great and the graphics are great for a kindle but the game can be a bit laggy and is difficult to control at times.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This is a great introductory game to those bored with Milton Bradley, et al. However, being one of the older European board games, it suffers from several serious flaws. The dice provide for too much randomness (you can solve this using 36 cards from 2 poker decks, using 2-Q to represent the probabilities of 2-12, with 2 Jokers to cause re-shuffles), and it's too easy to get boxed in and locked down. Additionally, once you are clearly ahead of everyone else, it can become very difficult to actually win, since everyone will simply stop trading with you.<br /><br />I do NOT recommend buying ANY of the expansions (save perhaps the 5-6 player expansion for the original game), as they add needless complexity without making the game any more fun. Move on to newer and better designed games rather than investing in the seemingly endless expansions to this dated classic.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Love this album!<br />To be honest, I've allllllmost lost some faith in Eminem's stuff since Relapse. Not that they were \\"bad\\" or anything, It's just that the fun elements in his songs seemed to be missing there... The Marshall Mathers LP2, however, has it back!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great set of Indiana Jones on Blu-ray ,picture quality is very good on most of the DVDs and I do not have any real complaints on this set. These are excellent  movies  and I think most people will like this release on Blu ray,it comes in a nice case too for the DVDs.
0312360266|1.0|Wow, this was awful.  I should have listened to the reviewers who said the heroine of this book is annoying.  Also the writing is terrible, redundant, and full of cliches and stereotypes.  The plot is transparent and silly.  Go read Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead instead for your vampire fix.  Those books are ten thousand times better than this book.

1439138311|3.0|Brooklyn is the story of a young Irish woman who immigrated to the Borough of Churches in the fall of 1951.  The immigrant, Eilis Lacey, is an actor in a new life scripted by others. Her name, a distinctly Irish one, is pronounced Aye-LEESH.<br /><br />Eilis did not know about the Holocaust, which the bookstore owner in Manhattan in the story found remarkable.  However, Ireland was neutral during World War II.  Her ignorance is not much different from Americans today who do not know that the Ottomans practiced ethnic cleansing on the Armenians around the time of World War I.<br /><br />The Irish economy was subject to the effects of wartime dislocation, but politically, Ireland stayed out of the Second World War.  In some ways, the Irish considered Germany the enemy of their enemy, England.  A short post-war boom masked structural problems with the Irish economy that created a balance of payments problem by 1950.  Britain subsidized its farmers, cutting British demand for Irish produce, and throwing the Irish economy into a recession. Without an industrial base, little work was available for thousands of young people coming of age.  Ireland lost approximately 15% of its population in the exodus, primarily young adults like Eilis Lacey.  Many moved to England or to existing Irish communities in the northeast United States.<br /><br />America faced structural problems of a different kind.  A good way to remember the issues in America is to use the mnemonic PET: population, exodus, and television.  Cities like Brooklyn faced changing demographics, an exodus to the suburbs, and an increased reliance of Americans on television for entertainment.  Such elements were written into the story.  Eilis receives an assignment from her bosses at the department store that specifically caters to new kinds of customers.  Her boyfriend Tony and his family purchased land in Long Island, with the intention of building homes for their own use.  Life, as depicted in the novel, was as itwas before the proliferation of television.<br /><br />What was a bit disappointing to this Brooklynite was the lack of specifics related to Brooklyn of the 1950s.  There was relatively little color provided in the trip that Eilis made with Tony to Ebbets Field to see the Dodgers play the Giants.  There was no mention of the Sym-phony or Hilda Chester.  We do learn that the story was situated in 1952.  Bobby Thomson's famous home run against the Dodgers occurred during the three-game playoffs that concluded the regular season of 1951, where the Dodgers and Giants finished in a tie for first place.  The Bums got their revenge on Thomson, the Jints, and the rest of the National League winning the pennant the following season.<br /><br />Nor is there any color in the visit to Coney Island.  Eilis and Tony could have gone to any public beach and the scene could have been described the same way.  The scenes at Brooklyn College were also generic ones.  The Bartocci's department store that hired Eilis could have been one of several in downtown Brooklyn: Martins, Mays, or Abraham & Strauss.<br /><br />Colm Toibin uses a philosophy common with game shows on television to keep the reader engaged.  Every once in a while the reader wants to knock some sense into Eilis, just as television viewers want to yell at the contestant who guessed the wrong curtain or missed an easy quiz question.  She has a `people pleasing' personality who floats adrift according to the currents of others.  If Ms. Fortini tried anything else in the scene where Eilis was trying on bathing suits for a trip to the beach with Tony, we might have had a repeat of the famous scene in [[ASIN:0812978188 Ragtime]] between Evelyn Nesbitt and Emma the Red.<br /><br />Did anyone else believe there was a typo on page 37 of the novel?  Jack says, `Why I'm in change of the inventory is that I came recommended by a friend of the boss.' Jack must have meant he was in charge of the inventory.<br /><br />One typo is hardly a reason to be critical of Brooklyn, but the author's lack of first-hand knowledge with the Borough during the 1950s qualifies. A reader could also wonder why more assertive and interesting characters, such as Rose Lacey or Jack Lacey, are passed over by the narration in favor of the baby tomato of the family.  You just want to squash her and say, `[[ASIN:B005T5MYXC Catch up]].'
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|I love the first part and couldn't wait for the second part to come out and now the third part has finally arrived
B00APAS1MY|4.0|A quick read. Advice on life from the ages - as always easier said than done. Some passages were good, others I found a bit difficult to follow. He's written better.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I love the choreography, the scenes were beautiful loved the fights in the air with the choppers  and the flying birds
B006TF6WAM|4.0|An usual story with a few twists along the way. Once you accept the premise then the story flows quite well. I thought a couple of things were too unrealistic, but hey it is fiction. Worth reading.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very fun! This game keeps your brain on it's toes!  You'll play it for hours on end! So free up time to play this addictive game.
B00FQMVCEA|2.0|We were so disappointed with this movie :(  Everything about this story was contrived and unoriginal. My 2 year old who is enthralled with anything that 'goes', and LOVES Mater Tall Tales and enjoys cars left the room after the first 30 mins. My 6 year-old (who usually begs me to buy every movie we rent) and 3.5 year old were not very impressed either, but at least watched the whole thing. Mad at myself for not following my rule to always rent first. Silly me assumed it would be at least approaching the quality of a Disney Pixar movie.<br />I highly recommend renting this one before buying.<br />(Small side note, as an adult who has watched several Dane Cook movies, I just couldn't reconcile Dane's voice as the kind and moral hero in a children's movie. Also didn't enjoy several adult aimed jokes that were borderline inappropriate, and really disliked a scene where Dusty lands at one of the stops at what appears to be a bar and the barmaid says something along the lines of &#34;You are sad. Drink.&#34; Seriously? What kind of values are they promoting there. Soooo disappointed :( )
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great story! It's hard to keep from doing a marathon and watching them all at once. Kinda like buying a box of chocolate...
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This game is addictive...couldn't wait to get back to it after HAVING to put it down.<br />I enjoyed the story line, graphics very good, finding the many needed objects and having to go back added to the adventure of the game. Not making it to easy is good. Having the ( hint and map) options is a good choice to include. I played the easy option and enjoyed it...Will probably play a more difficult one in a few days.<br />Thanks for a great mystery-adventure-fantasy game.
B005T87QCI|5.0|The game is pretty fun but after you complete the entire game it get boring and there is nothing that you can do because you complete ed it
B004YOEFG8|3.0|As a documentary goes, it is informative but do not buy this DVD if you are looking for good 3D space images, this is about the telescope, not images, there is no real need for this documentary to be in 3D.
B0015AARJI|4.0|nice
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game so much its getting kind of expensive to plat! Is there a support group called game players anonymous? Fun game for sure!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the story. The author did throw in several 50¢ words that I found unnecessary but it was a good book. Wasn't expecting the outcome.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|The Product itself is of strong and light design.  But why the low rating?  This item has little place for any sort of professional use.  Outside of skate videos, I find that this item sits in the closet.  Even Music Videos find little use.  Great design but it's like portable DVD players -- sounds like a good idea on paper but you have other items that can achieve a higher / practical use.
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|traditional and back to the way things were before  now country became out of kilter. we need more Merle, Dwight, Buck... and Vince!  Great album!
B004DSX5B6|3.0|I work in TV Production, so I absolutely need items that I can use quickly and effectively.  I decided to venture from the land of the leathermans' and test this badboy.<br /><br />This is actually a durable design. Not Cheap and I love the grip on the handle (unlike Leathermans).  Now here are my problems with it:<br />- Flat Head's width is super thin.  When I had to screw in camera accessories, I had to use the bottom open to tighten because the base is at least longer to compensate for the thin width.<br />- Phillips is thin. Again, same problem.<br />- Scissors are mediocre.  Nominal cutting at best.<br />- Heavy / Bulky.  Really doesn't slide in your pockets that well (I don't use stupid holsters).  Since, I can't rock in my jeans/pants, I put in my jacket.  However, if you have to run and you have pockets that don't zipper down, it can actually fly out of any straps or button pockets.  Fairly clunky.<br /><br />The design is solid and feels great in your hands.  So if you have a job that isn't deadline driven, this item will work great for you.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Very cleverly written with layers of crafty, creepy, twisted family revelations! Families are complicated and so is the past - some wounds never really heal.  Gillian Flynn pushes the boundaries of abnormal and takes a peek into the things that can really happen behind closed doors.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is no ordinary arcade hunting game. It immerses you into the thrill of the hunt. You can't just shoot like any typical video game. There is technique and strategy involved and it keeps you interested. It's one of the more fun and lasting fun, FREE games I've played. Very cool indeed!
160774418X|4.0|It is a great cookbook but I better appreciated the beauty, creativity and easy use of recipes of his 1st two books, Jerusalem and Plenty.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Would definitely recommend to friends. As you progress it gets better. The rules are more like the way professional players play once you advance to higher levels.
0694003611|5.0|A classic every baby must receive for a gift. I now order this from Amazon for any baby gift that I need to send out of state. My children are adults now but I still remember saying &#34;hush&#34;.
B00GINENG0|4.0|This is an interesting and fun game to play with any type of liking you have. I recommend this game to any one who likes to talking Tom.
B00004YX39|4.0|what is there to say, you know you love Steely Dan. this is a great album from an incredible band
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't understand what all the rave about this game was until today when I actually played it for the 1st time. I love it!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Great gift for the SOA fan.<br />Must have for the collector and die hard who wants to add to their collection
141694737X|5.0|Excellent book for children early on!  My grandsons totally loved it for a long time.  They still like to re-visit it.  It's the flip that they love!!!
161775188X|5.0|I love Simon's Cat. I work at a library and we have ancient Garfield the Cat books that are still being checked out and I thought Simon's Cat might make a good replacement. Of course, I checked it out myself as soon as I saw it on our shelves.<br /><br />This is a lovely book, beautiful drawings with so much detail, and it is so clear that Simon Tofield owns and knows cats. Each drawing stands alone, but all on the subject of the title: cat v. world. A sheet of stickers is bound with the other pages. This book should appeal to almost any cat lover.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It had me really feeling like I was there. The story is a great one that makes you realize how everything bad can and will get better if you really put forth effort to conquer your dream. This is a must read for all ages and will make you want more! Two thumbs up!!!
1476729085|4.0|The Rosie Project is a clever and entertaining book. Although it's pretty clear how the romance is going to end, it still took some surprise turns and fully engaged me as a reader.<br /><br />It's not a five star book for me for a few reasons. At the beginning of the book, I didn't much like the main character Don, the woman he is trying not to be interested in, Rosie, or Don's best friend, the philandering Gene. Eventually I got past this but it did slow down my enjoyment of the book in the early chapters.<br /><br />The book is narrated by Don, and I was reminded of a criticism I read of The Big Bang Theory. The author complained that we are not laughing with the geeky nerds of the popular television show, but at them. I didn't agree with everything the author of that criticism said but thought some legitimate points were made, and they apply to The Rosie Project as well. There are many times when Don says or does something that we are supposed to find funny that Don would not.<br /><br />Also, in chapter eleven, Rosie convinces Don to leave a cafe without paying the bill. I believe we are supposed to see this as a sign of progress in Don, that he can stop being so rigid and such a rule follower now that he has met Rosie, but in my opinion anyone who leaves a cafe without paying the bill is just a jerk. In no way can that be considered a sign of growth, and on top of that Rosie is a part-time bartender and I did not buy that she'd be willing to stiff a waiter just because it was convenient. (There was no problem at the cafe or with the waiter.)<br /><br />So, I have my reasons for downgrading its rating, but it is still highly enjoyable and readable. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the Big Bang Theory or quirky romance with a satisfying ending.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This was faotd and has become my favorite adventure puzzle game, magic accademy moves to 2nd place.i like it so much i came back to see what else they had done.
B00GWYSQTU|5.0|Imagine what you could accomplish if you could never fail. Imagine the great possibilities. What if all the goals you ever wanted in life were at your finger tips. Well you can do anything you want to do. You can conquer the highest mountains. You can hit that home run. You can WIN with Bello's personal Breakthrough. In this book you learn that no obstacle is too large. Nothing an stand in between you and your goal. There will be obstacles but you learn how to get through them and continue to think and look positive. I positively recommend this book.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Use it all the time and it works so well.  Also,  no techinical issues to speak of.  I recommend  it.
B00D8CSVLW|3.0|Seems like he wrote it because it was time to put something else out there. The historical input at the end was a bit of a redeeming effect.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|It was very very informative and explains a lot of what I noticed in my mother's stroke. I now have trouble remembering who I loaned it to last.
B009DH372Y|5.0|good for the price.... queen was awesome but without Freddie it was never the same ... the dvd is a nice one
B008602KQI|4.0|Movie streamed great, no buffering effect, picture was HD clear, sound excellent, colors clear & vibrant! I like it when technology works as advertised....
B008US4PBY|5.0|Got it for a friend. He seemed satisfied with it after trying zero $ alternatives. Simple setup, up and running in no time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. Of course I am a horse lover but this game would by good for any animal person. This game teaches you how to take care of a horse and it is also lots of fun to do shows like the championship show. Well I would rate this game five stars because it is very creative and entertaining.. that is why I love this game.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|The first book in this series was so good, I had high expectations. But this book fell short.  Such a great idea behind these books but so far they haven't really delivered. A lot of waiting around to see what's going to happen.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast works exactly as promised. It streams Netflix, YouTube and Pandora. More options will likely be added. Then it will be even more valuable.
B000065V42|5.0|We went to Disney World and played at the Honey I Shrunk the Kids playground.  It was great fun to watch the movie again to see the inspiration!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book was really entertaining. It was like the author took a microphone and put it right up to the guys' brain and we could listen to all of his sarcastic and very man thoughts. It was such a fresh point of view to another romance book. Definitely recommend.
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|Found this movie to be not as good as the first but still fun to watch. Still a good chemistry with this cast.
B00GX598FO|4.0|Good acting and fun to watch.  While these actors are &#34;retired&#34; in the movie, they certainly still &#34;have it&#34; in terms of being able to deliver a performance.
B00004W221|5.0|Inspiring!! A true story about dreams and working for them. I watch it with my students and they just dreamed.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game was made very well it would be have been a six star only if they had a larger variety of skyscrapers
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Restaurant story is a great application to play,you intact with other neighbors and collect gems too. It's very fun and it's for all ages to play.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app had a really nice set up i really liked it it was easy to use but it takes like an hour to load videos and when u search something it takes an hour to load that page of videos... that's why i deleted it ... i would just use the Internet instead of this app
B00FATEJYE|5.0|So far this game is fun and I'm working on getting stuff for the console version, I wish that the controls weren't so simplistic but it might just be that I suck. But otherwise this game is fun and I'll be playing it for a while.
B00CHS31DG|4.0|The radar was easy to use and fun, the only thing that I don't like is the fact that the camara wont work:/ is just a black screen. That said is actually really cool, I find it most accurate then the previous radar like the classic. Again four starts but I well update as I get more use of the app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel is a must read. I finished it in two days, I can see John Green being one of my favorite authors.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love my minions if you are a collector of these lovable guys then get them now they are great and fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its sooooo fun me and my brother compete all the time at who can travel the farthest.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|so much fun and very addicting. What makes it so great is its completely free!! Kinda scary at times though but amazing to play!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up and use. There are more and more apps supporting Chromecast every day. Using the website it was very easy to setup the device. Now, with the IOS app, setup and using it is even easier.
0143119419|5.0|The book is fascinating.  I don't think that many people understand how markets are really moving and who is doing it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but the longer I stay away from wheat, the better I feel.  Sleep better, acne and fungal infections clearing, ibs no longer a problem, not craving.  But if I accidentally have some flour watch out, it all comes back within 3 to 7 days.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|It's Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues at his finest.  Loved the CD and the tour and would love to see him tours this one again.
B003B02OOG|5.0|What can I say? It's Grisham.......wonderful stories. Thought provoking. I will always highly recommend anything by this wonderful story teller.
0385335989|5.0|Every book I have read by Diana Gabaldon is wonderful.  Love her way of telling a story.  She is one of my favorite authors.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Red 2 was really funny with great action and a clear plot! Loved the cast. This movie is a must see.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Thanks for the recommendation Michelle!<br /><br />I enjoyed the characters lives intertwining in ways I could not have imagined. Could not put it down!
B00009RGBS|5.0|The music and lyrics are outstanding and quite unique! Stand-out performance by the whole cast. Manages to capture the magic of the stage on a DVD format.
B0095D8ZAA|5.0|Wonderful and so much fun.  It helps make you think and excerise the mind.  Great app for kids as well as adults.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've been wanting to try this interesting game for some time, so I was delighted to see it for free today. I'm very glad I did. It is a gentle diversion for hectic times.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It has good graphics and I like the action in it. It also has lots of features in it.<br />All in all, it`s a great  game. (=
B004XMMSZG|5.0|At last, my Bose Sound dock II and my iphone 5 have established a meaningful relationship!  The installation couldn't be easier: connect the dock boss to my sound dock, go to Bluetooth on my phone settings menu and select dock boss.  Musical happiness!  No fooling with trying to connect a lightning adaptor with an Otterbox case, or other iPhone 5 unpleasantness.  Shipping was fast too!
B0024FADAQ|5.0|Love this movie.  All good.  The Dvd was well done and all worked as you would expect it too.  Good movie for kid
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|the caption says it all,  This book could have been 1/3 as long and been interesting. I did like the characters, however.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Very good book, unfortunately I've seen the tv series first so it took me a while to get into it but still a great read.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|I am sorry to disagree with the positive reviews, as Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors, but this movie was boring. The movie did not get deep enough into the main character, and the level of his addiction seemed artificial. Maybe I am just naive about the depth of addiction in pilots?
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I went into this game expecting it to just be a 2d minecraft, but there are many differences between this and Minecraft. It has an in game guide and a tutorial, so you are not just thrown into an unknown world like in Minecraft. There are many more ores and items, so you will be much more reliant on tools, which do not wear out. This is the legit Terraria, even though it is published by 505 games, Re-logic is credited. Lastly, the controls start a little awkward, but they are easy to get used to.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Huge world<br />Great, nostalgic graphics<br />Runs smoothly<br />Fun combat<br />Freedom<br />Customizable avatar<br />Creativity<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />No creative mode<br />Initially awkward controls<br />No difficulty options
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I can't wait for the third movie to come out!!!!!!!!!! Best trilogy EVER! My favorite character was Peeta! My second one was Cinna! Loved it!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love this app its really helpful it assists in keeping my tablet running smooth ,an helps manage memory very well
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't think I would have fallen for it, but it's got me addicted.  Very fun, I didn't get into the bejeweled type of games and since I kept seeing my friends post about it I finally broke down and tried it.
B004G7UTXG|2.0|We have Amazon Prime and got the movie for free. Sorry, Amazon but the streaming is pretty poor. Neither my wife nor I could understand the dialog. Somehow the speech is just garbeled or whatever. You can't enjoy the movie. It looked like a good flick but the lousy speech caused us to turn it off. Amazon Prime ain't ready for Prime time. You gotta fix the sound or provide subtitles. FYI, we aren't the first to complain. Fix it guys or watch NETFLIX. They have subtitles.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|Terraria comes to mobile with a reasonably good port. It is more or less the same game as the PC version, but the touch controls keep it from being great. The controls work better than I expected, but being able to play with a mouse and keyboard just felt a lot more fluid. Still, Terraria is a solid port and well worth picking up if you're a fan of the original. Just be aware that it will take a bit of time to get fully used to the controls.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This book quickly became one of my all time favorites. I almost wish that there were more series similar to these.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I needed to use my hints a few times, but the map was quite valuable. The game was fairly difficult to know where you needed to go next. I felt it was worth the price, although many similar apps of this type have come down in cost. I paid $4.99.<br />  G5 has not released a new game of this genre in a long time, I hope that they will be quicker to get new apps on the market sooner for those of us who enjoy playing on kindles or other hand held devices. Lowering the price would sell more also :-)
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Love, love, loved this movie!  It was a terrific addition to the Star Trek family and I hope that they keep making more....and more, and more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't put it down.  Need to beat my best score.  Need to get more minions.  And I hate bananas too.  Every run is different.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|Great CD.  I had one of their albums back in the 80's and never listened to them until I stumbled across this CD.  Glad they are still around spreading the word and making great music!  I don't think you will be disappointed!
B00AVXVQGI|3.0|I expected more with the ending of the book but it was a bit of a disappointment..it was just ok. .blahhhhh
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|This connects my son's iPod shuffle to an iHome docking station.  It works well and the sound isn't distorted, nor is there any static or other sound disturbances due to using the cable.  My only complaint is that it doesn't also charge the shuffle - but it doesn't make any claim to charge the shuffle.  It's just a feature I wish it had.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This app is going to help me with my schooling so very much. I have been looking for what seems like forever, for an app like this! GREAT!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I have an old 2nd Gen kindle that was not connecting with my computer.  I was very frustrated with trying to download books and documents via USB.  This cable works well with my kindle and doesn't have the loose connection like my original USB cable did.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|In iphone, kindle is user friendly, but i still recommend to revise it so that we can easly locate specific bible verses and not swipe or turn the pages of the chaper until youfi d the verse. But in my samsung s3, there's table of contents when you are already in the book. That's why i cant read my book in my samsong galaxy S3 phone.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a book my book club is reading and I could not put it down.  The characters immediately drew me in.  I don't normally like books that flip back and forth different time periods but this one was easy to read.  There a few surprises and great story line.  I will definitely recommend this book to friends.  Definitely look up more about Orphan trains.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Only works with select routers.  Does not work with any AT&T routers.  I can't even find a good list of routers it does work with.
0142501123|5.0|This book is one of our &#34;family classics&#34;.  A clever and cute story written with a cadence that is just perfect, making it fun to read, even over and over again.  Also pulls kids in to read along.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book so much, I bought and read her other two. It was so interesting and really dealt with feelings from the heart, kept my interest, moved right along and had a strong message delivered at the end....do what you believe is right for you.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|Love One Republic! And they kept up to all my expectations with this album after a while. Every song is catchy and love 'em.
006202406X|1.0|I was so looking forward to this book, but the formatting was not consistent compared to the first two books (hindsight shows why the narration had to change).  I found I had to push myself to keep reading it and kept getting confused as I read. Halfway through I wanted to find a guide online to figure out what exactly was going on and more importantly, why? Now, I kind of wish I had just given up - I feel gutted, but not in a satisfied way other books have made me feel. I slogged through 500 pages and now feel too betrayed, heartbroken, and hopeless to finish the last 20. I have recommended the series to my students, but I certainly won't be gushing about this series anymore. Maybe I'll feel differently after a while, but I will definitely feel more wary of the next series I dive into. I have definitely lost some trust here.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Clear and easy to understand usually right on for the short term forecast  also like the graphics. Easy to access.the only weather apps i use
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is really worth it for free! Amazing effects. Its a bit slow on my kindle but besides that its very enjoyable.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Theres a lot to do in this game. Everything is fair you don't need to purchase anything because everything can be earned EASILY through achievements. Awesome game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy playing a variety of games, &amp; mixing them up.  I find myself returning to this one more often.  It's my favorite, very addictive.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Very informative and interesting... Also surprising and heartbreaking...<br />I recommend this book to anyone who is curious about life in North Korea, why it is so vastly different from South Korea and how North Koreans survive under the regime.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|Is missing some functionality but you can chat with your friends and purchase games. Great app if you love steam sales.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|Didn't work as I had hoped. It was a bit too complicated a contraption. Not what I expected from the description.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|Good phones for the money in this price range.  Comfortable, sound quality improves with age, nice long cord, good sound imaging for audiophiles or watching/listening to digital programs on your computer.
B001O1O71C|4.0|A story that is mystifyingly sweet and at the same time brutal.  The Jewish people and the Germans family lives were both captured in a way that deals with hatred, love and destruction of life.
B004LUS390|2.0|The app is fun, but not very easy to figure out.  I couldn't figure out how to change colors for example.  But if you like doodling, it might not be so bad.
B003WJ9DYA|4.0|Definitely dated, but fun, with a great visual design. The real highlight is Tim Curry as Lord Darkness - the makeup is amazing even by modern standards and his performance is brilliant.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|This game is seriously addicting.  It took me a little while to get all the nuances, and on the challenging levels I could pass them with 10-30 errors, once I figured out the simple methods to this game, the puzzles usually end with only one or two errors, mainly because I fat finger them.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|My favorite season of the series! Walter is disappearing, which leaves Heisenberg to emerge & challenge Gus Fring to the ultimate drug lord chess match. Which explodes into one of the greatest season finales ever!
B008D28HYS|5.0|These brick fill in games are fun, but this adds a fun extra dimension with multiple colors.  Black and white is a bit more challenging, but the colors are fun in their own way.
B00BPA2PBG|4.0|I bought and watched Ghostbusters (Mastered in 4K) Blu-ray and it's a noticeable improvement. It's definitely the best I've ever seen Ghostbusters look. I saw objects and detail in the background I've never seen in the movie before. The picture is very colorful. Colors like red, yellow, green and others really stand out. I'm glad I bought it and I will definitely watch it again sometime.<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars, because... well... I'm sure there could have been more improvement in the video and audio, but it's easily the best I've ever seen the movie look. I recommend it to anyone.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really enjoy the game and appreciate the quality and variety of the photos. I have had several difficulties downloading new puzzles.
0061122416|5.0|I love this book. It is one of my favorites. This book is a must read for those on the spiritual path.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|Enjoyed the actors portrayals of these characters. This is a very enjoyable version of this classic story.  Johnny Lee Miller fans will not be disappointed.
B00F522C7C|1.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it - when it was called \\"Cars\\". I am a Pixar nut - I own all of them and have watched and each probably 100 times. But this is without a doubt the worst Pixar flick to date. It has an almost identical look and storyline as did \\"Cars\\". There is nothing unique about this movie - and that's very unfortunate.  In my opinion, Pixar movies have been going downhill for a while. I wish I could send this back with a letter to the director asking him what the heck is up with this!<br /><br />I understand that this movie is made \\"for kids \\"- but my four-year-old nephew couldn't stand it either!  Additionally - our kids are getting a bit more savvy and I just think that this picture was a failure.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I agree that the full nudity was not necessary to the plot. The other girl who he met in the hospital was definitely not needed in the movie either, but for some odd reason, the writers wrote her into such a large part of the movie. However, I did think that Denzel's performance was top-notch and his performance was moving (as always). I liked the change and self-realization his character experienced and he did the right thing in the end. I wish we could transplant Denzel's performance into another writer's story who didn't choose to keep all the ancillary stuff that did not add to the plot at all. I still give this a 4 as Denzel redeemed it from a 3.
B00GTZJLAK|3.0|I tried to talk my kids out of this one because of the bad reviews.This isn't one of those Pixar movies that both adults and kids will love. And I wouldn't expect a sequel or new section of Disney World dedicated to it. But all of my kids, including my increasingly picky 9 yr old daughter, liked it.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I did not know anything about the destruction of Dresden.  The author really brings to life the horrors that accompany war in a fascinating and moving way.  I would like to read some analysis on this book...since I never read it in high school!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The best App on my Fire HD.  Engaging, beautifully conceived, Brilliant, and delivers nothing less then a challenging future experiences today.  The music adds to the delightful experience.  You will not be disappointed.  Be challenged and entertained.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This version only goes up to level 440.  I am on level 448, so I have to play on laptop to finish the game instead of my Kindle. :(
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I waited a long time before picking buying and then starting the trilogy. Once I started HG I couldn't put it down or wait before reading the second and third books. I'm so glad that i didn't have to wait between books!
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My daughter is really into Monster High right now and loves watching the DVD's! They are holding up well after repeat viewings!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen House grabbed me from the first page and kept my interest until the last page! In addition it was enlightening as it shed light on  a period of time that I personally have no real knowledge of.  I found this book to be entertaining and informative and I would and have recommended it to friends!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love this game but I accidentally deleted my favorite character I had a murderous starfury a golden sword silver pic silver axe golden armour full health and mana Hermes boots and a bunch of other stuff I'm so sad &amp; mad that the yes &amp; no buttons are so close but it's my fault not the games
B003B0JLYW|2.0|The book was fine, but the condition was NOT like new - not even close.<br />I was told the condition was very good, like new. The book was<br />written in and even had pieces of paper in it. I paid extra for this<br />item since the condition was labeled like new, but I should've just<br />spent the extra $5 for the new book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the little minion!! I also like that they created this minion game! And that the game ties into the movies! By far one of the best games I've ever played on my kindle fire!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fast paced and very addictive! People will need Candy Crush rehabilitation....I can barely focus on my job because I have to play candy crush. You have officially been dipped in awesome sauce and yes I am a Candy Crushaholic!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Game is fun but simple to learn. I did not like finding out that I would be charged for additional levels.
B00DJ80VMM|4.0|The &#34;IT&#34; I like is Mangini's drum parts. There, that's &#34;IT&#34;, that's all I like about the recordingafter trying to listen to it hoping for more.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game is such a good game I just wish I don't have to wait until the next levels arrive.I am so impatiently waiting for more to come.I hope this will be soon !
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|Before I really knew much about the other artists/musicians on this, I had no idea that it was these musicians playing in this band, Wilson really curbed and reigned in these typically over the top players into a really killer final product.<br />Pretty dang impressed with the drum sound on the opener. It reminds me of the drum sound on Rush's SIGNALS but modern.<br />Along with all the other statements of praise that others have made about this album, I would just like to add my thanks for making this thing happen. Steve, your a man god.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I haven't stopped watching The Good Wife since the beginning.  Excellent storylines and casting,  The Good Wife has replaced Mad Men as my #1 favorite television series!  Thanks for including it in your Prime Membership lineup.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|No as scary as Shining but a good story. Definitely felt closure for Danny.......but just enough loose ends to keep you wondering. ....are we safe?
0385349947|4.0|I borrowed the book from someone at work and then decided to have my own copy since it is such a great read.  However, the hardcover copy that I received from Amazon.com is not of good quality.  The pages have not been trimmed evenly which makes the book quite cheap.  Disappointed of this.
B00932AA5G|5.0|well-told action story, especially a style different from Hollywood. Four stars may be more accurate. Five stars for hoping more of this  kind of movies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game disappointed that am at level 440 and there is more levels to do but game not updated even though when device said push to update nothing happened hope s someone can sort it out soon
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Exactly as advertised.  Perfect fit and finish.  Now I can charge my MB Air with any of my older chargers that have MagSafe connectors instead of throwing them away.  Now I have chargers in every room (not that I need them because the Air lasts forever on a charge) so I never have to go looking for one.
0765357151|5.0|The method of binding is no different from a paperback. The print was as good as any book, and the book was great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Well written and exciting. I felt it was better than the first book of the trilogy.  You really bond with the characters, and each one is better defined than in the first book - especially as they try to deal with the lingering trauma of the Hunger Games.  What happens to them next after the Hunger Games is truly monsterous, and you feel so deeply for them. I couldn't put it down.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Great App. Love it! Wouldn't change anything about it. No complaints here. Wish you guys had more levels. I am really addicted to this game.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|We love Indianna Jones! This is a great deal on a great package of blue-rays. Cant wait to watch them!
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is one of the best games of all time and has been around forever. And fun as ever! All I can say is Get it Now! You'll Love it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham is a competent and interesting writer who himself is a lawyer who can deal with the law in both its finer points and its sleazier ones.  I have fun comparing him with William Faulkner as a teller of deep south stories.  Faulkner seems to me to have emphasized the doom, rot,  and gloom of the post reconstruction south - one can see the mouldering moss hanging from the live oaks and the mildew on the old wallpaper.  In a way, so does Grisham, but with a difference: most of Grisham's stories have a redemption or uplift at the end. So it is with this tale. It is the story of an ugly and a grossly unlikable family thirsting for the goodies ($24 million) which the testator has instead, in a holographic will, for the most part has left to his  black housekeeper, a fact that arises all sorts of ire, greed, false remonstrations of love and concern on the part of the family and bewilderment on the part of everyone else.  The rest is in the story and the redemptive denouement, neither of which a reviewer should go into further so that you can enjoy the story.  Thank you John for another good one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This one put me on the edge of my seat cause you never know what's going to happen or what or where the governor is going<br />to do next. Like I said the zombies eat you alive.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Looking to kill a good half hour or three? Feeling nostalgic? This app is free and does exactly what it says. Good 'ol  fashioned solitaire. Nothing more, nothing less. The adds aren't super interrupting, just between every game or so and you can skip them. I like how there's an option for a random deal, or a winning deal, because sometimes you just wanna feel like a winner.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|All the seasons have been awesome and it just keeps on getting better each season. I always try to figure out whats going to happen next. The zombies keep eating at you.
006202406X|1.0|I loved the first two books, Divergent and Insurgent, read them each in a day.  I was so looking forward to Allegiant.  I rushed to the bookstore the day it came out and couldn't wait to start reading Allegiant.  Got home and started to read it.  It was slow reading and very confusing going back and forth from Tris and Tobias' perspective's.  I thought it might get better so kept reading but I just couldn't get into this book like I did the others.  I have been reading Allegiant for over a month now and still haven't finished it.  I decided to go and look at the reviews and was very surprised to find out I was not the only one who absolutely disappointed with this last book.  I have no intention of finishing it now.  Wish I could take it back, total waist of money and my time.  Ms. Ross was such a promising new writer but after this I will not be reading anymore of her books, and forget the movie.  HORRIBLE!!!
B0049VZ222|5.0|This season 1 was really awesome how it started out. Now look were it is today nearing the end of this season. What do you think is going to happen to the Governor in this last season? Get it to find out what happens!

B00EPFEY44|5.0|Having been to Portofino, viewing the concert at that location added to the emotional impact. Bocelli has a wonderful voice, which this selection of songs enhances. I have listened to it repeatedly and do not tire of it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a real fun game and you can get addicted to this but that's okay. My friend got me started on this game. Thanks everyone.<br />Get it you will enjoy it. Have loads of fun. Get it?

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is very fun and interesting has so many things to do and gives u so many choices. I very much so like this game.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|May be the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad script bad acting- it makes Olympus has fallen look like a master piece.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I saw this film in the theater when it first came out. I was a pretty young person. The themes were pretty adult - the awakening of the innocent daughter - the evil that lives in man's mind, etc. The space travel special effects were gripping, as were what was down on - and in - the planet. The featured robot appeared functional and not comic. Everything in this movie holds up well in the present day, except perhaps when an invisible creature is made see-able by blaster fire - it is an a Disney animation and it looks pretty much like it. This edition is sharp and crisp and with many extras. If you're a fan of the movie, let me be clear - you need this!
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|It's one of the best free racing games in the Appstore. I highly suggest this game because it's a blast
0740748475|5.0|For all the guys who want to remember what it was like being a kid and for all women to wonder. Watterson didn't invent anything new here, he just captured absolute truth in a beautiful and funny way. You can watch his ability and influence grow and evolve over his career, and he was able to return &#34;Artist&#34; to the title &#34;Cartoon Artist&#34;. All that's gone now, but for a brief, shining moment, he changed everything. There is so much material here, you will return to it over and over. Trust me when I say that this seemingly expensive book is a complete bargain!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|(No spoilers.)<br /><br />I love, love, love this book. It's a tender love story, and I could relate to Eleanor so much, which I'm sure all girls can--especially women who were girls in the 80's. I had a privileged life, more like Park's, as far as money goes, but I was just like Eleanor emotionally. I think that's one of the beautiful things of this book is how specific and yet universal it is.<br /><br />I loved hearing of bands I hadn't listened to in years (like The Smiths), but were a mainstay to me in the mid-80's. One wouldn't have to be that age to appreciate this book, though. Anyone appreciating a tender story of some misfit older adolescents would like it.<br /><br />It's the perfect book for adults or YA readers. I think women and girls would like it more than men or boys, but I think that's typical with anything that's a love story.
B000001U3K|3.0|I bought this CD for one song - Walk On The Wild Side - one of the all time best songs ever recorded. Yes, the subject matter isn't for everybody, but the catchy beat and smooth delivery sells it. I rate the song up there with Baker Street and Werewolves Of London for total coolness. To be honest, I found the rest of the tracks to be pretty forgettable, and I almost never play them - hence the mediocre rating. On the other hand, if you're a Lou Reed fan, you'll probably eat them up, so I recommend the album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow is all I can say.  Graphics are cool and sound is spot on. Too funny.<br /><br />Minions are hilarious.  Whaa???
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Bought this collection back in 2008 , lend it to a friend .. you know the rest.<br /><br />This collection is THE definitive collection for all Matrix fans.<br />It contains the original trilogy along with the Animatrix and making of and a documentary about the philosophy behind the matrix.<br /><br />It's Blu-Ray so i don't have to talk about the quality.<br />Good collector's item for fans , and new-comers will never find a better DOOR to the MATRIX
B004TI5N38|1.0|REALLY BAD! Characters are undeveloped. Storylines lead nowhere. Chapters and chapters of the main characters having the same conversation over again. Not what you would expect from Baldacci.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Not much to say but, if you're a Metal Gear fan; you'll buy it anyway as it contains EVERYTHING.<br />If you're new to the series; then what better way to get into the vast MGS universe other than this collection.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Well it's over. I am sure there were many things I missed which I will catch the next time through.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|What can I say?  Even with all of the calculators on computers and phones today, sometimes I really want a regular, gold-standard calculator.  HP has many choices and I've been using RPN [Reverse Polish Notation] since undergrad engineering school, so I'm grateful these are still around.<br /><br />I should mention that while there are many functions available on this machine, I rely on Microsoft Excel for most of those.  Maybe I'm a throwback, but when I lost my HP17C [I have no idea how], this replaced it admirably.  I didn't really explore other brands.  It's probably a combination of RPN and the buttons, which are perfect.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is the second time I've read the book and I'm glad I did.  I'm going to see Catching Fire and reading this definitely put me in the right mood.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Lots of action, but it seems that the traditional Superman storyline was changed just for the sake of change.  It's also kinda dark, much like the Batman movies.  Hope the next in the series will be a little lighter and more characteristic of the older Superman movies.
B00G3HSF7O|5.0|I thought this movie was fantastic, not only did it have some really amazing special effects and action scenes, it also had a touching love interest (without being sappy). If that's not enough the underlying theme mirroring the real life separation between first and third world countries is a real eye opener. Obviously we can't cure cancer but many diseases are death sentences to children there and we can cure them with some pills, even if they get here they can't get the medicine without healthcare . . .  i wont get political, its a well rounded, well acted, thought provoking movie. Give it a shot!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have not been drawn into a futuristic novel like this in years!  The author creates a completely seamless world that draws you in.  The thing I like best is he told a human story... life, love, yearning for freedom.  Thank you!  I diwnloaded the next series &#34;Shift Omnibus&#34; witout even bothering to have a sample sent... something I almost never do.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really a great and easy to use. +, -, x, / just what you need for everyday use. Best part it's free.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|This is a good dystopian movie about a girl who trys her best to remain a good human while put in a difficult situation. Not good for young children to watch.
B00GS1DM2S|5.0|Took a year and a half but its here eva 3.33. This shock and define the series. The dub is top notch and the music is terrifying. The ending song of sakura nagashi is beautifil. If you love anime. Pre order this. I already have
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Great movie, poor streaming performance. I ended to sit in front of my Laptop and could not use the TV. Weired messages like non certified display came up
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Favorite game on kindle. Very fun and addictive. Only complaint is you cant use a robot in a higher class but you can use the higher class robots in the lower class fights if that makes sense.

0393317552|4.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel<br /><br />An informative book that does a very good job at explaining why human development, technology and empire building took place in some areas of the world, but not others.  Diamond explains how geography plays a pivotal role in determining why certain human civilizations took off, and others were relegated to comparative backwaters.  His reasoning is well supported, and comprehensive to the point where it sometimes becomes a bit redundant.<br /><br />Surpluses of produce from domesticated plants and animals allows for surpluses of people, who in turn can specialize in something else beside food production is the key.<br />Conduits for the spread of information, invention, and written language relied upon geography.  The advance of those who brought these innovations also brought disease.<br /><br />If you have ever read “Ishmael” by Daniel Quinn, some of this book may sound familiar. What Diamond does is to take the reasons for the advance of civilization by certain groups, and not others to a new level.  Conflict, or lack of conflict between and among developing kleptocracies play an important role as the mother of innovation and invention. An adapt or die card is dealt, and why this helped innovation in Europe, but ultimately held back innovation in China.<br /><br />After reading Guns, Germs, and Steel, the reader will have developed an understanding why certain civilizations have developed, prospered, and conquered, while others have been subjugated by the aforementioned societies.  Diamond gets his information across without being preachy, and includes an occasional nugget of humor. The message at times becomes a bit repetitive, and is the only negative I find with the book.  I would highly recommend Jared Diamond’s Guns’ Germs, and Steel to anyone who has an interest in why human societies advanced, and subjugated others, and thus set the table for the History of mankind on planet Earth.
0596007124|5.0|I purchased this book several years ago while attending a software developer conference. I wanted to learn more about design patterns and this was the most interesting book I could find on the topic. At the time it was a fairly new title; though it is not really a new book on the subject anymore it’s still very relevant and it does a great job of covering the main design patterns that software developers encounter in the software development cycle.<br /><br />Most books I have seen on the subject of design patterns have dry, textbook approaches to presenting design patterns. They may cover some use cases, present some case studies and offer some discussion about the proper way to use particular patters in development. Head First Design Patterns takes a completely different approach - instead of dry reading on the particulars of different design patterns, the authors instead have a more light-hearted and fun approach. There are running case studies but these are presented in a whimsical and humorous way, with all manner of puns and cutesy graphics injected throughout.<br /><br />In spite of the humor and all of the “fluff ‘n stuff” in this book, the authors never lose sight of the real goal which is presenting material on design patterns. They present over a dozen design patterns, explain how they work and when to use them. The lighthearted approach does not take away from this but rather makes the material more palatable for those of us with shorter attention spans. It also makes the material more memorable, which is a good thing when working with as much material as is being presented.<br /><br />The patterns are presented with the Java programming language in mind and as such those who work with Java will gain the most benefit. That said, it is easy enough to adapt the material to other object-oriented languages such as C++ or C#.<br /><br />For learning design patterns, Head First Design Patterns is a fine book. It is an easier read than many of the others books on the subject and still presents the important points of design patterns. It has been out for a while now but it is still very relevant. If you need to learn about design patterns or want to know more about them but don’t have the patience for a long, dry read, try this book.s books on the subject and still presents the important points of design patterns.

B00472NZDQ|2.0|I liked this book less. I found moving Mickey to the prosecutors table did not work so well. A lot of set-up of the murderers activities which all come to nothing.
B008S80P38|3.0|It's ok. There's nothing to draw you in and keep you interested. Not something I recommend sitting down to listen to. good background filler music.
B001DPC52C|4.0|If you like live shows and Within Temptation, then this is not lacking. DVD has more music then the CD however.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very fun a bit of a discovery with all the cities you go through. Just can't help but enjoy it daily with challenges and bonuses.
143353083X|1.0|Too small to really use for a study Bible.  I did not like the format - the print is tiny.  It is not really useable.  Maybe its ok for a younger audience - but this is not the right size for a Study Bible.  But I love the ESV version and the commentary
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app I can work with it so easy with out it turning off or twitching and it not shutting off.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Classic comedy to start off the holiday season. Perfect way to kick off the busy holiday season with side splitting humor.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|I went into this movie with very low expectations but it was better than I thought. Jennifer Aniston could never be a stripper though, it's pretty obvious.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. No frustration if I got stuck because of the hint button and I could go back right where I left off if I walked away for a while. I felt it was just right to play along with my son too. Scenery was beautiful and nice to the eyes along with all graphics. I played with the sound off and it didn't take away from the game at all. It was nice to finish a point and click game without consulting the internet  and it was fulfilling to finish.  Thanks devs for a great game hope to see more in the future and thanks for making it the free app of the day!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I like how descriptive the book is. I rated the book 5 stars because it is my new favorite book.
B0093QHWLC|3.0|Decent movie. Solid acting but an average plot with an average ending. I would recommend others to watch but definitely wouldn't put it up there as a great movie.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|For the price the book had good info and was structured very well. Having a degree in exercise science, I found the information valid and presentable to someone new to the fitness game.

1612680011|1.0|Dude's a fraud.  I only read half the book and was aMazed that he could remember the details to conversations from his childhood.  Plus, I never felt like anything of substance was being revealed.  Then I started researching the guy online to find out he has a spotty past and legitimacy issues.  Oprah should bring him on and make him admit that the book is a lie.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Simply, it is badly written. The plot is unlikely and demeaning. It is though the author had accepted a bet to see if she could make a best seller by being as outrageous as possible using repetitive cliches for writing skills.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I bought this for my fiancé as his christmas present… he loves the band and listens to it all the time in the car.

B00EW9GQR6|4.0|I am a huge fan of Lady Gaga and couldn't wait for this to be released! Upon hearing the album, I was impressed, yet worried that the album wouldn't be liked by the mainstream radio, and not do well. This is a very experimental album, and if you are into the EDM type stuff, then get the album. If you want another Poker Face or Bad Romance, then you might want to skip this one. I love the dance music, so this album is great and right up my ally. The star off is for &#34;Jewels n' Drugs&#34; and the vocals in &#34;Aura.&#34; I preferred the ones used in the demo.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed the book .It kept my interest from the first page. Liked  the way the author connected all the characters.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Games is fun would like it a lot more if you didn't have to pay to coin. Wish you could earn them instead of paying money for them
044042321X|4.0|It's nice, but honestly, I would rather read the real book. It is a good summary of the show/book though.
B004V9MU86|4.0|It is different that what I normally ready but I am enjoying the story being told by death. Very good
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This has been lots of laughs and yes, at times frustrating. But I have really enjoyed the fun of it. This is worth all $.99 and much more.
B00GLX0Z8C|1.0|I ordered the HD movie and the quality is terrible on my 55 inch tv. Maybe the quality is for the kindle so I don't recommend renting on a large tv.
159562015X|4.0|Focusing on our strengths rather than improving our weaknesses is now accepted wisdom for achieving &#34;success&#34; (however you define that) in life. Many people don't understand what their strengths are and hence, this book and accompanying online questionnaire are an excellent guide to identifying and understanding one's top 5 strengths.<br /><br />The majority of the book is simply an outline of each of the 34 &#34;themes&#34; as Rath dubs them. You really don't need to read through all as the reports that come on completing the 177 questions provides the same information for each person's Top 5.<br /><br />I found it interesting that 5 years after first doing the questionnaire 3 of my Top 5 changed which in someways reflect my current circumstances. However, what that also indicates is that a Top 5 isn't necessarily definitive and so that there are a number of other themes that we are naturally inclined to.<br /><br />And that serves in my mind as the biggest frustration with this study: not receiving information about where we stand on the other 29 themes. I'd love to see plotted on some sort of scale all 34 themes that emphasise my strongest ones but also indicate those themes that are near and far to the Top 5.<br /><br />But this is a very useful resource and the customised reports provide a list of suggested action items for taking advantage of those strengths in a timely manner. As the author states, it's one thing knowing your strengths, it's another actually using them to enhance your life.<br /><br />Highly recommend for all walks of life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and easy to see!! Calculator fills the whole screen. Great app if you use your Kindle to do online banking.
193700788X|1.0|This book was written differently from the other books and all in all seemed thrown together.  I heard that the author had been planning on this ending since they beginning, but not only was I personally unhappy with the outcome, I felt like it was rushed.  The author seems to has lost her passion for the series and it shows.  I wish the series would have been concluded a couple books ago rather than end this way.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is awesome you should get it right away you will be addicted in the first day and won't stop playing for weeks
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|A absolutely fantastic Doctor Who 50th anniversary special and can't wait to watch it again in 3D. The Day of the Doctor price isn't bad in my opinion if you consider it a movie link episode of Doctor Who that comes in a 3d Blu ray / Blu ray / DVD combo.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|I found this book took a long time to really get flowing but once it found its pace it kept it going right until the end. And the end is where I found it somewhat anaemic again. I really appreciate King and Maxwell as protagonists but I believe they way this plot was handled didn't live up to my expectations. The question is, would I recommend it? Without a doubt but if this is going to be your first K&M book, there are much better books to start with.
145210655X|5.0|awesome storybook!! my 3 yr old loves it! I bought this because her dad is a huge star wars fan and he has her interested in it now! great for adults and kids!!
6305428050|5.0|There is not a wasted second in this movie...it is hilarious and awesome...I love it and think everyone should watch it...sooo many great one-liners...
B008Q0AJA2|4.0|Recently I visited Seaside, Florida. Everyone but I in our party of six had seen The Truman Show and kept saying they remembered this building or that scene. So I had to watch it. It was fun.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Dude really. You don't need an explanation to love this movie. Can't wait for the next one. Watch this movie!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was not able to view the series as it was televised and now I am hooked.  There are a lot of programs but very few are worth spending any time viewing.  Excellent series!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great series. I am so glad I bought this set. I love all the movies (and books) so it is totally worth it to get the set.
B00E3QJ7ZG|5.0|Another timeless classic from Clint Eastwood! The fact that he directed this movie makes this film that much better. Eastwood fits the role perfectly as the unknown drifter in Legos. His demeanor and tough guy attitude rates this film as a perfect 5 for me. The Bluray transfer is quite good also! This movie is a must have for any western film collector!
B002ZG9774|5.0|Christina and Cher. That should tell you everything you need to know. Lots of fun music and dancing. Definitely a good buy.
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|Great movie. John Hurt does a magnificent of portraying Winston Smith, the &#34;revolutionary thought criminal&#34;. His hatred of the government  and Big Brother and his attempt to revise the political and historical inaccuracies of Oceania and his &#34;illicit&#34; sexual activities with Julia lead to his ultimate demise and re-education. Bravado for Richard Burton and his portrayal of O'Brien of the &#34;inner Ministry&#34;. He is completely in his element here. He is utterly convincing in this role as the advocate of &#34;political conformity&#34;, but at the same time conveying an element of political cynicism inherent in his role. Torture and cruelty are simply tools used as a means to an end. No contradiction in terms for O'Brien and any method employed to extract loyalty and conformity in thought from his victims seems to be justified. I have no problem with the Korean version of this DVD since you can select the subtitles in any language to correspond to the English dialog. The soundtrack from the Eurythmics is excellent! Overall, a great film based off the George Orwell book!
B0088EDMMS|5.0|Such a great movie! The witches are the best part of course, but the story is simple and the acting is not bad. I am so glad I bought this movie.
B00E3QJ7FG|5.0|A timeless classic from director John Hughes. Anthony Michael Hall is hilarious in this comedy about two high school misfits who decide to create the perfect woman with their computer. Kelly LeBrock fits that role very well. This movie had to definitely be a springboard for Anthony Michael Hall in his acting career! A must have for anyone who really enjoys a good laugh! John Hughes at his best! 80's comedy at its finest!
1616550414|5.0|I got this for my fiance as a birthday present. He loves it. I looked through the book and it is actually really neat. I would recommmend this to others.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|From the first reaping to the final closure and gathering of victors, Collins keeps readers not just involved but captivated.<br /><br />Join Peeta Mellark, Katniss and Primrose Everdeen, Gale Hawthorne, Haymitch Abernathy, Effie Trinkett, Finnick and Annie Odair, as well as Johanna, Beetee, and countless others as they attempt to do the unthinkable by taking on the Capitol.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|predictable. have always looked forward to new books. really disappointed in this one.  need more suspense and intrigue.  look forward to next  book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|No problems with downloading or playing, but haven't received the 7500 coins I purchased. Other than that I love this game. Each costumed minion has special abilities. It's fast-paced and fun. Not for the impatient.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game it keeps you going with its many layers which make is very interesting. I personally hav  not figure out everything yet but im looking forward to trying.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought one of these as I am regularly on the road.  I wastoldby the google rep that it would stream anywhere there is a wifi, great product, I have one and its the best.. blah blah<br /><br />as long as you are right next to a wifi, it works well.  in my house it streamed without lags, but if you go less than 3 wifi bars, it will stop to buffer every few seconds, especially if hd, and theres no way to set bitrate that I have found.<br /><br />on the road, I was told I could use it in hotels, etc.  this is wrong.  the unit will not connect to any public wifi that has a secondary login page (you connect and when you try to go somewhere a page pops up and you login, or click an agreement)<br /><br />all in all, lots of hype but little substance.  im going to return mine until they get their act  more together.  the ability to stream directly to it would be very nice also.<br /><br />shame, I really did want to love it, but feel &#34;meh..&#34;<br /><br />I think ill just get a slightly bigger device that can do more, maybe a roku or similar.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Really, really great program. It ha  proven to b  really helpful for someone like me who likes expedience. IM on th he go a lot so having f2f his handy when i want to work on stuff from my tablet is helpful
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|Blitz Brigade is a brilliant First person shooter (fps)  game when I downloaded this I only got it because of the multiplayer inside the game I thought you would just sit around and rotate your screen and just shoot targets but I WAS WRONG! this type of gameplay is very much like Battlefield3 and that just speaks for its self. but however in every app there is a negative side too. like any other free app there is a currency system with either diamonds,  gems,  etc. and you need them to buy something that is &quot;powerful&quot; or maybe to change your characters attire. well,  in this game they have diamonds. and  they are VERY useful,  you need them for just about everything so yeah minor flaw but compared to the game itself, its worth it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The graphics are better than I thought they were going to be. It's just a fun and cute game! I would recommend this game for all ages.
0060935464|4.0|A great adaption and great acting to this classic story.  There are so many parts of the film that had meaning 50 years ago and still has great provoking substance today.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Wasn't sure I was going to like because it was completely different from any other books I read.... but surprise surprise, I even went on to Trilogy 2 and 3.  Devoured them, very entertaining.  Clever writer.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's ok, could give little hints.  I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  It is a challenge, not a 5 star game.<br />Www.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing for when your  bored and have nothing to do. And its there for you ever were you go PICKLE357
0345803507|2.0|I ordered all three books together and didn't make it past the first few chapters of Book One.  Dumb. Don't.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|If only they made this on amazon sooner. This is my #1 app i use. I recommend you get this game.
B00CB4ET0K|1.0|I downloaded this game for a new experience. However, once I got past the first level, I was stuck at the \\"purchase Glu-points\\" page. I was not able to bypass it. This is not what I would call a free game and I have removed it from my Kindle. There is a slight difference between a free game and a free download (which is what this game truly is). If you have money to spend, I can see this being enjoyable. I suppose I will keep my true free games.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of fun. Very addicting. Can't stop playing. Definitely recommended!! The competitions are super fun and getting to train the horse is lots of fun as well.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Unbelievable.  I drove past my exit after seeing this movie.  It made me reevaluate my life choices and the impact my life would take if I didn't change my path.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|Decent movie.  I liked this particular point-of-view on Clark Kent.  I also liked the backstory of Krypton.  However I the dialogue and character development felt shallow to me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was very suspenseful and great reading.  I am a fan of John Grisham and I have read a lot of his books.
034580709X|5.0|My first Nesbo read has been a great experience. The Bat features Harry Hole, a detective in Norway who is enroute to Sydney by the police department to help search for information about a young woman killed not long ago.<br /><br />The search leads Harry to Brigitta, a prostitute and Harry tells her a great personal demon....that he is an alcoholic. He once caused the paralysis of a victim in the line of duty back in Norway and the guilt from the ordeal hasn't left him.<br /><br />Harry ends up in the hospital after one knock out drag out fight. His new lead has led him on the trail of a gay clown that he becomes certain is the killer of Inger, the woman he's looking for.<br /><br />This is where the book becomes a page turner and you won't be able to put it down as you go through twist and turn.<br /><br />This first venture into the world of Harry Hole, the cop from Norway is an often heart pounding lead. Definitely glad to have been introduced to Jo Nesbo.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This is a great game.  I've played several of this type and this one is the best.  I like the feature that allows the player to solve the puzzles or just look at the solution and move on with no penalty.  I wish it would have another chapter or two.  I would like to go on an adventure with the uncle and defeat the ancestors of evil.  Super creative!  Keep up the good work.
B007JVJ3C4|3.0|I didn't think this movie was as good as the first one; but it was OK.  The UV Digital copy was a disappointment.  I could not get it to upload into my UV account.  The code number was incorrect.  Sony did not answer my email request for help and Ultraviolet's answer to my request was not helpful at all.  The net result of many emails was this:  I did not receive an Ultraviolet copy.  I do have the movie; therefore, I pursued this loss no further.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series sprouted from what was probably a small idea into a long and beautifully-crafted story and backdrop.  It is impossible to not be fully engaged with the characters, making it ever more heart-wrenching when Howey decides to kill them off.  I can't wait to read his other books!
B00992CF6W|2.0|it was fun at first but now its just repetitive and dull. the game play is good but they could add more...ALLOT more. that just my opinion.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Scalzi is one of my favorite authors; Red Shirts is a comedy drawing on his love of the genre.  You don't have to be a Star Trek fan but it helps.
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|Wish she'd make another album already!  Never heard anything like it!  I'd love to see her in concert some day!
B008JFUPOY|3.0|The characters are from Monsters Inc. so kids will have no trouble following if they have seen the first one.  Other than that it is an animated close of every other college nerd vs jocks film ever made (without the T&A stuff).  That is not to say the movie is not entertaining...  Some of the creatures are creative and fun and the leads are likable and mature emotionally so that the kids will be exposed to some good quality of live issues without being bored.
1401312853|5.0|I enjoyed the fact that it was a modern fable...the message was crystal clear and I have been thinking of time ever since.  Albom has a succinct and articulate way of expressing his views.  The book allows readers to evoke feelings of sympathy, compassion, empathy and sometimes disdain for each of the characters. The number of pages were few, but the takeaway abundant.  I would recommend the book to all who would like a reminder of the complexity and perfection of Father Time.  Andi Sumner
B008JFURKG|4.0|Not quite as good as the original but entertaining non the less.  I am not sure if seeing the first one is a requirement to enjoy this one or not.  If you have this one you might want to watch it again before this one just to get up to speed on who's who.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just upgraded this game and omg. I cant stop playing it lol. my little brothers always go on my kindle/ipod.band play SUBWAY SURFURS. That game is just awesome. No Way to say it. IF U DONT HAAVVEE THIS GAME GET IT NOWWWWWWWWWWW.
B001BPJJ82|2.0|Beyond my area of interest and too strange for anyone not a native of eastern Europe.  Save your money and watch something better.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Before starting this novel I went back to where it all began and re-read the Shining.  Since it was quite some time ago that second read made it feel like both novels blended into one.  Stephen King did not disappoint!  I loved it and I expect that you will too.
B003EYVXTQ|3.0|The thing about this movie is that it is about life in the mountains of West Virginia(?) where people are DIFFERENT.  The kudos goes to the casting director.  The story itself if different enough to keep your interest and the twisty road it takes is full of surprises.  If you live in a metropolitan area you might think the movie is about outer space.  But, part of the pull for this movie is learning how different life is today for people we never knew existed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is amazing for people to play on and is enteresting for people to be on for a while
B003ZSJ212|3.0|This is coming from a very big Star Wars fan.  The bonus features are amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed watching those. The thing that I did not like so much is that, with all of the remastering, the movies look very fake in several parts.  It makes it look like a cheesy sci-fi version of the original star wars.  You really can't beat those VHS versions lol.  I really thought I would like the HD, but other than the spectacular sound, the effects looked cheesy in HD.  Sad....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I haven't cried so much reading as book in a very long time. I loved it an  I'm so sad it's over. The book was wonderfully written full of hilarious parts as well as its sad scenes. I highly recommend this book. It will show you a different perspective on life itself and make you wonder what is the purpose of life really about.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game with bright colors and super addicitve. I can only  put it down when I run out of lives.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|****spoiler alert<br />I  know  this  book received a lot  of negative reviews because  of  the  ending.  Certainly can't be because it was poorly written-it wasn't. The fact is if Tris had not done what she did, she would not been the character we all became so attached to. Roth did an excellent job. It may have been extremely sad, and not the ending I wanted, but it was an ending I believed an  it was incredibly poignant.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it doesnt work on my kindle fire hd but it says its download so im a bit mad about that
B008JFURII|5.0|Love, love, love this movie series.  The mix of humor and action keep you interested all the way to the end.  Also love the mix of characters!!!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game  is....... AMAZING. Me, my brother and my friends LOVE playing  together. We already have a mansion that go's into space. BUY THIS NOW. IF YOU HATE THIS GAME AND DON'T GIVE IT 4 OR 5 STARS, I WILL FIND U!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />.
B00004XOWM|4.0|A lot of time ago was looking for a CD of limp bizcuit.<br />I found this and you prop they gave to me the CD it to come out to the cellular one or to the PC.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have been waiting for this game forever and its awesome<br />Batman to superman it so much fun<br />Great app
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|It wasn't to bad but it's not like how this other music used to be just don't seem the same him smh
B00908DDZM|5.0|Love Macklemore and his album is awesome!  Defnitely buy his album with confidence.  if you're skeptical check it out on youtbe first.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked the thorough descriptions of everything<br />U felt like u were right there watching.  Very intense and strongly addicting
B0094BB4TW|1.0|DOWNLOAD SUCKS. REFRESH DOESN'T WORK. PICTURES DON'T APPEAR WITH NEW FEEDS. CUSTOMER SERVICE KNOWS THE PROBLEM BUT CAN'T FIX. HATE IT RIGHT NOW
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book thief is an excellent book full of both heartache and happiness. I very much enjoyed and recommend it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It is such a compelling story. I was overwhelmed by the cruelty and the generosity of the characters.
B005KDWUFA|4.0|This group is outstanding.  While they sometimes are too bombastic, and often are unintelligible to one who doesn't speak Italian, the performance is excellent.
B004XWLN20|5.0|So I grew up a Marvel Comics fan in the sixties.  Specifically, Spiderman.  Stan Lee captured a young man growing up trying to fit in with the crowd, which, as a teen at the time, was something I strongly identified.  The emotions of this turbulent period were so different than just a few years before.  DC comics, at the time,  seemed to be locked into the World War II era where we simply needed superheroes to take care of bad guys.  They tended to be sappy and, in the campy Batman series of the time, patronizing.  I think Smallville has been the best superhero show on TV to date.  The show developed the characters and their relationships over a ten year period in which it was obvious that they had a vision of the denouement when the pilot was written.  Throughout the seasons, the recurring theme of fitting in resonates like a Lady Gaga song.  Yes, there were some clunkers, and the meteor rock infection was overplayed at times,  but, the regular kryptonite infections were true to the comic book and inspired some pretty good storylines.  The lineup changes were particularly appropriate for a young man growing up and moving on with life.  I appreciate that the show reached out to former \\"superman\\" cast (especially tying in Christopher Reeve in as an important character to the storyline).  They did an excellent job of explaining the Lana to Lois as girlfriend transition and Lex's descent into evil.  It ended on a great note, and true to the promise that I understand was made to Tom Welling, \\"no capes\\", at least until the very last shot.  Smallville was a great show for teens of any age.  If any of the cast, writers or producers sees this post, wonderful show and thanks for ten years of great entertainment!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Read the whole series. Enjoyed them. Great novel. Lots of suspense, action, and intrigue.I would recommend the whole series of books.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|I got this as a gift for my husband. They're high quality recordings conducted by John Williams, not bogus arrangements. If you love his soundtracks you need to get this album.

0060936223|5.0|Awesome book. If you grew up in the 80s and remember the village as it used to be, it brings you back to those days. Amazing love story.
B005LAII8A|5.0|Looper stars Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt and is written and directed by the exceptional Rian Johnson. Rian creates a world that is at times trippy and entrancing. This movie is a perfect movie to watch on DVD because you will want to watch it multiple times to catch new elements you may have missed. The I feel would be great to invite some friends over and watch and maybe talk about afterwards. I loved this movie and would recommend it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Love the whole story!  I have a retail background and can appreciate the vision.  A normal person could never have accomplished what Bezos did.  We're all benefiting from his determination to change the way we buy things.  Wow.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|The Lincoln Lawyer is a great movie that went under the radar when it was in theaters.  This movie showcases  Marisa Tomei and Matthew McConaughey's acting skills.  Matthew McConaughey will likely get an academy award nomination this year for his performance in Dallas Buyers Club.  This movie shows his growth as an actor.  The movie is a thiller that features great character actors as well like country music star Trace Adkins.  The movie is well constructed and had me into it from the first scene on.  This movie is a perfect DVD to buy and have a fun Saturday night viewing party.  I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|how come it skips an update the goes to the next because it went from 0.7.4 then it skiped 0.7.5 then went to 0.7.6 and i really
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|I watched this in theaters in 3D and thought it was totally awesome! I took my friend, who is a casual viewer to the series, not a big time fan such as myself, and he even loved it! I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I can say this, it's possibly the best \\"Dr. Who\\" of all time. Steven Moffat really did a fantastic job writing this one. The Doctor (Matt Smith) is united with his previous incarnation (David Tennant) as well as another Doctor (John Hurt), a previous unknown Doctor who is a much darker Doctor that has actually renounced the \\"Doctor\\" title. The Doctors' adventure stretches from 21st century Earth to Gallifrey during the Time War. We see the return of the Zygons as well as the Daleks. Billie Piper returns. Plus we get to see a cameo appearance by Fourth Doctor Tom Baker! All in all, an epic action-packed adventure that is both dark and uplifting, dramatic and humorous, and did I mention action-packed?! \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" will make any Whovian's day... even some none Whovians such as my friend. Very Highly Recommended! Happy 50th \\"Doctor Who\\"!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|...now, I can't wait to see the movie.  I hope the movie stays true to the characters and the story.
B005PK1G76|4.0|IT COMES IN HANDY WHEN YOU HAVE A STROLLER WITH NO CUP HOLDER (IT'S ISOLATED WHICH IS A PLUS!!). AND IT ALSO HAS A SMALL ZIPPER POCKET GOOD FOR YOUR CELL PHONE, ID OR LOOSE CHANGE WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR HANDBAG AT HOME FOR A QUICK OUTING. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS ORGANIZER IS YOU CAN REMOVE IT FROM YOUR STROLLER AT ANY TIME WHEN NOT IN USE.
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|Very intriguing story always wondering when the Sycamore Row was going to appear and what form it was going to take<br />One star short of being one of his best
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I think the game is really cool. I especially love the BRIGHTNESS. I also think it's cool how one move can effect the 3rd one after it.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|This was a great movie and I can't believe I just now saw it. The story was good and the actors did a good job portraying the characters. I hope to see more John Grisham stories on Amazon Prime soon!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i really like the game but i just wish that everything was not so much money and that i could do whatever instead of having to wait or something
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game moves much faster then the original. The quest are good and you level up faster. The only thing the storage is too small.
0679720200|4.0|Novels based on philosophical theories often suffer from being lengthy and often arcane however Camus manages to portray the essence of existentialism in this short well  structured story.<br />The main character Meursault displays a detachment from events occurring around him, including his mother’s death and a general indifference to the other characters in the story.<br />His eventual predicament and ultimate fate, fail to generate any noticeable emotional change in his demeanour and he retains his stoical outlook to the end.<br />This book can be read on differing levels and irrespective of which one you choose it will prove to be worthwhile.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Have you ever wanted to take a minecraft build you made in creative mode and you want to put it in survival? Well,  here is your answer!  But,  I haven't tried the pro version. One bug- if you are in survival and have stuff in your invuntory, and you use this app to go into creative. If you don't put the stuff in your invuntory to a chest and change into creative,  you lose the stuff in your invuntory after changing back to survival. So,  remember to store important stuff before changing!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great after I corrected a WIFI password issue.  Cannot connect to a secure network with more than a 63 character password.  Not an issue for most people but I'm paranoid; I like long passwords.  Shortened it to 63 characters and now it works just fine.
141694737X|5.0|This is one of my kid's fav books.  Sturdy flaps that withstand being turned by little ones! (over and over)
B00DF0POXA|1.0|I was sent the old album late registration.<br />I didn't get a great deal I paid for something I already had. Uncool amazon. Uncool.
B006FTCH2E|4.0|I would ideally give this 3.5 stars. But that's not an option, so I'm rounding up! It was an interesting film visually and intellectually, but I found the pace over the first half of the movie could have benefitted from a little bit more momentum.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Catching Fire, the second book of the Hunger Games starts exactly where we left off the first one. Katniss returns to her district and starts off on the victory tour with Peeta. The love angle...er...triangle develops more, but Gale appears only intermittently and we see more of Peeta in this one. This book starts off boringly, but there is a stunning twist midway that made my insides twist. You will scream No, No, No... President Snow cannot do that. But then again, he is the President and he can do whatever he wants. I cannot tell you the twist without spoiling it.<br /><br />The second half just picks off super fast, and we turn chapter after chapter to find out what will happen next. The end is a masterful cliffhanger. I was like clicking the next page on my Kindle to see if there was more...but it was the end. I am so glad I already have the third book to continue where the author as such at intriguing junction.<br /><br />Having said that, there are some points that really hurt the book. The editing of the first half is very sloppy. Whatever happens after Katniss returns home is told in third person narrative. It is all 'tell', no 'show' and hence we don't experience first hand her first meeting with Gale, the disclosure to Peeta that her love was fake, etc. All these points take away the fun from the story.<br /><br />But this is a trilogy, so overall the second book sets up the stage well for the third one. My hands are itching to read it... and so will yours!
B0007TKH66|3.0|An up and down season with more than a few very good episodes and the beginnings of major ongoing storylines.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like being able to share my success and frustration over this sweet game, though getting stuck on a  level for days on end!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|a great game.  it is kid friendly, but it is also silly fun for grownups.  I just wish it wasn't determined to connect to social media.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|solid bond movie. good action, great villain, even a little nerdy at times.  No crazy parkour scenes, but still worth a watch.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I really like it because it is a very simple app and to the point. I like the layout and look.  I can easily find the information.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game is so well done that it elates me.  Three of us actually enjoy paying and playing this incredibly well done strategy game.  THANK YOU, IRON HIDE STUDIOS SO MUCH!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is so fun it is just really FUN!!!!! I love this game it is awesome and really fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|After downloading this FREE app. All I could do for hours was play. Smacking minions around and well,  having fun! If you like temple run or playing with crazy gadets,  this is the game for you.
B0026772N8|1.0|I really didn't like this book, despite hearing great things about it from other people. I didn't think it had much to offer, it wasn't interesting and I didn't even want to pick it up once I had started.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|A lot of great actors play interesting characters.  Fast paced.  Great stories from good writers. Can't watch only one episode.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its okay for a while but my 7 year old got tired of it quick.  I wouldn't recommend it for the older kids.
B00ESNE696|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better.  The actors are top-notch and the writing is intelligent, discerning, and topical.  The characters are fleshed out; not one-dimensional as is the case of many dramas today.  Julia Margulies plays the &#34;good wife&#34; who is married to the philandering Chicago state's attorney (played superbly by Chris Noth).  She returns to work as a lawyer after a 15-year hiatus spent raising her children.  Without giving anything away, the upheaval in her life is challenging and demanding.  I watched the first 4 seasons on Amazon, one right after the other.  Season 5 offers the same high quality entertainment, with all its twists and turns; I am eager to see what this year brings.<br /><br />For those who like political and romantic intrigue, this is the cherry on top of the sundae.
0385537131|5.0|Oh mine! What an excellent read. GJ never seize to amaze! Will  highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a great legal thriller
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This is one of the most definitive Sherlock brought to the modern age.  It is a much better version of Robert Downing Jr on the screen and a far superior in contrast to the elementary series produce by CBS.In comparison to the classic PBS series with Jeremy Brett is a different flavor.  If you are looking for an ultimate adaptation to the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle version, this will not meet your satisfaction.  However if you are in search for a twist of the original chronicle this will be an ideal for you.  The second season the writer from the current version of Doctor Who had not only modernize the Arthur Conan Doyle version but it place a greater analysis of Sherlock Holmes in the modern day society. Benedict Cumberbatch is just superb as Sherlock Holmes among the many tales the Scandal in Scarlet was an interesting intrigue in the introduction of Irene Adler.  Her strength in deduction equal to Sherlock and the female actress is by far a superior version in comparison to Rachel McAdam's version on the silver screen.  The support cast is just superior in all aspect this should be attribute the production company in delivering a superior script and detail of how Sherlock uses its power of observation and the element within each cases.  This is a most have for any Sherlock Holmes fan.  Season 1 is equally great.  However I had found season two is far more superior..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages, even my 4 year old loves playing! We love trying to solve the puzzles together.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I loved this spy thriller which reminded me of a classic James Bond movie. Damian Stevenson writes with the same literary panache as Ian Fleming, the subject of this book and ‘Operation Parsifal.’ Both thrillers are fantastic. Strong recommendation.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My son solved the puzzles in this game on his own... good puzzle game for kids. Maybe they will add more levels.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|I have loved ‘Scarface’ for many years and was thrilled to find this book. It is awesome. There is so much information in these pages, including original essays, interviews and a wealth of facts about the original production,  its reception and the movie’s place in popular culture.  A brilliantly written and informative book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Thank goodness,  I had the audible version and could also read along as so desired because &#34;I read&#34; it in  less than 4 days<br />It made me sad, happy, anxious, I could not not put it down. This book was recommended to me, and now I will recommend it to<br />Several people.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|This is a great story on what I see a bestseller. I am usually not the type to read this type of genre but this book has definitely changed my perspective on this type of books. I really like the descriptive writing style the author has. I felt as if I were inside the story myself.<br /><br />This science fiction book will definitely have you hooked from the very beginning. I thought it wouldn't hook me but it actually did so for this reason I had to write a review for it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Smiths always puts out quality products, needed this one for a badly dulled knife. Like the fact that it has a rod for serrated blades.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|Just great  I love the Agatha Christie stories  This is one of the best  although I love them all I suppose I'm a Christie Addict
B00992CF6W|4.0|Umm person who was wondering how to update umm apps you go to app store and then press apps and then press the button with all the lines and then press app updates. And this app is addicting but Xbox is way better!
B001EBWINQ|5.0|One has to revisit rick place every decade or so to compare life in that era to the insanity of the twenty first century
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Its awesome. I have been waiting for this since it came out. You guys should get this app. BEST GAME!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Couldn't put it down.  A friend recommended the book, I had never heard of it.  Finished it in just a couple of days.  Aging out of foster care is a abrupt process for many and I can't imagine that most of these kids are ready for the harsh world we throw them into.  It is a process we need to fix.  I am glad that Victoria was able to make it work for her and to also go back and help others!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!! I play it all the time, and my brothers even steal my Kindle Fire sometimes to play on it!!!!! I love everything about this game, and it will entertain you for hours at a time!!  I would totally recommend this for you if you are extremely creative, and have money on your account like I do. But , this app is definitely worth 7$. So, I would recommend buying this app.<br /><br />Pro's-<br /><br />-Creativity beyond our imagination<br /><br />-Realistic animal sounds<br /><br />-You are able to download mods for it-<br /><br />-There are a lot of blocks on there that aren't even in real life<br /><br />-There are monsters to battle<br /><br />-There is survival mode<br /><br />-There is creative mode where you can build anything that you want without even finding it<br /><br />- On creative mode you can fly<br /><br />Cons-<br /><br />None.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|I really liked it because it kept you guessing right until the end the plot was very clever.  It was classic Grisham.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is sexy and its out for Kindle Fire!!!&hellip;sexy sexy sexy!!! GET THIS SEXY APP AND HAVE FUN ITS SEXY AND WE MAKE SEXY AND SEXY AND SEXY AND SEXY AND SEXY AND WE REPRODUCE THIS APP TO EVERY ELECTRONIC!!! Dont forget sexy!!! Ah come on sugar daddy!!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|A great science fiction book I was a little disappointed in the end. It seemed to have great detail during the main story then kind of just wrapped up. Will read the next one in the series though.
B00GT1TANM|5.0|Amazing album by Mr. Williams. Full of life and a great celebration of all that is swing! There are covers of classic swing songs, but also original material in the form of many duets on the album. The album is excellent, I would recommend the deluxe version not only for the bonus tracks but also for the video of Robbie recording the various duets because that's a gem to see. How exciting to see this album is offered in the USA in mp3 form! Long live swing, and long live Robbie Williams!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Took a few levels for me to get into Candy Crush but now I'm hooked like everyone else. Finally up to level 229. I only wish I could get into exercising the way I have gotten into this game.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun game, no forced purchases ...unless you're very impatient. I managed to get a rainbow Dragon very early, so now I have to wait until I save up 300,000 coins for a habitat. But Amazon has had quite a few free coins deals lately and I have enough to get the second nest. :) works for me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just got into Angry Birds with my new Kindle. Did not understand why my sister was so into such a simple game. Now I know. Almost can't wait to run out of lives to play Angry Birds.
B002NPUCIA|4.0|Excellent musicians. Very good album. I will buy other CD's of this pianist.<br />I'm glad I met this interpreter. And the attention of Amazon has been excellent
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I am a senior in my early 70s, so the situation in this film delighted me. The acting is superb. The scenery colorful. The interaction and life lessons rewarding. A delight all the way round.
B000JMKO0A|5.0|Very well written and intensely engaging! I loved the ending :)!!! Highly recommended if you're looking for a good book!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Best series on TV! This is one of the best series on TV combining zombie horror with post apocalyptic life.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I first saw King & Maxwell on TV and loved the show. The book does not disappoint. If you like David Baldacci books, you will like this one.  Baldacci is one of the best story tellers around and this one will hold your interest from the first page.  And now we know where Edgar comes from.  The story starts with a \\"dead-man\\" switch in Afghanistan and ends with saving the POTUS under 20 feet of water in the Patomic.  There are lots of twists and turns in between.<br /><br />Richard Ruppel
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I know the film didn't get a lot of praise but as far as the release goes, I am happy. The only issue I have faced is downloading the digital copy to iTunes, but I know it is an Apple issue since it is happening with others. The slipcover is very nice and overall PQ and AQ are very good.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Earlier this year I began hearing the radio ads for this collection. I thought nothing of it until late spring/early summer. This was something that would be an aid in a weird way for a certain situation.<br />If you are hurting, confused and maybe nursing a broken heart the way I did, (and still doing that), this is something you need to listen to. It's a worship album, of course, but more centered around getting into the presence of Jesus and giving your hurting soul to Him. She even talks at a certain point about how our 'praise and worship' is our weapon against our enemy.<br />This disc really spoke to me and I pray for whoever needs to hear this will be reached. It is worth the few dollars you'll end up paying for it.
B004AU07O0|5.0|another go to cd at christmas time...her vocals are amazing...and it really gets you<br />in the christmas spirit...wonder what a xmas from her today 13years later would sound<br />like omg i bet it would be even be even better
B00DCZ34CG|5.0|This movie really does &#34;make you believe in God&#34;.  Very touching and thought-provoking movie.  Received quickly and it played well.  LOVE this movie
B00AREIAI8|3.0|i wish there was an easier way to get coins ant coins. it gets old having to wait for them through tasks. also is is quite hard to gain energy quickly.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|Not only is Christmas Vacation my favorite Christmas movie and my favorite comedy movie, it ranks near the top on my personal list of movies of any genre. I've seen it so many times I know the dialogue by heart. I know what's coming and I still laugh out loud - every time. THE BEST!!!
B00AVTMCYW|1.0|This movie does not keep you guessing. I am shocked by the high reviews. I couldnt even watch the whole movie in one sitting. Worst movie I have seen in a long time.
B0014DCTCY|4.0|Great album, and pleased that it came with a CD copy as well. My record came warped in the mail, which was a bit disappointing.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great read with strong characters.  I liked the blending of history with current times and how human nature remains the same despite the decade.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Fascinating look at how the brain works.  Jill Bolte Taylor weaves together basic information about brain function and her own compelling story.  I enjoyed the whole book, including her experience of living in the right brain and how that felt. The book is simple and clearly written - highly recommended for anyone who has an interest in it!
B004GXL8GC|1.0|Way smaller in size than it appears on website. Overpriced for what you get. Not a good deal. Should of read reviews before purchasing.
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|I do hate to write a less than positive review. I found the book Very Predictable , and just felt amateurish to me.
B005LAIGRS|1.0|A weak attempt of a Jason Bourne movie.2 old CIA guys beating dust off eachother.Denzel has been the new Nicholas Cage for few years now lol.Overhyped movie with crap plot.please do Not listen to these positive reviews they are very Misleading save monay!!!! Get it on Redbox it is worth one Dollar if u wan good laugh this movie is joke:)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Out of all the games I have played this game, Solitaire,  is my favorite.It is so addictive. If you have ever played Candy Crush and liked it so much that you were costintly playing it that is how addicting Solitaire is. Anyone that has not downloaded Solitaire yet better get it or I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND MURDER YOU IN YOUR SLEEP!( Or If your a cute boy I will just download it on something. Then I will pull off all my clothes and wake you up, take off your clothes and make out with you. After that,  you will want more trust me,  we will have rough, hard sex untill I get pregnant.) THANK YOU FOR READING MY REVEIW!
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|I understand why people don't like this movie because it feels like Cars with planes. But I liked Cars and my son liked Cars and we both like Planes. It is just a fun movie.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Lots of fun.May be addictive to some people.played for 3 hours without realizing it . Fun to play against friends and family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|about time yay &quot;&quot;<br />I've been waiting and waiting for a kindle app. I'm going to even start fresh. I can't wait for it to load.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|heartwarming and inspiring, I think anyone who reads it will be affected.  Gives a lot of insight into<br /><br />different aspects of terminal health conditions.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I loved re-reading this old book again... truly a timeless classic!  If you enjoy science fiction, it is a must-read.
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|Through my experience, there is nothing defective with this product. It will play excellently on any latest blu-ray player models of any brands. I bought this title a month ago, and it cannot play on my Toshiba player manufactured in 2010 and updated to the latest firmware available. Then I decided to get a new unit, and bought me one of the latest Samsung models. The discs play nicely and there are no sync issues at all even when I hooked the player to the audio system. In my opinion, the only way that Warner Bros can do is produce new 3 discs set, similar to the previous releases, to enable majority of the buyers to fully enjoy it on their current/old players without having to buy a new set.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Perfect! This is the Christmas album you will never tire of hearing. It is exactly right - no matter the occasion. Music to wrap presents by, music to hold a dinner party by, music to dance while alone in the house, music to make your heart sing...this is it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. It was different but in a good way. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure with a hint of romance.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great Game. Interesting missions, likeable characters. The graphics are great and the ease of play make this game a good one for all ages to play. I really enjoy this one myself as does my entire family.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|too many statistical facts and not enough about the actual hits he made. I would have liked to read more about what he felt during each hit and what he thought as he watched his target.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! If u love subway surfers or temple run you would definitely love this game! Great for kids and very fun to play.
B0036G8IQS|4.0|Reading is not my son's favorite thing to do but he loved that he could listen and follow along on his Kindle.  It was a great Assistive Technology device for him.  He is now on to the next book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|First 2 games freeze but after that the game is awesome. This game rocks and has many different locations to run and many different characters.
031632406X|1.0|Very poorly written. I gave up about 10% of the way in. There may be a good story here, but I couldn't get past the bad writing and unnecessary political statement.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Hey guys this app is cool and fun.And I'm not a cool Dude.BTW My name is Danny.I love chess and checkers. I hope you enjoy this app.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm thrilled that Kindle finally got this app. I love playing Candy Crush and its easier [on my eyes] playing it on my Kindle Fire HD vs. my iPod Touch. My only issue is that when I type a letter not all the names starting with that letter come up, when requesting [lives through FB]. It's frustrating going in and out to select more people.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I love reading especially spy books but when a friend recommended this book to me I thought I would give it a try.  I started reading the first book and I was enthralled.  It is rare for me to really get into a book to the point that I feel that I am being transported to another world but Martin does that in these books.  The way that he writes is masterful and this series will surely put him among some of the greatest fiction writers of all time.  I think it is rare when you see a \\"classic piece of literature\\" develop in front of your eyes but I think that is what is happening with the whole Game of Thrones series.  We are witnessing a classic being born.<br /><br />Now as for the format on the Kindle, as mentioned by other posters, it does leave some things to be desired like the lack of real page numbers.  However, I am of the opinion that the story more than makes up for these little things to the point that I really don't notice them anymore when I read the story.  I just get transferred to King's Landing or Winterfell or bedong the Wall and forget about those little things.
B001YV506S|5.0|Brilliant movie. Beautiful to watch even though corny at times. Good acting by most in the movie.<br /><br />Excellent video transfer and audio on Blu Ray.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It may look just like regular flow when you start but it is pretty cool I would recommend this app!!:)
B005IQ39AY|1.0|This is a typical &quot;match at least 3 of the same color&quot; and watch them disappear type game.  I have been playing it for years and this was one of my favorites of this type of game.  But then for reasons unknown, the game started throwing me out when my score got too high.  So stupidly, I decided to reinstall it.  BIG MISTAKE!!  This game is now loaded with ads or other games by this dev.  You cannot get in OR out without having to close those things, and since there are multiple ads its often just easier to use the home button to escape!!<br /><br />The game was mindless and fun, so why did you have to mess it up with all the self promotion??  :-(
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Lots of fun whole family likes it. Starts out easy and with each level u need to think a little more.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was looking for a nice little word processor for my Amazon Kindle HD tablet and I was coming up short.<br /><br />I tried several but they never delivered. I wanted something to use when I am servicing my auto at the dealer, and the service manager calls me into his office and tells me I need various work done on my car which may amount to another $400 dollars. Sitting in the waiting room, I can read a book, and when I am talking to him about my vehicle, I can access a folder in my word processor under auto and easily check when I was there last and what service I had done. I hate being taken for a ride so to speak and paying for work I don’t need or already had done. I like having all and any of my information at my finger tips.<br /><br />I downloaded several apps and then deleted them since they didn’t fit my requirements. No big deal. I used Office Suite, wouldn’t work for me. I also used Office Suite Viewer 7. It was view only. I could add info but not edit, which I felt was the purpose of a word processor.<br /><br />I read the reviews about Office Suite Professional 7 Pro. A lot were negative, and few were good. Some stated it didn’t work. Problems from the app shutting down from time to time to not working as stated.<br /><br />Amazon had a special on Office Suite Professional 7 Pro, 1/3 off the regular price and with my purchase they gave me several hundred Amazon Gold Coins to use for future apps to buy at any time. I love Amazon!! With this offer, I pulled the trigger and bought it. Closest thing to Microsoft Office I can find.<br /><br />Amazon really takes care of their customers. I must tell you that they stated you must download the free version before you download the professional in order for it to work properly. No big deal.<br /><br />All I can say is I must have gotten lucky with this app, or the developer updated this program because of short comings posted by viewers. This program works GREAT and is exactly what I was looking for. Works as stated and I can enter and edit any item I want. Also I can place items in folders to be named for easy access at any time. All I can say is this fits my needs perfectly and I would recommend it to anyone. It also has a spread sheet you can access on it if needed. One more thing, one person stated this app works only when your wifi is on. I found this not to be true. I can turn off my wifi and it still works perfectly.
B00081MUY0|5.0|A  great album! I remember my first trip to the Philmore auditorium (summer 66') this was played in between band performances.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's good for on the go<br />This game is even addicting . I suggest you get this app you'll be happy in the end
B001MIVTVS|4.0|good compellation of a few albums. There are a few memorable tunes herein. 'How high the gull flies, ore Islay, how sad the farm lad deep in play...&#34;
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Good to great has been on my to do list for years, and boy do I wish I had read it years ago. The chapters are short, concise and straight to the point. They reveal concepts that are so glaringly obvious but so easy to disregard. A blueprint for greatness indeed.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This is the best game in the world I love it.it is soooo much fun and I am a girl and I like it is ant that cool
006202406X|5.0|I love it! I like the alternating voices, I think it's the perfect poignant ending to the series! I can't wait for the movies!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I rated it three stars because:<br />1) It needs a power supply (another cable, ugh), my TV didnt have USB input, product page didnt spell that out at all.<br />2) It can basically only stream chrome browser, it needs to be able to stream divx video to be worthwhile.  If there was a decent chrome browser plugin for that (key word : decent) it would annihilate #1 and be worth 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Three stars only cuz it was so cheap.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|1 word... ADDICTING! I love so much about this game. It keeps getting harder as you progress, so you are constantly challenged. The extras in the game are both appropriate and hilarious! This game gets you coming back for more by appealing to your need to win and be rewarded. After you have finally accomplished all of the missions, you reboot and start all over. Loads of fun, and the music gets stuck in my head long enough to put a smile on my face. When is last time you got to ride a dragon?
B000TRXRUY|5.0|Bruce lee is the best action  hero in kunfu movies  of all others. No one can top his  speed and strength
B004I1AGTC|3.0|I was so thrilled with IP Man that I immediately rushed out to get IP Man 2. Viewers should understand that this is simply not as good a movie as the first one. That's not to say that there aren't parts to be enjoyed... the scene with masters fighting on top of an unstable table was fantastic. However, the idea of Eastern martial artist versus Western boxer has been done too many times, and in this case, the evil boxer was just WAY over the top. The Chinese people would have drug his arrogant body through the streets, and I can't imagine anyone complaining. If you've seen Rocky IV (remember the Soviet giant played by Dolph Lundgren), you have this movie to a tee.<br /><br />Donnie Yen was excellent of course, but the English voiceover was kind of cheesy. Overall, not a bad movie, but not quite up to its predecessor either.
B00GDFVTZQ|5.0|Entertaining and challenging.  It has funny cartoon antics and classic silly Rayman theme music.  Hours of entertainment for a very modest price.  But then again, I'm an old guy who used to pay 30 dollars for PC games.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book was awesome.  No one can tell a story as well as Stephen King.  If you really liked the Shining, you will not be disappointed.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzil is a wonderful actor, and the movie kept my interest throughout. I liked the storyline, which I'm certain has happened.
0857208748|5.0|A wonderfully exciting story, had to read it in one day, a real page turner.  Vince Flynn and his writings will truly be missed by me & my entire family. We've read every one of his books and found them all to be great.  Rest in peace Mr. Flynn.
B001NLCBJI|1.0|awful, boring, slow, pointless, point less, point less, point less ,no more words are needed, that would waste much more time
0316044695|5.0|Well written, I had tears in my eyes in many parts of the book.  It is the story of a really brave, loyal, feeling, dedicated servant of the American government.  It also highlights the injustice the liberal media plays in reporting almost anything concerning the United States military.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I recommend it to anybody who likes science fiction. Once you start reading, youll never stop. The book is just amazing, really
B00FATEJYE|4.0|It's actually a nice app all but I played this on my friends tablet except it won't install  as fast as other apps will.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game, I can spend hours just playing it. The only issue is that I cannot seem to be able to receive more tokens without buying them.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Hillarious and raunchy! Jason Sudekis and Jennifer Anniston are a perfect pair. Super funny, but with a great story mixed in.

B00G32OER4|5.0|This movie was terrifying! The fact that it was based on true events made it all the more scary. Haven't seen a movie that made me scream in years, but this one did!

B008VBYN80|5.0|Great detail. Awesome. I would recommend this game to others. Would love to see an expansions. The only thing bad is the waiting requirements... but like all farming games.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|awsome app. challenging and unlike others it is expanded with BOTH new terrain and vehicles both with their own strengths and challenges
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Addictive game but the free edition has a limited number of lives, so is frustrating once you start playing and have to wait for a long time to play again...
B003G4W49C|5.0|Holy Cow! This was one of those books you find yourself making excuses for not doing other work just to get through the next chapter. Absolutely loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE CANDY CRUSH KEEPS ME BUSY KEEPS MY MIND THINKING &amp; IM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ADDICTED! I LOVE THIS GAME DEFINITELY HAS MY SWEET TOOTH CRAVING MORE CANDY CRUSH!!
B00881VLCE|2.0|I would love to be able to give this app 5 stars. I would if it worked right. I really love the make -your -own puzzle feature.
034552554X|5.0|An interesting story, good writing, and characters one can become friends with.  It's a memorable book with a good twist.
B006PZBRCY|4.0|This is a good Father and kids movie. Mom was out shopping and this was the best option for us.
030758836X|2.0|This book started out with such promise. It was witty and made me laugh out loud several times in the first chapters.  The writing is quite good.  Unfortunately, the story went on way too long.  It could have been shortened by about 100 pages.  All the characters were unlikable and very flawed.  The only reason I finished the book was because I had to for my book club.  At the end I was glad it was over and I realized that I hadn't learned a darn thing.  A waste of time in my opinion.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|mildly entertaining.  A little difficult to hook up with friends on GL Live.  Addictive game play.  Free to play, but added content is extra.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is by far my favorite waste of time I just wish it was updated as quickly on Kindle as it is on iPhone. I have it on both but I prefer to play it on my Kindle because the screen is so much bigger.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I enjoyed using Duolingo to learn the basic vocabulary of a different language. It was fast and easy. The lessons go over what you have learned numerous times and in various ways and suddenly you realize that you now know how to speak/understand/read/and write another language. It is the most simple yet effective tool I have ever used to learn a language with and I have tried several.  The best part is it is free and on my Kindle Fire HD. Hard to believe.  I highly recommend this app and program.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Everything that it's advertised....  so simple and easy to use.  If you're tired of watching movies on your laptop and want to move those movies to your big screen TV, then this is the way to do it.  The only thing that I didn't like is that it requires you to download Google's operating system....  which I do not like because it slows down my laptop.  Other than that...  it's a great product.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I would suggest it to any hunter that can't wait to hunt in the off season.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Touching, heart warming story. Loved this book from the first to the last page. I enjoyed how the author worked the past and present together. You, the reader will see what I mean as you get more engrossed in the story. I felt such compassion for the orphans that were being so used and so mistreated. I highly recommend this book.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I honestly didn't know what to expect, other than that this is a pop album. I hadn't read any reviews about it or heard anyone talk positively or negatively of it until after listening to the entire album. I must say, I was quite surprised by this album! Nearly every track is a pleasure to listen to, with the exception of Popular Song (for some reason I find it kind of corny). I already knew from hearing her singles on the radio that Ariana Grande has an amazing voice, a lot compare it to Mariah Carey's. Ariana's singing style, power, range just make the album that much better. I'm sure this has to be one of the best pop albums of the year.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|This game s kind of fun,but they need to fix the problem about being able to go back to the bedroom. Every time I try to go back,it won't let me. They need to put a &quot;how to play&quot; thing,showing us the features and stuff. But anyway if you are really looking for a game that works works out your mind, this is the game. Great for kids and fun to play. Recommendation: 4. (5 is the highest 1 is the lowest)
B004EBZX6W|5.0|My husband loves this app - he's able to show small business owners quickly how well they have their wi-fi set up, and it is very easy to get the information at a glance.  I wish it was available for iPhone - he's always snagging my android!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing! It is very fun for those who like wildlife and bad for those who dislike people killing animals. In this game you shoot deer,that's it,but it is very fun. I thought when I saw it that it was going to be boring but boy was that a lie! I do have to warn you that when you shoot the deer,blood splatters out like a volcano so this game should not be given to kids below 12, I mean u can give it too kids below 12, they would just get really disgusted. Recommendation: 4 (5 is the highest 1 is the lowest) (DO NOT GIVE TO KIDS THAT ARE YOUNG)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I've been a Grisham fan for years but grew a little bored with some recent ones.
B004YM6JLO|4.0|This is my guilty pleasure. I really like this show. It has pretty actors and nice settings and nice wardrobe. The stories can be so convoluted but that is part of the fun. I do not think this show should be watched by young teens as it does show sex between minors. Older teens should be aware of your opinion about this before watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I dont have a smartphone like everyone else . But i do have a kindle fire and I'm so glad i can finally play candy crush!!!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This series has continued to make me laugh out loud. The actors are excellent and stay true to character. It is just a delightful series. I highly recommend this series to anyone.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is more of a TV series about human interaction and edge of your seat survival.  Add some zombies for tension and a evil human enemy and it makes for a thrilling show!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game and hard to put down! I enjoy it a lot. Not too fond of having to get tickets from people to advance sometimes or buy them but its an overall nice time passing game.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Well written, and a remarkable development of some very interesting characters and places. Very much appreciated the homage to Sherlock Holmes and his apt creator.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book breaks my heart in many ways. I know people get mad about this book. But it's never been a happy story. It's more real.
B005ES0YKO|2.0|I have and love the original crocks but these are so clunky it's hard to walk. I wouldn't recommend these.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I think I t was a great price I've been trying to get it but it's been to expensive.<br />love this game
B00GWYSQTU|5.0|After I read this book. I found that It could challenge myself to know myself better, make more happiness everyday and be a better one everyday. The author wrote this book to inspire and encourage the reader to be the best that they can be and guide them towards their happiness. I hope that you feel the same way like I do.  I want to live the better life!
B004JMY312|5.0|Hocus Pocus is the best choice for a family Halloween movie night. I loved it when I was a little boy, and my six-year-old niece loves it now, twenty years later.<br /><br />The writing is funny. The stars are clearly having a blast getting into their roles as the witches. The teen/child actors hold their own. It is fun, scary, clever, goofy, and exciting. Top notch.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although this book caused me to break down sobbing on an airplane (I received many judging glances), this story was incredibly and utterly inspiring. Before this I was always aware of the cancer in the world, but I never really put much thought into it or how it affected people; but after I finished this book in only a few hours (which I very much enjoyed), I finally realized the importance behind it. Now when my dad comes home from his work at the hospital saying, \\"I cured another cancer patient today,\\" I will appreciate it much more and modern sciences concerning it. This novel creates a dimension where it is only you and the book, similar to the one only Augustus and Hazel share. It creates a special relationship between you and the characters- I feel as if I have been there the whole time shadowing them, building relationships with them. I know I will never quite find a book like this again, for nothing can compare to this.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  It kept me interested and enthralled from start to finish.  I am so glad that after several weeks of putting off watching it, I finally decided to see it.  There is some violence, but I found the movie more romantic, mystical, suspenseful, magical and enchanting!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I absolutely love this game is fun and easy to play plus the rewards for leveling up makes it worth it
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book is well written and interesting.  Definitely recommend.  I've already read it twice and can hardly wait for book 2!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Haven't read the book but I will surely will do now after watching this movie :) and I will watch part 2 when I get a chance
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is a good use of time. It can be used to try your responsibility. I would recommend this app to any horse-lovers
0618551050|5.0|Smolin is exactly on target. Physics has been taken over by an unholy cabal of mathematical aestheticists. String theorists own the major physics departments and only hire guys doing the same, tired old un-falsifiable crap. In most physics departments, the &#34;research&#34; has nothing to do with science anymore. It's meta-philosophy - that's the kindest word one can use.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Hahahahaha, I know, I know I am way late to this game and I couldn't be more disappointed in myself because I sure was the one missing out!! I read this in less than 24hrs because I just had to see what Drew said next! I'm gonna be honest and say that this is your classic man whore meets the woman who changes him story! But please don't let that deter you from reading! Drew Evans is the only reason you need as to why you should read this book. Overplayed manwhore plot and predictability aside this book is a new favorite. I could have honestly highlighted the entire book simply because of the things that Drew thought, said or actually did! The man is incorrigible yet endearing and honestly you can't help but love him. Seeing things from his POV is absolutely priceless. I can't say enough about how much I loved how this book was written. I adored every minute I spent with Drew and Kate!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a decade. I bought it three times - two paperbacks and one for my iPAd.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|Good movie for incredible action, but way past believable.  Classic story of the underdog getting the bad guy in the end.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Some juvenile writing - high-school locker-room stuff  that will make you wonder at the maturity of Navy SEALs - but the details about the Abbotabad raid are first-rate. There is no question that the toughest human beings on the planet are Navy SEALs. I'd be an American just to have them on my side.

0465092764|5.0|Bingo. Hit the nail smack on the head. I LEFT physics after a MS degree and switched and got my PhD in geosciences, after where I saw physics was heading. Well, physics as a profession stayed on that train-wreck to dead-head alley, and has largely become meta-physics, or perhaps philosophy. Quantum entanglement may someday provide something useful to society, but string theory is and never was science, and has long overstayed its welcome.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good app but not great just needs more detail in the forecasts. A travel weather info option would be nice also.
B00000F169|5.0|You have to have a certain warped sense of humor - AND have lived through the anti-war 1970's - to appreciate this amazingly funny movie. Friends of mine will sometimes include some of the dialogue in their emails to me and each other. In my garage I have a rough duplicate of The Alien - a beach ball with black spray-paint blobs on it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut the rope some more and time travel too!  Even more silly fun for you.  Just buy it,  it's nit even one buck.
0553801473|4.0|Well written, involving and complex history which is of a fantastical nature but nevertheless engrossing.  Do not expect the usual outcomes or resolution.  This may make it hard to read at times but more like reality than not.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Great character interaction and a world class bad guy.  A must for Star Trek fans. My only complaint was the recycling of old story lines material.
0446310786|5.0|Set in the South in the 30's, this historical fiction story is for old and young.  The characters are fascinating, and there is delightful humor throughout.  It has many intertwining subplots with layers of meaning and lessons for life.  It is truly a timeless masterpiece!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have never learned so much about World War 1 as I did in this novel. I loved the fact that the author Ken Follett seamlessly and almost effortlessly interwove real history with fictional characters, and made the history jump of the page and come alive. This is a must read for all those who love historical dramas, or romance, and even adventure. The pages are filled with everything you can imagine, and I belief there is a wide reaching audience who will fall in love with this work. I can't wait to start the next audio book in the series, and may be able to hopefully swing it for Christmas. I really can't summarize the story line any better than the synopsis does above. So instead I'll give you my highlights. All of the main characters in the book had endearing qualities, and some at the same time you just wanted to choke because of the stupid decisions they were making. It was a realistic portrayal, because no one really set out to be evil or bad, it was just part of their nature, and all the characters had flaws that they had to deal with and struggle with, with World War 1 as the backdrop.  My two favorite characters of the book were Ethel and Billy Williams, probably because I like rooting for the underdog. Both of them had tremendous growth in the book, and I liked that they we're always striving to do what is right, even if it meant going against authority. Although I loved this book, I would not recommend it for kids under the age of 14, as the book can get pretty graphical, gory and steamy at times. It's easy enough to flip those pages or skip ahead on the audio book, but is one reason it's not appropriate for kids to read.
B0038NN3B4|3.0|Although the information was quite good, I had to return the book because on Kindle Fire, the charts are unusable and some of them contain important information vital to the program.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ladies, get your kleenex out for I promise you that you're going to need it when reading this book. I wont spoil it, but let's just say that things don't turn out as expected, as one makes a sacrifice for their loved ones and another gains a family. Tris, Four and their friends finally venture outside the city limits and learn that everything that they've thought important up to that point has been part of an experiment, and that nothing is real. Everything they once believed is turned upside down, and they once again have to fight to do the right thing, which will have an everlasting effect on their entire world and culture. Packed full of adventure, and drama this book felt more serious than the first two, because it felt like we as the readers were finally getting to the true bottom of the truth, and not all these smokescreens. In this book, the author derails from the previous format and tells the story from both Tris and Fours point of views. Once you get to the end of the book, you'll understand the importance of doing this. I listened to this book in audio format, and it took me a while to get used to the actor who was reading for Four, but got used to it about half way through. Really recommend this book for parents to read with their kids (under 14) as some of the content may be too mature. However it is suitable for tweens and older.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br />So I've read a lot of the negative comments that people have written about this book, in that they felt betrayed, etc. But come on people, just because Tris dies in the end and does not have her happily ever after does not mean her sacrifice is in vain. If you even think that her brother Caleb could have pulled off a successful mission at the end and taken the bullet, then you are delusional. In reality, Tris was the only one that would have been able to do it. No one else. She did not just do it for Caleb, but did it for everyone. Although I agree that Four got a bit annoying and whiny, and I didn't really understand his motivation for feeling worthless, I could still appreciated that he was struggling dealing with the fact that everything he once believed in was a lie. I think the author did a good job of putting hints throughout the entire series, that there was more going on here than just your normal city left to survive. It was not that big of a leap to imagine that this was an experimental city. I thought this book ended the way it needed to. Not every story has a happy ending, and I never thought that this one would, but nevertheless life goes on, even for the characters.n't really understand his motivation for feeling worthless, I could still appreciated that he was struggling dealing with the fact that everything he once believed in was a lie.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's an ok game. It could use more animation. I'll play again when they add more rooms.  Not nearly as good as &quot;The Room&quot;.  Needs to be longer.
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Solid album, lot more polished (commercial?) than previous albums. Enjoy disk 1 at lot better with the first 2 songs really good. Disk 2 seems a little pretentious with couple of filler songs. Heck, you're getting everything for 4 bucks which is less than a pretentious cup of carp from Starbucks which you will pass away within a day. At least some songs on this album can be enjoyed forever or till you become comatose from drinking all that carp from Starbucks. Think about it, one can build a library of great music thru Amazon for less than a daily trip to you know where. I'm building mine and get to try out new artists I would otherwise never even know about.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I was really surprised this movie was as good as it was. I'm not a superhero, comic book or special effects fan.  But this movie was GREAT!  The story was accurate, well written and executed nicely.  The special effects were high quality and relevant to the plot,  not overdone.  A GREAT MODERN TAKE ON THE STORY :-)
0385537131|5.0|Mr. Grisham has, once again, prevented me from getting the sleep I need.  This is a wonderful story with insights of the human condition, I'm certain anyone over the age of 40, has encountered.
B00GPWEPZ8|4.0|SAVING MR. BANKS tells the story of when author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) went to Hollywood to negotiate with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) about negotiating the film rights to MARY POPPINS.  As she negotiates - often fruitlessly - with Disney's creative team, her mind flashes back to her childhood in Australia.  Through such flashbacks we learn the extent to which MARY POPPINS is based on her autobiographical experiences.  Thompson's performance is a memorable one; her reactions to Disney's idealized world are classic, especially when she repeats the words &#34;No! No! No!&#34; in tones that recall Margaret Rutherford.  She is also vulnerable in an alien world, which pushes her towards a friendship with her driver Ralph (Paul Giametti).  Hanks' Disney comes across as an avuncular personality with a penchant for getting what he wants, but not without a considerable degree of understanding.  The portrait is an idealized one (apparently Disney was much more ruthless, and did not really get on with Travers at all), but works well within the overall film.  There are sentimental moments, but the ending is particularly affecting, when the film juxtaposes clips from the 1964 version of MARY POPPINS with Travers' and Disney's reaction, as they watch the premiere in Hollywood.
B003GQM52Q|5.0|Excellent actors and plot.  Held my interest all the way through and I had seen it before.  It also had Closed Caption.
B001F12J0C|3.0|the disk labeling is too vague to know in what order to watch the multiple cd's  but it appears to be a great story

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini conveys life's reality in such a way that even though his characters may seem harsh, the prose is smooth, descriptive and full of emotion. It does require the reader to keep a sharp mind to follow the narrative thread.<br />I think it helped that different characters told their story and the timeline was maintained thanks to that. And I really appreciated that the author did so well writing in English as a second language.
B000J1AGQI|4.0|I use this in my military leadership classes all the time. There are great examples of NCO's in leadership positions, junior officers, and senior leadership. I especially like to point out that the women also take on leadership roles while the men are in Vietnam,

B003WKOTXE|4.0|My wife talked me in to watching this movie shortly after we had our first son. It took some deliberating. It didn't exactly seem like a movie I would be interested in. I'm really glad I broke down and watched it. The documentary follows four very different babies from birth through their first couple years. The differing behaviors of the babies as well as their parents was very interesting. Definately worth a watch.

B0062P32V6|3.0|This is the second album I now own by Running Wild. With Black Hand Inn, I can only tell it’s the same band by the vocals except a few influences in the riffing, here and there. At the same time, as I get to know the band better, I like them more.<br /><br />My fascination really stared several months ago when I was cruising YouTube and stumbled across their Final Jolly Roger video. I vaguely remember their name since I had that Black Hand CD but couldn’t remember what they sounded like. So I put on the video and liked it immediately. Then I find out later it was a completely different band except for Rolf. Seems he’s really Running Wild and the rest of the band are just whoever he hires to fill in. I guess for the past decade or so, PJ (Peter Jordan) has been his right-hand man, so the two of them are going strong, especially since they have a side project that just put out an album in Jan 13 with a band called Giant X.<br /><br />Anyway… Shadowmaker has a pretty bad front cover. I don’t mean that in a good way. It’s like something one got from free public domain graphics off the Internet. Sorry. The back cover is a little better. The inside book is great, having all the lyrics, however, there’s almost nothing about who made the music, except Rolf and one hint that PJ was also on there (he plays PRS guitars). Another reviewer said there was a third guy involved, but I guess that’s for the DVD, which I haven’t watched all the way because it’s in German and I hate reading subtitles. Guess I’ll have to watch the rest of it now to find out!<br /><br />As for the most important part, the music, well, it IS a mixed bag. It sounds sort of like Running Wild because of Rolf’s vocals. There are some familiar riffs that are in the correct style, and according to others, maybe stolen from earlier songs. I wouldn’t know since I don’t have those earlier albums. Judging from the music, I like every song. None of them are awful. Some of them are a bit forgettable, but none of them are super-memorable either.<br /><br />The one song that is really out of place is Me & The Boys. It sounds like a Slade cover band. I’m not kidding. It’s out of place with the rest of the songs. That’s not to say it’s a bad song or sounds bad, it just doesn’t fit with the rest of the songs, if they were to have any kind of continuity or theme.<br /><br />Overall, the album is enjoyable and I’ve been playing it quite a bit. Though not earthshaking, I guess it’s better than some comeback albums from a band that probably never should’ve quit in the first place. Maybe it just had to happen for Rolf to realize he knew where his heart needed to be. I think he’s found more focus with Resilient, which from what little I’ve heard of it so far, sounds like it might be a winner.<br /><br />Not bad, but not great. Recommended for fans.orgettable, but none of them are super-memorable either.<br /><br />The one song that is really out of place is Me & The Boys. It sounds like a Slade cover band. I’m not kidding.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Greatest.  Thing.  Ever.  Will continue to get better as more apps are added for it.  Google is hosting a Chromecast hackathon next week and from that we'll start seeing a bunch more ways to use this device.  Check out info online if you'd like to learn more about what to expect.  In the meantime, Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Pandora and casting any tab in Chrome to your TV monitor is what's natively available.  I actually just watched a basketball game tonight full screen on my TV through the Chromecast, however, and that was broadcast on ESPN3.com.  Worked very well.  This is unbeatable at the $35 price, and once the anticipated future apps are added soon, it will become a steal.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The set up was suppose to be fast and easy. Well, suppose to be! It's freaking NOT. After endless attempt that took over 50 minutes it the computer and ipad finally found the chromecast. Praise The Lord!!! If only the configuration was stable, I wouldn't be writing this review, but it lasted exactly two bourse and 37 minutes! The ipad and computer lost the chromecast. Well, I'm on the hunt for this illusive chromecast. This time it took me &#34;only&#34; 42 minutes to reinstall the file that finds this chromecast and to find it. Well, if it only ended there, I wouldn't be here, right? Wrong! The following morning I got lost all connection with the chromecast. Lets roll up our sleeves and hunt this device's signal again. This time it took over an hour, but by noon I already lost all connectivity with the chromecast again.<br />At this point I realized that this technology is a piece of junk and returned it back to the box and shipped it back to Amazon. Maybe it's adolescence issues, maybe it's just not ready for the public yet. Either way, there are better products out there that work much better and are stable. Thanks but no thanks, google.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Love this show!  I just finished the season tonight and am now looking forward to watching season 3.  If you haven't seen any of the seasons, start with season 1 and watch them all.  You won't be disappointed!  I know I haven't been.
B004FEJ3VY|5.0|My grandson loves Transformers and this is one of his favorites. I would buy this again and have bought others very similar since this purchase.
0307887960|4.0|My wife wanted this diet book, and I purchased it for her.  She has tried to use this as a basis for dieting, and she said that it was a good one.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I thought the plot was more realistic of what the Man of Steel would really be about than just appearing. The lead actor carried off the confusion often experienced in freewill.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I saw this couple perform on Jay Leno and was struck with the performance, so I decided to try to find some more Christmas music by them and purchased this CD.  I recommend this to fans of traditional Christmas music who want the simplistic approach, without any jazzed up band or orchestra behind the performers.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|Very confusing. Too much description. Not at all believable. Characters are harder to like and identify with with each novel she writes.
B0029XFN9O|5.0|I love this video.  My family and I never get tired of watching it.  This is a follow up on Home Alone, and the sequel is every bit as good.  The world fell in love with McCaulay Culkin, the innocent, but streetwise, err homewise, child who is very capable of taking care of himself without the help of any grownups, thank-you very much.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is a perfect. Game to help my son learn how to figure things out. Highly recommend  for children to help with problem solving. My son really loves it.
B000QUUD60|5.0|If you like Elvis, you'll like this DVD.  Fantastic, Super, Dazzling. This 90 minutes of concert and behind the scenic footage is breath taking. It is 1970 and Elvis has a Vegas tour planned, he has finished his movie contract and has been reborn more mature, thanks to his 68 comeback.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|I love this movie and i was so glad to have it and also it played like it was suppose to.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|This was perhaps the best book - out of a great many - that I have read on the second world war.<br /><br />I purchased the book but didn't get to reading it for 6 or so months, and then wished I'd put it top of my to-read list much eariler!<br /><br />The wriitng style is outstanding and even though so much is known about the war  -I learned a great amount of new insights,<br />particular from the average person, combatant and non-combatant.<br /><br />Spans the whole war, with a bit before and after, but includes some really interesting battles and theatres that have largely been ignored by mainstream writers of the conflict, as well as all the standard ones with new angles and thoughts.<br /><br />A must read!!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Love this game fun and challenging all at the same time =)!!!!  I'll love this game no matter which version I play.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I LOVED this film!!  What fun - and so serious, too!  Absolutely LOVED it!  Gave it to a friend who's a doctor with Republican views on health care - - He never looked at it.  Pity, too!  He would have learned a thing or two!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well written plot inter webbing three families.  An unexpected turn of events as a kharma debt is painfully paid. Outstanding!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Great book loved it it was awesome I would read it again great people and description  go read it !
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Excellent approach to the &#34;historical&#34; side of the man Jesus of Nazareth, for which little or anything is known through the written word.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Cool little adventure. Puzzles to solve. Only makes you wish it was longer or that there are more to come.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|bought this for my husband as a gift. The packaging is amazing,as is the quality of the movies ! He is thrilled to finally have them on blu-ray !!! This is an excellent set and I would have paid twice as much to see the smile on his face.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It is a fun mind challenging game!  Easy to learn and fun to solve the puzzles in as little moves as possible.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this book in 2 days. I normally don't read this genre, but it was on my husband's carousel and the book jacket caught my eye. I loved it and am starting the next series today. The writing is excellent, character development was complete and the mystery kept me turning the pages. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys reading.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best animal game on the Amazon App store! It is like you are there, perfect graphics! Definitely recommended by me!!!!!
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|As this product contains no less than 35 single star reviews based on the Instant video streaming, I felt obligated to add to the massive pile of reviews praising this excellent episode itself. It's true, there may have been many several little moments of missed opportunity over the course of this 75 minute story where the writers COULD have included a few more fan-pleasing cameos and jests and COULD have buckled to their pressure, at the risk of the stories integrity, but what they did give us where just enough big pieces to set this episode apart as a celebration, and enough little jests and nods to please fans from all periods of the show.<br />  The dynamics between the old and new Doctors are brilliantly executed here, while every little intricacie and parallel within the two on-running stories is presented in top-notch 'Who' fashion. Even if you're fooled by the main plot of the episode though, or not satiated by the little pieces of the Time War that are used as a plot device to set up the the rest of the episode, the climactic twist that sets up the final moments minutes of the episode and takes us back through all 50 years of the shows history-and even a little bit forward- will be sure to leave you satisfied.<br />  Don't let the poor reviews, based on production and release technicalities sway your opinion- this is the 'Doctor Who' episode for the ages.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|It is very fun and tests your brain skills.But it is a short time period before you finish the quest! Please fix.
B00EDPFJA4|3.0|This is in fact a good album and I'd be lieing if I said I didn't like it. However this is the second ablum I've purchased from Drake. Going from his first album to this I just wasn't impressed. I expected to see some growth through out that time but it's not there. I think there's two things missing on this album. A song that would be a complete surprise and a must listen to song.<br /><br />Really good beats pretty much across the board. It's more of a 3.5 star sort of album.<br /><br />I do think drake does copy dreams style in some ways when he does do his all out R&B songs. Often throughout this album I kept thinking of Dream.<br /><br />Drake is a talented guy but it feels like he's settled already. I may just demand more from an artist from album to album. It feels the same as his first.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|My better half bounced the edge of the base of a crystal wineglass on the countertop yesterday and a chip went flying.  I was able to file down the sharp edge and save the glass...  At least it will still look nice in the china cabinet.
B0000029AP|5.0|AH, the early AEROSMITH of the 70´s is pure HEAVY ROCK MAGIC!!!!! The musicians are amazing and Steven Tyler was at his peak.....While i totally love later works like PUMP and PERMANENT VACATION, the 70´s was the time for the true raw ROCK AEROSMITH!!!!!All the songs here are gems like the completely classics WALK THIS WAY and SWEET EMOTION and the fast punk title track and ROUND AND ROUND!!!!!! TOTALLY GREAT!!!!!!WELL DONE, AEROSMITH!!!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|One of my favorite books. Up untill this book, I thought fantasy books were for nerds. Nevertheless, I bought the actual book a few years ago on the reccomendation of a friend and was blown away! The characters feel fully real and fleshed out, making you feel for the characters. Rothfuss takes a logical approach to &#34;Magic&#34; that makes it really seem possible. Also, the world he has created feels detailed and real, not just suited for the character to live in. By that, I mean it feels like this world had depth and exists with or without the characters, in contrast with other books in which the world is unimprotant and is just a &#34;set&#34; the characters act on. I re-read it at least once a year and now I've bought it on kindle.<br /><br />If I had anything bad to say, it would be about the kindle applications. I reccomend you buy the actual book.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|damn scary,the words were better than any special effects,would have preferred some  much better explanation on the origins , you know,some viral,or biological weapon gone wrong,in other words some biological,virologic,CSI rather than just things were so crazy we will never know,which worked for the book but didnt satisfy that one aspect for me
B000HF0ISC|5.0|This movie is a movie about the negative and positive sides of friendship; on the negative side, we see a relatively &#34;clean&#34; guard at the correctional institution the children are sent to part-take in atrocities with his friend, fellow prison guard leader Nokes, and later initially defend Nokes even posthumously in the trial of the boys who took his life, simply out of a sense of brotherly bond; we understand the basis for the guards' camaraderie and fraternity to be the worst - the systematic humiliation and torture of young, vulnerable lives in their care. Antithetically, we see the positive side of friendship and human action later in the movie in the bonds between the victims themselves, and also those of the entire community, which bands around the children later in life, each character magnanimously offering all they can to help restore some sense of vindication to the injured, now grown, children. This is epitomized in the sacrifice of the priest, who violates his entire belief system &#34;as a good father would&#34; - for his &#34;sons&#34; and commits perjury.<br /><br />The film is graceful, but horrifically sad. Unlike some of the negative reviewers, I did not have a problem with the revenge portion of this film; to me, the only detriment was that it was not vengeful enough. Rather than the expedient execution of the pedophilic animals passing for human beings, I would really have enjoyed watching them get tortured in a slower, more satisfying and brutal way (gunshots were too merciful for them). My only thought is that perhaps doing so would have had more of a cathartic effect on the viewer, feeling more that &#34;justice was done&#34; than the author wanted to permit.<br /><br />Because therein lies the true haunting nature of this tale. Even though the boys summarily execute one of the sadistic guards, and help destroy the lives of the rest, &#34;it's not enough&#34;. They remain broken, sleeping with the light on, forever traumatized by theirpast; some cannot even achieve sexual intimacy, while others have lost more than their sexual innocence, but have resorted to a life of crime - an uncertain outcome had they not been so brutalized in their youth - leaving a power-imbalance that they perhaps then tried to rectify the rest of their lives.<br /><br />I know some of the negative reviewers walked away with a sense that &#34;justice is being done&#34; and so these pedophilic problems were therefore &#34;trivialized&#34; in their impression of the movie - because &#34;someone out there is doing something about them, so why care?&#34; I think only if you imagine that killing the slime presented in the movie were compensatory justice enough for the absolute permanent and horrific abuse demonstrated in the movie - could you arrive to that conclusion.<br /><br />For me, it was a tragedy from start to finish. I did not enjoy going mentally to the places this film took me too - the basement with the ill lighting, where the abuse was going on, with the background conversation on the children's mother and all they held sacred. These things will remain seared into my mind, just as though they were real events. Just as the touching scene when the boy looks back in the moonlight on his palm, and remembers joyfully playing with a hose and diving into the water in absolute childish innocence with his friends. It's poignantly, even if terribly, portrayed.<br /><br />I know the film does try to give the victims some sense of emotional victory in that, they see how while their abusers showed the worst side of humanity - antipathy and cruelty - the same extreme was reversed and presented in the actions of the priest, who self-sacrificially gave everything he could out of love and compassion - giving them perhaps the only thing in their lives as a powerful example of the &#34;best of humanity&#34;. Still, I feel, it's not enough.<br /><br />This film is therefore permanently a sad horror story, and it makes one want to hidefrom society as a whole, seeing how vile it can be.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's final film is also one of his best. Eyes Wide Shut is a cinematic masterpiece and a beautiful, dark and strange one.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Click to enlarge the first place for you to care for you and your dog. The first place off for ever
B005HT400A|5.0|A dark, twisted, and funny Lynch masterpiece that is dangerously addictive, and one that finds the director addressing all of his favorite themes. Great acting, music and cinematography all contribute to Blue Velvet's beautiful darkness, and once you watch this film you cannot get it out of your mind.
0399226907|5.0|So happy to get this book for our collection at home. Great classic book that will last for years to come.
B008220DIC|5.0|A great film. Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master may not be for the casual movie-going masses, but the the serious veiwer, it is a challenging and rich piece of art that is endlessly fascinating and thought-provoking. Beautiful cinematography and Oscar worthy performances from Phoenix and Hoffman make this a great film that any self-respecting cinephile must see.
B0047685I2|5.0|This movie is magic. I especially like the ending. One of my all time favorite romance movies to watch on a rainy day!
B00CX7OW1G|5.0|Terrence Malick's TO THE WONDER is a gorgeously rendered and deeply felt film that is one of the most underrated and misunderstood films of the year. Like all of Malick's films, it's definitely NOT for everyone, but for those who appreciate Malick's art like I do, this is a beautiful experiance.
B004IK30S2|5.0|&#34;I love scotch....I have leather bound books....&#34; Anchorman is by far my favorite movie by Will Ferrell. The chemistry between him and the rest of the actors is incredible. Can't wait to see the second movie.
1476727651|5.0|GREAT BOOK I love it. Won of the best books I have read in a while.  I highly suggest it, any one who likes horror books will like this book.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|I fell out laughing during the entire movie. Robert Downey , Jr. is hilarious!!! Best movie to watch when you're feeling like crap!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|If I'm being honest, it was disappointing.  I re-read the first two in order to prepare for the third.  It took me a mere 5 days to finish both, however when I starting reading this one I drug my feet and I think it took me 2 weeks just to finish this one...<br /><br />I thought the explanation for outside of the city was lame and she really rushed giving something so important little details.  I thought the action was slow and not exciting enough.  The relationships were meh.  It really didn't feel like it belonged with the other two.<br /><br />I think the author either rushed to put this out, cut out too much, or wrote the first two and had no idea how to end the series.  I'm so sad because it started so strong and I feel bad for Veronica because I can't imagine how this one could get good feedback.  I do not recommend it and it makes me less likely to recommend someone to start the series not that I know it ends to poorly.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Connect the colored dots without crossing the lines easy on the first level I'm sure that it gets harder .
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's better than the first book and super surprising. I didn't expect most anything. I will immediately start the third book. I just realized how bland this review is, unlike the book.(this review is also very cheesy.)
B003VANOFY|1.0|I was absolutely ripped off. I received a &#34;Dead On Arrival&#34; purchase from Amazon.com!<br />The sound quality is an absolute joke. I am very angry and want a refund for my loss.<br />Amazon should know better than to waste peoples hard earned money so close to the holidays!
B00BATG18K|1.0|I can't get interested enough to finish it after she is taken from her mother. It just seems too contrived.  I liked the &#34;Joy Luck Club.&#34;
B00E8S2JZ4|3.0|I don't own that many movies in Blu-ray, so I still get impresses by the quality of the image. It looks really good! I was able to enjoy the movie in another level from when I watch it on the theater.<br /><br />To be fair, the extended scenes on LOTR were a bit more memorable. It's true that the extra scenes in the Hobbit contribute to tell a much more coherent story, but I completely understand why they were cut from the theatrical release.<br /><br />The other two discs have a lot of extra material if you are a hardcore fan.<br /><br />Certainly worth your money if you really love the franchise!<br /><br />Just a complaint: I HATE REGION LOCKING!<br />One of the extra features that pushed me to buy this movie was that it came with an UltraViolet code to watch it via internet on practically any devise. The problem is that I live in Costa Rica (Latin America) so I can't use the code I paid for in my country because of regional restrictions.<br />Be careful before purchasing downloadable or digital streaming if you are not in the US!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Wow, it always takes a few hundred pages, but once you are there, he has you. I found it so difficult to put this book down. I love the good guys and intensely dislike the bad.  Just what you want at the end of the day. I have enjoyed most of the series immensely and Dance was not disappointing.  Thank you Mr. Martin for sharing your  world.  I am so ready to see who will sit the Iron Throne. Highly recommend.
0061367036|4.0|If you are a fan of the Supernatural show, this is great for your collection. I also recommend all the novelizations
B008JFUPOY|5.0|One of the best family films I have seen in years. Great story, very cute and funny. My husband and I just loved it.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I really enjoyed Pines.  It had me guessing what the town was all about until the last 30 pages.  Definitely worth the $5 - can't wait to read part 2.
B000083C8Y|5.0|Classic Jean Reno film with lots of humor and violence woven into sweet  father/daughter story.  Have to watch it multiple times to catch all the classic funnies and symbolism.
B00GWYSQTU|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who wants to advance their life to the next level. It is a really practical guide to personal transformation and development. I would recommend that everyone read this book because it will help you begin to see life from a different perspective. The strategies within are tremendous. You will easily gain a mastery of your life with this personal breakthrough e-book.<br />I also highly recommend that you check out some of the articles the author has on his blog. The amazing life tools website is a very handy tool box for all your life's needs and advice.
B00G6S8P5C|5.0|Great app. Easy to use, but would be better with soundcloud included. The fx are cool. Overall 5/5 stars bro.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|Fun movie to watch for whole family.  Predictable plot, Good guys win, family friendly.  Still wish Bumble Bee was a VW bug, but Hollywood hooked up with chevy so car fans of the original toys will notice their favorites switched.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I seriously looked forward to this installment of the series, and it didn't disappoint. I just wish some things were different. I do appreciate that Veronica didn't sugar coat anything and let things play out realistically.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Been playing this game for days - love it!<br />The graphics are really nice. You can purchase items with real money, but you don't have to.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I picked this by chance and was pleasantly surprised.  I will definitely be looking to read another of Loans Moriarty`s titles
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I can play all day! it is very addictive and challenging. if you liked it at the fair you will love it here because you. can play at home or on the go.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fills in so much the movie couldn't squeeze in.  Sister in politics.  Far more strategy etc.  Elegantly written.  Fast paced.  Hard to put down.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|If you play too much of this game like I did you get easily bored with this game:(  So did my sis too;(
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|The Circle made me think about the meaning of \\"privacy\\" in a world where we willingly give so much personal information to private companies and about the tradeoff between privacy and transparency. A timely read at the outset of the Snowden era.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great application for tasks. Easy to use. Nice big buttons and screen. I highly recommended it. Go try it yourself!
B00AEBB86A|5.0|Great action story with great scenery, that involves you in technical information about the crime without being overwhelming or boring.  Enjoyed all the actors in their roles, they did a great job of making the story believable.  The story moved you along with it and kept you involved.  Intrigue, deceit, power and corruption v.s. patriotism, integrity, and human decency.  A good movie, especially if you like to see the good guys win in a big way after much suffering.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|Its free but slow to open app and when closing app light still stay on. Do your search flashlight homework before installing this app.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I love the movie.  It's patriotic, has lots of action, some humor regarding the humans involved, bigger than life scenery, good alien creations, some romance and true love between family members.  One of best movies with alien beings that looked reasonable and not comic while being strange.  The world pulled together to face a common enemy.  The good guys won.  Can be enjoyed over and over, by the family.  Can appeal to lots of different interests.  It's a movie you can get involved in feeling the struggles, and the joy of winning, yet it is not emotionaly draining.  It's fun and exciting.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Yes its like that angry bird but different a little weird at times kind of throws you off. Try it.
B005LAII94|2.0|very slow and predictable ...as far as the kidnapping genre of movies goes there are far better ones out there then savages..worth a rental at red box .that is all
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I like this app but every time you get on it asks you to rate it . I like every thing blur that about it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such a fun and addicting game.<br />One thing I would change though: if the game is taking really long to load and you decide to remove it from your device and then reinstall it, all your data would be lost. The game was taking forever to load so I thought I should remove it from my device and then reinstall it. Bad idea. 15 keys, down the drain. I had to start over but it was still fun regaining back all my keys.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book in as much it kept me interested all the way through. I did feel there was an undertone of moral message. But at the end of the book I felt it was rather predictable and left me feeling I need not remember much.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is alot like world of warcraft. Its sooo fun to play online with other people and you can interact with them in different ways. Such as the chat, teams or even talking if u have a headset or your device has a built in mic. this game is truly amazing especially for a tablet device. I actually play this game more than minecraft?! And i LOVE mc. ;) worth the money.<br /><br />by the way i play this game on my kindle fire so i dont know if it works as well on other devices and u should probably have good internet if u want the full experiance.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|I loved this book sooo much i cried and showed more emotion than some of the other books i read. Anna Adams is a genius in her own way.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great characters, brisk plotting, insightful writing. Read in one sitting, couldn't wait to see what happened next!  Like Ann Patchett lite.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Every couple hours I try to watch a video and it closes the app so I have to download it over and over again.

B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Bad quality. Even when I have 30MBPS internet speed, Amazon can't stream the movie in HD. Feels like I'm watching a pirated movie. Wish I could stop right now and get my money back.
B00CSYR432|5.0|Myself and my wife are both enormous Ghibli fans, and both of us are of the firm opinion that From Up on Poppy Hill constitutes the best Studio Ghibli film bar none. Yes, the movie doesn't possess the heavy-handed, unrelenting grief and potent message of Grave of the Fireflies. And no, it isn't another Spirited Away (although that may be a good thing. Spirited Away is so utterly nonsensical that at times I think people are applying meaning where there is none).<br /><br />What From Up on Poppy Hill is, though, is a beautiful love story, set in a Japan struggling to emerge from the clouds of war guilt and reenter the global stage. It's a Japan that we Americans neither know nor remember. While the United States spent the 1960s dealing with racism and the looming peril of nuclear war, Japan looked inwards, fighting to understand its place in the world. Who were the Japanese? What was their identity? What did the future hold for them?<br /><br />Such are the questions that the film's protagonists Umi Matsuzaki and Shun Kazama must deal with themselves. At the movie's opening, Umi labors night and day in anonymity, striving to juggle school work and manage her Grandmother's boarding house; watching as her precious youth slips away. Shy but daring Shun secretly loves her from afar, answering her daily prayer to her deceased father with his own unseen proclamations of love, all the while knowing little of his own dead father's past. After Shun publishes a poetic reply to Umi's flags in the school paper, Umi finally discovers he exists, only to have the two of them rapidly tumble over a precipice into the greatest emotional strife of their young lives.<br /><br />All this plays out as students at their school fight to save an old building -- a literal link to their own past -- from the heavy-handed, eradicative policies of the school board, who seek to remove all reminders of pre-War Japan. Umi and Shun's own fates become intrinsically linked to those of the building, as both discover that the foundations of their future lie buried within the past.<br /><br />Those reviewers who have levied the complaints that the movie is 'slow,' or 'ponderous in developing' miss the entire point. Unlike Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke, From Up on Poppy Hill is Ghibli's lightest and most emotionally-tender touch. And unlike the carefree nature of Kiki's Delivery Service, Poppy Hill's characters are rooted in a real world where the escapism of magic or imaginary creatures aren't available to solve their problems. They, like the rest of their nation, must fight through the trials of their time, to emerge all the more vibrant and stronger.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie enough. Buy it. Buy it yesterday.
B008JFURII|2.0|Saw the first movie and absolutely LOVED it-a 6 star movie in my book.Couldn't wait for Red 2 to come out.Rented it out of Redbox,and watched it.So,so disappointed with this sequel-thank goodness I only paid 1.20 to rent it!!
B008JFURII|3.0|Red (Retired Extremely Dangerous) was about retired agents being hunted by the CIA, and them having to step out of retirement and kick ass once again.  Red 2 is more of the same but, in my opinion, done a bit better.  If you enjoy the first Red you should enjoy this film.  I did not enjoy the first Red, despite some good performances, but I did end up enjoying this one.  I found it a bit funnier, the villain is much better, and the action scenes are vastly improved from the first one.  However, the film still has many of the problems that Red had that drag the movie down.<br /><br />There are many things that the film has going for it.  First off most of the main cast returns here like Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, etc.  We also have new cast members joining in like Anthony Hopkins, Byung-hun Lee, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Everyone does a good job performance wise.  John Malkovich and Anthony Hopkins practically steal the show.  They steal every scene they are in.  John Malkovich was the best part of the first movie, and he is one of the best parts of this movie.  Anthony Hopkins is great in everything he is in whether it is bad or not.  Catherine Zeta-Jones does a good job too.  I’m glad that she is getting more work.  I like how she plays off Bruce Willis in the film.  I think that they have better chemistry than Bruce and Sarah Ross.<br /><br />Byung-hun Lee as Han was also great.  He was my third favorite character in the film.  Han’s character is basically what Karl Urban’s character was in the first movie, except Han, in my opinion, is much better.  He is also quite funny and has the best action scenes in the film.<br /><br />The action is ramped up in this which is definitely a plus.  I thought that the action in the first movie was mediocre at best.  The final action scene in particular was rather lame.  In this movie the final action scene is much more fun and intense.  It felt like there was much more at stake and it was more of a sense of challenge and urgency for the main characters which was lacking in the first film.  The effects were much better as well.  I also like more diverse locations.  The last film took place in many locations as well, but only confined to the United States.  Here we go from America to London, to Russia, then back to London again.  I cannot comment on the 3D since I did not see the film in 3D.<br /><br />There are still many problems with the film.  First off the Mary-Louise Parker (Sarah Ross) character still annoys me.  In fact I find her more annoying here than in the last film.  Like in the first movie out of all the characters I find her gags to be the weakest and not funny at all.  Granted she does have more to do here and she does have a nice moment near the end.  However, she is still annoying and has to be saved multiple times again.  Since she is a main character it becomes a major issue and brings the movie down for me considerably.  Again, she felt out of place and should not have been in the movie.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was this CIA agent played by Neal McDonough.  He was played up as a major threat at the start of the film, but then becomes basically a throwaway character after that, which was weak.  You cannot introduce a badass character in the beginning then just throw him away like that.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of the first Red then you should enjoy yourself.  Even if you did not care for the first movie you might like this.  I did not like Red but enjoyed Red 2 despite its problems.
B00FJ7YDV6|3.0|I PUT THIS ON MY KINDLE FOR MY GREAT GRANDSON, HE LOVES ANYTHING TO DO WITH CHUGGINTON, SO HE IS ENJOYING THIS.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a story  of the effects of a war on the regular people of Germany and how it effected them.  It was hard to get into the book at first because of the lists at the beginning of each section. But by the end of the sample I was hooked.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I loved the game and it was really fun I don't know how you thought about all of this stuff
B000GOWNPU|5.0|This was a dark, haunting movie.  The acting was superb and the story was compelling.  As a Catholic priest, I kept wondering how this same issue would be for me.  Love for one another is the bottom line, and that was truly demonstrated by all the actors.  The young boys were superb!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is one of the best war game apps on the Kindle Fire. Thank you for this game Gameloft!
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|I'm no horror movie film snob, but I know a bad horror movie when I see one. It's crazy how we're at the fourth movie in the series now, and people still manage to get scared watching these things. In case you haven't figured it out, here's the outline for any Paranormal Activity movie:<br /><br />-haunted house<br />-house has tons of cameras set up, be it surveillance cameras or computers with cameras<br />-ghost in haunted house gradually messes with the residents<br />-if there's a kid involved, it's either going to be possessed or can communicate with the ghost<br />-something finally happens in the last 5 minutes and then it's over<br /><br />That's it. These movies aren't scary, they're just annoying. I don't even know where to really start with this one. Unless you're a young kid who's never seen a horror movie before (let alone spent much time on the internet), there isn't anything here that should get so much as a quiet gasp out of you.<br /><br />Alex is a young high school girl living with her parents and little  brother in Nevada. She spends a lot of time with her friend Ben and talks to him with a video chat program on her computer. When the two of them go out to a tree house late at night, they find the neighbor's young child, Robbie, all alone. His mom gets sick suddenly and it's up to Alex's family to take care of the little guy. He isn't very sociable and rarely speaks. As the days go on, odd things happen in Alex's house, like objects moving, weird noises, and a knife flying up into the ceiling when someone is preparing dinner. As if that wasn't bad enough, Alex notices a bunch of cars outside Robbie's house one night, though his mom is still in the hospital, AND Robbie drew a mysterious symbol on Alex's brother's back, which is related to witchcraft. That's a good sign, right?<br /><br />My biggest gripe with this movie is how much of a wasted opportunity it is. The story with Alex and Ben is fairly interesting, considering they're the only two people who are investigating the strange happenings. Alex's parents don't do much aside from the usual mom and dad thing when something strange happens, even when a big chandelier crashes to the ground and almost kills Alex. The kids try to explain things to the parents, and get brushed off like it's no big deal. If more time were spent with these two, who had good chemistry, and less time on long scenes of nothing happening, there could have been a good movie here. The ghost that haunts the house doesn't do a whole lot either. Aside from two incidents, including the chandelier one I just mentioned, all he's really doing is playing small pranks on everyone. Even the third movie, which I consider a bit worse than this one, had a little bit more of a threatening presence with its ghost when it would go after the little girls.<br /><br />And here's the other big problem with this movie, and also the series as a whole. Because the cameras are in fixed locations, you essentially play a guessing game of where a shadow's going to appear or where something's going to fall. There's no suspense because you're expecting something to happen at any moment, and that's not what horror is. There's one part where they even use a cheap attempt at a scare where a cat jumps in front of the camera. I half-expected him to wink at the camera as if he was going \\"gotcha!\\". Did anyone else wonder how these laptops were able to record so much footage? Ben explains that his computer automatically saves every single video chat session he has, or whenever the camera's on it keeps recording and saves everything. The same goes for the phones too, I'm guessing, since this is supposed to be a found footage movie, and with half the movie being filmed on a phone...ugh, I need to stop thinking about this one. As dumb as teenagers in horror movies usually are, it didn't make any sense when something pretty big towards the end was happening, and someone was STILL recording with their phone, getting some pretty clear shots while they were running away.<br /><br />Nothing in the movie scared me, most of the acting was terrible (especially from a returning character), there's too much footage shot in the daytime, and the only cool thing shown isn't even a scare, but a few shots using the Xbox 360's Kinect, with it's infrared tracking dots. Who knew that thing would finally be interesting? The only other thing that bumps the rating up to 2 stars for me is a dumb 'guy' reason, and it's that Alex's mom, played by Alexondra Lee, is pretty dang hot, and when she got some solo screen time, it kept me from falling asleep.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie to anyone. I watched it not that long ago, and actually forgot all about it until I went through my Recently Watched queue. If you're not a fan of these movies, Paranormal Activity 4 isn't going to help change your mind.
B00GN76K4Y|5.0|this is a fun game and is better game than pently shot and is my favorite game and it is also my brother game
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|I liked the way the story was presented, factually, and enough subtleness to keep you thinking for yourself.  When I first saw it in a theatre I came out wanting to free Tilikum and shut down SeaWorld.  I bought the DVD as soon as it was issued and have watched it, each time feeling that we are not being respectful of other sentient beings.<br /><br />I am boycotting Macy and will have words with CBS for broadcasting their parade even if I refused to watch since SeaWorld was allowed to have their float.  Have no idea what it looked like.<br /><br />And I will no longer watch David Letterman for having Jack Hanna on his show this past week.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Does what I want it to do plus some stuff I didn't know I wanted, I can not ask for more.
B00ECLU346|5.0|Excellent ending to the series.... this time they did NOT follow the same recipe as the first two... Mr. Chow rules!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|everyone loves Facebook its great when it works although I  cant really blame the app its  more like blaming my cheap  phone
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I found these episodes interesting.  I had to discipline myself to stop watching. It was like reading a book and wanting to continue to the end.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love this book so much<br />I this It is so cool. I would recommend this book to my friends and sister
B003J27WFW|5.0|i bought this book for my husband and he loved it.  he is a big fan of rush.  i recommend this book for all Rush fans.

B00BSBR9N6|5.0|So glad I read this one!<br />Absolute charmer from page one to the end! This would make for a great movie!!! There's never been a Romantic Comedy where the leading man has Aspergers! And can kick ass!!!! Loved the characters. Loved the story!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|awesome game that I play all the time kids love it to and it is easy to figure out.  I really wasn't to get the rollercoaster
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of the best Grisham novels yet.  An amazing story teller. Highly recommend if you enjoy a blending of law technique with great fictional characters.
0316017930|5.0|A book every parent of school age children should read.  What does equality of opportunity really mean?  Knowing how the game is played, and how that will affect your child's success is thought provoking.  If you have a child with talents or abilities this book could help you maximize his chances for great success.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Fabulous acting reflecting historical events.<br />Action packed storyline complete with suspense throughout the entire season.<br />Each episode kept me fully engaged.
B003CH9PV8|5.0|I've been watching this through Netflix, so I didn't get any of the censoring.  I can only watch so many episodes at a time because I usually watch it on my iPad before going to sleep & it gets pretty dark with the creepy characters and periodic violence. The stuff that can stimulate nightmares because my brain grabs images like a puppy with a toy.  I'll watch a couple of episodes then switch to a comedy for a nightcap.  But it is, as someone else said, &#34;dangerously addicting.&#34;  The juxtaposition of his two personas (personae?) is incredibly well played, and it's full of surprises.  I love/hate it like a bad habit.
0062082841|5.0|It is a HUGE book , full of sketchbook pages as promised . There is a lot of info and photos as well. It is divided in parts , one dedicated to his house , full of amazing collections of props  , sculpts , books , toys... art...  The bigger part is dedicated to the sketchbooks divided into the different movies from Guillermo .There are sketchbook scans and photos from each movie. The last part is for unfinished projects and ideas .<br />For Guillermo del Toro fans but also for SKETCHBOOK fans . It is a visual guide of how an idea drawn in a paper become in a character in the movie. Very cool!
0670024856|5.0|This is a strange and fascinating book, both innocent and erotic. The heroine is a botanist who leads an isolated life at first, but later travels to the South Pacific in search of mosses and the story of her husband who went there before her.  It's a good read!
B0085A9HXS|1.0|You know how some people rate movies by saying style over substance or something alone those lines? Well this movie has neither. This incredibly boring, incredibly pointless, \\"action\\" movie really doesn't have much of anything going for it. They market this movie as being relentless and full of action and one of a kind when, in reality, it's just another s***ty movie that's hoping because they show a little more gore than american movies it will be regarded as \\"brutal\\" or \\"intense\\" or \\"gritty\\". This movie focuses entirely too much on a plot or story of whatever you want to call it, that just isn't there. The action, while sometimes entertaining, is broken up by extremely long periods of literally nothing. Then when there is action, it starts out great but is over way too soon. On multiple occasions I found myself wanting more action but there just wasn't any. For some reason, they thought an action movie required more focus on a overly derivative plot full of cliches and expectable \\"twists\\" than the freaking action. It blows my mind that people even consider this an enjoyable experience. Watch Dredd instead. It's the same movie location and sort of plotwise, except that movie actually has awesome action sequences and a plot that doesn't put you to sleep. Avoid this movie, it's two hours of your life you will regret wasting.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love, love love  this app. I just purchased cordless headphones, and I walk around in my home without checking every few minutes, as with Pandora. I have my own songs on the player.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game! Sure,sometimes you don't get the dragon  you want and gems take a lit of time to collect. But Dragonvale is a great game! Models are cool,and I love the dragons,I recommend this to all ages
B00FAI2IUM|1.0|I understand the freemium concept, but this is just abusing that concept, i mean come on $20 bux for a corvette! Get real thats just overkill. I dont mind pay to play but its excessive, go play real racing 3 a much much better freemium game. This same dev made asphalt 8 freemium &amp; did not abuse the idea. I dont know what went wrong here...
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Wow!  I must say that I've never read any poetry like this before!  I am in my feelings right now.  Each one was delicious and I could visualized the settings.  Enough was my favorite one followed by Chocolate, Powdered Sugar, and Strawberries.  it all flowed together lovely and it was a very enjoyable read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is challenging from start to finish. A great way to pass the time and exercise your brain. It is a simple and addictive puzzle game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love minions and temple run.  This game is so much fun I have to play too. Way better than temple run
0812982622|5.0|A very tough read because of the subject matter, profanity & pervasive disturbing violence. However, this is also a gripping story that does a fine job keeping its focus on the main character's fight to find and preserve some semblance of humanity for himself.  The novel offers a lot to think about (trauma, political oppression, guilt & complicity, state paranoia, identity, the power & function of stories), but it also draws one in emotionally with its depictions of different kinds of love and sacrifice. You care about the characters from beginning to end, despite some of the horrific things they do and go through.  Echoes of Dickens (orphan adventure) and Orwell (political dystopia) are undeniable, but the novel is no imitation:  It stands on its own. A demanding text both intellectually and emotionally.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Bales best Batman yet. His voice was nice and deep. The Actress in the movie is very hot. Very good special effects. The Villan was very good as well.
B000YHG72E|4.0|One of Will  Farells best movies. James Cann is always good weater in comidy or drama.  Bob Newhart is one excellent actor.<br />Ed Asner was good as usual.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Pretty good. Not the same as other Superman Movies. Look forward to the next Movie. Not too over done with special effects.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a great app and it DOES come with all of the fonts! I got this app last night for 99&cent;, which is really funny because they paid me 2.50$ to buy the app. LOL!
B001XCWPAM|4.0|Great to have these movies in Blu-ray. Too bad the packaging is way over sized. Each movie comes in a over sized Blu-ray case capable of holding 3 disks...times 3.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Good hunting game just getting started. Has good graphic. Duck hunting hard to get the hang of going to be fun to get the hang of.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|As usual,  King has another hit, in my opinion.  It will draw you in,  get you going on high and then have you braking to give you a minute to study the situation and decide whether to struggle to get past that level or to do an in app purchase to get help.  Awesome!  King doesn't seem to have the ability to disappoint.<br />Carendalem@aol
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Once you start playing its so addictive that the only reason you stop playing is because you don`t have any lives left to play ... I would totally recommend to all age groups !
B00BATG18K|3.0|Each scene is to wordy.  The story is very interesting, but too many words are used to share the  fate of the characters
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is an amazing app, and there are probably duzins out there that are TRYING to copy it (Dragon story, Dragon village etc.) But they are just failing because Dragon vale is probably the best game IN THE WORLD and cannot be copied.<br />  WARNING if you don't sign into this game with a FB account, you will lose your park and all the time and effort you've put into it. So,ALWAYS sign in with your Facebook. I really wish they would fix that, but yah know, it is what it is.<br />  Conclusion, this is the best game IN THE ENTIRE ****ING UNIVERSE but don't get it if you don't have a Facebook
B0078XHAB4|4.0|A book seamlessly written from the heart.  I loved the author's concept of what becomes of us after we pass on, very comforting, one almost wants to believe  that we never really die , that life goes on in a dimension where we become one with nature and who knows , start a new life in the shape of a new born baby.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|Another book by Dennis Lehane I just couldn't put down.  The only problem I have with Mr. Lehane is he is not writing fast enough.  More, more!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I don't always appreciate book to movie, but....I can't wait for the movie!  Aside from the obvious Matthew McConaghey, would love to offer my casting opinions!  This book gripped me.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I like most of Grisham's books. He has changed his style over the years. This book is different from other ones of his that I have previously read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's a great narration, I couldn't stop reading!! Finished it in two days!! Way better than the movie!Totally worth it.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Maybe one of the best mouse I've ever purchased next to the madcatz ones. Really high dpi and the adjustment control is what I needed to game on Eyefinity.
140006922X|5.0|This book actually contains relatively little that's new. It summarizes a great deal of historical and theological thinking, presenting the results in clear and fascinating detail. Reading the bibliographic citations/notes is as informative & fascinating as reading the text itself. Those who've objected to the book as sacrilegious are well worth ignoring.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I am not a fan of the Mission Impossible movies (or John Woo) but I really enjoyed this one. So, if your idea of a good movie contains a helicopter somehow remaining stable in flight behind a bullet train in a tunnel and someone taking a mask off their face off every couple of minutes, then this movie will most likely be a disappointment. I hated Face Off - passionately hated it. So if you liked that movie go see Mission Impossible II first. Here's my Mission Impossible list  - favorite one at the top and least favorite at the bottom:<br />Ghost Protocol (IV)<br />Mission Impossible III<br />Mission Impossible I<br />Mission Impossible II
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A great story about life in the South today and yesterday.<br />Hard to put the book down. His best since &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;!
B002RXZF6C|4.0|This is a great movie even after all these years. It's also surpassingly short...only 71 minutes. I find it interesting to watch because in my younger years I had this impression of the monster in this movie as being this horrible creation. However, this movie has nuance. He's actually quite gentle to the little girl and really only responds poorly to people when hunted down or threatened. Also, many portrayals would leave you to believe the performances in this movie would be over the top. They are not. Boris Karloff in particular took it seriously and did a terrific job.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect.  I am always losing things, among them the solar powered calculator I use for just about everything.  So glad I found this app for my kindle fire.  Never have had a problem with it!
B0012HF5NC|4.0|This movie is about taking every action cliche and putting them all into one movie but somehow getting it to work. It's a fun movie with great explosions. I usually gripe about this type of thing but not here with this movie. Me likey. It's fun.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Just learning how to play but enjoying this game! Not sure anyone in my city will survive me but I'm trying!
B00GH4R95C|2.0|This could easily have been cut down to an hour or so..... way too long and entirely too repetitive. . When I tried to stream it Friday night I couldn't get it to work. I should have realized that something mystical out there was telling me it was a mistake to order it.
B00GUJP9PG|5.0|It is awesome and fun it is so addictive to play I still cant stop playing I love the new semi what a nice touch
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I'm not usually a zombie move guy but this had a different feel with fast pacing. I also liked how the zombies moved fast and aggressively which made it hard to focus on them and gave the viewer a disjointed feeling.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|The harmonies are perfect, and the solo voices are very nice.  This is a new spin on Christmas music. Not an easy accomplishment in this day and age.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Why oh why doesn't George Martin bring the series to a conclusion rather than spinning out more and more meaningless subplots?  A Song of Ice and Fire started out with interesting characters and a compelling storyline--I thought the first 3 books were amazing.  Unfortunately it got stuck and went from fluid to frozen.  Maybe that is why the Stark's motto &#34;Winter is coming&#34; has always been so prominent--the author was warning us that the story would become frozen before it was finished.<br /><br />I hope the next books bring life back into this originally interesting series. If not they will just add more confusion to a series that has become tedious and boring.
B00GP3NCYC|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults.  Something to make everyone laugh.  Voices are funny and the animation is fantastic.  My kids were very happy when it was available to buy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Thrilling and sweet at the same time, this sequel to &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; re-introduces some of Grisham's best characters. I was surprised many times by the plot turns and could not wait to read what happened next. The end is very satisfying. Yet, I could be very happy with another Jake Brigance tale if the author would be so kind.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun game!  Would be nice to earn crowns faster.  Takes way too long to earn enough coins to purchase buildings.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This is an absolutely fun book about a group of officers on a star ship who discover that their lives are directed by the writers of a science fiction series on TV. I laughed out loud several times and shared their frustration at others. I thought Scalzi did an excellent job of tying everything up at the end. Well written and fun to read! If you like Star Trek or if you liked Galaxy Quest, you will love this!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|A little tedious and hard to get through but enjoyed many of the characters.  Had to force myself to finish it but glad I did.
B00004STPT|5.0|Russell in his prime, and he won the Oscar. What more is there to say. The man showed his heart as Maximus.

B00CE03UOC|5.0|Gonna give 5 stars cuz it works smoothly and is a good time killer. No complaints,  but not a difficult game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed the connection between characters and how it transitioned and came together in the end.  Quick and easy read for a weekend escape.
B00EDUTGB2|5.0|works fantastic I can use my kindle for so much more now. Was so easy to download and use. Great
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved it  just as much as A Time to Kill which is my all time favorite Grisham novel.  Would remommend.

B000G6R7B8|3.0|This was a great watch, until I dropped it on a tile floor. Cracked the glass, and it stopped working within an hour. Perhaps too much to expect that it'd survive a fall on a hard surface, but it would have been nice.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|An easy read with lots of great tips.  Have asked both my teenagers to read it and both said it was a great book filled with some info they knew, but a ton of info they did not know!  Very helpful -- thanks
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Easy to learn. Great time waster. Good graphics. Easy to play and advance. Add me FAWGWOC I like farms too.
B008I43DYU|4.0|but I wish I hadn't updated. The percentage button has been removed from the portrait mode and only appears in landscape. Extremely frustrating seeing as that was the one I used the most.
1612680011|5.0|Life changer. This book will change how you think and see the world of money.  I consider myself very lucky to have picked up this book. It has given me a chance in life.  Without this book I would have probably planed on working my entire life only to retire poor. Thank you Robert!
B001706I5I|4.0|\\"Holiday Whodee Whatee?!\\" Ron Howard and Jim Carey did a great job with this one, stretching a beloved relatively short narrative to a live action feature film. The art direction and casting approved by Seuss' Widow herself is true to the spirit of the classic children's book. The one original song the film features \\"Where are you Christmas?\\" has even been covered by Faith Hill. The additional Grinch origins, love interest and holiday Cheer Meister  Ceremony. What a delight to see Max and the Grinch in the flesh, the make-up on the Grinch and the Who's is surprisingly uninfluenced by the Chuck Jones animated tv classic adaption. And Sir Antony Hopkins as an excellent narrator. \\"Oh the WHOmanity!\\" Carey was truly perfect in this role!  And his efforts impressive even to get the part he didn't wish to break character will filming Man in the Moon so he auditioned for Mrs (Seuss) Geisel as Andy Kaufman playing Jim playing the Grinch, once getting the role he had some special forces anti-torture  training to endure the Grinch make-up.
B009DT9ANW|3.0|Many of the performances are good.  It is great to see this performance live.  However,  I am not a fan of overlong endings to songs.  So that is a negative for me.
B001AQO3XS|5.0|Just doesn't do the book series justice....just kidding... An amazingly innovative & iconic 80's fantasy film nicely fused w/ music by Queen loads of sword fights, flashbacks immortals and SEAN.. F'N... CONNERY people! Yeah, there's no question there can only be one... And 5 sequels, a series...cartoon... A remake... If you love Scotts playing Spaniards, Frenchmen playing Scotts,  beheadings and heroines in mom jeans you'll LOVE Highlander! Queen was so impressed by initial screenings they wrote even more original music for the film. Ricky Bobby will fight you if you fail to see it as an America institution!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Who doesn't like the twilight series.  The book was a bit different but it was wonderful to put a face to the name. I loved all the series. This one didn't disappoint.
