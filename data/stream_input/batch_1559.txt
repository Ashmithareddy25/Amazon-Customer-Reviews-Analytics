B006MVJ2L4|3.0|A voice such as Adam Lambert's comes along only once a generation, if then.  One has only to listen to his sublime rendition of \\"Come to Me, Bend to Me\\" to understand the glory of this man's talent.<br /><br />So WHY does he persist in releasing albums that make him sound like pretty much any other noisy, flashy, over-produced, studio-packaged rock sensation out there?<br /><br />Just as did another enormously-promising talent who hit the big time via a network talent show -- Sam Harris from \\"Star Search\\" of the 1980's -- Adam Lambert is frittering away his gift by confusing dazzle with beauty.  I fear that by the time he finally realizes that electronic overload, vocal pyrotechnics, and relentlessly pounding rhythms are a two-edged sword, no one will be listening.  The people who value musical performance primarily for its use of such tools will have moved on to the next sensation.  The people who love the ability of a human voice such as Lambert's to plumb their souls and conjure up another world will have sighed one last time and walked away.<br /><br />At least perhaps we'll still have a few youtube segments from the days Lambert wanted to be a singer instead of a star to remind ourselves of what could have been.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|CAUTION THIS IS FOR THE 3RD BOOK. MY BAD<br /><br />The book is very predictable. I basically made a prediction 25% througha the nook and proved myself right in the end. Although its nice to watch this couple evolve. It happens rather very slow. I found myself less intrigued to read this one.<br /><br />I pretty much read the book beacause I wanted to see how James would finish it off. The book gets better once your at least 75% through it. Not to mention some of the flashbacks she put in this book are rather confusing to read at first. But u get use to them since they re-occur in the story.[[ASIN:0345803507 Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy (50 Shades Trilogy)]]<br /><br />This book wrapped up the story and was similar to the other two I just wish it wasn't so slow go reveal itself because it was super predictable. Overall it ended well. There's a suprise in the end that's a joy to read :)

B002W1UEW4|1.0|Poor me, poor me.  I suffered so much watching this movie to the end.  Two hours long, que horror!!! This is the most horrific movie I have ever seen. It is boring as hell.  I was browsing through the movies and figured this one would be exciting.  I really do not care about the acting, but I was expecting the action to excite.  It did nothing for me.  The CGI wasn't very impressive either.  It looked very unrealistic.  You could tell it was CGI.  Geesh!  Wait until your library has it and check it out free of charge.  Through out the whole thing I had been wishing it to end and wish I had been watching something else.  It reminds me of an 80's sci fi movie the kind you laugh at now in the present.....generic and cheesy.  Bleah!
0345803507|5.0|I could not put these down. Read 2 and 3 in  2 1/2 days. I'm already having withdrawl and would love to see what their future holds. It ended up being a beautiful love story!!
B00845PV16|1.0|Pu...the first movie was fairly entertaining, but this...I think everyone phoned in their parts..Basically a vehicle for Nicholas Cage to raise some cash. I was consistent, at least...the acting, directing and screenplay were all sub-par..:)
1563898586|4.0|I just finished reading this first volume of this comic and let me tell you, I was not disappointed in the least. First let me say one thing, do NOT see the film version of this comic, its awful in almost every single way! But I'm not reviewing that I'm reviewing the vastly superior graphic novel! Its excellent in almost every way!!! The premise is that in 1898, famous literary characters are being assembled by the British Empire to fight evil. Those characters are Wilhemina \\"Mina\\" Murray from Dracula, Allan Quatermain from King Solomon's Mines, Captain Nemo from 20000 Leagues Under the Sea and the Mysterious Island, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and the Invisible Man. One aspect of the comic is that ,much like the Avengers movie, it acts as a sequel to the source novels, so if you want to know the characters backstory read the novels, or at the very least research them. This can be both a strength and a weakness of the comic, but I myself rather enjoyed it. Another touchy subject of the comic is it's tone. It has many people go on about how Oriental people are evil heathens and how women are weak, fragile and emotional. That may seem sexist and racist, but really its meant to poke fun at the social mores of Victorian society. The men in the League go on how Mina is too emotional when she clearly has far more self control than any of the men in her group. I should also point out that despite the title League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Mina is in fact the leader, which is one of many ways of showing how at the turn of the last century how times were changing. This ranges from a divorced woman revertng to her maiden name to having a female leader, which allows for both dramatic and funny moments. So all in all the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is very smart, creative and fun. I loved Volume 1 and I'll definitely be checking out the rest of the series. Here's hoping you all do the same!
B00005MFPJ|1.0|This would have been great if it had been formatted for viewing in the US! I spent the next 4 hours trying to explain to my Autistic son why he had to watch his DVD on his computer (after I was finally able to find a program that would play it), and he could not use his portable DVD player, that he prefers. Needless to say I was mad, I should have been more careful and spent the extra money and bought the more expensive DVD. I will not make that mistake again, thank you for the lesson, it has cost me more in the long run, and all i was trying to do was save a few dollars still have to buy a DVD that will play on his \\"Little TV\\".
B005LAIH54|2.0|If all you've ever had as a toy growing up was mass produced plastic then you're excused for not wanting uniqueness, individuality, personality in your entertainment toys - not your fault.<br />Yes, the packaging was spectacular, i.e. the CGI. Except that the moving labyrinth was borrowed from Tomb Raider. The burning, fire-ash look, in people and other worldly critters has been around for a decade and is getting old. The CGI craggy canyons, caverns and rock walkways, also heavily borrowed, is becoming a CGI crutch.<br />The story lacked soul; just superficial and bland. Usual, not-creative & stereotypic, gods against gods with humans as pawn.<br />The acting from the first moments had that stand still and RECITE, monotonically, some dialogue that sounded like a mix of middle English and 21st century urban slang. Even the side-to-side head shaking gestures meant to convey some emotion like frustration seemed mechanical and rehearsed. At a point near the beginning an unscripted editing missed Pike (Andromeda) as we see her rolling her eyes in disbelief at what was being said. Neeson, like Willis, must be coasting for paychecks because he's put out a few of these rutted robotic performances recently. Worthington is getting there.

0316056863|5.0|\\"Bossypants\\" was chosen as a book club selection for the summer, and I've found it to be very quick, funny and as edgy as Tiny Fey has been on TV.  The vendor from whom I purchased the hardcover book was very careful to ship it carefully and I received it within the timeframe allowed.  The price for the hardcover copy was in many instances less than many paperbacks! All in all a very pleasurable experience!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great series, great start.  This is a very rich world, filled with gritty, wet, greasy details.  The pacing is fast, there's never a dull moment and the structure really threw me for a loop; I had NO CLUE what was going to happen next.  The chapters end with cliff hangers that made it impossible to put the book down.  Looking forward to see how the powers that be will react to the new order in Silo 18.  I want more.  NOW!
B006OAB3ME|3.0|Paul McCartney had alot of fun making this recording-you can sense it's probably something he's wanted to do for a while. I think he could have chosen more classic pieces to record. As for what he produced I thought it was a little lacking in the jazz style he portrayed. I appreciate his original style much more. He should stick to that in my opinion.

There are a few special features worth viewing as well.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Excellent read. This book will suck you right in. He was a great person and inspired me to prove people wrong when they say that I can't, or won't be able to do something. You can do anything you can put your mind to. It's a shame that this man lost his life so young.
B00000GAIW|5.0|CD players were the best thing ever invented. When i had any LP it would scratch, skip and make back ground noise.

B004QO9WVO|1.0|what!!!!!!Â&iquest;Â&iquest;Â&iquest;Â&iquest;Â&iquest;Â&iquest;Â&iquest; the title said free audiobook so why does this cost 2.99 it just does not make sense please help me understand this
0345803485|1.0|\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is proof that any talentless hack like E.L. James can get published. When its clunky writing and glacier-like pacing isn't boring you into a coma, its trying to pass off an abusive relationship as \\"erotic\\" and \\"romantic\\" will make you cringe.<br /><br />Christian Grey is not a romantic hero. He's an arrogant, stalking, abusive jackass who puts the \\"creep\\" in \\"creepy\\". Men like him are the reason restraining orders were invented. When he's not busy stalking Ana at her workplace, he's giving the reader scorching dialogue like this:<br /><br />**\\"If you're looking for your jeans, I've sent them to the laundry.\\" His gaze is a dark obsidian. \\"They were spattered with your vomit.\\"**<br /><br />Oh, baby. Talking about vomit gets me so hot! *eye roll*<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is not a romantic heroine. She's a whiny, pouty, rock-stupid, obnoxious brat who does nothing but bitch and moan about how everyone else sooooo much prettier than her because poor little Ana is just so brunette and skinny nobody possibly find poor little her attractive. Note to authors--your heroines should be likable and someone people can identify with. Readers shouldn't want to reach into the book to strangle your lead character so she'll stop whining for five seconds. When she's not treating everyone around her like dirt, Ana is treating the readers with insights like this:<br /><br />**His voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel... or something.**<br /><br />The deep thoughts of Anastasia Steele, ladies and gentlemen. If she were any dumber she'd have to watered twice a day.<br /><br />How did this waste of trees see the light of day?

B007C7UZIG|4.0|Installed this up during the Steam Summer Sale so I could give my money even faster to Valve. Works just as you'd expect a mobile interface for the Steam client to work.

0143119680|2.0|I won't go into a summary of the book, as others here have done that better than I could.  However, I will say that at first I enjoyed Harkness' prose and rich scientific information peppered into the story.  It seemed like it would be a supernatural story with substance.  Shortly thereafter, I realized Diana is basically Bella Swan, who falls hopelessly in love with a vampire, and he with her, because she is a very special unique snowflake (I'm rolling my eyes, you just can't see it).  Everything from Matthew's protective warnings that Diana should not trust vampires, to Diana's assertions that she trusts him and he won't hurt her seem to be lifted right off the Twilight series.  While I'd admit that it is more intelligent than Twilight, that's really not a difficult feat to accomplish.
B00006L9X7|4.0|This film has always been one of my all-time favorite movie musical classics; I think I was about 12 when I first saw it in a movie theater--long before multiplexes and hi-tech special effects. Now my 7-year-old granddaughter would like to enjoy it as well, having seen a couple of numbers on youtube. Unfortunately, the \\"Region 2\\" designation was not mentioned on the purchasing site, and when I tried to play it on my American DVD player, I got a \\"region error\\" message. Gene Kelly's dancing and dashing sex appeal, Donald O'Connor's dancing and comedic timing and Debbie Reynolds's dancing and fresh vitality--not to mention the original and pitch-perfect singing of all three--made for a perfect musical comedy ensemble. Gene Kelly's classic performance of the title number never gets old. Just make sure the disc is a \\"region 1\\". The only clue to this potential deal-killer is a tiny (nail-head tiny)icon on the back of the jacket, hidden among the credits, of a stylized world globe with the region number inscribed in the middle.
0812992792|4.0|I thought this novel lived up to the hype. Of course, it should be read with the understanding that it's set in an American's idea of North Korea, which, however well-researched, still makes a significant imaginative thrust into the darkness beyond its notes (not unlike a tunnel soldier forging under the DMZ).<br /><br />But, when it comes to fiction, I'm in the camp that sees historic fidelity as mattering less than the story's truths. In that sense, The Orphan Master's Son is fantastic. Johnson, who writes with the dexterity to mix horror, beauty, humor, and poignancy on a single page, crafts a vision of a country harshly yoked to an all-pervading, state-created fiction that overrules the lives of its citizens. If you the state decrees that you have a new job, name, husband, or identity, then you do. If the state finds your existence inconvenient, you simply cease to be. Yet, the state's power contains a flaw: sometimes the narratives it creates for its citizens give them just a little power to resist it.<br /><br />Enter Pak Jun Do, a non-orphan who, by various turns of events, becomes recast as an orphan, then as a tunnel soldier trained to fight in the darkness, then as a kidnapper, then as an intelligence officer installed on a fishing boat, then as an agent sent on an absurd mission to Texas. Initially an anonymous, dutiful North Korean subject, opaque to the reader, Jun Do gradually becomes someone, both in terms of his official status and his own inner life. Until, suddenly, Jun Do's story is over, and a new one begins.<br /><br />I won't give away precisely how this happens, but suffice to say that there's a layer of meta-ness in which we get to know another character, who exists outside the first story. The overall plot is somewhat non-linear, but I found it enjoyable and never had trouble making sense of what happens. Of course, there's a love story that comes into play, by a strange twist of fate and a daring act of defiance.<br /><br />Johnson's exploration of his characters is emotionally complex, considering how an idealistic state interrogator might compartmentalize his work life and his personal one, his ambitions and his own fears; or the layers of deception navigated by a character trying to manipulate the deluded, yet shrewd Dear Leader, who is running his own manipulation of the same character. Or how a wary trophy wife, freer than most, but far from free, might respond to being issued a \\"replacement husband\\" at the pleasure of Kim Jong Il. Or the unspoken tales of suffering and uncertainty that the average citizen must carry around, making some inner world to escape to. Johnson has the skill to make small details and images resonate in the narrative. The tattoos of their wives that fisherman put on their chests, fragmentary artifacts that drift in from the outside world (on the ocean or through radio), human connections to plants and animals, the use of martyrs names for orphans, the humorously outlandish pronouncements of state propaganda broadcasts -- all acquire a meaning beyond themselves. In sum, I can see why David Mitchell (a favorite writer of mine) made a point of praising this book. It's just as about using a postmodern lens to view the world as his own works are.<br /><br />On the subject of postmodernism, the book does have a few weakness. The different substories are a little awkwardly joined. The use of the aforementioned propaganda broadcasts, with the Disnery-esque displays of patriotism from animals and the godlike benevolence of Dear Leader, to tell part of the story is a clever device, but gets a little exhausting later in the book. A lovemaking session celebrating the glories of socialism was just a bit too much (even for this Cambervillian). Also, a number of the scenes involving Americans come across as a little forced. Much of the problem, I think (possibly exacerbated by the audiobook), was that any scene in which the Yankees talk yanked me right out of Jun Do's mind -- he couldn't have understood them as I did. Readers who prefer strict realism over literary creation might be frustrated with aspects of the story.<br /><br />I was glad Johnson took the dare, though. If it has its rough spots, The Orphan Master's Son is still a stunning accomplishment, and I'm looking forward to seeing where else he might go in his career.<br /><br />The audiobook narrators do a fine job, capturing (among other voices) the interrogator's youthful sense of mission, the stern, moralizing tone of the broadcasts, and the creepy, vapid jocularity of Kim Jong Il.
B008ASLQZW|1.0|Don't waste your time. The first movie was maybe a 2 star movie at best, and had the chance to be great, this one was a glorified turd that should have gone straight to DVD and not been wasted on a bluray disk. If there was a way to get back that 2 hours and 5 bucks I would.

B0012QCZ54|5.0|One of my favorite films ever. I still have not seen part 4, but I'm sure it's not better than this one. The first one wasn't that good and neither was the dancing, but I still wanted to see the sequel. I'm glad I did. It makes the first look even worse. Everything is 10x better. The characters, the music and the dancing. The plot isn't something you have not seen before, but that's okay. The film is pretty much about the dancing more than anything else and that is okay. The two leads are charming and have chemistry. Moose is also charming. He has become a fan favorite. To me he made part 3 decent. The ending is one of best endings ever. None of the other SU films can top it. \\"Step Up 2: The Streets\\" is a fun and entertaining film. I believe all ages will enjoy it. It would've been nice to see an interracial couple as the main couple in one of these films considering the subject matter.
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|Am also a long time DOORS fan, this set is one of, if not THE best example of the DOORS spontaneous, creative live music I have ever heard.<br /> Morison is in good voice, audio quality is good and song selection is pretty good. My opinion, buy it, you will not be disappointed.
0786955570|5.0|Castle Ravenloft is an AMAZING introduction to the Dungeons and Dragons Board Game System. It is fun, fast paced and always exciting. It can have 1-5 players and has a high replay value. The miniatures are not painted, but that doesn't really bother me all that much. They are good, solid quality pieces and the tiles are great stock pieces. If there was one thing I would improve on with this set, it is that the miniatures, while good pieces, could be a bit sturdier. They are normal miniature stock, but for my own personal taste, I prefer the pieces to be a bit more rigid (like in the 1990 MB game Heroquest). That is the only real complaint I have. I ordered the Wrath of Ashardalon and the two Dungeon Commander sets to go along with this game. As an avid RPG player, having the miniatures and the tiles is great, and on game days when we can't think of where to go next, the adventures in the book that comes with the sets can be a great jumping off point to segue into the game session.<br /><br />Overall, I give this game 5 stars and congratulate WotC for putting out a fantastic game. High quality, great content and very high replay value.

B004SQS9FA|4.0|Before THE KING OF LIMBS was released, I have loved every Radiohead album: that's right, even PABLO HONEY. After stepping into more conventional genre with IN RAINBOWS, the band zags by releasing an esoteric concept album about a 1,000 year old tree.<br /><br />Radiohead has been a consistently great band through the years thanks to their approach to songwriting -- melody always comes first. Don't mistake melody for \\"catchy hooks\\" though -- the band's terrific KID A is largely devoid of much to sing along with, but it's always an interesting and pleasant enough listen. THE KING OF LIMBS, however, seems to have thrown melody out of the window. The album's lead single \\"Lotus Flower\\" is the only song that has any kind of enduring effect on the listener -- it's the only song that stays with me from this record. Most of the other songs seem to be unfocused and meandering -- occasionally, nice moments will spring up out of the confusion, but said moments are few and far between. This is a record that you will really have to work to like.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Bloom,\\" doesn't hide the more experimental nature that KING OF LIMBS is about to take. Working off of samples and incidental takes, this album sounds like a mix between AMNESIAC and Thom Yorke's solo album THE ERASER. It's about as accessible as 2000's KID A, but it's unfortunately much less rewarding. \\"Codex\\" and \\"Feral\\" seem to be without much to hang on to in terms of melody or convention. At times, some of these tracks sound half-baked, like ideas that were never quite fully explored (\\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\", or \\"Separator\\").<br /><br />I would like to re-emphasize that this is the only Radiohead record that I don't love. It's not that I'm a lazy listener, it's just that Radiohead have focused too much on their sound and not enough on their songwriting. Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"Lotus Flower,\\" and \\"Little by Little.\\" THE KING OF LIMBS isn't without its nice moments, but you have to search for them.m.

B0011Z76RS|5.0|Through the years, it's been easy to dismiss Linkin Park.  The rap-rock genre that they brought to the mainstream Top 40 has largely died off and been mocked.  The band has changed direction, to the anger of some fans, and Linkin Park is now somewhat of a staple to alternative rock radio.  However, many of the band's old songs (largely in part to the passing fads) don't receive the same replay on radio as their contemporaries.  With all of this said, it's easy to forget just how good the band's debut, HYBRID THEORY, really is.<br /><br />Linkin Park's sound takes hard rock, articulate rap, screeching vocals, and electronic samples and wraps them around terrific melodies.  Throughout HYBRID THEORY, there's not a stinker in the entire bunch.  Songs are concise, to-the-point, and musically, pretty simple.  The band's focus on melody makes many of these songs endure long after their run time is over.  Even over a decade after its release, these songs have stayed with me.  And although my musical taste has changed much in this last decade, I still can't deny the quality of HYBRID THEORY.<br /><br />The special edition version of HYBRID THEORY includes two songs that were not originally on the record: \\"My December\\" and \\"High Voltage.\\"  These two songs are pretty good, and their inclusion is a welcome one.  Both of these tracks were initially released between HYBRID THEORY and METEORA -- it's good to see they have find a home on an album now.<br /><br />HYBRID THEORY nails its genre -- in the same way that Nirvana's NEVERMIND perfectly distilled the essence of the Seattle scene, Linkin Park's debut album perfectly surmises the rap-rock movement of 2000.  At points it feels a bit like an artifact, but the songs here transcend their genre.  Essential tracks to download/sample: \\"In The End,\\" \\"One Step Closer,\\" and \\"Crawling.\\"  Whether you enjoy Linkin Park's music or not, HYBRID THEORY is worth a listen.

1613823606|5.0|Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN is as relevant today as it was during its initial publication in 1818.  The story, butchered by Hollywood renditions, chronicles a young doctor Frankenstein who discovers how to reanimate life.  He attempts to create the perfect being: tall, athletic, and free from disease.  Instead, when the being comes to life, the result is hideous and grotesque.  The doctor flees his lab and his creation only to find his life haunted by his rejected creation.  Modern retellings of this story hold that the monster (who is often inappropriately called \\"Frankenstein\\",) is a lumbering idiot who is afraid of fire.  These versions focus on the horror of the monster.  The 1818 version of Frankenstein's creation is a smart, nimble creature who has become a wretch after finding rejection at every corner of the world.<br /><br />Shelley's original narrative focuses on the horror of being rejected or cast out of the world.  The book often references and evokes Milton's PARADISE LOST, and for good reason.  There are similar themes at work here -- similar ideas about creation, rejection, and the yearning to find meaning in our lives.<br /><br />The Kindle edition is a pretty good public domain copy.  The formatting is great.  There's two introductions: one from Wendy Steiner, and another from the author herself.  There are a few instances in which letters and characters did not translate correctly to the electronic edition (some ol's that format as d's, etc).  Other than a few instances of this, this version is very readable and contains few errors.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who has even a cursory interest in FRANKENSTEIN -- the tale told here is infinitely more interesting and fascinating than the monsters of Hollywood.  Because FRANKENSTEIN is available through the public domain, Amazon is offering this eBook for free.  It's easier to access this great book now than it ever has been before.  What are you waiting for?
0757302661|5.0|I did Hypnobirthing training religiously because I was very committed to an all natural delivery.  Unfortunately, my little man was frank breech (butt down - legs and head up) and because I had lower fluid, there was pretty much no way he was flipping.  C Section it was.<br /><br />BUT.<br /><br />I am terrified of flying and used these calming techniques and I was shocked at how well they work.  Now flying certainly isn't as painful as your cervix stretching 10cm, but as far as maintaining your calm and overcoming trepidation about the birthing experience, I believe this will be very useful.  I did have contractions and was able to stay comfortable and calm.
B001661RC2|4.0|ATTACK & RELEASE was certainly a turning point for the Black Keys.  After the duo released a couple of bluesy-rock albums (good ones at that) to not much public reaction, the band released ATTACK & RELEASE: an album that wasn't afraid to center on strong, radio-ready melodies.  Brian \\"Danger Mouse\\" Burton (of Gnarls Barkley, Beck, and THE GREY ALBUM fame) was brought in to produce and collaborate on the album, and in this record, he serves as a third-member of the band.  His involvement with the band turned out to be a divisive move for longtime Black Keys fans, but this album hits far more often than it misses.<br /><br />Some of these songs do indeed exude a certain hypnotic rhythm that Danger Mouse has made his wheelhouse.  \\"Psychotic Girl,\\" for example, makes good use of Danger Mouse's trademark sound.  The perfect combination comes along with \\"Strange Times,\\" a song that is both definitely raw and dirty, but streamlined just enough to make a perfect lead single.  Other songs however, feel relatively untouched by the producer.  \\"I Got Mine,\\" for example, wouldn't feel out of place on one of the Keys' earlier records.  In most cases, the Black Keys' bluesy, dirty sound is relatively untampered with.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the album seems to have its first half stacked with great songs, leaving the second half to kind of peter out.  The first five songs on ATTACK & RELEASE are fantastic (\\"All You Ever Wanted,\\" \\"I Got You,\\" \\"Strange Times,\\" \\"Psychotic Girl,\\" \\"Lies.\\")  The remaining 6 songs aren't bad, but they just are not as consistent -- the final track, \\"Things Ain't Like They Used to Be\\" is probably the best out of this last half.  It's a mellow, moody song that hits all the right notes.<br /><br />ATTACK & RELEASE is a pretty good album, but it seems to be relegated as \\"the one that came before [[ASIN:B003LXSY60 BROTHERS]].\\"  I would recommend fans of the Black Keys to seek out this album, but for those that are new to the band, BROTHERS is probably a better place to start.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B001663MG6 Strange Times]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B0016673W0 I Got Mine]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0016673Y8 Lies]].\\"r place to start.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B001663MG6 Strange Times]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B0016673W0 I Got Mine]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0016673Y8 Lies]].\\"
0345803485|3.0|I went into this book open-minded although I knew that it would be overrated. The author kept saying the same things over and over and over. Each character was almost like a robot. Grey's long fingers, his pants hanging off of his hips, she runs her hands through his hair, he grunts through clenched teeth, etc. Every sex scene is the same. I enjoyed the emails though they were a bit excessive. I will finish the trilogy but not immediately--an avid reader will understand what that means. :/
B006LSZECO|5.0|Team Nick or Team Amy?<br /><br />A life story, bad marriage vs. good marriage,love for your spouse or hatred. Who are you? What am I? These are the lives of two people who prove life isn't dandy, every marriage isn't perfect. And last but never the least, you never truly know someone as much as you think you do.<br /><br />\\"Life and lessons learned.\\"<br /><br />Sad to say this,but there's no review out there that can do this novel justice. It's just downright jacked up, but so addicting all combined in one. Confusing isn't it? Not only can this author write,she'll leave your mind totally mind-boggled. What an imagination she has, the plot of the story,with twists at every few pages. It just made me wonder \\" is this for real?, is this really happening?,\\" and my biggest question \\"There are really people out there with sick and twisted minds as these characters,aren't there?\\" Well hell, this story was a wake up call. Take your life in stride,and learn from your mistakes.<br /><br />Nick and Amy's, first two years of marriage started off as blissful,intriguing,and loving marriage. Till Amy decides she longer wants to pretend to be the \\"Cool Girl\\" she wants to act and be who she really is, along with having her husband understand her and love her anyways. Let me throw this in the air \\"She's a Sociopath!\\" but a smart woman at best. I'm not sure what I think of the Hero either. I swear for the first time in my reading history. I felt for both characters in the beginning,then I hated both characters. Now,my decision is undecided. This author got me good. Damn she's good! I loved what a wonderful job she did in writing this novel in two different point of views. Awesome!<br /><br />At this moment all I can say is \\"Well darn!\\"<br /><br />Nick doesn't like the miserable wife Amy has become,and all her \\"understandings\\" he wants his wife to feel again,make a few arguments here and there so they can kiss and make up. Instead he gets the complete opposite, fake smiles, fake caring,fake love all in all. So Nick takes a different route, and does the unthinkable, the unforgivable motto that goes on in every marriage. I won't spoil this part of the story. But boy! I'll bet he thinks twice the next time he decides to do anything wrong. And I'm sure he'll think of the future and start doing background checks on anyone that gets close to him.<br /><br />Nick gets framed for his wife Amy's disappearance. But the question is \\"Is he involved?,Is she even still alive?\\"<br /><br />Nick and Amy: \\"My Gosh ,Nick, why are you so wonderful to me?\\" he was supposed to say \\"You deserve it.I love you.\\"<br />But he said, \\" Because I feel sorry for you\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"Because every morning you have to wake up and be you.\\"<br /><br />What a sad but twisted and wicked story. At this point, I want to scream how it ended. But I knew it had to end at some point. I'm stunned and in total shock, while sitting here trying to keep my profanities to a minimum,with a stomach tied in knots. I can't help but scrub my hands down my face and think \\"Did I just read what I just read? Or am I dreaming?\\"  What a sucker punching, gut wrenching story! Like I said above, there isn't many words to describe how I felt about the book. But know this much, the author has a strong skill for writing. It's downright amazing! I gotta admit, I looked up almost every other word in the dictionary on my kindle, but her writing is phenomenal and once I took the time to define the words, all the pieces fit together.<br /><br />This story will WOW you on so many different levels. You might look at life through a kaleidoscope. Everything is in different color pieces. There's never a right or wrong way to live. Neither is making mistakes ever right,we all have different opinions on right and wrong.<br /><br />I've come across this novel based on ratings,just scrolling through amazon and goodreads. The blurb didn't catch my attention as much as the star ratings. I'm glad I decided to take this novelfor a test drive. I'm now a fan and on my way to add many books of Gillian Flynn to my shelves. I'm sure one day I'll need a fantastic story to pull me out from under my rock. And her novels will be the first I turn to.<br /><br />Once again WOW!!!!!for a test drive. I'm now a fan and on my way to add many books of Gillian Flynn to my shelves. I'm sure one day I'll need a fantastic story to pull me out from under my rock. And her novels will be the first I turn to.<br /><br />Once again WOW!!!!!

0375842209|5.0|there is only one word to describe this book that comes to mind and it would have to be 'perfect' but even so it does not do it justice. The unique writing style and the way in which the book is written is just perfect and i love a book that makes you look back and see everything you thought you understood with a lot more depth and understanding that you did not think possible. Read this book.
B00846REIS|3.0|Where do I begin?<br />First of how is this book not considered plagiarism? The similarities between these books an FSOG are absolutely absurd. Any publisher should have picked up on the fact that it is FSOG with a different title and different character names. That does not, however, make it a different book. There are so many similarities I would literally take me forever to list the similarities.<br />However, this book was grammatically written astronomically better than FSOG were. That does not make it a good book.<br />If I would have read this book FIRST I think I would have liked it a lot more than I did. I could just not get over the similarities between the two books.<br />I am the type of person that will continue reading books until the last one comes out. I am hoping that the author has a little more dignity and makes the next book her own. Not another version of FSOG.

0812550706|5.0|I'm an avid reader and I just loved this book.  I used to read Star Wars novels as a kid, and this novel really reminded me of that in the sense that your dealing with a child.  A child blessed with certain gifts, but is put into situations that would break even the toughest of men.  Orson Scott Card truly is a great author and I look forward to reading more of his works.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I decided to join the bandwagon and read the infamous 50 Shades of Grey. Well, once I was over the poor writing style and repetitive description, all I could think about was, wow it is piggy backing off the Story of O.  I read the Story of O several years ago!  Anyway, to cut a long story short.  Not really that impressed considering what I have read before, but ok for the novice erotic reader, or totally frustrated housewife.  I have purchased the next book to really find out what happens next and whether it gets any better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this is a really good book. like most people i read the review and i think people should have and mind before the write something about book. i can wait until i read part two
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I have read many military history and special forces books.  This is one of the best ever.  It is NOT a typical action packed recount of narrowly escaped mission/s or detailed training logs.  What it is, is the story of one of the most amazing people I have ever read about.  This story about Adam Brown is funny (the anthill), patriotic, spiritual, sad, exciting and filled with accounts of one man's never surrender attitude. Awesome.

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|The movie overall is great. The only problem I had was that the begging of the movie is hard to understand cause they have accents but not just that because they have accents through the whole movie but in the begging they kinda mumble and that is why I gave it a 4 stars but once the movie gets going and what I mean by that is like 10 min in it is great I love the premise I have not read the book and at first did want to see this but I had a free redbox rental which they send me once a month to my cell so I let my dad pick what he wanted to watch and this is what he picked and it is kinda funny because he ALWAYS falls asleep during any and every movie but not this one him and I were hooked on it. It def. draws you in to watching it and it made me want to buy it on dvd which is why I have ended up here on amazon talking about it. As for reccomending it I would def. to any and everyone I know. you wont be disapointed. And on a last side note I think Rooney Mara does a fantastic job.

Could of have more detail and it got to the most vital parts to quickly.

0345803485|5.0|This is just hands down the best book I have ever read. I love it and I would love for there to be more and I hope that when they make this into a movie that they will do 3 movies and not just one and I hope that they stick to the book as much as possible.
0307951529|5.0|Do it, get the book.  You will not be sorry.  Don't even read the negative reviews.  There is a ton of great info in here.  The people that say there are no actual tools given, are the people that can't think at all for themselves and they want someone else to give them an exact map to making money on their own and quitting their jobs.  These people will never make it.  If you are one of these people that thinks this book is a perfect map to financial freedom, keep looking.  It is however going to get you started in the right direction.  Most of us big thinkers like to think we don't need motivation, we just want a few good and easy to find facts to get us going in the right direction.  This book has that and more.  Audio version is good too.  Not the biggest fan of the narrator, but I listen to about 2 audio books a week and you will find that.  He's not terrible, he's just not great.  Enjoy.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I love love loved this movie this was the first time I have ever seen it I bought it for my mom cause she loves it and she told me to sit down and watch it with her so i did i honestly at first thought that it was going to be boring and just like hair spray the movie which i dont care for but it was way better and jonny depp was cute and hot in this movie and now I want to buy it for myself. I loved it what more can I say.
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|Before I begin my review, I want state up front that I did not come to this highly entertaining DVD from the point of a Led Zeppelin or Robert Plant fan, as many of the previous reviewers her have. In fact I don't even own one Led Zep album.<br /><br />I first saw (and heard) Plant performing with Alison Krauss at the Americana Music Awards in Nashville, on the eve of their embarking on the \\"Raising Sand\\" CD and tour. It was Krauss, and the incomparable guitarist/singer/producer Buddy Miller - the music director for that evening- that brought me to see Plant. I wasn't sure what to expect (and neither was the audience at the Awards Show) but we were all drawn in.<br /><br />After the Raising Sand project, Plant decided he like the \\"Americana\\" mode and used Miller to put together the Band of Joy. Nashville music stalwarts Byron House (bass) and Darrell Scott (multi-instrumentalist, but also a songwriter with a string of CDs to his credit) were brought in. Singer-songwriter Patty Griffin joined the group and subsequently married Plant in the last month. And there there was Miller holding it all together like glue.<br /><br />This \\"concert\\" was staged in Nashville specifically for the Live at The Artists Den television series and - as others have pointed out - it differs some from the national tour by the group. It runs 77 minutes (to fit TV schedules) so those who saw the tour will find songs missing.<br /><br />As for performance, I thought the band was in fine form and everyone got their own spotlight (not just the rock icon whose name is three times the size of the band's on the DVD cover. They work as a team with each member supporting the other.<br /><br />There are a few interview segments included and then a longer (nearly 30-minute) interview with Plant as a bonus.<br /><br />I'll leave it to my fellow reviewers to provide more details but just say that this is an interesting crossover concept where a British rocker gets to \\"Americana\\" and Nashville's best musicians get to rock out too!<br /><br />I've never seen any of the other \\"Live From The Artists Den\\" shows but, after seeing this DVD I'm looking forward to watching more.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"cians get to rock out too!<br /><br />I've never seen any of the other \\"Live From The Artists Den\\" shows but, after seeing this DVD I'm looking forward to watching more.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

B004LROUNG|3.0|I found this John Grisham novel interesting, but the amount of bad language and sexual inunendos almost overwhelming to the point of ruining the story for me.  I have read almost every novel John Grisham has written and only \\"The Painted House\\" was worse.  I will hesitate to purchase another of his books in the future.

B0086700CM|5.0|The hallmark of a strong game is how quickly can you learn it. How quickly can you get good at it and how long can it be just hard to keep you coming back to try one more time before the repetition becomes monotony or the difficulty becomes frustrating. Achieving the simple replay value that has vaulted games like Pac-man and Angry Birds into pop culture history, Temple balances those elements well and has a shot at being a game we will still be playing years from now.

B004LROMQG|5.0|Merlin seems like an attempt to build off the success of Harry Potter - a TV show about teenage wizards and princes. The series is loosely based on the legend of King Arthur and Merlin in Camelot. I say loosely because it is essentially about the adventures of young Arthur and Merlin. Each episode, the two get into trouble, very much like the early Harry Potter books. However, this show has a lot more spirit than the over-produced Harry Potter movies.<br /><br />What I really appreciate about the show is its maturity, despite its focus on younger characters. The humor is (generally) not slapstick humor, but rather in emphasizing the absurdity of the situations Arthur and Merlin find themselves in. The show gets dark at times and doesn't shy away from death, but also keeps it in good taste - unlike HBO's Game of Thrones, which seems to delight in bloodshed.<br /><br />Merlin also develops its characters, something very hard to do on a TV show. Most TV shows tend to focus on the \\"threat of the week\\" and rush over character development. It's not uncommon for the characters to remain the same throughout. However, Merlin's characters do have their respective journeys. Arthur in particular goes from callous knight to mature ruler with a sense of responsibility. The show also treats the other characters subtly with few heroes and villains. I especially appreciate how Uther Pendragon is never portrayed as simply a villain, but rather a king with heavy emotional and political burdens to bear.<br /><br />Moreover, Merlin stays true to the atmosphere of the Middle-Ages, with a few obvious deviations. I'm not a historian, but do read a lot of history and there isn't too much I've noticed wrong with the historical details of the era. Although given that it's based on the fictional kingdom of Camelot some liberties are expected. Given that this is a TV show, I'm actually quite impressed with the attention to detail in the sets and clothing.<br /><br />Overall, if you like Harry Potter, definitely check this show out.

B0081KTI0E|5.0|The story for Woman in Black is mysterious and begs the viewer for their attention. The opening scenes are depressing and sad, but good building blocks for the over all story. As the movie continues you are filled with questions and suspense. Why do people seem to shun him away? What's their problem? Why is no one cooperative when it comes to dealing with the house and estate? Then, when he finally gets to the house, the subtle creepy sounds, look and events are perfect. Not over the top scary, but enough to put a shiver in your spine. The entire movie is suspenseful, intriguing and creepy-the story line is creative, believeable and heart tugging (especially if you are a parent). I was surprised to see Daniel ratcliff in such a dramatic role so soon after his epic Harry Potter movies, but was pleasantly surprised at his performance. This was a very mature role for him in the wake of his \\"harry\\" image. And i must say, I commend him. He did well. A standing ovation! (But it doesn't stop one from screaming \\"pull out your wand, Harry!\\" during threatening parts of the film. Ha ha.) Overall, a good movie for horror, suspense and thriller film appreciators alike! I highly recommend The Woman in Black.
B000EULJLU|4.0|This disc goes by too quickly, I wish they had put more music on this disc. it is a GREAT ALBUM and should be in all collections
0380730405|5.0|...with only ten books, \\"Rebecca\\" is one of the ones I would pack. I've read it every year or two since I discovered it in 1990, and there's always something new to discover. The language Du Maurier uses is gorgeous. Her imagery is stunning. You can see the violent red of the rhododendrons, the beautiful wildflowers in the Happy Valley. The dialogues are brisk. The narrator's youth, shyness, and inexperience are painful to read, but it's a good pain. You do have to wonder on occasion why exactly she fell for Maxim, since he is often snotty and condescending, but he improves on closer acquaintance. The moment you realize everything is not as it seems is a WHAM on the back of the head--when Maxim finally opens up and tells all, it's chilling and terrifying, but it also makes everything make sense.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained about the nameless heroine, the second Mrs. De Winter. \\"Why didn't she ask Maxim what was going on?\\" they ask. Well, as I mentioned before, the nameless protagonist is very young and sheltered, with little experience of the world. She's shy and has been dominated by strong personalities most of her life, so it makes sense that she would gravitate toward Maxim's strength. It also explains why she is easily silenced on the rare occasions when she does try to speak. Further, there's the time factor to consider. The novel was published in 1938, but the narrator said it happened years ago. If we assume that the story had taken place even just a decade before, remember that 1928 in England was the year women of 21 years of age finally got the right to vote -- it's not as if they were used to going about speaking their mind and making demands of their husbands. Men didn't expect or want them to be opinionated. It's hard for us a century later to remember there was ever a time before women enjoyed the freedoms we have today, but it did exist.<br /><br />I read a lot of books 20 years ago, but the benchmark for quality for me is, did I like it well enough to return to it at least twice in twenty years? There are few that I come back to again and again; this is one of them and will always be.
B005W0ARFQ|5.0|Kerr's Bernie Gunther has moved to the top of my must read list, and Prague Fatale doesn't disappoint.

0399536108|4.0|Tell it like it is. That's just what author Chris Guillebeau does in this book of self-exploration, doing what you love to do, and living the life you want to live. The reader will take a journey with the author as he travels around the world, on a very budget. He shows us how to live freely, break the chains of \\"the common work day\\", save money (how about that!), help others, and as the book title says, \\"change the world\\".<br />I like how Guillebeau basically shuns a college education, stating how one can learn much in the world by actually getting out there and doing something. I personally can relate.<br />He shares on blogging,and strategies to build your own following. And how to make money from blogging and freelance writing.<br />Then there's travel hacking, working to help others, being useful and leaving a legacy.<br />I really enjoyed this book, and probably will read it again. It will definately give the reader a boost of confidence to fly free, and not to be afraid to jump without a net.<br />(Although, as stated by the author, this life may not be for everyone.) Then at least pick up the book and read about it!

B004EBUXSA|5.0|I bought this processor about a year ago and it failed 2 months ago. While inconvenient I was about to upgrade to Ivy Bridge anyway. I called up Intel and their customer service was knowledgeable and respectful and after making sure I had done the proper troubleshooting (which I already had) processed the RMA. I don't use this processer anymore in my desktop as I've already replaced it with an Ivy Bridge. But I am building my parents a PC and plan to use this i7 in it.<br /><br />While I was using it, I was screaming through games and video rendering was a breeze. Don't let the 4-core count make you think less of it. This thing kicks some serious butt when it comes to heavy-duty desktop applications.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I am forcing myself to read it at this point, halfway through and if I could find something else to read, this wouldnt get read any further.<br /><br />Female characters get abused left and right.<br /><br />Its frustrating because you get into a characters story and then another characters story takes off abruptly. Tired of that.<br /><br />Lots of political intrigue, that I dont care about any longer, and didnt really care about to begin with.<br /><br />I thought I missed something at first because there was such a leap into the characters at the beginning of the book I wasnt sure if I had the first book or the second.<br /><br />I would say that I do wish to see the show and may buy the DVDs, but I sure as heck wont be buying the next books to read.

0062082353|3.0|I saw author Chis Kyle interviewed a while back on the Imus in the Morning show on Fox Business News.  I was genuinely impressed by his humility - not so much in terms of his not focusing on the recognition afforded his elite status among this subset (SEAL / sniper), but more from listening closely to everything he risked.<br /><br />This risk applies equally to himself physically - training and combat - as well as to his marriage and young family.  As a USAF vet I saw first hand the toll a lengthy deployment took on both those in uniform and those waiting at home.  The length of the wars in Iraq (where most of American Sniper takes place) and Afghanistan continues to call for multiple and lengthy deployments - all at a cost.<br /><br />The author begins by providing an autobiographical sketch of his childhood and young adulthood.  Both phases in this timeline are effcted by the culture of cowboys and the west.  The story begins to pick up pace when the author enlists and decides to become a SEAL.  A lot has been written about SEAL training and American Sniper doesn't repeat much of what's already well-known and available in the public domain.  Things get more interesting as Chris outlines the training he received in sniper school, then gets deployed to Iraq.<br /><br />Any of us who followed the news in the midle of this past decade know well the settings of the various hostilities.  The author recounts in detail his time 'behind the scope' in a geography that's familiar to many by name only.  An important take-away from this compelling book is how the author and many of our troops deal with the death and destruction that simply becomes part of their 'work' day.  It's difficult for those of us as civilians - stuck in annoying traffic, frustrated on the job or dealing with misbehaving children - to understand.  For many, these wars do not represent a direct impact beyond the nightly news; that is until someone we know, love, care bout, etc. is in harm's way.<br /><br />The author juxtaposes dialogue from his wife in the narrative as an effective way to illustrate an alternative view.  There's seemingly a lot of honesty and candor in this presentation.  As a sniper, Chris acknowledges the roles of skill, opportunity and luck. Too, his post traumatic stress took him to some very dark places.  It was his ability to conquer these demons that allowed him to accept the fate of those he could not save while successfully saving his marriage and having a productive life as a former warrior who's now a civilian.r />The author juxtaposes dialogue from his wife in the narrative as an effective way to illustrate an alternative view.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|So all you Amazons skewered me for my review of '50 Shades of Grey - Book One.'  I stand by my opinion.  To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, 'literature, like art, is in the eye of the beholder.'  My thesis then and now is that those drawn to BDSM stories and the erotic exchange of power would find other, better written tales more satisfying.<br /><br />That said, 50 Shades of Grey: Book Two, was to this reader a far more enjoyable missive.  This is perhaps due to the familiarity of the characters and storyline.  Book Two simply and with more cogent prose better defines the story as each principal character - Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele - come into thier own within the dynamics of a deepening relationship.<br /><br />I found Book Two considerably more compelling than Book One.  There was more character development as well as plot - particularly the ending.  It certainly set the 'scene' for Book Three in the trilogy.  It's one I look forward to reading on my Kindle.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|You'll want more once you finish! Although some elements find an echo in other dystopias - City of Ember for instance -  the sum of its parts is much, much more.<br />Each novella  - there are 5 - that is a part of Wool is so well plotted, it could be read individually. (But you'd want to know more).<br /><br />The idea of \\"going cleaning\\" takes on a sinister resonance here as it means \\"cast off, doomed\\".<br />From where? from the huge underground construction that shelters what remains of humanity - over a hundred floors with IT, schools, orchards, engineering, hospital... all connected by a single spiral staircase.<br />The community is ruled by an elected mayor and has strict rules in order to survive.<br />A series of events is triggered however, when all of a sudden, inside conspiracies and well-kept secrets are unveiled by a few people, at their lives'risk. Is everything really as it seems? It's hard to give more details on the different parts without giving away too much - so I won't.<br /><br />It's a completely claustrophobic world, with breathtaking suspense and great characters. Wool is probably my favorite SF book to date with \\"Ender's game\\" (which I also reviewed).
B007RP4D5Y|4.0|I have been a huge Pat Metheny fan for 25+ years---back before I had a CD player. I saw this concert (the Unity Band Tour) live last night (great, as expected). Most Metheny fans know 99% of the glowing tripe in most of the reviews here already. It's another Metheny record, with a lot of the style carried over from the past. Chris Potter is the big change, but even that has been done before (80/81 with Ornette Coleman/Mike Brecker) and, often overlooked Pat's collaboration with Michael Brecker on Brecker's albums (not listed under Pat's name). Incorporation of that huge \\"orhestrion\\" gizmo is a real novelty (and fascinating to see in person).<br />Don't get me wrong, I really like this CD. It's not striking in originality, though. Not like Pat's collaborations with Brad Mehldau or Gary Burton, Michael Brecker, Jim Hall,  etc. which I think are very original (although not \\"Pat Metheny Music\\" to many).<br />My own .02 worth---Lyle Mays adds a missing dimension to the music Pat does not have with other ensembles. Even that music (Metheny/Mays) can become predictable, though. This album is evolutionary, not revolutionary.<br />Buy it anyway. I'll listen to this over and over---like all my Metheny records (even one of my favorites, also under another artist's name-Upogenie--can't hear that enough!).

0345803507|4.0|Yes, this book contains sexual content. It says right on the cover EROTIC ROMANCE / Mature Audiences. I just heard it was good, I'd see it in every book store I went into, and got curious. I agree with the one reviewer who posed the question \\"Where the hell was the editor?\\" for the first book. There were times where I was pulled out of the story because of random exclamations, especially when it came to a certain \\"goddess\\" (Could have done without that, completely) or subconscious (or whatever. Too lazy to go grab the book and refer to them accurately. Sorry, meeting my sister in a half hour). However, the second two books were really written well and introduced some interesting characters.<br /><br />It's a love it or hate it trilogy, and the sex is of course a major part of the book, not scrapping on the details. It's not always loving and \\"romantic.\\" That's where the \\"love it/hate it\\" divide comes from. People have commented on the \\"bad\\" quality of the writing and I completely agree that that's the case with parts of the first book (but only some parts), and could've done without the goddess or what-have-you, as mentioned. Frankly, I love reading about characters who love reading, and could relate to the main character in a lot of ways (minus the nature of her sex-life. Haha!), which is why I stuck with it. An okay read for the first book, and a good read for the second two.<br /><br />Overall, not #1 on my list of top reads, but glad I kept reading after the first book, and would read all three again. Definitely a guilty pleasure.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I am so glad I called Amazon Customer Service about my old cord for my 2nd Generation Kindle.  I called them to report that the cord that came with my Kindle was crumbling and to find out what cord I should order.  Low and behold, this is the cord that would replace the original.  Not only that it replaced my original cord, but that the replacement would be free.<br />I am never unhappy for calling Amazon.com for any reason, because the Customer Service Reps are so accommodating and friendly and know exactly what it is I need; even when I don't know. :-) I get so nervous when it comes to electronics and it is rare when I can figure out anything.  So, it was a stroke of luck for me to call Amazon.com Customer Service.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Ever since I saw a dog mutilate himself,a car possessed and a spider in a sewer(clowns I'm ok with), I have figured I could write off King as a reader. Now I have to rethink a big library trip. I am going to have to start at the beginning.  This story took me to many places on my mind. Stories that my mom told about how the country felt about Kennedy who was killed while she was pregnant with me. Tales of segregation but even she never saw the plank horror. I have been reading this the last few days as the summer '12 Olympics are on.  I swear I win a gold medal for speed reading during the countdosn minutes nearing the assisination time. Mr King, with tears on my eyes since I just finished your tale,wear you crown well!  Thank you'
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a very good book.  I couldn't put it down.  There are some twists and turns that I hadn't anticipated.  Strong language, but if that doesn't bother you, then go ahead and read this book.  You will not be disappointed.

1408215330|4.0|Indeed this is a great acquisition not just for English language students but for general usage. I believe this is a great tool for daily.<br />Despite of the good trade, I realized a problem with the book that let me quite unhappy. The CD which comes with the dictionary is glued on book cover. The glue is too firm that I can't remove the CD pack without damage my book.<br />I think that it would be simple separate the book and the CD and send it on the same package. Why do you, Amazon, did not this? I have a point that who sell a book should take care for not to do things that could damage the product, even in future.

B004ZWKWQQ|1.0|I am 31 years old now, and loved putting LEGO sets together as a kid.  I recently became interested in LEGO again, and thought this set, the Shuttle Expedition (10231), would be a good challenge that would take some time to put together.  So after receiving this set, I sat down on the floor and spread all the pieces out, making sure to organize them by color.  I start putting the set together and after about an hour and a half I realize that there are no white 2x1 flat/smooth pieces (there should have been 13 of them, so there's no chance that I happened to drop them all).<br /><br />I had never had this happen before, and my dad, who was visiting for the week, didn't believe me.  We both combed back through all 1230 pieces, and I even took everything apart to make sure that I hadn't accidentally used them already.  I figured it was a fluke, so I went online to LEGO's site, filled out the online form, and a little over a week later the missing pieces arrived.  No problem - it was a pretty easy process and I was willing to shrug it off.<br /><br />So...Last night I sit down to put it together again, and about 1/3 of the way in I realized that it was also missing all six of the white 1x1 pieces!  Geez...at this point, I realized that I had become somewhat frustrated.<br /><br />I called LEGO and spoke with a customer service representative, and his only solution was to get the part number and send me out another round of replacement pieces.  He also suggested that I go back through and inventory all 1230 pieces.  I have no complaints about the customer service; the guy I spoke with on the phone was just doing his job, but at this point I'm afraid that I am going to get several more steps in and realize that I'm missing more pieces.  Either I go through and inventory the pieces and call in a replacement order or I take a chance and run the risk of starting the whole process over.<br /><br />What a hassle.  I'm sure it is rare to be missing pieces, but I'm sort of starting to lose faith in the company I loved so much as a kid.  As you can probably tell, I am a little bit discouraged.<br /><br />The bottom line?  This isn't fun any more.ing to lose faith in the company I loved so much as a kid.  As you can probably tell, I am a little bit discouraged.<br /><br />The bottom line?  This isn't fun any more.
030758836X|4.0|And stayed up until 2 a.m. on the last night of a recent vacation to very nearly finish the book. The narrative is very tight and fast and extremely well conceived. I am in the camp that believes the ending was a bit of a let down, but certainly others out there love it. Overall a very interesting book.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This device works like a charm. It had been very inconvenient to store photos taken with cameras other than iPhone or iPad into apple tablets. With this new devices, I can store photo images taken with other digital cameras such as Nikon, Panasonic and so on Into my iPad.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Not the sort of book i would normally read (I'm a Non-Fiction reader). I only bought this book to see what all the fuss was about. However i have read this one and am now onto the second one...Fifty Shades Darker. So....Hmmmm....I would have to say in general it is Very Unrealistic, and repeatative. The same thing (and you know what that is!!LOL) over and over and over and over and over and over and over.......gets a bit boring after the first few times. Not much of a story line , but just enough to keep you wondering and i think that is the only reason i bothered to continue onto the the next book. I probably will read all three of them (the next one after Fifty Shades Darker is Fifty Shades Freed)because after all if i don't now i will be missing the end part of the story and after reading this much i may as well. I think only now after starting to read Fifty Shades Darker (the second part) the story line is starting to build a little better, but it has taken all this time to eventuate. Overall Fifty Shades of Grey is not a bad book. Not an amazing book either. Probably scored it a bit high giving it a 4 star. I think i did this only because it mustn't be too bad if it keeps me intriged as to what is about to happen next (apart from all the usual stuff...over and over and over and over and over and over again). \\"Oh My\\"!!!
B0068FZ1C8|5.0|What a great English film. I've seen it twice now as well warrented. Perfect casting by the boy that plays Billy Elliott. Great movie about acceptance. Yet never over done. Billy's teacher is a good actor too. Hats off. This is not as many English films are, harder to follow the humor or more even the culture. This film Is almost americanized. A must see once for all.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After giving Bk 1 only 3/5 stars, i decided to continue on with the 50 saga and read bk 2.  I happen to REALLY enjoy this book.  It has more of a storyline, though some of the events/characters did feel like addons.  It almost felt like the author just \\"whipped\\" ideas together to create another book for fans to enjoy and to answer the question readers ask themselves at the end of every book \\"What happens next?\\"  Christian is extremely likeable in this book and you feel some kind of connection/attatchment to this couple and their story.  I would definitly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book is enough to keep you interested but can be a bit too much sexual content, so much that it starts to bore you or at least it did me. I did go on though and am almost finished with the 3rd book.

B0047WJ12K|5.0|Great story, great acting, great effects.<br />It's a sort of a Hollywood ending with a twist.<br /><br />I wanted this review to be simple because so many people have already written fantastic reviews.  The Amazon computer, however, is smarter than me and is telling me that my review must contain at least 20 words, and repeated words don't count.  To conclude:  this paragraph can be ignored.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is cute, fun, and addictive. The critters are cute and the graphics are great. The best thing is that you can play as long as you like. There is no limit on energy to complete your tasks.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|Ok, yes it was chilling, no, I'll probably forget about it.  Plus, unless you're a complete imbecile you can see the ending less than halfway into the film.  It's been said that movies use a frequent flashback format to improve a bland script.  This film certainly supports that theory.  Oh and Acadamy Award nomination?  Look at the cover of the film, that's the expression on Tilda Swinton's face for 113 minutes.  Three words to describe this film:<br />Simple.  Boring.  Nauseating.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|MAD MEN is currently moving into its sixth season, and it's unlikely that you haven't heard of it by now. I managed to go this long without watching a single episode or learning a single thing about any of its characters or events. I had, of course, heard of the rave reviews, but the concept (the lives and times of advertising executives in Manhattan) didn't really interest me. Also, I'm generally of the sort that if something has massively wide appeal (see: Twilight), then I'm probably not going to like it. I'm not an elitist; I just find that wildly popular entertainment has usually been dumbed down to have broader draw.<br /><br />At the insistence of friends and family, I finally sat down to watch the first season of this much-lauded show, and -- I won't lie -- I immediately hated it. The characters are pretty much all despicable. The men are obnoxious adulterers. The women are either hollow, petulant shells or obvious caricatures of sexuality for the men to gape and paw at. Right off the bat, the central character -- a charismatic and mysterious advertising executive named Don Draper -- falls madly in love with a rich Jewess he has just met. \\"What the?\\" I said. \\"Has he met her before?\\" By the third episode, I was ready to call it quits.<br /><br />I'm so glad I didn't.<br /><br />It is easy to get tied up in concepts like story and entertainment, but it is so rare to find subtlety, depth, and brilliance in primetime television that I have often stopped looking for them. The more I watched this show, though, the more I realized that there was a true craft at work. Not only is every element ingeniously placed and crafted -- from the soundtrack, costumes, backdrops, asides, cultural references, and glances -- but it is done so in such a way that, even if you aren't aware of them, you can't help but appreciate them. What a joy to finally find a work of art -- and, yes, this show is certainly a work of art -- that actively finagles its way into your braincells. You can focus on superficialities such as whose doing what (or whom) and where the plot is headed, but you will soon find yourself (if even subconsciously) noting how perfectly those larger elements mesh with the show's less overt environment.<br /><br />I was initially distracted by the truly selfish, lazy, and loathsome attitudes of the show's main characters, but I see now that they are representations of American culture as it was, wants to be, and even is today. The show's themes -- success, happiness, love, hope, and commercialism -- are never pounded into the scripts or set pieces, and yet they are so achingly resonant that I ended each episode with a tingle in my neck and an immediate desire to watch it again. It is nearly impossible to watch one without feeling as if there were parts -- important or not -- that slipped your notice or that you would love to go back and fully learn how to relish. Everything from the acting, dialogue, and subject matter ties together in a way that, well, that I don't know if I've ever seen on TV before.<br /><br />Watch it. If you're like me, and you're holding out, you've no reason to. Seriously. Watch it. Then watch it again. It really is that good.can focus on superficialities such as whose doing what (or whom) and where the plot is headed, but you will soon find yourself (if even subconsciously) noting how perfectly those larger elements mesh with the show's less overt environment.<br /><br />I was initially distracted by the truly selfish, lazy, and loathsome attitudes of the show's main characters, but I see now that they are representations of American culture as it was, wants to be, and even is today.

B008CXWX4S|5.0|I love the series. I'm not always the best critic (easy to please) but I love it. Its my guilty pleasure when I am tired of working. And the order process from Amazon was great as usual.
1416972250|5.0|An awesome conclusion to an incredible series. This series is so much fun, and in my opinion better than the ultra-popular 'Twilight' series, although it can easily be compared to that particular series. This is also an Urban fantasy, a relatively new sub-genre that seems to be very popular with teens, because it is usually about a very relateable, ordinary main character that discovers a secret world, hidden from normal humans. The characters in this book are simply outstanding, I loved nearly every one of them, and they were brought to life masterfully. I was extremely sad to see the series come to a close, and wished I could spend more time with the characters. I don't re-read books very often at all, but this is probably a series that I will read again, which really says something for it. I read a lot of books, and this series is a clear favourite for me.<br />If you haven't read the first two books, you shouldn't even bother attempting to read this one, since there's so much going on. I've heard some complaints about how the story is rather predictable, and it is, but it's done on purpose, and written in such a way that although you know something will happen before the characters do, it's still fun to read.<br />The characters are three dimensional and are constantly struggling and changing, and although physically some may not be, emotionally, they seem completely real. Clare really made me care for the characters, and whenever someone was hurt or struggling with something, I felt it along with them. I just thought the emotion in this book was breathtaking. I also found it very interesting how Clare took a subject as frowned upon as incest and showed a different angle to it.<br />I just loved this book so much that it's very easy to look past its occasional imperfections and rate it a 5. This series is simply incredible, and there are probably very few people out there who would not enjoy it.

0375842209|5.0|Tragic and searing, the book thief is a fantastic and emotional book. It is written extremely well, and it is very absorbing. So many books I have read lately I found myself counting the pages until the end, but not so with this book. This is one of those few books that I found myself disappointed that it was over, and really missing the characters that I had spent the last couple of days with. It's not a very long book in the sense that it is nearly impossible to put down once the book gets going. Not so much that it is filled with action, because there is very little in that regard, but that the book is so absorbing that you want to keep coming back to it. Probably the biggest reason that this is so are the characters. The characters and dialogue are very believable, which is again something that's difficult to find lately, especially in \\"young adult\\" books. The author didn't try to palliate anything, the dialogue of the characters was appropriate to the low-class setting that they lived in, and the setting itself was very believable, since it takes place in a time that is well known in human history, world war II. It really does a good job in showing the other side of Germany, the decent people that didn't hate Jews, the ones that even go as far as to hide Jews from the Nazis. The book is also pretty dark and morbid, but considering the narrator of the story is death, this is understandable. I thought it did a lot more for the book and made it more real and emotional and heart-wrenching than if Zusak had sugarcoated what life was really like at this time. But Death in a way makes the story less morbid by using dark humour. It makes it more enjoyable to the typical reader. It can be like watching a train wreck though, at times, because you learn what happens at the end very early in the book, but that doesn't make it any more shocking and sad when that time comes, due to exceptional writing. This is one of those books that isn't ruined even if you know the end, because the prose is so close to perfect that even though you know what will happen, it makes you feel as shocked and devastated as if it had caught you by surprise.<br />This is simply an incredible book, quite possibly the best of the year, and if you are even slightly interested in WWII, even if you're not, this is a superb book and you should definitely give it a try.cause the prose is so close to perfect that even though you know what will happen, it makes you feel as shocked and devastated as if it had caught you by surprise.<br />This is simply an incredible book, quite possibly the best of the year, and if you are even slightly interested in WWII, even if you're not, this is a superb book and you should definitely give it a try.
0316044938|4.0|I had no intention of reading this book, but when some vacation plans went awry, I found myself with a lot of time on my hands at my mother's house--and only one book in her house--a library book called \\"The Lovely Bones.\\"<br /><br />I won't go into too much detail on the plot, since there are over three thousand reviews, but the story revolves around Susie Salmon, a 14-year-old girl who is raped and murdered by a neighbor in a corn field on her way home from eighth grade. She goes to heaven and watches life on Earth unfold for her family and friends--and of course, her murderer.<br /><br />Well, I couldn't put the book down. It's an absolute page-turner, and winning mixture of true crime, coming-of-age story, fantasy, family drama and ghost story. There is a power to Sebold's writing that is undeniable--and I reread many passages in order to better savor Sebold's words and reflect on how well she had described events, thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />It is also one of the more unique concepts for a book that I've read in quite some time.<br /><br />I look forward to more of this author's work.

B003719G40|5.0|This book has been life changing. My husband and I are reading it together and learning so much. Whether you are in a place where marriage is good or you are struggling, this book will help you. Before we started the book we thought our marriage was pretty good, now we are learning so much that is has gotten even better.
0307341550|4.0|Sharp, sharp sharp observations of the causes and consequences of family dysfunction.  Very well written.  After reading Gone Girl and Sharp Objects my only criticism is the author tries to do too much.  No need to include mystery/police procedure.  The unraveling of family dysfunction is mystery enough.  Fewer gothic/sensational images (the pig farm and perhaps one other is plenty). A subtler approach (which she did take in Gone Girl) would have been preferred.  And I know this author is up to it!  A similar and equally harrowing book is We Need to Talk About Kevin.  Obviously no book is perfect, but Sharp Objects comes close.  A little more subtlety and this author 's writing would be stunning.
B00000DHZJ|3.0|The first 7 songs are the best. The last 13 are a waste on this album. Better too buy the songs on download because this album is not worth the price.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This was a good game.  I was pleased.  it was not your typical hidden object game.  it has a pretty large map that you have to maneuver around in to find clues and solve different puzzles.  there are plenty of hints that range from small clues to point you in the general direction to straight forward answering it for you.  I had one problem though.  I had the sound turned off when the game was wrapping up and I have know idea what the ending was about or why all the people were gone.

0312427646|3.0|About a million people have reviewed this book, so presumptuous of me to suppose I can have anything to add! In line with most of these reviews, I found this to be a charming little story full of erudite literary references, engaging wit, and abundant irony.<br /><br />Having said that, just can't resist the urge to express my distress at the story's outcome.  After undergoing this wonderful, transformational \\"intellectual awakening\\" in which she discovers critical thinking, empathy, and humanity, our \\"uncommon reader\\" essentially does nothing useful with the knowledge? Instead of applying this new knowledge to alleviate the ignorance that she discovers all around her, she instead resolves to retire from the world entirely? I admit I was put off the book's presumption that reading and writing are isolating activities. Granted, the actions themselves are necessarily performed in isolation - but what a waste if all that lovely wisdom we gain as the result of the things we read and write doesn't inform the way we interact with the world in which we live! Even ordinary people, afforded the enlightenment of literature and education, have performed extraordinary things; what might someone with the power and the resources of a monarch accomplish? A part of me can't help but be disappointed that the book didn't have the courage to go there.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Definitely one of Rush's all time greatest releases. Rush has went back to their 70's concept album days and turned a collection of ideas into a conceptial masterpiece. Who would have thought a concept album would be so popular in the year 2012? This is THE rock album of the year.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|This book had been recommended to me as a young adult book that holds up well for adults.  Yes and no.  The device of having death narrate was interesting, but sometimes got in the way and distanced the reader from the main characters.  The story was interesting, but not completely engrossing.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|the game is cool but after you forget about it does not work!!!!!! but I hav to say it is cool!!!
030758836X|5.0|I will add my voice with those who loved the gorgeous writing in this book, the roller-coaster ride that seemed to never end, and the construction of characters that we would publically spurn but privately recognize in ourselves more often than we'd like to admit.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Re: the ending: some of the more contrived elements are forgiveable when you recognize that the author had to construct a hellish future for these two narcissistic, co-dependant and psychologically immature people.  Yes, Nick is merely a bad person, while Amy is a true psychopath, but you have to ask yourself if Nick could actually go out and lead a \\"normal\\" life.  As he says near the end of the novel, a \\"regular' person would bore him and any future partner's brain would pale in comparison to Amy's.<br /><br />How about a sequel, Ms. Flynn?
B0083GCK5G|5.0|What a way to kick off Summer 2012 with a brand new collection of Beach Boys music of beaches, Pacific Coast Hwy, and having fun.  How can a group keep writing and recording such superb music?  That's just what this CD is.  Magic happens when these guys record together as a group.  Their ageless vocals are angelic harmonies and melodies that play in your head long after the music stops.  Every song on this CD is great and I thank them for giving us this beautiful collection of music that has already become one of my all time favorites.  Please don't let the music stop with the 50th Anniversary collection ... give us more music like this!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I am an open minded reader of all genres.  I kept hearing the hype of these books and had so many friends reading them that I got sucked in and bought all 3 for my kindle.  I will say that Romance novels are my least favorite types of books but enjoy a good romantic read every now and then,so with that said keep that in mind as I tell you why I gave this book only 3 stars.<br /><br />I do have to say this first book is the best of the trilogy....I think the story line is amazing except it is too quick because it is so full of the \\"intimate\\" parts that it rushes the rest of the storyline.  I was so disappointed that I wasn't kept on the edge of my chair trying to figure out what is happening.  I found my self rushing through the loves scenes by the 3rd book because it just kept happening so the excitement of it sort of dwindled. I think had a few of these moments been taken out and more of the storyline substance it would have been a 5 star read.  This is my opinion, It wasn't terrible but it was an OK series.  Maybe the hype of the book created higher expectations and that is why I felt so let down.
030014332X|5.0|This was shipped quickly and arrived in just a few days!

1451608659|4.0|I really liked this book and found Moceanu's perspective about her trying and highly publicized life very interesting and a bit sad. Yes, I finished this book the day after the USA women's team won the Olympic team gold again - for the first time since Moceanu's team.<br /><br />I was a gymnast from the age of 4 through high school. I was never a club or Elite gymnast by any means, but I could hold my own in my high school conference. Needless to say, I have been a fan of gymnastics for years and remember watching the 1996 Olympics.<br /><br />This book is about Moceanu's life; not just the Olympics, not just the Karolyi's, and just her emancipation, and not just her recently found sister. This covers everything, and that is a lot to cover in one book. At times I wished for more details about events, especially the Olympics and the emancipation trial. However, during the Olympics, Moceanu was a young girl and she purposefully didn't watch her teammates' routines so as not to throw off her concentration, so she doesn't have many details to share about those specific meets. Also, I'm sure even thinking about the emancipation trial is still difficult for her, so I can't fault her for not writing much about it.<br /><br />She jumped around in the book a bit, it did not flow chronologically which was confusing at times. The chapter titles tell you what it will be about, but there was still some timeline jumping throughout.<br /><br />I was very interested to hear her take on the Karolyi's. I've heard mixed reviews about their practices over the years, especially after Kerri Strug's famous vault. For gymnasts to be competing at the level that we see them on TV, one has to expect them to work hard and their time in the gym will be tough. However, Moceanu's descriptions of how she was treated by the Karolyi's before the Olympics and even in years after the Olympics are deplorable. Yes, this is one girl's experience and possibly not everyone was treated like that at the time and isn't even now. Even so, this was her experience and how she internalized it and remembers it, and it breaks my heart. Then, in the past few years for her to be blackballed essentially and not allowed to compete even after doing all that was asked of her is just plain wrong. There is too much bureaucracy in gymnastics, and she's right, \\"Do we really want someone who financially benefits from hosting training camps telling us we need more of these camps throughout the year? Shouldn't an unbiased individual...be making those decisions?\\"<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was a good book. It makes me look differently at the sport that I love to watch - especially during Olympic games. Also, the pages of photos in the center of the book were nice to see - young Moceanu through her children and reunion with her sister.<br /><br />Watch Bela during interviews - he really is a sleazy suave guy, isn't he?and isn't even now.

0394818237|5.0|This book is just wonderful.  My son (5) is an emerging reader and it was nice that the title was easy enough to engage him right from the beginning.  Each page takes you through the town and all of the different things that people could be doing.  The pictures are very captivating in and of themselves.  Even without reading the story to my 3 year old he was very interested in all of the little details in the pictures.  He kept pointing out things all over the place.  The book is really a great way to make little ones aware of different vocabulary words that you would run across in day to day life.  We first saw this book at a friends house and she raved about it as well.  Our family owns several Richard Scarry books and this one has been one of the best.<br /><br />Happy Reading!

1419702238|5.0|My child blows through this series with such excitement and can't wait to get to the next in the series ... these books are funny, age appropriate, easy to understand and relate to.

1250004217|5.0|I chose to read Sarah's Key after some friends mentioned it when we were talking about books we recommend.  They didn't say much about it, so I had no idea what it was about.  I could not put this book down from the moment I started reading it!  I have read many other books that people have recommended highly (Unbroken, the Dragon Tattoo series, the Hunger Games, Fifty Shades, The Help, for ex) and while those are all good books and I do recommend them, Sarah's Key is by FAR my favorite.  It may be my favorite book overall.  The suspense of what was happening kept my nose glued to my Kindle.  The truth in the history shocked me.  The knowledge that, while this was fiction, there are too many people who lived through these times and experiences made my heart ache.  No book is perfect and no book is for everyone.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I only wish I could find another book that I love as much.  Thank you, Tatiana, for the emotional, educational and spiritual ride.

B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very fun and addicting. The reason it's 4 stars: the more you play, it starts to slow down and freeze up. It isn't too bad but sometimes just long enough for you to not respond in time and die. Otherwise it is fun, minus the lag.

B004UG7RQ0|4.0|Most new HDTV flat panel TVs have very poor internal audio, as do most laptops . . . and some of us bought the Bose iPod sound docks back in the day (mine came at Xmas 2004) have always thought \\"wouldn't it be ideal to run the TV through the Bose?\\" . . . alas, up to last year (2011) there had been no way to marry the two  . . . The CableJive was the answer  ... don't forget, however, that you have two volume controls, one on the docking Station and one on the TV . . . so as you connect the TV and Bose with the CableJive, probably best to turn the Bose docking station volume to maximum, thereby permitting you to use the TV remote control to adjust the sound . . . (I purchased the CableJive about a year ago, 2011 . . . anyway . . . worked for me.)

0802130208|3.0|I am really mixed about this book. I read it because people were passing it around at work and they raved about it. It certainly contains unique characters but the main one just annoyed me, although I loved Jones, the floor-sweeping guy. I stopped reading halfway through because I was bored, then pick it up again because I hate not to finish a book. I can't find that there's a real plot here. If you're looking for a mix of laugh out loud and quiet humor with southern dialect I'd recommend the series by TR Pearson: A Short History of a Small Place, Off for the Sweet Hereafter, and The Last of All There Was.

B0000648WZ|5.0|Director Paul Verhoven (\\"Robocop\\", \\"Total Recall\\") gives us this flick set in the future where high school kids join the military in various roles to become citizens, but sadly they do not know just what lies in wait for them once they join. A few friends who get into the military are thrown into a massive firefight on a distant planet where there are giant bugs are waiting to attack and destroy them.<br /><br />This is a fairly basic premise but its done with quite a silly and goofy flare, from the opening scenes in the high school, to the training camp sequences where some violence occurs thanks to a faulty helmet (funny moment to me), the first attacks on the bug planet and so on. The action sequences are very well done, the bug attacks and effects are very good, sure the acting is pretty bad but the brisk pace and great effects do help keep the movie elevated above most sci-fi flicks.<br /><br />The cast has Casper Van Dien (\\"Sleepy Hollow\\"), Dina Meyer (\\"Dragonheart\\"), Denise Richards (\\"Wild Things\\"), Neil Patrick Harris (\\"Beastly\\"), Jake Busey (\\"The Frighteners\\") and Michael Ironside (\\"Total Recall\\") among others. Van Dien is much better in the action sequences than trying to act smart and speaking of that the most laughable part of the movie was Richards trying to sound smart in her role, which was really laugh inducing to me. But this is one fun, festive movie even if the action is the only great part of it. *** out of 4 stars.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I also had the problem of being locked out of the game. When I would. try to launch the game I would get the black screen and sent back to the home screen.

Worked perfectly.  kept all my colors and bombs, and all my current games and scores intact!!
B004SIP9MY|5.0|Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell, \\"Wild Things\\") is a young woman who lost her mother when she was murdered about a year ago, her dad still is there taking care of her but for this coming weekend he's going on a business trip. There's a man named Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber, \\"Sphere\\") whose in jail on death row accused of murdering Sydney's mom, but a news reporter named Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox, TV's \\"Friends\\") who feels he's been wrongfully convicted and confronts Sydney about it outside of school. Syndey's friends and her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich, \\"The Craft\\") are there to comfort and support Sydney through these trying times.<br /><br />Oh I think I forgot to mention there's a killer with the nickname \\"Ghost Face\\" whose come to town and seems to be targeting certain people and killing them, like he did to Drew Barrymore in the fantastic opening sequence. This killer seems to be working their way towards Sydney for reasons that become much clearer as the movie goes on.<br /><br />What director Wes Craven (\\"Red Eye\\", \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\") does well with this material written by Kevin Williamson (\\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\", \\"The Faculty\\") is give it a lot of punch and mock the horror cliches of various movies, while making a great, fun film on its own.<br /><br />The before-mentioned opening sequence with Drew Barrymore as the first victim was very well done, starting with a phone call featuring the famous creepy voice asking \\"Do you like scary movies?\\" and ending in a short chase scene and killing. The rest of the movie features some clever dialogue, good death scenes and funny and good performances by other actors like Matthew Lillard (\\"Scooby-Doo\\"), Jamie Kennedy (\\"Romeo & Juliet\\"), David Arquette (\\"Eight Legged Freaks\\"), Rose McGowan (\\"Planet Terror\\") and a funny small role by Henry Winkler (\\"The Waterboy\\").<br /><br />This is easily one of my favorite horror/comedy flicks, it clicks along at a great pace and still is funny to me even after all these years. ***1/2 out of 4 Stars.ll these years. ***1/2 out of 4 Stars.
B0086DBE62|3.0|This is a campy and humorous twist on the Snow White story.  Julia Roberts is the middle-aged wicked queen who has a fiscal problem in her palace and wants to marry into some money to solve it.  Lily Collins is the 18 YO \\"Snow\\" who gets out from under the Queen's thumb and is becoming independent, liberated and more assertive.  The seven dwarfs are played by .... seven dwarf actors, who are disgruntled bandits (they get on stilts and do acrobatic manuevers when they rob a victim).  Roberts the Queen has her Cougar eye on a younger boy-toy prince (played by Arnie Hammer) who keeps getting his clothes robbed by the bandits and shows up in front of her without a shirt.  But of course, Snow and the Prince are really in love.  The Queen's assistant is played by the very funny Nathan Lane.  Lots of fun little scenes and a nice, competant, entertaining fairly forgettable plot.  The dwarfs are a funny, edgy bunch, with good interplay and banter. The strong, independent Snow (taught by the dwarf bandits) duels creepy puppet zombies, the Prince himself, and the \\"beast\\" at the end.  I guess she's supposed to be the new role-model for strong, successful women, while the men (the Prince, the Assistant) are silly twits.  Roberts plays a good wicked queen character in another strong female role.  Like a pushy middle-age Cougar boss at work.<br /><br />I thought that it was a PG-13 but it seems the MPAA rates it a PG.  One non-family-friendly part is when the Queen's assistant is turned into a cockroach by magic.  When he \\"gets better\\" he's bemoaning his nightmare, saying that \\"the worst part was, a grasshopper had his way with me!\\"  Ha-ha.  Try explaining that to your 10 YO child, that he was buggered by another insect.  Except for that purposefull (and these days it's obligatory for decadent Hollywood, even for \\"family movies\\") use of sexual innuendo, Mirror Mirror is overall entertaining comedy/fantasy with a women's lib theme.

0061122416|1.0|I could barely finish this annoying allegory of shallow New Age spirituality.  In his journey to find treasure (and knowledge of the Universe), the hero Santiago journeys through North Africa, trying to create his Personal Legend, which is God's will for his life.  The Universe, also God's creation, cooperates in his attempt at self-fulfillment.<br /><br />It seems, however, that only men have Personal Legends -- the only significant female character in the text, Santiago's love-interest Fatima, has no need to seek knowledge or self-fulfillment.  The Alchemist, a sage figure, explains to Santiago that she needs only him: \\"You are her treasure.\\"  The happy ending is predicated on her continuing to do her chores at the oasis and look out to the desert until his return, when she will bear his children -- sexism hard to accept in a book written in the late 20th century.<br /><br />Humanists will find the idea that the Universe is interested in each man's self-fulfillment ludicrous -- and dangerously misleading.  Many Christians will find the idea that God expects sacrifice not for other people but only for one's own Personal Legend offensive.  This book offers religion-lite, a faith that doesn't interfere with your ambitions or ask for inconvenient interest in others.  It should, however, appeal to men undergoing a mid-life crisis and looking for divine justification to pursue self-fulfillment, whatever the cost to others.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I ordered two of these USB cables. One to extend my IR receiver for my media center PC and the other to extend my XBox USB hub for connection of the Kinect sensor and to be closer to the drums and keyboards for Rock Band. I routed them under the house and up through the wall into the hollow area above the fireplace where the TV is. Perfect length for this. I would highly recommend one for anyone in need of a USB extension cable.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I thought Richard Ford did an incredible job with this book and as an author I appreciate his craft. Two things made it  special. One was the framing of the incredibly desolate setting in Saskatchewan. And the second was the development of the characters.<br /><br />The two characters I liked the most were Charley, this incredibly multifaceted hand and Berner, Dell's sassy sister. They were right up there with other great characters in literature.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0066PQSJA Writer Interruptus and Other Stories]]

0345803485|1.0|This book is like a Harlequin romance with just a few more graphic scenes - all of which are boring, lame, unrealistic and repetitive.  I kept skipping pages hoping that I'd get to something that was exciting.  I wanted to slap Anastasia silly, as she \\"rolled her eyes\\" and \\"bit her lip\\" and he looked at her \\"darkly\\" through \\"hooded eyes\\" and her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" did whatever...And these were just some of the myriad of overused phrases.  Didn't you ever learn how to write a letter, author?  You don't use the same words over and over! I'd rather have the Harlequin romance.  However, E.L.

0761169253|5.0|Steal Like An Artist By Austin Kleon is a small book. It's the kind of book where you think, \\"What could be in a small book like this that would be worth any of my money?\\" Since I had read the pdf and already stimulated my brain I realized that even ONE good idea is priceless and can change everything in an instant. This is one of those books where you want to say thank you to the author for having done you a solid. I'm juiced to start so many things that have been rattling around in my brain now and feel validated in my approaches since reading this book.

B007SGM084|5.0|The 50 shades trilogy was my first set of romance novels and now I'm hooked!  I was very wary in the beginning - the first few chapters were a little \\"dark\\" for my taste.  Luckily I had a friend to recommend sticking with it, that I would not be disappointed.  Boy was she right, this is an excellent set of novels that have turned me on to this genre of literature.  All three books were page-turners throughout and now that I am finished, I am sad I read them so quickly.  E.L. James has hit the ball out of the park with the 50 Shades Trilogy and I hope to see more from her soon (hoping this story of Christian and Anastasia never comes to an end).

B004LWZW6K|1.0|...to make up stories about how the actors were forced to be in this bilge.<br /><br />I figure for Hass and Gary Busey, it's probably a community service sentence.<br />Someone obviously has some naked pictures of Danielle Panabaker she doesn't want getting out.<br />Christopher Lloyd has not been playing a mad scientist...he really must be mad.<br />David Koechner's unemployment checks must have run out.<br /><br />Not sure about the rest, but if someone told me waterboards were involved, I'd believe it.<br /><br />The first [[ASIN:B002ZG98KK Piranha]] was a full-on blast.  Scary enough, but also entertaining and funny.  The Richard Dreyfus cameo was classic, and the nude swimming scene, while out of place in a campy horror movie, was gorgeous.  It managed to have a great sense of fun, but also a dedication to professional story-telling.<br /><br />Dubby-dees here replaces all that with crass and uninventive nudity, too much severed penis (the one in the first movie had just the right amount of screen time), mirthless humor, shopworn tropes...I mean, no wonder this one never had a theatrical release.  It barely deserves a DVD or streaming release.<br /><br />And what makes that a damned shame is that the premise has actual potential, and the actors (excluding Hasselhoff who is to acting what this reviewer is to Roger Ebert) are all quite capable, and the movie had a big enough budget to pull off something diverting.  This was a paycheck, period.  And no greater proof of that need exist than the \\"outtakes\\" that follow the movie.  When people are really having fun with something, sincere, uninhibited high jinks ensue.  The outtakes from DD are just as canned and cliched and pointless as the movie itself was.<br /><br />I rented it for $1.20.  I was robbed.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|By Steve Bareham<br /><br />Martin does a fine job serving up believable characters with interesting, natural dialogue that flows, not an easy task for a writer. For readers who appreciate well knitted narrative, this book will not disappoint. As both a writer of fiction, and a fan of good writers, I felt transported to another time and place, so that's a credit to Martin as well. A great summer read on the beach, which is exactly where I read it.

B006SV2LWA|5.0|We see at the end of the movie how this disease originated--don't fast forward!  The movie is documentary style and thus more compelling.  We see what happens when so many deaths cause panic and societal breakdown, as in the times of Spanish influenza, bubonic plague (or anthrax), AIDS--fingers pointed, distrust of government, government posturing, loonies out of wordwork, prayer to saints.  The microbiologist reviewer feels 95% of us don't understand this movie.  No: that's why the plot unfolds as it did--so we would.  But I did not know what the CDC and scientists would have to face with political machinations and Big Pharma greed...I should have.  This is a cautionary tale in my eyes.  Instead of using evolution as a political knee jerker or religious boogeyman, can we not study and learn from it, and try to be prepared?  Everthing evolves just as this movie will tell you, and so, \\"War of the Worlds\\"  As this movie will show you: panic ensues when we don't use our rationale, objectivity and intellect.  Soderberg and his excellent cast got the point across to me.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|Under My Skin was Avril Lavinge's sophomore album and unlike some artists this was not a slump. The album takes on a a very dark and depressing edge that shows she is more than capable to write songs other than the likes of Skater Boi. Every song on here is great and you will only find yourself skipping the through the CD to get your favorites on it. After the release of this CD she would shed the dark themes and go for a more poppy sound for her next two albums which makes Under My Skin ever that more special. My favorites are Nobody's Home, Fall to Pieces, Take Me Away, and Who Knows.

B0019IIPXQ|5.0|Pitch Black is a great SciFi film. It a SciFi film at heart, but also packs plenty of action, thrills, and even some scares. Vin Diesel plays Riddick, a deadly prisoner that was being transported on a now crashed ship; he plays the character well as a cold, yet cool (as in awesome) prisoner. When they are attacked by an unknown flying species, Riddick teams up with the rest of the survivors to get off the planet. It's a very dark film, so be prepared for that; it didn't bother me at all, though. The story was great and paced very well. The acting was fine. I didn't see any significant flaws, really.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Pitch Black. It's a great SciFi film, but you don't have to be a SciFi fan to enjoy it. As of 8/1/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also recommended.<br /><br />This film has strong violence and gore, and strong language. It does not have sex or nudity.

0345803485|4.0|When reading FICTION, I don't look for historical context.  I don't look for a common ground or familiarity with the protaganist and antagonist.  I don't even want a believable story, because I can get  \\"believable\\" in day-to-day living.  As an Engish/Literature major, I was (gratefully) taught to leave MY life and experiences at the door, and approach FICTION with a blank canvas - an unadulterated, receptive, non-discrimnatory mind.  There shall be no engaging of my conscience with the story if you give me something disgustingly awesome.  Well, I asked for it, and I got it.  And at first...I hated it.  I did NOT want to read the next two installments, because the book made me uneasy.  But... 1)  a professor once told me to always finish a book because if it is bothering you on some level, you will usually be pleasantly surprised and 2) in my personal life,  I RARELY start something and don't finish it, SO...<br /><br />After first meeting Ana(stasia), you can't help BUT to bring your conscience into the story, as you start to feel like a mother hen, or at least a worldly and experienced friend, wanting to encourage, advise and protect her as she leaves the safe-havens of college, a mother, a loving step-father and two very best friends, to figure her way out in this big, scary world.  However, when she  inadvertently meets the VERY experienced, troubled, gorgeous, wildly sucessful, mysteriously impossible, too-good-to-be-true Mr. Christian Grey, Ana's inconspicuous obstrusiveness starts to peak out at you,  and she somehow makes  Momma proud.  Maybe there is no need to worry...maybe.<br /><br />That being said, there is no need for a spoiler alert when I say that Ana and Christian (the biblicality of BOTH of their names is soooo twisted) turn out to be the type of persons we don't expect them to be.  Which is ironic, given that I am \\"supposed\\" to leave ALL suppostions at the door (see first paragraph).  Oh well, they do the expected AND unexpected, but most readersof imaginative stories relish in the \\"unexpected,\\" and for me...the surprises were plentiful.  Hey, it's FICTION!  You can create whatever you want! ;p<br /><br />I guess I have to now address the BDSM.  Okay, I do not knock ANYBODY'S way of \\"getting it on,\\" because, well, quite frankly, I'm not GOD.  However, my one critique would be the following - the way some of the sex scenes played out in all three books was a bit...well...mentally and mind-blowingly personal.  I can appreciate romance and even erotica....BUT...I don't HAVE to know EXACTLY how it went down between two consenting adults.  There is a little responsibility that E. L. James should be held to, because let's face it: kids (yes, they WILL find copies) will not be able to separate real life from fiction, so authors should give some consideration to that fact when deciding how much detail they put into sex scenes.  That being said, as an adult, I could remove myself from the explicit scenes, and extract the emotion and story that bubbled under the surface of each sexual encounter.<br /><br />That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.  That's E. L. James' story, and SHE'S sticking to it.  It was artistically crafted, but it would have been just as great without the author's foray into the sordid (my word, sorry!) side of Doms and Subs...just saying, I would've liked the story the same.  And to all the \\"vanilla-sex\\" readers - it's FICTION!
B000QUEQBS|5.0|mark whalberg movies are non stop action... he is a terrifc actor... this movie will keep you on your toes... i give this movie two thumbs up
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I just finished my second reread of this book. I was lucky to receive Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire from NetGalley. I was completely drawn into this story, the angst between the main characters, the love of true friends, and unrelenting will to change your life. There were times when I laughed outloud, times when I wanted to (if I wasn't reading on an Ipad) throw the book against the wall. I love it when main characters are broken, and not the perfect little mold of what lovers should be. This book was a solid 4.74 stars for me.<br /><br />Abby (aka Pidgeon) and Travis are both quite flawed in a few ways, but in my mind that truly adds truth to the love story. I kept thinking that they could be a real couple in college somewhere just because this was not a perfect little couple. Travis is our tattoo covered hero who pays for college by fighting in an underground fight club of sorts. He has sex with too many women, drinks too much whiskey, and basically had a rough time growing up without a mother and a house full of men. Abby on the other hand is our prim and proper heroine with a secret past that she is trying to escape. She wants to give herself a new life and leave her sad past behind her. Abby also happens to be the only woman that will not put up with Travis and his BS. She is completely immune to his charms but losing a bet lands her living with him.<br /><br />Abby and Travis have a complicated love story, that is messy and hard, as well as sweet and loving. There were several times while reading this book that I wanted to yell and scream at them both until they realized what they were doing to each other. Other times I wanted to smack some sense into both of them, but in the end they got it right.<br /><br />The story was fabulous, the characters were well written and made me want hear more about them, especially America. America, Abby's best friend is quite a spitfire. I would love to read a story about her life. I am so glad I found this book and I stated this is the second time I read it. I devoured it in the first reading and needed to reread just in case I missed some good stuff. Go now and read this book.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|John Green has done it again: written a fantastic, funny, and also poetic novel that one is bound to finish in a day.  The plot is well thought out.  Though I did find some parts confusing in part two of the book, I still loved the book.  I felt that the characters were funny and easy to relate to.  I truly recommend this book for fans of mystery, adventure, and all John Green books.

Can't recommend this to everyone, but I really enjoyed it.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I had to give atleast two stars because the series kept me reading non stop thinking I was going to get to this fantastic ending to the book but nope. Dont get me wrong I loved that everything worked out with the districts and but way tooooo many unneccessary deaths happened, leaving me feeling empty and sad that not everything worked out. I felt that when I got to the end that everything that kept me interested in the first two books was absolutely pointless. I feel like im the only one who feels this way. I guess im a \\"fairy tale ending\\" kind of girl.

None of the characters are likable, I mean none - but the story itself was unbelievable.  An absolute page turner.

0345803485|2.0|No, holy crap is not what I thought when I read this book.  Holy crap is what the main character, Ana, says about just about everything!  I thought I was reading something written by a high school girl.<br /><br />Okay, SOME of the dialog is erotic, but it's a real disappointment to be in the middle of reading one of these sections, biting your lower lip in anticipation like Ana does, only to be brought down by the very frequently thrown in \\"Holy Crap!\\".<br /><br />I didn't give up easily - I made it 2/3 of the way through before I put it down for the last time. My inner goddess was yawning.

030758836X|5.0|All one has to do is read this book and it will put any plans for marching to the altar on hold real fast. Wow, what a thrill ride GONE GIRL is. Every once in a blue moon I will come across a book that I would put on the shortlist of my all-time-favorites. It happened with CIRCLE OF FRIENDS, THE HORSE WHISPERER, and THOSE WHO SAVE US. Add GONE GIRL to that list. This is one of those rare books that reels the reader in, holds you spellbound and mesmerized by the sheer insanity, and never lets go until the last page.<br /><br />While probably not a book for everyone, there are lots of curse words that some may find offensive, I found they added to the story. The profanity was not gratuitous by any means. It was real and compelling. The story and the characters were so realistic that I found myself getting all worked up and stressed out while reading. I was actually sweating in some parts. Once the reader gets entangled in this brilliantly conceived and even more brilliantly executed novel there is no turning back. You will find yourself staying up all night to read \\"just one more chapter.\\"<br /><br />I read SHARP OBJECTS by Gillian Flynn and I hated it. It read like a lousy Lifetime Network \\"disease of the week\\" themed book. It's hard to believe the same person wrote GONE GIRL. The author has grown leaps and bounds and has crafted one of the most geniusly plotted books I've read in years. I liked it so much I'm tempted to go back to page one and start all over again. Don't walk, RUN to your nearest local bookstore and pick this up today. You'll be sharing it with your friends soon. Trust me.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Let me start off by saying:<br /><br />A) This is miles better than the overextended jam-fest trying to re-capture 90's glory that was \\"Zeitgeist\\". There's no comparison between this album and that.<br />B) \\"Oceania\\" has hints of the sound of some the 90's albums but it is definitely not a cookie cutter attempt at trying to sound like another \\"Siamese Dream\\" or something. After the band broke up and he did some of his self-indulgent projects, it feels like Billy rediscovered his passion and love for music here.<br /><br />Getting to \\"Oceania\\", the new band Billy has assembled sounds excellent and doesn't try to imitate their predecessors which is refreshing. Billy is in top form in every way; his voice sounds better than I've heard it in years, his songwriting is top-notch, and the musicianship is amazing. This album sounds like the logical progression from an album like \\"Machina\\". It isn't all distorted-guitar driven tracks; there is a wide variety of sound ranging from synths to strings to electronics. The songs never go into the territory of sounding too pretentious or self indulgent, they always stay true to the actual songwriting and soul of the song.<br /><br />To people who don't like this album or can't wrap their heads around it, the negative reviews probably come from expecting the 90's Pumpkins sound or just not being able to accept the fact that great artists evolve and change. If Billy Corgan put out a song like \\"Zero\\" or \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" now at this point, he'd be laughed at and be considered irrelevant. If you can appreciate this album for the actual music and forget the Smashing Pumpkins of the past, you'd probably find that you'd enjoy some of these songs (maybe the whole thing).<br /><br />Bottom line: In a time where mainstream music is suffering from a drought of great rock music, the newly re-energized Smashing Pumpkins have put out an album that is remarkable. If this was an unknown band coming up in the world, I'm pretty sure you'd be hearing a whole lot more praise and hype. Billy Corgan seems like he's actually enjoying what he's doing again and it shines through the music.<br /><br />Old Pumpkins fans, don't expect angst and distorted rock anthems all over the place but try to enjoy this masterpiece.<br /><br />People new to the band, buy this if you like good rock music.d be hearing a whole lot more praise and hype.

B007X4N0DU|4.0|Allow me to start off this review by stating that i have been a casual P.O.D. fan for years and know their albums Satellite and self titled very well.  I haven't paid much attention to their last couple albums.  I heard Murdered Love a couple weeks before the release of the album and was blown away.  I picked up the album when it came out just for that song.  I popped the album in my CD player and blasted it.  Too my surprise it was fantastic all the way through.  I have listened to it non stop since i bought it and i love it.  Eyez, murdered love, Babylon the Murderer, On Fire and I Am are my favorite tracks.  My only issue with the CD is the already much discussed muted out F bombs in I Am.  I'm not a fan of my music being censored and P.O.D. Christian or not i have no problem with them swearing in their music.  Most people, Christian or not have no problem with swear words we are not 10 anymore.  Either say the words as you intend to say them or don't say them at all.  I hate that the f bombs are censored.  I would have given this album a 5 out of 5 star review if the f bombs weren't censored but since they are censored it gets a 4 out of 5 star review. I still love the album and plan on blasting it for a long time to come despite the censored F bombs.  Rock on P.O.D.

B000001DQG|3.0|people seem to forget how in tune to music and other artists that elton was. not only are the beach boys on backing vocals but the TOWER OF POWER horn section did all the brass back ups;  elton even took them out on his tour with him to support this album.i rate this album a 3 only because in 1974 and living in FORT LAUDERDALE; radio station WSHE would play SICK CITY over an over from SUN single before the album was released. man i was upset when the album came out and SICK CITY was not on the album. all in all this album still holds up well.

B0018LX9T4|4.0|Here we have the story of a psychologically messed up woman who falls under the spell of a dominant man only to turn into what I call a dominant submissive - a submissive who demands to be dominated. She gets her act together early on, but he's not an alpha male, he's an alpha wuss. The ending sucked. I won't spoil it, but they would have been better served to use the opening as the ending to provide some closure.<br /><br />The acting is very good. She comes across a bit schizo, which she is. He comes across as the tough guy, but it's all a veneer. While her acting has a subtle quality, his is way over the top, especially towards the end.<br /><br />All in all, the plot holds together. The characters are attractive. There is some humor. Like when she's overcome with lust and goes into the ladies room to masturbate not knowing one of the stalls is occupied. Oops!<br /><br />All in all this is a lighthearted serious/comedy. The hardcore BDSM types will be disappointed and the vanilla types will be scratching their heads. If they'd put the opening sequence at the end it might have been 5 stars.<br /><br />A solid four stars. But better as a rental, than a purchase.

Big Bang keeps getting better with each new season; the entire cast is at their wittiest!!<br />The best part of having this season online (less DVD disc storage in the cabinet) and more room for popcorn!! Thanks Amazon, for an easy purchasing experience:)
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have been using this app for a year on my android phone (Verizon droid razr).  I uploaded all of the music I own (aprox 15gb) to my cloud drive and use the amazon mp3 app in place of the music app provided by android.  I love that it lets me play music on my phone or in my cloud from anywhere or purchase music and play it without having to download.  A few glitches here and there but the features and ease of use far outweigh any drawbacks for me.

However, because of Amamzon policy, a book that I have bought can only be lent out 14 days - can someone please explaing this policy to me?

B003HARV98|5.0|I heard about Marina and the Diamonds through Tumblr. Photos of her cluttered by dashboard. She looked so cute, and quirky. I had to check her music out on Youtube.<br /><br />I randomly searched her name and found the song, \\"Hollywood.\\" After listening to it, I was hooked. Marina has such a beautiful voice. Her lyrics are catchy and fun. She also reminds me of Katy Perry with her funky retro-like costumes.<br /><br />After buying the album, The Family Jewels, and listening to it, I can now say that I'm definitely a fan! I can't wait to see her in concert someday.<br /><br />Not everyone will like her music. I'm well aware of that. But, give her a try. It took me almost a month before I searched her on Youtube. Now, I'm sorry that I waited so long.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|This movie had it's good points and bad. Let's start with bad the plot was less than excellent. This was one of those movies that you would watch on a rainy day. The good well some of the effects were good but, you could still tell they were cgi. I thought i would like this move more than I did. I rented it when it was .99 cents so no real loss on that count.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Fun, can be addicting just wish when you get the paid version<br />you had more options for words & colors, it's almost the same as the free version.

055357342X|4.0|I think the biggest lesson we can take from Martin's books is never get attached, ever.  And that's all I'm saying about that.  Storm of Swords is the third book in the Song of Fire and Ice series.  If you haven't read the first two books then reading this review will be a waste of time for you, you have to start at the beginning or be hopelessly lost.  Heck, I've read them all in order and I still get lost at times.<br /><br />Storm of Swords pretty much takes up after where the second book left off.  Joffrey is still in power while Robb is slowly losing ground in the North.  Sansa is married off to Joffrey's uncle Tyrion in an effort to secure some sort of claim to the North.  Arya finds herself in the care of The Hound and while she wants to kill him, she also know she needs him to survive.  Jon is busy in the North, running with the wildlings and trying to figure out what his next step will be.  Daeynerys has her dragons and is slowly building an army.  And like the other books, everyone is plotting and planning and wanting the throne for themselves.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters in this book.  So much so that I can't keep track of them all the time.  So I stopped trying to and that actually made the book a little more enjoyable as a result; not as much stress.  The important ones are easy to remember and my definite favorite is Daenerys.  She has a lot of strength but is also trusting.  My least favorite characters would be the Lannisters, with the exception of Tyrion.  I know I'm not supposed to like them but I just can't stand reading about them.  Everyone else is just so much more interesting.<br /><br />The plot, like always, is brutal.  There is a lot of murder, rape, war, cussing, you name it.  It's as real as it gets and Martin does not hold back.  This time though there is a lot that is happening and it's kind of a whirlwind ride.  The story bounces back and forth between most of the main characters so you're continually being drug around in the timeline too.  But despite this, it remains fairly consistent and you aren't too lost when you come back to a certain character and their point in the story.  I do think this book could have easily been split in two, it's quite large and there is a lot happening.  Although it wouldn't have slowed the pace down at any rate, all the actions here would happen no matter if it were one, two or three books.<br /><br />I liked it and will continue to look forward to the next in the series.  It's a solid fantasy to be reading and intriguing as well.<br /><br />Storm of Swords<br />Copyright 2000<br />924 pages<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012the timeline too.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm just some guy who likes to read and not some grammarian-type.  I found the story easy to follow and consistent.  Dont be fooled by the news/interview-like descriptions made in the book.  When you tie it all together, it really makes the \\"story\\" very deep and enjoyable.  As stated in the title, I've read it twice, and will read it again in a few months.  I compare all of the zombie stories I read to this book.

I was very surprised to find an author so willing to help.
034580404X|5.0|First of all, not everyone who reads these reviews have already read through all 3 novels. So, I find it extremely inconsiderate that you people give so much away. I personally loved the books, and I am in no way shallow or stupid. However, unlike a lot of you, I have an imagination. If you are the type of person who takes yourself very seriously and has a fear of actually letting go of your self righteous nature, then no. I do not suggest you read these books. You should maybe read something a little more serious. God forbid you let your hair down and allow yourself to enjoy something not so modest. But, if you actually read for the simple pleasure of escaping the routine of your everyday life, and your not ashamed to allow yourself to fantasize and have a little fun, then YES YES YES! Read them all! Because they will transport those of you who are actually open minded to a whole new world of excitement! You will easily fall in love with these characters, if you do not ride an imaginary \\"high-horse\\". Is it realistic, heck no! But, what great love story really is...?

0385342063|5.0|I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella, and have purchased nearly every book she's written (via Amazon of course). This book is her best, in my opinion. It is lengthy, charming, and will be keeping you up for hours past your bedtime! It's always nice to read a laugh out loud book- and it really is; I was reading it in a doctor's office and laughed outwardly. My best friend read it and did the same...she said it kept her laughing from start to finish. The other fun part about this book was the texting that went on throughout the story. It was so easy to relate, especially in this day and age, to the technology mishaps and discussions that went on...and really played a huge part in the novel. I was sincerely sad to see the end approach as I ate up each page of this book. The witty writing, hilariously awkward situations, and love stories concocted throughout are just a few reasons why this has become one of my favorite books. If you're sitting there reading this...order the novel already! It will be a bigger regret to pass this book up then to spend the money to purchase it!! :) For those who are upset because this isn't a book filled with substance and high-end vocabulary...let it GO! It's so nice to laugh and read a heartwarming story. I would rather read this instead of Shakespeare or an otherwise renowned author any day! Kinsella, you rock!  Love love love this book!
0307742997|3.0|Our book club's book for July was THE SNOWMAN by Jo Nesbo, translated from the original Norwegian. It seemed to us that, in light of the huge success of  Stieg Larsson's books, and the fact that there will be no more of them, the publishing industry has been trying to find Scandinavians to publicize/push as \\"the next Stieg Larsson.\\" Most of us liked THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (though none of us thought it was flawless) so we considered a bunch of writers who are getting a lot of press, including K.O. Dahl, Arnaldur Indridason, and Henning Mankell. But ultimately we decided on Jo Nesbo.<br /><br />I must say, this book generated almost as much discussion as our most-discussed book, THE GUERNSEY LITERARY SOCIETY..., over which we were divided. With THE SNOWMAN, our final \\"thumbs up or thumbs down\\" vote was split right down the middle: 6 thumbs up, 6 thumbs down. Which is going to make it a little hard for me to write this review and do justice to everyone's comments/insights.<br /><br />On the Pro side: Those who liked the book found Harry Hole to be an engaging protagonist. He's really sort of basic as far as protagonists go: a (recovering?) alcoholic whose workaholism has ruined his relationships. He lives in the shadow of respected/admired friends/colleagues in the Oslo police force who have died (most likely the plots of earlier books) and can't quite get over their passing. Those of us who have read more widely in Scandinavian crime fiction had a moment of epiphany where we decided that, based on the depictions of detectives in these books, they're loners who drink too much but manage to have a lot of sex, too. The Oslo and Bergen settings are well realized; you really do feel as if you are there in those cities as the snow falls and the menace mounts. Jo Nesbo is also a musician, so the pages of the book are peppered with references to popular music, which the music fans among us liked and appreciated. The fans also appreciated the book's fast pace, saying it is a little slow to start but then ... well, is \\"snowballs\\" too bad a pun?<br /><br />On the Con side: Several people wondered why Nesbo is getting the sort of acclaim he is getting. (Publisher marketing?) The plotline is, admittedly, sort of a mess, going back and forth among several time periods with no rhyme or reason, sometimes within a chapter. And many of us don't really care for serial killer books - and this is one of them. (Not a spoiler: The reason Harry Hole is investigating is because he's solved the case of a serial murderer in Australia, and Norway has never had a serial killer.) The violence borders on the sadistic, and many felt that the plot holes (again, pardon the pun) were too huge to allow for the willing suspension of disbelief. Even those who liked the book agreed that the identity of the killer is evident, much earlier in the book than it really should be, for an effective crime novel.<br /><br />We did do some comparing between this book and Larsson.  Larsson was a journalist who wrote in a journalistic style, which kept the pages turning even if the prose sometimes sounded glib. It's hard to define Nesbo's style. Maybe sort of a rough-and-tumble, testosterone-fueled \\"dude\\"-type style would be a good description. Those who liked it enjoyed the rough edges; those who didn't like it found the prose unpolished, rough, and just plain mediocre. Of course, this could have something to do with the English translation, which none of us were in a position to judge. Still, the book is published by Knopf, so one has to assume that they have access to good translators?<br /><br />So, as you can probably figure out from this review, exactly half said they'd look for more books featuring Harry Hole, while the other half said \\"One is more than enough.\\" I personally fell more into the naysayer category. I found the ending to be beyond contrived, and I like when the author outsmarts me - but Nesbo didn't outsmart any of us.  Overall I think the book justwent on too long, lingered a little too long over the gory details. But perhaps this is Scandinavian hardboiled, and there were certainly some upsetting scenes in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO ... we joked (uncomfortably) that maybe this is a requirement of Scandinavian crime fiction.<br /><br />All of this said, I think I can speak for the group when I say that this is an EXCELLENT book club book. If you are part of a club, you'll have a lot of fun talking about and seeing various people's reactions. Our group's reactions ranged from awed by Nesbo to condescendingly dismissive of Nesbo as \\"the fortunate product of publisher marketing.\\"  But we had a great time, lots of really good back-and-forth (just as we did with THE GUERNSEY LITERARY SOCIETY), so while I didn't love the book itself, I can say I did enjoy the discussion and I think your book group would, too. You just have to be prepared for half the group loving it and other half hating it!went on too long, lingered a little too long over the gory details.

031620157X|4.0|Actor, Golden Globe winner, 2-time Emmy nominee, one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World, singer, screen writer, producer ... and now author? And all of that at just 22 years old?  I understand how some people might be a bit skeptical in regards to Chris Colfer's actual writing talents, but the truth is - the guy just seems to be a natural-born storyteller, and it doesn't matter which medium he uses for it.<br /><br />His first novel, \\"The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell\\", is the first book in what will become a series of novels about twins Alex and Conner Bailey.<br /><br />For their twelfth birthday the twins' grandmother gives them a book that has been in the family for a long time - a collection of fairytales called \\"The Land of Stories\\". But as Conner and Alex soon find out - this is no ordinary book! When Alex accidentally falls into the book and Conner jumps after her, the twins find themselves in a world that is at once familiar and foreign - familiar, because they've grown up reading stories about the kingdoms of this fairytale world; and foreign because suddenly they are faced with the aftermath of \\"Happily Ever After\\": Goldilocks is a wanted fugitive; the big bad wolf may be dead but his pack is very much alive and hellbent on revenge; and the evil queen that almost succeeded in murdering Snow White has escaped from her prison.<br /><br />Desperately trying to find their way home the twins start gathering a number of magical items in the hopes of successfully performing \\"The Wishing Spell\\". On their journey they meet many of the characters they've known since childhood along with numerous magical creatures. But Alex and Conner are not the only ones looking for the ingredients for the Wishing Spell, and what started out as a kind of scavenger hunt quickly turns into a race against time ...<br /><br />Chris Colfer has a very vivid and descriptive style of writing that I personally liked very much. Whether he was describing castles, quaint villages or the dungeons of the Troll and Goblin Territory - it all came to life right before my eyes, and I could see every scene like a movie in my mind.<br /><br />Conner and Alex were both likable and endearing lead characters. Where Alex is a too-smart-for-her-own-good bookworm, Conner is full of sarcasm. Despite their differences and their constant bickering and bantering - which makes for quite a few funny moments - it is clear that they have a close relationship and would never leave the other behind. But the twins are really just two out of a very large cast of characters, many of whom are of course already known to us from various fairytales. Personally, I have to admit I really liked Goldilocks - the girl kicked ass, so to speak ... ;o)<br /><br />Children will absolutely love this book - in fact, they might want to live in it! - but that doesn't mean that it is only suitable for children. If you enjoy imaginative and fantastical stories full of magic, humor and adventure then you will probably adore TLOS! It really is a wonderful story for anyone who has ever loved fairytales ... and everyone who has remained young at heart!<br /><br />Reading this book reminded me of how much I loved escaping into the world of books as a kid! Back then I would forget everything around me and just dive into different worlds to have amazing adventures. I could be a princess, a pirate or a rebel; I could travel the world, discover hidden treasures, or solve huge mysteries. In short - I could do or be anything I wanted!<br /><br />I still love reading books but somehow I now often find it much harder to lose myself completely in a story like I used to do. But this particular book gave me back that feeling I remembered from my childhood - a sense of something magical! It would hold a special place in my heart for that alone, even if it wasn't as good as it actually is!<br /><br />One thing I also liked was that Chris managed to tuck a few valuable lessons into his story, and he did so in a subtle way that never comes across as preachy. The message that he wants to give his readers is simple and yet so important: There is nothing wrong with just being yourself; don't try to mold yourself into something you're not comfortable with just to please other people; and don't disregard your own talents and capabilities just because they might not be the same as those of others.<br /><br />Is TLOS a perfect book? No. Nor is it the best book I have ever read. But what it is is a wonderfully imaginative and fast-paced adventure that is very entertaining and definitely fun to read. It is a book that I thoroughly enjoyed, and will certainly pick up and read again. The story has a good flow to it, I was never bored for even a moment, and I chuckled to myself (or even laughed out loud) more often than I can count. Yes, some of the scenes could have been elaborated a bit or fleshed out more, and yes - there were a few moments where I felt like the twins got away a little bit too easily, but those are just the little bumps that almost any novel by a first-time author has.<br /><br />As for predictability - well, sure ... there were a few things that I guessed at pretty early on, but I have to say that there were quite a few surprising twists and turns in the final chapters that I definitely did not see coming! In fact, I think the last 100 or so pages were my favorite part of the book, and it felt like Chris really hit his stride as a writer the further into the story he got - something that certainly makes me excited for the sequel ... :o)<br /><br />This book definitely proves that Chris Colfer is indeed a talented writer with a wonderful imagination whose storytelling ability  will most likely only get better with age, and I for one cannot wait for all the other stories that will surely come out of his creative mind in the coming years!<br /><br />So to sum this up .... what did I love most about TLOS? Well, I'd say its unique story and humor,  the interesting characters - and the magical feeling it left me with ... :o)<br /><br />Last but not least, one note about the audiobook:<br /><br />It is read by Chris Colfer himself, and what a treat that is! He really has a unique voice - both literally and figuratively speaking - and his narrative is utterly engaging. He truly manages to give every character their own voice and personality (and that's no small feat considering the large number of characters in this book!), and I must say that I almost loved the audiobook a bit more than the actual printed book (which I read first) - and that means a lot coming from me since I'm not normally a fan of audiobooks at all  ....!
1594203334|3.0|This book was a very fast read, entertaining and interesting, but left a very bad taste in my mouth. At the end of it, I felt really pretty let down. The author didn't do enough research into the American parenting-- maybe this is difficult, writing from France, but it doesn't excuse her. She bases her ideas of what American parenting is like on a few trips to the playgrounds in Brooklyn and Miami, on a few blogs, and on her friends. Which means that her idea of Americans is they are all high-powered super-competitive, super-neurotic people-- the cartoon versions of those helicopter parents you read about in the New York Times Magazine. She does mention that she's only speaking of middle to upper class Americans, but I'm a middle class American, and most of my friends are. She's speaking of extremes here, not your average American, or EVEN your average middle-to-upper-class American.<br /><br />Some examples: Her chapter on Daycare is totally out of date. She posits we Americans look down on daycare while the French promote it as a way to 'socialize' their children. My experience is that most Americans use daycare because it's economical. If they don't it's because it's not economical. It also costs an arm and a leg here. Parents pay anywhere from $1000 to $2000 for an infant. The price goes down as the kids get older, but it's hard as a mother to fight against the urge to stay with your baby when we are basically paying half our paychecks to childcare. Which leads to my other bone to pick with this book-- she downplays the role of free childcare, free healthcare, the short workweek (don't the French work an average of 35 hours a week?) in Europe. This is really annoying. Her claims that the French are such great parents because they are calmer than Americans-- well, yeah. I'd be calmer too if I all that support. She has all these grand claims about the 'cadre' created among children-- but children in France spend a lot more time eating dinner with their families, going places, and doing fun things-- hence the need to train them to behave in these situations. In the United States, most families are caught in a vicious cycle of working and catching up on household chores, and the need to teach your children how to eat vegetables correctly with a fork comes last after making sure they get some sort of dinner (usually something quick and easy like mac and cheese, something you don't have to spend 2 hours preparing) and into bed and their clothes washed and laid out for daycare the next day. Ok, so the casualty is kids without table manners. Among other things-- like no family time at all. It would be nice if she had acknowledged the different priorities of our countries and the government policies that have resulted as a major factor in the difference, and not blamed it on us poor American parents who don't know any better.<br /><br />A final little annoyance-- she talks toward the end of the book about the 'owl eyes' of Parents when their kids are doing something wrong. Apparently, in France, the parents can turn this special expression, their 'owl eyes' on their kids and the kids will stop being bad. We have that too. It's called 'The Eye.' Any teacher worth her (or his) salt can do it, and most people who grew up in big families can do it too. The people who can't are those people who grew up without a lot of little kids around. Again, the segmentation of American society, the loss of our extended families, the priority of work over family life that exists here-- NOT the stupid naivete of the Americans.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I am a big fan of fantasy books, and I read quite a few books per year.  This book is simply one of the best books I have ever read.  The characters are excellent, the story is amazing, and my only complaint is that the second book is not out yet!<br /><br />This is truly a wonderful book, priced below what it should be.  I think this is a sign of the times though with self published books.  Some people have pointed out grammatical errors, but I didn't find the editing (or lack of) to be a distraction at all.<br /><br />Loved it.  Buy this book.  You will not regret it!<br /><br />Edit: I just read on the author's blog that he has been picked up by a publisher.  My advice: BUY THIS BOOK NOW!  I won't be surprised if it comes down at this wonderful price (where the author gets most of the money too).  Apparently the publisher is going to publish this book, so I assume they will also get the electronic version and this one will be gone.<br /><br />Also found out that the second book is about half way done, but it won't be out until after the publisher puts out this book.  I get it, but it still sucks.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app because I tells me when my battery is low. so I can charge it when it is time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I found this game as a top seller on the freebie app list. What a bargain! This is certainly among the top games I have played on the Kindle Fire. (Um. Of course, I really have the Kindle Fire for reading great books.:)<br /><br />The game is pleasantly intuitive - just connect the dots and don't cross any of the lines. Of course, it gets more challenging later on. There is a mode that allows you to take your time and a time trial mode, in which you race the clock to complete as many puzzles as possible.<br /><br />It is fun; it is strangly calming and relaxing; and I am sure that it is improving my visual-spacial skills. It is also quite addictive!<br /><br />It works perfectly on the Kindle Fire. Highly recommended.

B0007939NO|3.0|Two American ramblers (Van Johnson, Gene Kelly) wandering in the Scottish Highlands stumble across the imaginary village of Brigadoon that appears only once every 100 years. Inhabitants are not allowed to go outside the village boundaries or the village will disappear forever. The fantasy aspect undoubtedly appealed to lyricist Alan Jay Lerner, who was a keen devotee of psychic phenomena and the `supernatural'. The music was by Frederick Loewe. Cyd Charisse is also in the film and plays a local lass who captures Kelly's heart: Carole Richards dubbed for Cyd Charisse in the songs. I find it hard to take seriously the reviewer who said this was Loewe and Lerner's greatest musical - not 'My Fair Lady' or 'Gigi' or 'Paint Your Wagon'?<br /><br />The sets are all staged unfortunately, rather than being shot on location, and this adds to the artificial feeling of the whole film. There is a rousing ensemble number, `I'll go home with bonnie Jean', which was one of the high spots of the film. Kelly sings and dances `Almost like being in love' (the only hit song in the movie) and he is joined by Cyd Charisse for a duet on `The heather on the hill'. Apart from these numbers, there is little memorable about the film. Vincente Minnelli did the direction and Arthur Freed was the producer.

B007ATHNJA|4.0|I could have easily rated this production five stars had it not been for one serious distraction. William Christie's musicianship and profound understanding of the work are impeachable, his Les Arts Florissants are as usually excellent, Daniele de Niese and Philippe Yaroussky are superb in the leading roles, other singers are in general good, the stage setting has a good balance of being realistic without falling into the trap of an extravagant Nero's court.<br />However the major weakness in this production is the silly and absurd costumes that verge on the farcical in this tragic and serious opera. One can focus on the merits of the performance and attempt to ignore the stupid customes, however, it exasperates me that very serious and talented  artists would succumb to the whims of a director with a bizarre taste for ridiculous costumes. Having said that, Pier Luigi Pizzi's general direction and staging are excellent. He arrived to a very subtle mixture of a staged operatic work with a sung performance of this epitome of Monteverdi's operas. I really wish that next time he tackle's an opera he delegates the business of custome design to someone who understands his business.
0394721780|5.0|Although I DO own the hard-bound Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\", I also purchased the so-called \\"trade paper-bound\\" versions, through Amazon.<br /><br />The reason is simple: I prefer to work from spiral-bound editions, over which I can apply a layer of poly wrap (Saran ?) as a protector, while cooking.<br /><br />I take the \\"trade paper-bound\\" editions to a local copier service center (Kinkos in the old days, FedEx today) and have them mount, in their motorized paper-cutter, the edition with clear vinyl covers and in \\"one fell swoop\\" slice-off the so-called \\"perfect binding\\".

0062124293|1.0|I'm sorry, but this is the most profane and degrading book I've ever read.  I managed to push through skimming the first 2 chapters (I can't even write what it was about without being flagged for profanity and crude language) but at the opening of chapter 3 I was done.  It's not only disgusting and crude, but actually degrading to women.  I can't believe anyone rated this book above a 1-star (If I could have given 0 I would have!) and definitely can't believe Amazon would recommend it.  I'd hate to think that all we (women) are is what she has in this book (stuck on pleasuring our bodies, obsessed with pornography, and intent on namming our private parts).  Horrible book!

B007SGM084|3.0|So, how many times can a person have \\"mind altering\\" sex?  The book was an easy read, but the main character, Ana, was a flake.  Could she be so blinded buy the great sex and incredibly handsome man to see that his sexual lifestyle takes committment and experience.  She's an innocent girl looking for the love of her life (just like a fairytale).  I am struggling to get the interest up to read the 2nd book.  I don't want to read more about Ana's inability to make a rational decision.  I also do not want to read about how every sexual experience is better than the previous.  Everyone has \\"bad\\" sex in their lives.

1401207529|4.0|I know that this is no longer the official origin of the current incarnation of Batman, but this is definitely the version that stands the test of time the best. This is a story of two men who so badly want to make the world better that they are willing to risk everything to make that happen. The artists have done a great job making the emotions of the characters very tangible, far more so than has been achieved in any Batman film even.
1595825045|5.0|As a devoted fan of the show from almost the very beginning, I followed all the interviews, sneak peeks, and DVD commentaries aggressively, so I thought I knew a good bit about every aspect of the show, from its influences to its creation process to little trivia bits about the finished episodes. I told myself I didn't need the art book because it would tell me little about Avatar that I didn't already know. For a while I was able to hold off buying this book, but the art in Avatar is so beautiful that I finally broke down and got it, telling myself that I might as well dish out twenty bucks to have a nice hardcover Avatar book to add to my collection of flimsy cinemanga and Earth Kingdom Chronicles paperbacks. Now I'm writing this review to tell every fan out there who has had even a minute's hesitation in buying this book: DO IT.<br /><br />Avatar: The Art of the Animated Series covers everything you could dream of wanting to know about the show. I should have known Bryke would never do anything halfway. I was blown away by the obviously intense amount of effort the creators put into compiling such a thorough and well-put-together inside look at the creation process. They explain everything about Avatar's production, starting with their very first fateful meeting and taking fans all the way up through the end of the epic series. It's so neat to read about all their inspirations (especially if you're an anime fan; you'll probably recognize a lot of names) and some of the difficulties they had to overcome in order to make the show what it is today. It is a fantastic read from cover to cover.<br /><br />As you can tell when you use Amazon's \\"look inside\\" feature, the creator commentary is arranged in paragraph format with bold letters to tell which creator is speaking. They actually go into a lot more detail than I thought they would about almost everything. They spend a lot of time talking about the development of characters: their personalities, design characteristics, models, and any changes that were made and why. (Plus it's really neat to see the way some of your favorite characters looked like originally!) They mention the animals, settings, voice acting, martial arts influences, weapons and technology, and all sorts of other things, some that you may not even necessarily have thought about much before, like color schemes and drawing styles. I learned a lot of really neat things about the process behind Avatar's animation and about the Korean studio that did such a beautiful job animating the series.<br /><br />The thing I like most about this book is the great variety of art it showcases. There are original character concepts by various crew members, background sketches and paintings, real storyboard action sequences, martial arts references, detailed clothing and weapon designs, descriptions and illustrations of Avatar-verse animals, screenshots from the show and the original pilot episode, press and/or promotional art, and even some photos Mike and Bryan took on some of their trips to places that inspired the layout of the Avatar universe. And to top it all off, there is at least a one-page spread for each one of Avatar's 61 chapters that highlights some of the strongest points in each episode, whether it's new characters, locations, technology, action sequences, or a combination of several of these. Needless to say, this book is a must-have for all Avatar fans. Whether you're a casual fan who just happened to fall in love with the art (and there is plenty of it in this book, all amazing quality despite the fact that much of it is simply sketched) or you're a die-hard Avatard who wants to know everything about everything, trust me when I say that this compilation is worth every penny and more.<br /><br />As for the packaging and shipping, I have very little to say - the item was wrapped adequately and arrived when it said it would. No problems there. The only minor (and I do mean minor) problem that I had was that oneof the corners was bent when it arrived. It probably would have happened anyway, though, through regular use, so it's not really something to complain about. Everything else was fine, and the price is excellent given the durable binding and beautiful thick pages (not to mention the content). I know I've said this so many times that it's probably starting to sound old, but if you want a good look behind the scenes of the greatest cartoon of our generation, this is it. Other creators, take note: this is how TV series art books should be.

Nowhere did it state that many of the songs, from the original recording (VHS) were deleted on the DVD I purchased.  I expected the same concert that I purchased on VHS to be on the DVD copy I purchased through Amazon.  I contacted the company that was the supplier of this DVD, but didn't get much help from them.  I would not recommend doing business there.

B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind was released onto the unsuspecting music world in 1991 to amazingly positive reviews. Many people thought this was Nirvana's debut (their debut was made two years earlier with Bleach) and some even thought Smells Like Teen Spirit was their only song! This has a far more refined sound compared to Well, anyway, the artwork does feature a naked baby. But, as Kurt said, \\"If you're offended by this, you're probably a closet pedofile.\\"<br /><br />(4.5/5) Smells Like Teen Spirit - I don't feel like I need to go into this. Literally everybody knows this song, even if you hate Nirvana. Everything about this is timeless. Kurt actually quite hated this song and would intentionally mess it up in concert.<br /><br />(5/5) In Bloom - I love this song to death. The riff is amazing and it has a(n) (intentionally) catchy chorus (just don't sing along, Kurt will hate it.) It's supposedly about rednecks, but I don't really see the connection. The video for this is hilarious.<br /><br />(5/5) Come As You Are - Another hit, and my second favorite song from this album. It uses the chorus effect to give it a nice wavy feel for the opening. The lyrics are very good and the solo is fantastic. This is one of the first song people who learn guitar learn for picking styles.<br /><br />(5/5) Breed - This is a concert staple and one of the few songs from Nevermind that Kurt actually enjoyed playing. There's not much to say except don't even try to interpret the lyrics, as they are completely non-sensical. I think this was made like I Am The Walrus by the Beatles in that he knew people would over analyze they lyrics and wrote a song with no meaning to confuse people.<br /><br />(4.5/5) Lithium - A rather eerie song about a man who turns to god after killing his wife. This is the song that \\"invented\\" Nirvana's quiet-loud style (Nirvana copied this style from the Pixies.) This is one of the creepier songs to hear at night. Everyone sang along when this was played live at the 1992 ReadingFestival. I love this song and it deserves  more praise than it gets.<br /><br />(3/5) Polly - Now that we're out of the singles, we can see what kind of songs Kurt really wanted to write. Polly is a repetitive acoustic song with the only instrument being a cymbal hit at the beginning of the chorus. It's not very impressive and has better versions, so I think it's the low point of the album. It is about a 14-year-old girl named Polly who was kidnapped and abused with a blow torch and in *ahem* other ways that I cannot list here.<br /><br />(4/5) Territorial P**sings -  A short song about god-knows-what. This song has no use of the title, so it is radio friendly. The opening of it is so hilariously sarcastic that I can't help but laugh it (it's Khrist Novelisc saying, \\"Come on people now! Smile like you're brothers everybody get together! Try to love one another right nooooooooooow!\\" in a weird filtered voice.)<br /><br />(5/5) Drain You - Kurt hated the recording of this, which is why he loved playing it in concert so people could hear how it was supposed to hear. This is severely underrated in my opinion. It was always played second on the In Utero tour. It's not very notable, but it's a great song that real Nirvana fans should know.<br /><br />(5/5) Lounge Act - This is my favorite song on the album. Sure, it's short, and it's one of the only times Kurt swears in a song, but does that really diminish the quality of the song now does it? It has a very eastern sound to it and has great lyrics as well. I personally think it's about a guy turning himself in for his love (I'm probably wrong.)<br /><br />(4.5/5) Stay Away - Originally titled Pay To Play, this is a three and a half minute song with non-sensical lyrics, fast paced riffs, and great rhythm. Not really much to say, but it's a good song and I wish there was one like it.<br /><br />(4/5) On A Plain - This has the clearest meaning of all the songs on here. It's the cheeriest song on here and sounds pretty weirduntil the last verse. It's about a guy being on a musical plain, AKA never gaining or losing fame. Also about songwriting.<br /><br />(3.5/5) Something In The Way - This is creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepy. Like, really creepy. It's so quiet and depressing at every point. It's a short acoustic song with only guitar until the chorus which adds Dave's drumming and a cello. This is about a time in Kurt's life where he had to live under a bridge after his dad kicked him out.This IS the last the song of the album, unless you count...<br /><br />(4/5) Endless Nameless - This is only one some pressings of the album. It comes after a five minute silent period on Something In The Way and has a low riff and weird lyrics. It was hardly ever played live, but when it is, oh man is it played wrong. It really is an improv song, which is why things sound so different on different recordings.
0307592731|4.0|This was an interesting read regarding the Pacific Crest trail, and woman journeying alone.  I would give it five stars except for the fact she includes the most horrifying description of putting a horse down with a gun and  it going wrong.  Putting the horse down had nothing to do with this fascinating account.  I felt like she included it to try to cleanse herself for making such a disgusting decision regarding the horse.  The reader did NOT need to hear that story.

B000P0J0EW|4.0|The film is superb. The plot is simple but with surprising twists, the characterisation is sensitive and believable, and the acting is outstanding.<br /><br />I like how the violence is neither glorified nor glossed over, neither graphically displayed nor hushed up. This gives a realistic, honest picture without excessive display of violence. I wish more films used this approach.<br /><br />The ending, alas, is saccharine and implausible and feels tacked on. If they had stopped the film earlier - say, when the postcard arrived - the viewer would have been left satisfied but thoughtful. Instead, they tacked on a sweet cheese ending. And, as if that wasn't enough, yet another sweet cheese. And another. These endings don't feel right; they lack the realism and authenticity and don't seem to be the same film. It was as if they couldn't leave a good thing as it was and were looking for yet more ways to make it cheesier.<br /><br />I recommend this film. It's worth watching. If you want it to be memorable, I suggest you stop when the postcard arrives. After that it goes downhill. I don't expect anyone will take my advice, though. :-)

1609611543|5.0|What a fantastic read, and has completely changed my life. I was never one to follow a diet, scoffed at people who went on the latest \\"trend\\" diet and generally thought my life was fine. I was told by an acquaintance, not even a close friend, just a guy I saw occasionally in passing, to read the book, after he saw my ever progressing belly over a period of about 6 months. In 30 seconds he had my attention, and I read the book, cover to cover, in less than a day. Game changer for me....the next day, I decided I would not only quit smoking, but change my diet, eating nothing but organic paleo foods, threw out all processed foods in my house, and began exercising. 4 weeks on, I have never felt better, have lost 16 pounds, noticeable in my face and belly, and no more acid reflux and even my asthma has suddenly become less noticeable. Funny thing was, yesterday I went to a Yankees game as I was visiting NYC, and \\"had\\" to try an authentic ballpark hotdog, what a night I had later, a seve reaction to the the hotdog left me with a miserable night - which proved the theory in this book. Get this book, read it, and follow e thing for 30 days, you have nothing to lose, except the belly and EVERYTHING to gain.

B005LAII1C|4.0|Ted is the cinematic debut of Seth MacFarlane, a polarizing figure if ever there was one. Obviously he's the creator of the highly successful Family Guy and American Dad, but he's often criticized for being unoriginal and derivative. Ted comes pre-packaged with a particular demographic, all of whom seemed to attend the screening I saw. I don't mean to stereotype, but I'm not sure anyone in that theater was not texting. Regardless, those who criticize MacFarlane have to give him credit for Ted. His first film is a big budget comedy about a man's relationship with a talking teddy bear. It's an interesting premise at face value. What's surprising is that Ted is essentially a formulaic romantic comedy that happens to have a talking, pothead teddy bear in it. This is a criticism, but Ted has received positive reviews and that's for a reason; when it's funny, it's very funny.<br /><br />It's 1985 in Massachusetts and young John Bennett is the most un-popular kid in the neighborhood. For Christmas, he's given a teddy bear and it becomes his best friend. One night he wishes for the teddy bear to come to life and it does. With one newscaster proclaiming \\"look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did!\\" Ted becomes an overnight celebrity, even appearing on Johnny Carson. But, \\"like Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, and Justin Bieber\\" the narrator (Patrick Stewart) informs us, \\"people eventually stop giving a s***.\\" Cut to present day, John (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (voiced and motion-captured by MacFarlane) live together, spending a good amount of time smoking pot and watching the movie Flash Gordon. John is in a committed relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis), whose patience with John and Ted's friendship is wearing thin. She finally convinces John to make Ted move out when they come home to find Ted in the company of four prostitutes; one of whom has left something on the floor.<br /><br />Yes, toilet humor abounds in Ted but this should come as no surprise if you're at all familiar withMacFarlane's work. The film is written by MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin, and Wellesley Wild, all of whom have written for Family Guy. All three have upped the ante on the humor, knowing that this would be a theatrical film and the jokes need to be funnier and more memorable; however, don't expect the humor to differ much from that formula. If MacFarlane's TV work has worn out its welcome for you, don't assume you'll dislike Ted. Just be aware that the humor shares the same DNA and has its share of cut-aways and random, anti-PC dialogue.<br /><br />Ted, while imperfect and with its fair share of jokes that fail to gel, is consistently funny and may be the funniest film I've seen this year. It scores big laughs immediately and the humor never runs out of steam. The humor often comes from pop culture references, cameos, and offensive insults, but there is some comedic gold here and few minutes pass without another big laugh. It's vulgar and provocative, but the really good jokes will make you short of breath.<br /><br />It's easy to forget or overlook, but this film relies heavily on visual effects. Ted is in nearly every scene and the motion-capture here is wonderful. If Ted ages poorly it will not result from the visual effects, which really give off the impression that a stuffed teddy bear has come to life. Why is Seth MacFarlane, a first time director whose previous successes have solely been animated television shows, able to make a film with better special effects than a guaranteed blockbuster like Twilight? And not only does Ted look great, but he's a fully developed character that MacFarlane brings to life both physically and vocally. The film acknowledges that Ted's voice isn't a far cry from Peter Griffin's voice, but he's a fully-realized, unique character.<br /><br />The performances are fine. Wahlberg has proven to be a gifted comedic actor and he's effective here, however the film seems unaware of something pivotal. The friendship angle of John and Ted is muchmore fascinating than the romantic angle of John and Lori. The film is consistently funny, but the storytelling lacks this same consistency. Aside from the presence of a talking teddy bear, there's little to separate this from any other romantic comedy. Even the music cues are the same (although, with MacFarlane as director, this film's a little heavier on the use of showtunes). Even worse is the unnecessary subplot involving Donny (Giovanni Ribisi), who wants to kidnap Ted for his son. Donny's presence contributes some hilarious moments to the film but the actual kidnapping subplot fails to gain momentum. Had the film shifted its focus to the relationship between Ted and John and been more of a buddy movie, I think it could've been funnier and more engaging.<br /><br />Ted is much better than it has any right to be, but will probably be just as polarizing as its creator for anyone outside of the built-in fanbase. MacFarlane fails to deliver on all the potential this film could've had to offer, but his debut film is uproariously funny at times and boasts a memorable, unique protagonist. Ted is imperfect, but it's a solid debut for MacFarlane that shows a seamless transition from TV to film, animation to live action. Not only would I like to see what else he has to offer, I'd actually be open for a sequel.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|When my mother first started watching this show, I thought it was going to be another stuffy, British period drama. Then when my dad gave it his endorsement, I was curious. The characterization and constant plotting of said characters is nothing short of addictive. Season 2 is a more than satisfying follow up to the last as World War I rips through the lives of all. Superbly written, acted, and filmed. There's nothing not to like.

0312641893|5.0|Set in New Beijing sometime in the future after World War IV, the world is terrified by a very real and terrible plague called Letumosis which is highly contagious and completely deadly.  Medical technology is much more advanced and humans who once would have died in accidents can now become cyborgs and live, but as second class citizens looked down upon by society.  Cinder is a young mechanic who works to fund the social lives of her stepmother and two step sisters.  After one of her step sisters contracts Letmosis, her stepmother sends Cinder off to be a cyborg volunteer at the research centre trying to find a cure for this deadly plague. From here Cinder's whole world goes into a huge spin as she discovers things about herself and her past that she would never have dreamed.<br /><br />Cinder is a wonderful character, definitely much more defiant and independent then the original Cinderella and I really enjoyed her point of view and telling of this story.  The entire Cinderella retelling was just wonderful, there was enough elements of the original fairytale in the book that gave it a comforting familiar touch but it still managed to be so very unique.  I especially loved the twist on the dramatic ball scene with Cinder's grand entrance and reveal to the handsome prince!<br /><br />The romance between Prince Kai and Cinderella was nicely done, not too thick or unrealistic and definitely not overally dramatic which I really enjoyed. Prince Kai was just a lovely male love interest in general and I think is a wonderful ruler - a great mix of empathy and inner strength!  At the end when Kai discovers Cinder's secret it was just heart breaking and so beautifully done, I just felt so sorry for the both and wished they could have their happily ever after.<br /><br />The added plot twists with the Lunar civilisation was fascinating and really sets this book apart from the average Cinderella retelling.  I found the Lunar people fascinating and loved the tension and anxiousness when the Lunar Queen descends onto Earth.  I can't wait to find out more about this in the future books of the Lunar Chronicles!<br /><br />This has really been one of the best books I've read so far this year and I am incredibly impressed considering Cinder is written by a debut author.  I think that this is a story that will suit anyone - don't let the science fiction elements put you off as this really isn't the heart of this novel. Cinder is a mystery, science fiction, love story and paranormal all in one and boy does it really work!ness when the Lunar Queen descends onto Earth.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|During my teen years, I came across John Carter of Mars written by Edgar Rice Burrough and became fascinated by that book and the rest of the series.  Now that it has been made into a mmovie, I have renewed my interest in the books as well.  Them  movie was up to my expectations and I ma hoping that this catches on and the rest of the 4 books becomes movies.  Mr Burroughs wrote  this book in 1911 and made this journey to Mars and back realistic.  Although he was noted for the Tarzan series, his SiFi books were not to be under rated.  They have captured my interest these 50 years later.  I hope enough people get behind this so the rest of the books becomes movies.<br />This movie is a must see for all SiFi fans.

BUY THIS. SUPPORT BRANDON SANDERSON.

However, after a while this story grew on me and I liked it going past to present and present to past.  I thought it had a very good story line and I liked the characters.  The end is brilliant and seems to set readers up for a sequel, of which I will gladly buy and read.

B005LAIHSG|4.0|Charlize Theron is stunningly beautiful and equally talented (as always). I could go on forever, but nothing needs to be said. Film-stealing in both appearance and performance; a wise decision to give the villain more than her fair share of screen time. I so wanted the queen to win.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth gave an excellent performance and was easy on the eyes. Rugged on the outside with a soft heart, just the way I like them. I hope we continue to see more of him in the future.<br /><br />Kristen did what she does best, look the part. Damsel in distress, don't say much, play dead, good job. It's a shame she's so lovely and so talent-less at the same time. It's like Keanu Reeves had a little sister. Thank you to all involved who kept the title character from having to say more than one sentence at a time for almost the whole film. She had one big speech, which she delivered expectantly mediocre, but they had to let her talk some time. I hope her Twilight role doesn't carry her career much further.<br /><br />All in all a definite go-see. Beautiful effects and a great interpretation of a classic story. Theron 5 stars, Hemsworth 5 stars, Stewart 3.

0671004107|4.0|Good book to pick up.<br /><br />What Carl has done here is an attempt to imagine what first contact with an alien civilization would be for Earth, but utilizing a background of science rather than science fiction. It's a look at how two civilizations, grown up in different systems with little if anything in common would communicate (spoilers: a long transmission utilizing prime numbers as they don't occur naturally in nature). He proceeds with all the relations to human civilization that such a transmission would bring about, in terms of religion, culture, social interaction, interaction between nations and politics, the economics of (spoiler: building a machine with blueprints that the aliens have transmitted), and the search for what it means to know that we are definitely not alone.<br /><br />It's deeper than I'm making it sound, of course.<br /><br />The style is definitely different than most novels, which may be a little odd, but it's worth it. Give it a read or watch the movie. Free on Amazon for Prime members.

0786856297|5.0|There are a lot of books out there that are similar to the Harry Potter series, and a surprising number that come close to the Potter experience. But, for the most part, either with regard to characters, backstory, overall plot, creativity or writing skill, they don't entirely measure up.<br /><br />  Well, the Percy Jackson books not only measure up, but in many ways exceed the Potter standard. A hipper hero, more intriguing companions, more action and conflict, more plotting variety over the course of the series, more accessible writing. If you need a Potter fix, a Potter alternative, or just a cool book to intrigue a young reader - this series has it all.

B005GHN2GG|5.0|I am an avid reader and I must say, this is probably one my favorite books in 2012. It is a great read with a great backstory and a beautiful and often, very humorous, love story. The character Martise is not a beauty but is a great character to follow. She is like many of us who do not stand out in a crowd, often overlooked, but unique in her own way. Silhara, the mage/master of crows isn't someone you will like much at first but grow to admire and love. The other central characters of the story, Gurn (Silhara's servent) and Cael (Silhara's mage finder) add a great deal of humor to the story too. The medievel/fantasy setting is a wonderful backdrop. I read a great deal of romance, paranormal romance, BDSM, sci-fi and fantasty (sometimes all mixed together) and I would recommend this book.
076535618X|5.0|I hesitated to buy the final book in the trilogy because I liked the first one a lot, the second book was a good read with a great ending but without the action of the first book, and the final book seemed to be so far from the first one in content and story line I just got cold feet for a while. I reluctantly bought it and I am glad I did. It was as good as the first one with enough surprises, twists, drama and action to please anyone. If you wondering if you should buy I recommend you do. It is a great story
B005FPT51K|5.0|I don't know why people put bad feedbacks on this product. I was researching for baby monitors, and I liked this the most. If you are an IOS device owner, you can eliminate few baby gadgets. Some people complain that it doesn't work over 3g or outside of your wifi zone, they didn't set up properly. I can check my baby from my work over my 3g network. AT home, I don't have to carry my cell phone and baby monitor everywhere I go. All I need is my iphone or my ipad. You can even install the pc version of ibaby, and monitor your baby with your PC. This is a great product, I can't live without it. Some people complain that ibaby's tech support is horrible. When I had a problem setting up my ibaby over 3g network, they returned my phone call within few hours after I left message. They were very polite and knew what they are doing. So I want to tell these people leaving bad feedback that they need to follow instruction.

What a waste of time....I am by no means a prude and I enjoy reading a little graphic sex now and again, but that was ALL this book was...that's all any of these books are...I never thought I'd get bored reading about sex, but this was just stupid....Stay clear of these inane, useless, poorly written books....what was I thinking???

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Honestly the whole series was too hyped up. I was disappointed in the detailing of just about every aspect of the series. This book was the most complicated of the 3. Author tried to put too much into one book to tie it all up. I was completely lost at the ending as well.
1467934925|4.0|I'm pitching in my two cents because it seems to me that a great many reviewers, both those that claim to \\"love\\" Keynes and those who excoriate him as the root of all evil, may not have actually read this book.  Rather, it appears that their sources of information range from the \\"Keynes vs. Hayek\\" rap video circulating on the net (a video which I love and which I include in my classes), or the ramblings of Glen Beck (a man who wouldn't like Hayek at all if he had actually read and understood more than the readers' digest comic book version of the Road to Serfdom).  The video is actually a pretty good summation of Hayek and Keynes' political-economic positions- but this book contains more than just politics.  The GT is the foundational book of Macroeconomics and modern monetary theory- the theory of liquidity preference that is the heart of the book, and is essentially \\"invented\\" by Keynes, is not contested by any serious economist (with the exception of Rothbard and, as much as I respect the guy, in this issue he's wrong).  Neither Hayek nor Friedman would have argued against the ISLM model.  In fact, the Austrian Theory of the Business cycle kind of relies on the truth of the ISLM model in order to make sense.  If both the Austrians and the New Dealers agree on a model, then it is probably worth taking a closer look at that model.<br /><br />Granted, Keynes and Hayek look at the formulation of liquidity preference and draw different conclusions regarding policy- although I think it is safe to say that neither Keynes nor Hayek are nearly as dogmatic about Keynesianism and \\"Hayekianism\\" as their respective modern day followers are.  But policy is not theory, and this book is the General THEORY of employment, interest, and money.  Thus, to claim that the welfare state is bad (an entirely legitimate claim, and one that I agree with) is not necessarily to criticize theoretical framework advanced the General Theory.  In order to criticize the general theory as an economic book, you would have to discuss it on its own terms.  This necessitates actually reading the book, something a number of reviewers don't appear to have done.<br /><br />I'll be honest, the book is moderately difficult reading.  Not because it is poorly written, but because it is 1936, and Keynes doesn't have the linguistic tools that will be developed by following economists to discuss the issues that he is talking about. There is no graph of the ISLM model, because no one had yet boiled down the GT into graphs.  A beginning student of physics might find Isaac Newton's \\"Principia\\" a hard slog, for mucht he same reason.  Also, some of Keynes says is truly opaque, wrong, or simply weird.  So be it, the man is blazing new trails.  No one calls Newton an idiot because he didn't anticipate the theory of relativity.<br /><br />Anyway, it seems to me that most of the arguing going on about this book on these reviews is based on current political axe grinding, and has very little to do with the economics of this truly great work of economics.  So go read it yourself.<br /><br />Also, watch the rap video.  It's good stuff.c book, you would have to discuss it on its own terms.

0718177029|5.0|Me Before You by JoJo Moyes will make you bawl like a baby. It's a heartbreaking book that deals with a very tough subject-euthanasia, and whether or not to allow that person, who's suffering because their quality of life is so horrible and will never improve, to be given the choice to end their own life regardless of their loves ones who will be devastated by the suicide.<br /><br />Me Before You is also an uplifting story when all is said and done. I'm so glad I took the chance and read this poignant, emotional and at times humorous tale. The humor used here is to soften the blow of the tragedy that has occurred. Me Before You hit me hard in the gut but also made me smile because of the amazing relationship the female protagonist, Louisa has with the sick Will. At first you think Will needs Louisa, but when it comes down to it, Louisa needed Will at the right moment in her life. He teaches her to live in the moment and live each day as it's her last because Will can't any longer.<br /><br />Will Traynor is a successful, handsome jetsetter of a man who's always on the go. He's traveled the world and has done everything and anything. All this ends for him at thirty-five when he's hit by a car and is paralyzed from the waist down. He can no longer feed, bathe, change himself or even go to the bathroom and must be taken care of for the rest of his life. His quality of life is next to nothing. He will slowly deteriorate from sickness and infection, and because of that he can barely find the will to live. He moves back in with his parents and he gives his mother and father an ultimatum they must accept, because if they don't, he'll do whatever he can to make certain it happens. This ultimatum is that after six months, he'll go to a facility in Switzerland where assisted suicide is legal. He's giving his parents six months to adjust and come to terms with his decision. To make sure Will doesn't do anything to harm himself before the deadline, they hire someone to keep him company and perhaps show him that he does have a reason to live. That's where Louisa Clark comes in.<br /><br />Louisa has lost her job at The Buttered Bun, a cafe where she's work for years. The job was very easy and comforting for her. This twenty-something woman lives at home with her parents, her grandfather and her sister and her nephew. When Louisa loses her job, she's worried because she feels she doesn't have any great skills that could help her find work. Louisa is the type of woman who's very set in her ways and afraid to take chances. She's been with her boyfriend Patrick, a man obsessed with running and exercise, for seven years because he's a safe choice. Louisa does rebel against her nature in some ways since she loves wearing eclectic clothing that seems at odd with her outlook. When she reads in the paper about a job as a companion to a man who's a quadriplegic, she goes on the interview even though she has no experience at all. Surprisingly she gets the job, although Mrs. Traynor, Will's mother has her doubts. And the moment Louisa meets Will, her life will change in ways she least expects it.<br /><br />At first Will is cold and rude to Louisa, who he calls Clark. But eventually he opens up and they develop a tentative relationship of sorts. Louisa slowly finds out what type of man Will used to be, and Will in turn figures out the woman Louise should be. But then Louisa finds out why Will's mother hired her. Now she's determined to do whatever she can to change Will's mind before the six months deadline and show him he has so much to live for even though he's a prisoner in his own body.<br /><br />Fans of chick-lit will adore Me Before You. Louisa has a very Bridget Jones type personality. She's adorable, quirky and lovely in so many ways. She's the perfect foil for Will's plan, but Will is set on his course. The biggest question will be if Louisa can change Will's mind. Louisa does bring Will out of his shell, and he in turn helps her believe inherself and pushes her to go after the happiness that's due her and thought she could never have.<br /><br />Louisa and Will's relationship evolves in a way that will have readers smiling through their tears. You're hoping for an outcome that may or may not happen between Louisa and Will. The results are surprising. The last fifty pages had me on the edge of my seat wondering how this story will turn out, and if there's that typical happily ever I'm used to. As for the HEA, it's very subjective on the reader's part. But I can promise you this, your heart will be lifted up, and don't be surprised if you're motivated to get up out of your chair and do something inspiring for yourself, much like Louisa ends up doing.<br /><br />Me Before You is a story with important moral behind it. I laughed, I choked up and I wanted so much more for Louisa and Will. This is one book everyone should read. You'll be a better person for it.<br /><br />Katiebabsherself and pushes her to go after the happiness that's due her and thought she could never have.<br /><br />Louisa and Will's relationship evolves in a way that will have readers smiling through their tears.

The Red Tails film seems aimed at those with little interest or conception of either flying, combat flying in World War Two, or reality. The Red Tails knock out 63 German planes on the ground in 5 minutes on their first action in Italy.  Five minutes because that is all the fuel they have left. Then they do acrobatics over their own field before landing. At that rate, give them an hour of fuel and they could have destroyed the entire Luftwaffe. The fact is during the entire war the Tuskegee airmen destroyed 150 German aircraft on the ground, a fine record, but it took nearly two years.  Then the potentially suspenseful scene of the Red Tail coming home with a fuel soaked plane is 'talked in' but never told to cut his engine.  He seems to hit the runway at full throttle. You can't land a plane at full throttle, and with a bad fuel leak, you would glide in on final with switch off, so the electronics don't ignite the fuel. It seems the producers of this film didn't care to do a better job than they did, which is a sad.
B000RLFJQ2|1.0|There was no Quint Tarantino style dialogue, though it offers that pretense. I found it virtually impossible to suspend disbelief. The script seemed canned and by the numbers instead of creative cinema art. De Niro is one of my favorites, but even he couldn't overcome the lousy directing and crummy script. The accents of the characters were transparently fake. There was little suspense as every scene was so predictable.<br /><br />If this is the best (1st I've watched) Amazon has to offer its 'prime' customers, forget that as a bonus. I couldn't work up the desire to finish watching the film, so I didn't.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was encouraged by my wife to try this app. I just thought it looked silly. But now, having tried it, I must say it is great. Don't judge a book by its cover.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This was the bands fourth release and it was filled with harder songs that were less accesible than before perhaps.  But it still had the hit 'unchained' on it and several other big radio songs. The whole effort was well constructed and played to perfection. It's what made hard rock huge and now hard rock is dying under the weight of one note bands that can't sing. Back then melodies were important. and this was one of the worlds top selling groupgs. It's hard rockin' done well. the band was still one of the worlds biggest sellers at this point and would continue that into the 90's.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed the Trilogy.  There was too much explicit sex being described even though some of it was warranted, a lot of it was unnecessary and actually boring after a while.<br />In any case, I did enjoyed the first book the most and I was happy the last book resolved everything so nicely.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|As a child of the 80's, this soundtrack really brought me back!  I love the remixes of several songs together.  It's great driving music, especially if you like to sing along.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|the beatles were still able to produce masterful discs in 1969, the drugged out haze of late 1968 which killed their manager brian epstien was fading. These guys were starting to get it together and get straight. (off hard drugs). the bickering in the band didn't handicap the greatness that was to come from there last disc of the sixties. The sixties  themselves were collapsing soon anyways. But this was a highpoint in the decades musical canon. The decade started out in a whole other world musically and this was a fine finish to the decade for popular music. In fact people much older than teenagers were spinning this on their turntables. It was a big hit to say the least and I remember people who were in their forties at the time were enjoying this. Why? because it was groundbreaking in some regards. The songs are all great and even the last short opera is fine. It had of course several hit singles and that's what you would expect. If the beatles represented a out of control band on drugs and losing it , but still making great tunes though, this was a band going back to be a professional group of musicians.
B000AQJPQE|2.0|I went with an outer space theme room for my 5-year-old son's bedroom. When I came across this item, I knew it would add the perfect touch for his room. Foolish me for not further researching the product, but I was under the impression that this product takes the place of main light. It does not. Instead you would have to drill new holes in ceiling with a 22 inch clearing all around (for rotating planets) this concept in my son's square room would just look awkward (two lights practically side by side). Now I can't imagine anyone wanting to use this product as a main light source for any room given that it is a:battery-operated, and b: is way too dim to be useful.  I think the idea of the product is great, but they should definitely design one that just easily becomes the cover plate for an existing electrical ceiling light.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book was great from the first page to its last page. I was actually surprised in the end with the outcome of the book. Just be open minded and you'll like the book. :)
B007PAAO0Y|4.0|Love the music if Bobby and still growing to love the CD. However I personally still continue to listen to Bobby Womack for he's  been around a long time. And has put out some good sounds.
B007P06DJ0|4.0|The mastering on this album leaves much to be desired. It is beautifully presented and there are wide gaps of silence between song bands so it resembles an old RCA Victor orange label LP from the 70s. You have to crank up the volume in order to hear the music, which apparently has been mastered at a very low volume in order to preserve dynamic range and avoid compression. They should have realized vinyl COULD have tolerated a louder cutting volume and sill preserve the original dynamic range.. A pity.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app. I'm. constantly using my kindle. great ease of use. I would reccomend to a friend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such an amazing book. The author was very clever with the story as well as his focus on intricate and intense details. No doubt a page-turner.  After reading the whole trilogy, you will be left with wanting more. You definitely won't regret it.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This movie is a great one for kids because it asks of you to use you imagination and enjoy being a kid
B007SYWFRM|5.0|like all apps this has it problems but for the most part runs well and kids don't really notice<br />but it would be nice to see same updates available kindle fire when iphone receives them
B007PVHAN2|5.0|I have been waiting to own this historic and positively reinforcing documentary since the first minute I saw it in the theater. I can't wait for this Blu-ray to change the world, even if only a little bit, then Bob's message was true. There is nothing false about this great man, prophet, life-living rastafarian. Our \\"civilized\\" way of life could really benefit from more people like Mr. Marley!<br /><br />This documentary is NOT like watered-down Starbucks, it's like Blue Mountain Coffee! Hotels should replace the bible with this documentary, crazy baldheads!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|simplicity of the games gets a little boring but overall not a bad game. I enjoy the challenge of unlocking the other games.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is the best app for my kindle fire that I have ever had. Please keep the updates comming though. I want doors and working Tnt. It would be nice to have multiplayer and to play other peoples maps and creations. Good work keep it comming.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|awesome very addicting could easily help you pass the time. I recommend any one to try this game. All Ages
B008MEM24S|5.0|pretty cool spin off from where's my water.  few new gadgets and stuff to keep it fresh. worth the buck, stop reading reviews and buy it already... you'll like it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The early stages are pretty easy but there is still satisfaction in solving the puzzles. It gets tough when connecting the elements is only part of the puzzle and you have to cover the board as well.
0761169253|5.0|I read this book in a few hours; it's not too long and an easy read.  But don't let that fool you. This books packs a BIG creative punch. It's made me look at my own creativity in a whole new light. One of the best (if not THE best) books I've read on creativity (no matter what your own particular creativity might be) and at this price - what have you got to loose?
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This trilogy has been one of the best I've read in a long time.  I was unable to put the book down until I completed it.  Highly recommend!
B004R6JG7Q|1.0|LE MANS is the first and only STEVE MCQUEEN film that I did not like. It is a disappointment on so many levels. I know McQueen spent years trying to get a racing movie into production and finally it was time for LE MANS. I have read that the production of LE MANS was chaos from the beginning. A lot of egos were crushed, friendships and marriages destroyed. The end result was not worth all the trauma.<br /><br />Unless you are a diehard NASCAR or Formula 1 racing fan, there is not much to this film. I would guess 3/4 of the film is just scenes of cars racing. Dialogue is at a minimum and it was 40 minutes into the film before there was and real dialogue. For 40 minutes, we are treated to scenes of cars racing, spectactors mulling around, racers getting in and out of their cars, more cars racing and more people walking around. McQueen wanted the film to be in documentary style and it is except for the total lack of explanation about what is going on - exactly what is this race? What are the rules of competition? Lastly, what exactly is going on.<br /><br />Steve McQueen was an avid racing fan so I can imagine how much fun it was for him to be in a race. Special effects were not the rage when LE MANS was filmed, so the filmmakers had to use a lot of ingenuity in camera placement and set-up. Countless cameras were set up along the race track and attached to cars to get a realistic look inside the cars and the views from the drivers' perspective.<br /><br />Here is where the film totally falls apart. There is no real story here. We knew McQueen's character had been involved in a tragic car crash the year before where a fellow racer was killed. The racer's widow shows up for this year's race..always looking seriously at McQueen but having little to say.<br /><br />The viewer needs a story and a better understanding of what is actually happening in the race. It looks like the racers are following a course that goes around the track and through the local countryside. We seethe same billboards and buildings over and over again. There are a few staged crashes in slow motion, but my understanding is that much of what we see is just the actual car race--over and over and over.<br /><br />LE MANS is one of McQueen's many famous and beloved films. I am sorry that this film is disappointing on so many levels. I wish I could have learned something about the racing scene beyond seeing race cars whiz down the street. The bonus feature narrated by Steve McQueen's son Chad was worth the time to get into the backstory of the movie and how it was filmed and to get some idea on the race.<br /><br />Visually this film is stunning to a race car fan but is an absolute disappointment in so many ways
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My 12yr old recommended this game. Thought it had all the features his old man would like.. No guns for a start. He was right on the money, it starts out on an easy level so you can get familiar with the operation and strategy required and gets progressively more difficult without becoming impossible. I found that I could not put it down. Great game!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome book series, totally addicting, couldn't put it down. My wife got me hooked. Make sure that you are not easily bothered by graphic scenes in books.
1401235417|5.0|Great story, intelligently written, and great art. At fist i didnt like seeing the design for riddler and killer croc, but thats over fast and the rest of it is very interesting. Batman teaches you alot of fun facts, like watching a cop show and you learn stuff while they solve the case. He also does alot of detective work, which is quite fun. One of the issues has you turning your book in all directions, making you as disoriented as Batman is in that current situation. The hallucinating was very cool, and this is the best ive read out of the new 52.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|It was an ok story line, but i didn't enjoy the authors style of writing......he rehashes thoughts over and over again.

B003DT194G|5.0|S.L. did a fine redition of payback in the old West...Henry Fonda & his blue eyes gave the bad guy a simple coldness to his part. You cannot beat Charles Bronson pre payback \\"Death Wish\\" series.  In Lakkewood, Colorado
B0011KQSZ4|2.0|This disc was unplayable on my computer. I returned it to the Sender (12th July) & have not received an acknowledgment of its arrival. I have the receipt of sending & await comment with dwindling patience & refund!
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I thought it would be another one of those stupid guy movies, but it was really funny!  Too crude for young kids, but enjoyed the performances by both actors!
B00009W0U4|5.0|First of all I must say that this is one of the best foreign films ever made and definitely the best of the 21st century. It is hard to categorize this film because it definitely has in its first 40 to 50 minutes elements of a horror film. The ominous siren wail when the two main characters are trying to find a very sick individual, a few scenes of extreme violence and the shocking conclusion. To me though I think the film really is a drama, well a psycho human drama but I will leave that one up to the viewer because this film is very hard to place in a category. I must say though that there are only a few films that shock me and they are all mostly horror films. This is the first film that is not horror to me that after viewing felt like a sledgehammer to the face. Gaspar Noe's other films do not even come close to the fierce realism of this one. It is a brutal and honest yet disturbing look at human actions and reactions. This film is not for children and I do not care if as a parent you let them view gory horror films. Do not let innocent eyes grace the screen while this one is on. The film has some extreme shots of homosexual men doing they're thing so that alone should make it an adult film only, not to mention the the few scenes of gruesome violence. But the rape scene is the worst rape ever to grace a scene. Especially after the first viewing but it seems to never get any easier with additional screenings. Noe is a genius filmmaker just for the camerawork in his films not to mention the storylines his films deal with. They take a viewer where they have never been before (hopefully) and that is the find of directors we need to see more of these days. Wish Noe would make more films, because any film he would make would be a great film I know. After viewing this film my jaw was slacked for hours, and I thought of the film the whole night when I was trying to sleep. A film that does that to me is in my opinion real art. The only other films that have ever done that to me is Texas Chinsaw (1974) and Hellraiser. Happy viewingat to me is Texas Chinsaw (1974) and Hellraiser. Happy viewing
B003O86FMW|5.0|Not typically the type of book that I would normally read but was a good book to get hooked into.  All three books in the series were hard to put down.  I can't imagine the movies will be able to live up to the books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So what if the writing is not fantastic.  The story is compelling and I loved reading it!  I am on the second book now and fully intend to buy the 3rd.  In fact, I'm already panicking a little as to what I'll do when I've finished all 3...
B008EQIA7W|3.0|The movie turned out to be somewhat like the first one, it is entertaining if you are looking for some SiFi action.
B008M34INW|5.0|Just an excellent drama/action film with a totally original storyline.  Mel Gibson is definitely back as one of the best actors today.  And Dolores Heredia (the mother of the kid) is sooo hot.  Her facial expressions are so, well, expressive, it made my spine tingle.  Jesus Ochoa also gets my thumbs up.  Highly recommended for a pure and different storyline and superb acting.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|angry birds. is so ffffffuuuuunnnnn.  I play it all the time. its so fun my little brother ask my Bff every time. she. comes over.
B0083GOPSG|1.0|This pov(point of view) camera technique is pointless and just relentless to the point of destroying any semblance entertainment.  Gets in the way of the movie. Build an Ark, better use of time.
B002GHHHG0|5.0|I rented this DVD and will probably pop for the blue-ray!  In fact, I might get the cover art as a tattoo!  Awesome movie based on stories by Stephen King.  Dark, ironic horror stories: \\"Father's Day\\" & \\"Something to Tide You Over\\" are unforgettable!
B0062GM6FS|5.0|Keith and (co-author) James Fox have written an intriguing and human perspective on perhaps one of the most misunderstood icons of rock & roll history.  This auto-biographical account expresses a far more sympathetic attitude comparative to what one may have read in media accounts over the years.  This book reveals a surprising education on the malfunctional (love/hate) relationship, which can develop with a fan-base towards their superstar.  Without apprehension, Keith characterises his rapport with other artists, such as Gram Parsons, Ronnie Spector, Ronnie Wood, John Lennon, Willie Nelson, as well as his mixed feelings regarding Mick Jagger, Chuck Berry, Billy Preston, Bill Wyman, Brian Jones, et al.  Some of the most fascinating writing of this book delves into the music theory behind Keith's evolution as a musician, as well as the influences of other styles (e.g. country, reggae, et al.) upon his musical interests.  He further elucidates on how addictive aspects may have affected his music (or not).  Although it is likely that a number of colourful tales may have been left out of this work, the author(s) seemingly project a narrative that does not hold back on feeling or candor.  I would be pleased to read this book again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a great game. good for free time and kids. it is easy to do. I would recommend it.
B0088WFZQG|3.0|Good story about special services.  You can appreciate the action more knowing the \\"actors\\" have done it for real.  Would have been a better movie with more action which is clearly a comfort zone for the portrayals.
6305972591|4.0|Just checked this movie out for the first time recently!  Pretty faithful adaptation of Stephen King's story, although the husband and wife are more appealing in the film than in the story!  I live in the midwest and dig this story about a cult of kids who kill all the adults and take over!  Very spooky and cool!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I honestly have nothing bad to say about this trilogy.  This was my 1st account of erotic and I can say without a doubt that I am hooked and will never be the same!  I couldn't stop reading...I purchased book one on 7/17, book two 7/20, and book three 7/23...that is seven days...and I am NOT an avid reader!<br /><br />I became increasingly obsessed with the depth of the story and its evolving characters.  I found it to be a wonderful way to remove myself from the day-in-day-out monotony that my simple life came sometime be...you know stay-at-home wife and mother...in a nut shell boring!<br /><br />My husband definitely reaped the benefits of my obsession and asked that I read him some of the scenes that I found so tantalizing.  After I read him Anastasia and Christian's first sexual account he asked me, \\"Is it really like that for women?\\"...I replied, \\"I have never experienced it, but I truly hope so.\\"  He has since worked very diligently to turn things up to our almost 10 years of marriage and I owe my thanks to 50 Shades.<br /><br />I said before that I had nothing bad to say about the series and honestly I don't, but I do have a word of caution for women out there reading this review...I without a doubt would urgently suggest this series to anyone I know or meet.  It was so alluring, erotic, frustrating, and tantalizing.  You will be drawn into the story and feel what Anastasia feels.  My word of caution is FICTION!  This is not real...Christian is a painstakingly fictional character and do not compare the man in your life to him because he will fall short about one million miles...at least.<br /><br />With that being said enjoy your reading and I suggest reading \\"Bonded to You\\" once you finish all three 50 Shades books because they will leave you wanting...not that they don't end divinely, but you will still want more.
B007IPJMCM|5.0|I love this record! I saw these guys at the Rocky Point Palladium in Warwick, RI , with Sacred Reich for this tour and it was beast! You can slag them off for creating the prototype for nu-metal if you want, but whatever.  This record is bad-ass!  A heavy, groove metal classic!  The new track \\"Piss\\" is hella cool, and the live video is worth checkin' out as well.  This record is awesome, if you don't like it, yr. probably lame!
B0083F5JE6|5.0|As a sweet gesture, my husband bought me \\"Overexposed\\" by Maroon 5 from Starbucks.  I definitely appreciate this gift and enjoy the following songs featured on this cd: \\"One More Night\\",\\"Daylight\\", \\"Lucky Strike\\", and \\"Love Somebody\\".  \\"Overexposed\\" by Maroon 5 is best for those who have enjoyed at least two of their previous songs and/or those who like a blend of dance and pop music.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|This is an excellent record!  I've been in to Testament since The Ritual, which came out when I was in high school.  In my opinion, this is the best thing they've done in years, although I've consistently enjoyed their records, and have been fortunate enough to check 'em out live three times.  I read the \\"one star\\" review from the guy who says Testament has no shame, and that is nonsense.  This record is a f*kin beast and I would strongly recommend that all old-school thrashers check this out!

The actors are great, I didn't even realize that Peter Sellers plays soo many characters, I had to re-watch it just to pick him out.  I was all 'why is he the big star if he plays such a minor character?'  Anyways, great movie, and on blu-ray its beautiful!

B007OWG3LM|5.0|Valtari is filled with ecstatic moments of music and vocals that, if you are in the right mood, will transport you to another state of mind.  It is much more than ambient electronic music, more like a spiritual experience that will leave you with chills and tingles.  It all seems very random, but it must take a lot of planning and creativity to make music like this.  Very well done.

I found it to be a wonderful way to remove myself from the day-in-day-out monotony that my simple life came sometime be...you know stay-at-home wife and mother...in a nut shell boring!<br /><br />My husband definitely reaped the benefits of my obsession and asked that I read him some of the scenes that I found so tantalizing.  After I read him Anastasia and Christian's first sexual account he asked me, \\"Is it really like that for women?\\"...I replied, \\"I have never experienced it, but I truly hope so.\\"  He has since worked very diligently to turn things up to our almost 10 years of marriage and I owe my thanks to 50 Shades.<br /><br />I said before that I had nothing bad to say about the series and honestly I don't, but I do have a word of caution for women out there reading this review...I without a doubt would urgently suggest this series to anyone I know or meet.  It was so alluring, erotic, frustrating, and tantalizing.  You will be drawn into the story and feel what Anastasia feels.  My word of caution is FICTION!  This is not real...Christian is a painstakingly fictional character and do not compare the man in your life to him because he will fall short about one million miles...at least.<br /><br />With that being said enjoy your reading and I suggest reading \\"Bonded to You\\" once you finish all three 50 Shades books because they will leave you wanting...not that they don't end divinely, but you will still want more.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|After seeing David Garrett on a PBS special I decided to get his Cd, then decided to get the DVD.  Listening to him play is really great, but watching him play is amazing. I really like this DVD. I have always liked classical and rock music so the way he combines them is the best of both worlds.  I just recently got his newest classical cd Legacy.  Once you start getting his music on cd or DVD you won't want to stop until you have all of them. [[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]][[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]][[ASIN:B005OSUKSA Legacy]]<br /><br />Update 8/23/13 I've had this for a year now and I play it as much as I did when I first got it.  Of course in the past year I have also bought a couple more of his CD's.  I play all of them all the time.  Great music!!
B008MEM24S|2.0|i wanna play so bad i love perry but it wont let me play stupid butt game y y do they have to tease us fire owners and say its awesome wel I WANNA KNOW FIX THIS NOW
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I love Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton & Steven Spielberg are awesome.  The second and third movies suck, but all of them are beautiful on blu-ray.  I recommend this for any fan of the first movie.  There are some great documentaries, but not much extra from the past dvd releases I have bought.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book was a life changer. It opened my eyes to show what I'm missing in life... well not focusing on everything. This was an amazing book and it only took me two days to read! And that's is fast for me... I never read. When you start this book Albom really hooks you where you can't stop reading! I'm glad that I had to read this for school, when looking at it I would have never pick it up because of the cover but it is worth it to reading. I KNOW I WILL BE READING THIS BOOK IN THE FUTURE SEVERAL TIMES AND BE MAKING MY FRIENDS READ IT!
B008MEM24S|5.0|A great game that is very entertaining though it can get hard at some parts and kids of all ages can enjoy this game if they are fans of the show!!!

B007L24T52|5.0|This is a great book from start to finish. I could not put it down and finished it in a few days.<br /><br />The story is very updated and keeps you asking for more clues to resolve the mistery.<br /><br />I can't wait to start the next book.
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|Not very mysterious... Not really abandoned... Not a very good book...<br />It's predictable, boring, and the author is hoping that the photos will somehow make the book darker than it really is. I won't be lookig for the second book anytime soon, or ever...
B00881VLCE|5.0|I haven't played this very much, however,  it has already impressed me.  Great puzzles. Great options. I would definitely recommend this to friends!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I subscribed to iTunes Match when it first came out and hated it because many of the songs that I have are the mono versions. iTunes match would match these tracks and give me the stereo version. There was no way to get around it. Then I paid for Amazon's mp3 cloud service. They didn't have an app for my iTouch but at least I could play the exact same tracks that I uploaded. When the Amazon app for the iTouch and iPhone came out, I was very happy because it worked well and it was easy to play all of the music that I uploaded. Now with this latest update to Amazon's cloud service, it's just like I'm back using iTunes match. A number of my mono tracks have been matched by Amazon and I'm getting the stereo version. I understand why match is available and get why it's a great tool but there really needs to be a way to bypass the match feature so people can listen to the exact mp3 they want to hear, not the one Amazon decides you should listen to. Some of the other tracks I've uploaded come from audiophile releases that sound much better than the ones offered by Amazon. So in these cases, I'm losing sound quality. Please, give us the option to shut off match if we don't want it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I just recently saw the movie and enjoyed the music so much that I bought the CD.  Very well done!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to read this series before the movie came out because as we all know the book is usually better. Wow!! This book was more than good, it was amazing. The characters are believable, the writting is excellent, and it left me haunted for days thinking about my own kids in that situation. I'm always leary about Y/A books, but this one is good for all ages.

B005MWPW86|4.0|I met Craig years ago at a reception at the British Consulate in Los Angeles, without really knowing who he was. As we shared a drink in the corner we chatted about \\"the industry,\\" and he was funny, warm, and engaging - just like the person he has captured in his autobiography. A light read about someone who knows how lucky he is to have found himself on top, something that's especially refreshing, and rare, in Hollywood

0307744434|1.0|I bought this book in hardcover after receiving a gift card for Christmas.  I only bought it because it was recommendend for me, and also new.  I barely had expectations, but after seeing the reviews from The Washington Post, New York Times, etc, I was very disappointed to find out this novel wasn't a good as it was praised to be.<br /><br />I have to give it some credit, however, because the ideas are fantastic!  I just don't think they were executed to their fullest.  I just imagine this circus being amazing!  The writing just doesn't do the ideas and plot any justice.  The chapters were confusing - toward the end, you had to really pay attention to what time frame you were looking at because it seemed to go back & forth - but that could just be perhaps that I confused myself because I was bored!  I took 4 months to get through it just because I had barely any interest.<br /><br />Disappointing read.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I love this book sooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!! I love Louis, Zayn, Harry, Niall and Liam. I am going to their Tour next summer!! CAN NOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lovee them!!!!!!!!  Amelia Ball Age 10
0375751513|3.0|First published in 1890, Oscar Wilde's now classic novel is a meditation on decadence, art and morality. At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.<br /><br />Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.<br /><br />The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century. However, for those who want to fully understand the commonly referenced trope of \\"Dorian Gray's portrait,\\" nothing serves bettern than the source.

Started them on a Wednesday and finished them on Sunday!! However I did tell my 18 & 16 year old daughters they could not read this book until they were 25 or 30!! LOL
0425263908|5.0|What a story...totally a must read after '50 shades of grey'. My post christian grey...though I cannot picture Gideon Cross well...to much focused on Christian Grey. I read the book within 3 days!!! Cannot wait for book 2!
B0044XV3R8|3.0|Movie is great, Beautiful collection -<br />only thing I did not like is that the movie is split on two discs!!! They should have put the versions on different disks instead of splitting it up like that...  I really hate having to change disks in the middle of my movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is fun and keeps you thinking my daughter is inthralled. I ran out of words blah blah blah blah
B0007TKH66|3.0|This show had real potential, the idea of making the very first Enterprise adventures should have been a sci fi wet dream.  The show promised to put a new spin on the franchise.  After watching a few episodes I can see why the show faltered and eventually failed.  Here is what I see<br /><br />Opening:  Terrible Rock 80's ballet!!  Say Wha- They used a horrible opening song, so bad in fact I could see people turning the channel to wait for it to be over, you never want veiwers to turn the channel.  We are opening to an adventure about the galaxy in all its glory, stick to a classic epic orchestra opening.<br /><br />Captain Archer:  The very first captain of a StarFleet vessel, a very exciting role, yet they write the character to be nieve, spineless, and really boring.  The writers give him some bold lines and actions every once in a while but a true personality is never pulled off, and you are left with a inept captain.  This is following some great personalities in the ST Universe: Kirk a resourceful from the hip cowboy, Picard an intelligent by the book gentleman, and Janeway who is bold and stubborn yet nurturing.<br /><br />The show itself: Never really sets itself apart from the rest.  Here is humans first shot at the galaxy in the first ship capable of exploring, but you feel like you are watching just another ST series.  They crew basicly remains faceless, the ship is a cold eviroment that sees to every comfort (yes they call it different things but reprocessed protien is still replicated food) and the main characters are the officers.  I was expecting a rag tag crew of hot heads and volenteers, a group willing to risk space adventures, a ship with personallity (Millenium Falcon, Serenity in Firefly, etc) and ship officers who had the beef to control it all.<br /><br />Overall the show is not bad, but so far it does not live up to its potential.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|nice to get you up when you want your alarm to go off in the mornings or at nights. have fun with your alarm
B0086HGW42|5.0|I've been in love with Ed since Vampire Diaries. The music is so mellow and soulful. Absolutely beautiful and the cd has a really cool diverseness, if that's even a word, about it as well.  All time favorite: Give Me Love.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy. I devoured all three in 8 days and I don't usually read fiction. I am now re reading them and my husband is reading them and hooked. I love the sensual senses but I really enjoy the story line and the characters. Can't wait for the movie to come out!
B000JCVXGE|4.0|\\"Whodunit\\" and John Cusack fans will like this film.  However, the plot twists may by too much for some viewers.  I simply can't go into detail about the plot without spoiling the movie, think \\"Sixth Sense\\".  The film is both an intellectual exercise and a thrill ride.  The acting is first rate, but if you want a pure \\"whodunit\\", I recommend \\"The Bat\\" with Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead [[ASIN:B00005QJJS Bat, The]] or \\"And Then There Were None\\" directed by René Clair [[ASIN:B00005QBZL And Then There Were None]].

030758836X|1.0|I am an avid reader, English major, and teacher.  I wouldn't recommend reading this book at all.  The first half of the book is great and I was completely engrossed, but the storyline and writing quickly deteriorates after part two begins.  I was ok with the twist at first, but things became so far-fetched that it was comical.  Another reviewer mentioned she felt cheated and that's a great way of putting it.  After completing the book, I felt, because the story became so ridiculous, the writer must be making some sort of social commentary.  Some kind of Cindy Sherman type stuff, but I couldn't imagine what that could possible be.<br /><br />It reminded me of watching a movie that at first seemed well-filmed, deep, complex, almost insightful and then suddenly becomes flimsy, uninspired, and of low quality.  Major let down.  Oh well.

B005FPT51K|5.0|How awesome to live 750 miles away, but get to watch my great granddaughter sleep or play in her crib.  With my amazon points, this was competitively priced, but I have seen some models that look the same and are a lot cheaper.  This one works as advertized and I love, love, love it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not like the dirty books I read in High School...so much worse.  But after reading the first couple chapters, I got hooked in the story line.  Yes, there is a story. Friends and co-workers are all reading it.  I am reading book 2 now.<br />I wouldn't recommend the book unless you don't mind reading 'dirty books'.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I cant stop playing once I start. it is one of the most addicting games ever. I have ever angry bird game so far.
006197806X|3.0|I loved Delirium.  Especially the ending.  It was heartbreakingly beautiful, and I wish Ms. Oliver had left it that way.  So when I heard Pandemonium was coming out, I was skeptical. But I read it and enjoyed it, but...<br /><br />It could have been better.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's writing is as lovely as always.  I especially enjoyed how Lena's story was broken up into \\"now\\" and \\"then\\".  We see Lena's growth as a character from the scared and sheltered girl she was in  Delirium to the brokenhearted,  yet stronger, girl in Pandemonium.  She isn't wide-eyed anymore.  She's faced hell and is stronger for it.<br /><br />I loved seeing the Wilds, which had only been hinted at in Delirium.  We met so many great characters there, including Raven, who I loved reading about, and Blue, who I adored.  The culture of the invalids was so well thought out and engrossing.  The stark contrast between the invalids--who have nothing except freedom--and the valids--who have everything but freedom--was fascinating.<br /><br />However, I found the plot with Raven and Tack and the Pro-Cure Movement and the Scavengers a bit confusing and unlikely.  It seems like the only purpose was to show the conflicted society and set Lena up with Julian.  This plot dragged down the novel instead of propelling it forward.<br /><br />And then we have Julian because what YA book is complete without a love triangle?  (Can I just have a quick shout-out to Divergent which avoided this whole subplot?)  Honestly, I liked him better than Alex.  He was more real, less perfect.  He transforms from a pawn of his father's, the leader of the pro-cure movement, willing to risk death to receive the cure, to a braver man falling in love for the first time.  Yet I wish Ms. Oliver would let her character's love stand for itself rather than introducing an extremely cliched plot device.  Her books are better than that.<br /><br />Predictably, in Requiem, we will have the anticipated showdown between Alex and Julian.  I'll read it, for Lauren Oliver's gorgeous writing and to see the end of Lena's story.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|After watching this movie from borrowing from a friend, I had to have it. Because it was a blu-ray, it was a little pricey in stores ($20+). I found it on Amazon a little cheaper, in new condition. Even with the cost of shipping, it was still less than going into a store and buying it. From the time I got confirmation of it shipping, it only took about 5 days until I received it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this because I love these types of games. its a bit easy for me but fun. it even has a time trial which is fun.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|I read Peter Mayles book A Good Year and had high hopes that the movie would be just as good as the book, but unfortunately it wasn't.  I would go on to say why, but I'm trying to recoup the time I spent watching this movie!
B004LE7PCM|2.0|I love Sherlock Holmes and the stories under this title are great; however, the kindle version is very poorly developed.  I would be reading along and then the story would come to an abrupt stop and the next chapter would be a totally different story.  I could not finish reading this purchase and had to stop after only several chapters.  I would not recommend purchasing this.
B007WULJ5G|4.0|It's hard to know what to say about this.<br /><br />Quite what the writer and director wanted to achieve in presenting this is not clear. To sell it as \\"A Serbian Film\\" as if to say- this is what this country is like, or feels like to live in, is a chilling and sobering thought indeed. I certainly won't be holidaying there anytime soon.<br /><br />The story is of a down on his luck porn actor, given a last chance opportunity to make big money for his family in a too tempting to refuse offer.<br />What he doesn't realise is the price to be paid in sacrificing his morals, and all that he holds dear, to satisfy a totally insane director, who believes the art/pornographic film he is making will be the ultimate statement to show what real life is all about.<br />Drugged and fuelled up high on viagra and cocaine, he is forced to perform grotesque acts of sex and violence, involving murder, incest,and all manner of degradation, all filmed by the director and his henchmen.<br />He finally cracks completely when his own family are brought into the filming, and the climax builds to an orgy of revolting murder and mutilation.<br /><br />So, this is strong stuff indeed, and not for the easily offended.<br />I'm not sure what kind of audience would say they \\"enjoyed~ this film.<br /> It is too well made, acted and presented to be dismissed as pure exploitation or simple \\"video nasty\\" material, so the usual gore lovers will probably be put off by the slow pace and the sub-titled dialogue to stick with it. Lovers of art films will probably just be revolted. The average cinema goer will probably be bewildered. So who it is aimed at, I don't know.<br /><br />That said, if you stick with it to the end, you will no doubt be devastated, probably feel dirty and ashamed, and certainly have a sense of despair that makes you wonder how sick the world can be sometimes. It is more of an endurance test than a film, to see who can stay the course. I doubt that anyone could say they felt enlightened after watching it, but you have to admire the bravery of the team that put it together, knowing how controversial it would be.<br /><br />Obviously this is cut in most countries, or banned outright in some. It is a tasteless film, but I think if you are going to bother to see it, you need to see it full strength for the real gut punch effect.<br /><br />This dvd is a bare bones affair, deliberately packaged to look down-market and sleazy. The DVD comes in a bloodied effect cheap plastic jewel case, glued to a piece of cardboard, with a sticker on the back giving a brief synopsis and credits. It looks like an under the counter porno, which I suppose to a certain extent, it is.
1612183956|5.0|This is a good read, with a rather convoluted plot. The strangeness of it all keeps you turning the pages, and I was barely able to put the book down long enough to go to sleep.<br /><br />Blake Crouch has a vivid imagination and I admire his talent. Pines was a strange blend of contemporary thriller and paranormal adventure. I truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />When a Secret Service agent goes looking for his missing colleagues, he finds himself in a place that is like nothing he's ever experienced... with no way out. Odd things are happening in this town, things he cannot explain. With chilling intent, he tries to discover the secrets of the inhabitants, only to be thwarted at every turn by an imposing, sadistic sheriff or the staff at hosptial.<br /><br />A MUST Read!
030758836X|4.0|I started this book yesterday and was up until 2 a.m. because I just had to finish it. It's a total page turner, but I'm so bummed about the ending.  Please tell me there's going to be a sequel because I hate the way this book ended.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Not a literary classic; but its hot and addictive and I can't put it down!! A very interesting,enlightening and entertaining book.
145162445X|2.0|I saw his interview on Colbert and immediately ordered the book.  I was intrigued by what he was discussing and thought it would be a plain spoken explanation of his theories.  Unfortunately much of the references are only understandable or available to cosmologists and people who study complicated astrophysics.  Very disappointed.
030758836X|3.0|This book did keep me intrigued and for the most part, I found myself anxiously waiting to see what would come next. But, I hated the two main characters. I know that given the circumstances of the book, it would be hard to really like either one of them by the time the book ends. But, I really ended up despising both of them - so much so that I think it has colored my opinion of this book. It was very well written and an interesting read so I will definitely check out other books by Gillian Flynn. Thanks to Nick and Amy for killing most of my enthusiasm for this book.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I wasn't sure what a \\"slam\\" was until I started reading this book.  I love the Poetry and the chemistry of these young people.  Dealing with so much heart ache and huge life obsticals.  I'm recommending it to all my friends.  Great read!
034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed the story line in these books very much. But, they are VERY graphic! The sexual content is entertaining at first. But then it goes over the top and starts to get in the way of the story itself. I think, if you condense them into one book, and take out 2/3 of the graphic sex scenes, you have a very good book! It will be very interesting to see how they make a movie from it without it being XXX rated!
B001QWBM62|5.0|The Zoom H4N does exactly what you would think a portable recorder would do. The basic controls are fairly intuitive.  What makes this usnit stand out above the other similar units in it's price range is the flexibility and bonus features.  The onboard mics are far superior to most on camera microphones. The option to plugin XLR just sweetens the pot.  Being able to record 4 inputs at once makes this the ideal portable recording solution in the field for videographers on a budget. I had no idea I was getting a tuner and an audio interface too.  I do a lot of editing on my notebook computer.  This fits in my notebook bag easily.  The one minor flaw i would love improved is that it only has 1/8\\" output, but that is seriously nitpicking.

B008IZ5X5Q|5.0|I've never stayed with any show this long. I thought I was going to abandon the show when Rita left us. But I stayed with it. Maybe all the twists and turns haven't offended me yet because this show is already a twisted concept. I think if you have seen all 5 seasons, you won't skip season 6. This is one of my favorite villians, such a sick and twisted character. I know he seems weak compared to the ones in the past, but he takes the crime scenes to another level of spectator fascination. Having a serial killer who believes he is working on God's behalf was an inevitable plot; I know some fans were disappointed, but I think the whole series has religious undertones waiting to explode into more discussion. Spoiler alert, Deb thinks she's in love with Dexter. Hopefully, her walking in on him killing someone kills this crush. I don't want her to hook up with her stepbrother (although off screen they did hook up). Such a wild show! I love Dexter. He's such a lovable character despite his fatal flaw. Any set of writers who can get us to love a serial killer as the hero of a show and still keep us watching season after season is one amazing group. This season doesn't disappoint.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Its fun at first, with the rush of buying tons of things, but then there's not much to do. Sure, you can buy land and put up new houses but, your energy runs out quick and it takes forever to regain energy. When you run out you can buy more but its five dollars for only 5 energy! Total rip-off. If you don't mind losing energy its a pretty fun game for awhile.

No bad tracks on this cd and some songs I 'd never heard before, besides the one original tune on the CD. It's already one of my favourite CD's, puts a smile on the face every time.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|\\"So one of the complaints of people \\"my age\\" - 55 - is that \\"there is no good music being made\\". I tell them they need to look around, no one is going to spoon feed them, certainly not the lame radio stations around Toronto. There is a ton of great music being made NOW! You just need to surf to find it. My personal first love in types of music are the older Prog bands (progressive rock), Pink Floyd, Yes, Rush, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, CANO, ELP... you get the picture. Well, surfing around tonight as I was working on my confuser, I happened upon \\"Porcupine Tree\\". WOW, this band encompasses the best of the Prog vision, but also extending well beyond with plenty of newer influence and invention in their music.  Music with rich, flowing, spacious writing and arrangements, great tight playing, and tons of power as it's called for, that is all about the music, with no circus or bling in sight. After listening to about a dozon songs - well - here I am writing this. Next stop - Amazon.\\"<br />That was my facebook post before I purchased two CD's.  I sat there for two evening taking in all I could find on this band, and in disbelief that I'd never heard of them before.  Why have the radio stations here not played these guys?  Isn't it part of their job to spread around great music like this?<br />I've since got the CD's and yes, am back to buy more.

I thought I'd write on the subject of the Reacher comparisons however.<br /><br />This will inevitably draw comparisons with Reacher because Puller is an MP. There's more to Baldacci than that, however.  I suspect Reacher fans may be a bit critical, but in the end Baldacci is a different kind of writer.  He's one of the best in the business for surprising twists, for a start.  his scenarios and also his characters are more varied.  But above all the intricacy of his plotting is possibly best-in-class.  I find him more varied and interesting, while still being a writer who grabs you from the very start.<br /><br />Reacher by contrast is all about Reacher.  He's a wonderful and enduring character and you read on and on because you enjoy having the conversation with him.<br /><br />Zero Day?  I loved Puller, I loved Sam Cole and most of all I loved the intricate way in which Baldacci draws us into plot angles and assumptions and then twists us out of them.
B0038JN6VA|5.0|Whenever I use this, so many people look for where the sound is coming from and are amazed that it's coming from this very tiny speaker! It's small enough to fit into my purse pocket, has SD slot, and has bass too! Can't be beat for the price! It comes with earphones too and can be hooked/combined with other xmini speakers to produce a louder sound! I love it!
0345803485|5.0|After hearing \\"fifty shades\\" mentioned countless times in the past couple of months, part of me was determined not to succumb to the media hype. Then, two days ago I was standing at the checkout of my local store and there it is...in a twitchy moment I simply had to know what it was all about. So...impulse buy.<br /><br />The fact that I finished it at eleven p.m last night says it all really. A real page turner for me. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Yes, on the outside it is a bit unbelievable when you consider the gorgeous, piano-playing, excessively wealthy Christian(every girls dream, right?) But I think the book touched on some really honest human traits (I mean, what girl hasn't been attracted to someone who was wrong for her? Every girl loves a bad boy who she believes she can turn into her saint. Or is that just me?) It's written from Ana's persective, who is, by all accounts, inexperienced. The girl hasn't even touched herself before (seriously? She's twenty one!) But this gives the story a nice angle for me. It means she questions the things that are happening with different eyes; innocent eyes. Like she doesn't really know if it's wrong or right.<br /><br />Personally, I like erotic fiction, so I had no problem with the sex scenes, though I imagine for some this would be far too graphic. Especially with the BDSM element involved. However, saying that, I believe E.L.James has done a great job in bringing what is fairly hardcore, kinky erotica to the masses without the need to use crude language in every other sentence. Not only is it sexy fiction, but it's kinda sweet and funny too; hard porn from a niave young womans perspective. A fun and enthralling read!<br /><br />(p.s. first thing I did on waking up this morning was log onto Amazon to buy Fifty Shades Darker!;))

B004WR125O|3.0|The UWF-1 Wireless LAN adapter worked reasonably well for a couple months.  At times it would not connect and other times it would take several attempts before finally connecting.  Onkyo staff was courteous and cooperative in trying to help me restore connectivity.  After several conversations, it was suggested that I take my receiver and adapter in for inspection by an authorized repair facility.  My unit pretty much sat on the shelf for a couple weeks, until it was finally tested, in close proximity to the shop's router, so it worked and was returned to me (no charge).  Over this period of time I became more enlightened as to how the product works.  I discovered that while close to my router, I had signal strength in the 72-78 range, which dropped to about 55 when moved a couple rooms away, which dropped to 20 to 30 when moved to the downstairs family room.  I believe the unit needs signal strength of 30 or greater to work (i.e., play music), even though a connection may exist in the 20s.  I never did truly figure out why it worked okay for a couple months, then not work okay afterwards.  Bottom line, if close enough to the router, the UWF-1 should work okay; however, if your internet-capable receiver will be near a live coax outlet, I recommend purchase of an Actiontec ECB2200 MoCA bridge, which enables ethernet (via coax) connectivity.  With FiOS (TV and Internet) service, only one MoCA bridge need be purchased; otherwise, a second bridge may be necessary (depending upon your system).  That's what I did, and that's my take.  See Verizon's Q&A website for MoCA hook-up instructions.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|I was really excited to download this app for my phone.  I previously had uploaded almost all of my music to the cloud.  So, when I got my new phone and the app, I was happy to have almost my entire music library at my fingertips.<br /><br />Then came August 1st...<br /><br />I am a Prime member, and I remember when I started using the cloud.  They said that songs would not count against my 5GB of free cloud storage.  In fact, the web page still says that.  However, when I went in to my cloud player on 08/01, I got a pop up message saying that I could only have 250 songs imported songs for free.  An imported song is anything you didn't purchase from Amazon (although that is not true because many of my imported songs are from CDs I did purchase from Amazon).<br /><br />So, I have until 08/31 to have all my imported songs on the cloud.  After that, I will need to pay for anything over 250 songs, and I have over 3,000.  It will be $24.99 per year, I believe is what the message said, to keep all my imported songs on there.  Now, just over $2 per month is not a lot of money, but when they tell you that you have 5GB of free storage and that \\"This space is yours to use as you like and you will never be charged for it.\\" (that is quoted from their website) and then they change it on you, it leaves a bad taste.<br /><br />I have deleted all of my imported music from the cloud.  I have been a big supporter of Amazon and bragged about their cloud player and the benefits of Prime membership.  I have also touted the Kindle Fire.  I'm very disappointed with the way Amazon handled this.  I have uploaded all my songs now to Google Music (20,000 free with them) and will just use their player from now on.

B005KWL2IW|5.0|Even if I hadn't grown up on Anthrax throughout the 80's and 90's, even I if had never heard of the band itself, was maybe living under a rock within the metal scene for the last 30 years, I would still consider this album as pure, unadulterated genius. Scott and Charlie have never been tighter, and with the resurgence of original front man, Joey Belladonna, I have never been more proud to be a fan of a band. I was always supportive, and actually enjoyed, when John Bush entered front man status in the 90's, but this album picks up where \\"The Sound Of White Noise\\" should have, and truly elevates the band to a level of seriousness I didn't think was going to be possible. Belladonna is flawless in his delivery, more than I think fans of the band and John Bush thought he would be, and I am glad whatever differences these guys had was laid to rest to produce this album with some of the coolest riffs and progressions I have heard in quite a while. Most notable on the album to me are the songs \\"The Devil You Know\\", \\"I'm Alive\\", \\"In The End\\", but every song stands on it's own as truly phenomenal songwriting. The blend of styles and genres they have partaken and redefined over the years come to light in one grand album. It's been a joy to watch this band grow up with all of their awkward moments, where true growth always occurs, and see them standing as the true giants I always knew they were. \\"Worship Music\\" should be in the collections of not only fans of Anthrax, but in the collections, ears, and hands of fans of the metal genre in general.

B004SCN2F6|5.0|Star Traders Elite is quite possibly the best RPG on the Amazon app market in my opinion, and well worth its price - even more so wth the developers constantly releasing updates and fixes.<br />For some the game may intially rather shallow and straight-forward, so be sure to check the developer's website and forums for features and ablities that are not readily apparent, as well as for tips and guides to help overcome the rather unforgiving learning curve present on all but the lowest diffculties.<br />And yes, characters played on the free version can be imported via the Roster screen at the main menu.<br /><br />I would love to see, and certainly to buy, an expansion pack or some such with even more planets, factions and cargo.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I'm so pleased that the update wipes your progress from previous levels, what a great way to ensure replay value.  NOT! It's actually quite lame!  Greedy freaking Rovio charging us 3 bucks for the KF version screwing us on updates and now erasing our progress.
1427214948|5.0|Enjoyed the first book \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" and caught the interview with the author at the end of the last disc where he stated  he believe it was going to take four to five books to complete the story. Went on-line right away and ordered the next book, \\"Sins of the Father\\" and enjoyed it as well. Now I am wondering how long until I can find out what happened in the.....oh well, get yourself a copy to find out!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I happened to chance upon this book while looking at books on Amazon and decided to purchase it. Scott's book is hugely inspiring, especially for me, as I have just recently taken up running and having been a vegetarian all my life was not sure if that was the correct diet for an activity as demanding as long distance running. I have also tried some of his recipes and they are delicious. Whenever I feel tired on my runs (modest runs compared to Scott's ultramarathons), I think of this book and Scott's unwavering determination. The book is well written and is interspersed with his vegan recipes. I would recommend this book to not only runners and athletes, but also to people who understand that our bodies are temples and we have to look after it with love and care. That involves eating organic (where possible), whole foods and avoiding processed foods. Thanks, Scott for helping me with my journey!!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I enjoy this game.  Easy to learn and a race against time.  Good fun for all ages. Best of all, it can be played anywhere and you don't need someone to play with you.
B008BRC6NS|1.0|Don't waste your money - just download the first and last songs - Dance Again, and Lets Get Loud. I could have sworn there were other songs by her that I really liked, but somehow as I listen through this cd I just get more and more annoyed.  More like Jenny from the Ghetto with the multitude of \\"N\\" bombs that are dropped on this cd.  This retrospective illustrates how JLO really has no idea what she is, a latin singer, a pop singer, a gangsta rap b*tch, she just seems to try to cling to trends rather than come up with something interesting and new. Wish I had something better to say about this cd.
B0034G4P80|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers who think the romance subplot needed more time. But compared with other action films, \\"Thor\\" is one of the most romantic of the genre. It's a very subtle romance, because that's how Branagh works. When Thor is exiled to Earth as a mortal, he finds himself dependent upon this feisty little human woman who not only helps him, but stands up to him and tells him to straighten up his act and think about other people for once. Hemsworth does a great job using facial expressions, body stance, and tone of voice to convey Thor's journey from bewilderment at her presumption to being intrigued and beginning to admire her, then wanting to please and help her, and finally, being willing to give up his life to save her. It doesn't hurt that he and Portman have great onscreen chemistry either.<br /><br />Visually this movie is a stunner. The shots of Asgard, both exteriors and interiors, are gorgeous. (As a Terry Pratchett fan, I also loved that they made Asgard a discworld!) Loki is (as others have said) one of the best villains ever, because you can understand his pain and why he does what he does after he finds out the truth of his parentage. Hiddleston makes you believe that he means well and has some ambivalence about the things he does. He and Thor share the same hubris and pay a similar price, but there's no Jane waiting to help Loki get his priorities straight.
B0088TG252|5.0|Really enjoyed this fast paced thriller. Very good performances from everyone. A little like a Bourne movie, with even some of the same actors. OK, maybe exactly like a Bourne movie, but still with some great twists. Worth the rental. Don't think I would add it as a purchase.

0385360169|1.0|This book is pure crap.  I bought it due to all the rave reviews I had heard from other people.  I am an avid reader so I was looking forward to picking this one up, since everyone loved it so much.  I just kept waiting for it to get better....it never did.  The writing is HORRIBLE, the author came across like a horny 13 year old.  Both the main characters were highly annoying and unlikable, correction...ALL the characters came off that way.  The main character's favorite expression is \\"holy crap\\" and I swear it is used in this book 500 times, along with \\"Oh my!\\" I have never read a book that was so repetitive.  By the end of the book I was rolling my eyes and wishing it would end!  The sex....it's really not that great, honestly I've read things that were a lot less graphic that turned me on more.  I refuse to read the next two books.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I really like this product and it is a great workout. I ordered this DVD because I don't have a lot of time during the day to workout, but I want/need to get back into shape. Level 1 is pretty easy for me but did provide a little bit of a sweat. Level 2 is tough and I am sweating up a storm by the end. I haven't reached Level 3 yet. My only problem with this program is that there is no diet suggested to follow while participating in this workout. You are supposed to lose 20 pounds and I have yet to lose one. I have great eating habits even before starting this, I am trying to cut down on certain things but don't know what else to do.<br /><br />All around it's a great workout and I feel better already, just wish there was diet suggestion along with the exercise.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was a glorified harlequin romance except it was much more graphic and x rated.  I don't mind the graphic sex scenes although they were unbelievable and too frequent. I do mind the fact that the book was redundant and poorly written.  No female has an orgasm every single time she has sex, multiple times, even her first time. I'm a woman, so I know.<br /> If Christian Grey talked about Ana Steele biting her lower lip one more time I thought I was going to scream.  I am still scratching my head with disbelief at all the great books out there and yet this garbage is selling like hotcakes because apparently somebody thinks BDSM is completely taboo in todays society.  That is the only reason why I can imagine that this book has gotten so much press.  I am blown away that anybody would concieve of reading the second one after reading the first one was terribly difficult just to finish.  Horrible read!
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|As Fear Factory fans know, ambience isn't usually a term associated with their brand of industrial apocalyptic metal, but on \\"The Industrialist\\" we're getting more melody and a more prominent role from keyboardist/programmer extraordinaire Rhys Fulber, whom, in my opinion, doesn't get anywhere near the recognition he deserves.  On cuts like \\"God Eater\\" and the nine minute noise excursion \\"Human Augmentation\\", the truly alien aspect of Fear Factory's sound shines through.  One can even hear a slight reference to early seventies noise pioneers and some might say, industrial pioneers too, Can, with the sprawling atmospheric journey that makes up \\"Human Augmentation.\\"  Some may find this dull, but I always find the longer more experimental tracks more interesting, especially on the underrated \\"Reconstruction\\", the remix album that came out soon after the legendary \\"Deconstruction.\\"  In fact, that set should always be packaged as a double album, so vital the two CD's are together.<br />  So, the big question:  is Fear Factory as good, at least by \\"Mechanize\\" standards, as their heyday?  It's taken a few listens, but I think \\"The Industrialist\\" is possibly better than \\"Mechanize\\" because of the increasing variety in their attack.  It still bludgeons, the drum programs still level condos and Dino Cazares is always right there with tight riffs and even some lead work, although not so much in the classic sense of the word.<br />  Burton C. Bell turns in his usual performance, and I do agree somewhat with fans, that maybe the takeover of the world by machines theme might be wearing a bit thin.  I personally fear the gradual mind control of so many gullible idiots by the government, religion and the powerful ultra rich, in more of a \\"1984\\" or \\"Brave New World\\" scenario more.  It wouldn't be too much of a stretch to explore the evils of that threat for Fear Factory.  Just a friendly suggestion.<br />  So where does \\"The Industrialist\\" belong in the Fear Factory canon?  I'd put it roughly in the general time frame of \\"Deconstruction\\" through \\"Obsolete\\".  \\"Mechanize\\" falls in probably at that point.  I do like \\"Digimortal\\", however, regardless of the stinging insults it still gets.  \\"Archetype\\" is Fear Factory trying to stay afloat, and the album title \\"Transgression\\" aptly fits the music.<br />  Give Rhys Fulber more attention and more creative space and the next album will be a monster.  One star deducted for lyrical repetitiveness.it roughly in the general time frame of \\"Deconstruction\\" through \\"Obsolete\\".  \\"Mechanize\\" falls in probably at that point.

After reading it you are left with a much more positive outlook on life whether it be in love,wealth,happiness or weight. you as the reader are shown how to change negative thoughts into positive ones and are therefore more receptive to the things you want from life.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I wish I could pretend I was a really young person ordering these, but I am not (50+). We own every season, and my love for this show is shared by my son and grandchildren.  We have seen every episode (more than once).  Some people probably won't care for it at all, but we love it
0307887448|5.0|Great book - definitvely going into my re-read pile. I was born in 77 so most of the references to 80's movies, games and TV were tight up my alley and created a wonderful sense of nostalgia while reading this book. Also since I was very young in the early 80's I had fun googling all of the early 80's reference and remembering all of these 80's arcade games which were sort of hazy memories until I looked em up and suddenly the memories of being crushed by these classic arcade games at the bowling alley arcade just flooded back to me.<br />The story is also very engaging, even if the final payoff is evident from the intro its the journey that is really the star of this book.
B00867GJYK|5.0|I first bought this dvd for my grandaughter, now age 8.  We watched it EVERY day while both parents were working.  I enjoyed it as much as she did.  I found myself watching it every day (sometimes several times a day) with her.  I made the mistake of letting her take it home, never to be seen again.  I now have another grandaughter, aged 6 months, so I have an excuse to buy another copy.  I confess that I would skip the whole first scenes showing the bad fish with Nemo's mom, and you know what happens if you have watched this.  My grandaughter never even knew that was in the movie until she was older (she probably wouldn't have understood, but I personally thought it was sad, even though death is a part of life).  As I first said, I know this movie word for word, and recently watched it on TV with my 60+ husband and we still laughed (not a kid in the room as an excuse).  I can't wait for new grandaughter to watch it with me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Sorry all you \\"50 Shades\\" lovers out there, but this book was terrible.  There is absolutely no plot that I could detect and both characters are so awful you can't get invested in them.  When you read a good book, you should actually like the characters and want to know more about them.  And you know it's a really good book when you can't wait to read what happens in the next book.  That is not the case with this trilogy.  I barely made it through the first book and have no interest in the next two.  Don't get me wrong, I like a steamy novel as well as the next gal, but this book just couldn't pull it off.  I wanted to strangle Christian Gray with his own tie and punch Ana in the face for being so stupid.<br /><br />I would say read at your own risk and by all means, don't download the whole trilogy until you read the first book so you're not out $30 bucks.
B00004BZ0N|4.0|Well, this is it.  The Clash's masterpiece, right?  Not quite.  It's their second or third best album in my opinion, right behind the Clash's debut and Give 'Em Enough Rope.  Nothing and I mean *nothing* leaves me more excited and speechless like the Clash's debut.  I really don't know whether I like Londong Calling or Give 'Em Enough Rope more.  You have a ton of diversity with a few forgettable/overrated moments in London Calling, or leftover punk aggression but weaker songwriting with Give 'Em Enough Rope, so it's sort of a toss-up between the two.<br /><br />The title song has gained fame in recent years.  I really don't remember any radio station playing this song when I embarrassingly became a regular FM listener 20 years ago (and I don't listen to the classic rock format on the radio anymore for obvious reasons).  A few other Clash songs from the 80's such as \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go\\" and \\"Rock the Casbah\\" would receive constant airplay but never this one.  What a shame.  A bouncy rhythm that's REALLY catchy, and wonderful vocals that make you feel like a group of young rebellious people are on an undercover mission to take over London during a typical rainy English setting, and yes my friends, take over it with a need to change the government they must!  \\"Brand New Cadillac\\" has an intro that reminds me of the part of \\"Black Sabbath\\" (the song from Black Sabbath's debut) when it speeds up near the end, however despite the similarity, the vocals are pretty catchy.  Not a favorite because it's essentialy a slightly heavier but very basic blues melody performed in a new wave-ish way, but it's decent.  \\"Jimmy Jazz\\" continues with the surprises as this is nothing like the more guitar heavy punk that I normally associate with the genre, and instead this is a steady-paced jazz and blues melody with little notable arrangements other than horns (that feel out of place by the way) and songwriting that's a bit weaker than even the less interesting moments from Give 'Em Enough Rope.  Well then again, nothing's weaker than \\"Cheapskates\\".  The horns really need to go at any rate.<br /><br />\\"Hateful\\" is an *excellent* song.  I can't stop singing the chorus \\"Anything I want, he gives it to me-e-e, anything I want, he gives it but not for free\\".  It's really an awesome melody and probably the best song on the entire album.  \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" has a melody based around the Dixie Cups \\"Iko Iko\\" but with a bit of Clash diversity to set it apart... somewhat.  I love it all the same I admit, though I really don't know why.  It's catchy sure, but nothing extraordinary.  Only memorable by Clash standards.  The way the melody constantly repeats the \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" line at the end is the best part.  \\"Spanish Bombs\\" is super catchy and another highlight, though the fact the song is based around the same melody for 3 minutes wears thin after a while.  \\"The Right Profile\\" has horns used in a more bearable way which is why I can't tolerate \\"Jimmy Jazz\\" very well, and in fact, the horns are actually melodic as the lead singer delivers a fantastic set of vocals and lyrics with the line \\"And everybody says what's he like, everybody says is he alright, everybody says he sure looks funny\\".<br /><br />\\"Lost in the Supermarket\\" (yes I get lost in there sometimes too, especially when I enter the dog food or paper towel aisle) has a hint of sadness and sincerity in the vocals which makes it pretty unique.  You can sing along to the vocal melody too which is a benefit.  \\"Clampdown\\" has a basic beat with forgettable vocal mumbling in the beginning, but quickly switching to a more upbeat though ultimately very ordinary vocal melody.  I don't really mind that it's ordinary perhaps because it sounds so refreshing for 1979 so I end up enjoying it all the same.  \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" is another really wonderful song because it sounds really original and just *cool*.  Listen to that rugged guitar tone.  The lyrics are cool too.  \\"When they kick out your front door, how you gonna come, with your hands on your head or on the trigger of your gun?\\"  I love that line and the David Bowie-like way it's sung.  \\"Wrong 'Em Boyo\\" sounds like a throwback to the glam rock days with an eerily similar vocal melody to Mott the Hoople but slightly jazzier.  Again, the horns should have been removed because they really don't enhance the already good enough melody, and I actually think the short vocal melody in the begining is better than what serves as the main one.  Small complaints.  \\"Death Or Glory\\" has lyrics that are rather difficult to make out, but at least the memorable chorus is easy to understand with the line \\"Death or glory, becomes just another story!\\"<br /><br />\\"Koka Kola\\" includes a flashback of sorts to that much beloved early punk sound that I hold dear.  Man I yearn for the Clash's debut all the time, even right now while listening to London Calling!  That's how much awesomeness it contains!  \\"The Card Cheat\\" is one of the more bizarre songs here.  The lyrics about serving the king gives the melody a majestic aura of elegance, but the verse melody feels dramatic in a \\"And Then He Kiss Me\\" by the Crystals kind of way.  An odd combination of two radically different styles, and the Clash deserves a ton of respect for that.  \\"Lover's Rock\\" reminds me of a place in Rehoboth Beach Delaware that my family refers to as \\"Lover's Lane\\" where all the teenagers make out by the water fountain near the bay.  Kind of creepy there's one spot for several teens to make out because that's supposed to be a private moment of intimacy, but the melody on this track is pretty groovy and somewhat ballad-like.  The way the melody sort of drifts into a dreamy state with piano and female vocals is unusually pleasant.  \\"Four Horsemen\\" carries a pretty good verse melody and I like the way the singer sings the line \\"You're never gonna ride that lonely mile\\".<br /><br />\\"I'm Not Down\\" is my favorite song on side four.  I don't normally acknowledgethat the album is split between four sides, but in this rare exception I simply must because it stands out so darn much!  \\"I've been beat up, I've been thrown out but I'm not down\\".  Let THESE lyrics be the motivation you need to overcome a depressing period of your life (and hopefully such a period will never come because being depressed stinks).  \\"Revolution Rules\\" is based around a reggae beat with horns that not only do NOT annoy me, but actually feel appropriate and enhance the vocal work.  Over 5 minutes is a bit much and the Clash never really were consistently strong songwriters and it shows here.  \\"Train In Vain\\" is one of those songs I never paid much attention to by itself, but in the context of a double album it takes on a whole new meaning.  The vocal melody *is* pretty decent after all (I originally didn't think it was anything special).<br /><br />Overall, this is the album that people should hear if they want to find out what it's like when a punk/rock band tackles diversity and succeeds most of the time.  I actually think side one contains most of the weaker songs whereas sides 2, 3 and 4 remain strong.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I downloaded this game and played it 1 before I started to love it. I think its the best game ever.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I rarely have time to read because I am rather busy keeping up with my children's schedules.  I sacraficed my sleep to read these books.  Very satisfying.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|As soon as I finished it, I started it over again. Probably one of the best stories I've ever read. Can't wait for book two!!

030758836X|3.0|Maybe I expected too much because of all the hype, I didn't hate it but felt that it could have been more. The writing was good, it kept my attention even though looking back on it, there really wasn't much action. All of the characters were whiny, irritating people with no redeeming qualities. I usually give up on books with no characters I like but I did finish this which I guess says something. I would say about the middle third of the book was suspenseful but it took a long time to get started and kind of fizzled out at the end. Many reviews I've read talk about how realistic the characters and relationships are, all I can say is if the people in my life were like these I would be \\"gone\\" too.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|The \\"update\\" may provide new levels, but I now have to replay ALL the previous ones to unlock the additional ones. As another 1-star reviewer said, all my history has been wiped out. Some update. Don't do it....This is an additional comment, now that I've read more reviews of the update and thought about what happened. I'd like to echo what someone asked in the forum - is anyone at Amazon paying attention? Amazon always says the apps it offers were thoroughly checked out and should be safe to use. Apparently that process doesn't apply to updates. There should have been a stronger warning that all progress would be wiped out. There's probably nothing that can be done to reclaim the older version, but at the very least Amazon owes us a BIG apology.
B004UID2LC|4.0|awesome. get it. u will like it. I like it so u will like it. so that brings me to my first statement. awesome.get it.
034580404X|5.0|This is a great set of books, good quality.  The author is very descriptive in her writing so be prepared.  I loved the story line and could not put the books down.  The only disappointing things for me was when I finished all reading them.
B0085FS5XG|5.0|Very good album.  Quality tunes with Hard, heavy, killer riffs.  I'm 43 and love it front to back...not a bad tune on the album.  The Iron Maiden cover of Powerslave is killer too.  \m/<br /><br />I don't know what the weenie from Edmonton is thinking that gave it a 1 star review.  He must be snorting his kitty litter box or into rap or something.<br /><br />Rock on.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing how amazing this book was and how so many people couldn't put it down, I was shocked to find it to be the complete opposite of all of the hype. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I actually couldn't even finish it. It is a sad reflection of our society that it is a best seller. The writing style is laughable, the characters are unrealistic and underdeveloped, and the author relies on trying to recreate versions of the same \\"titillating\\" scene throughout the book - and fails miserably. Don't waste your time or your money.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|There's so much hype about this book but I feel it's so far off reality that it sets up the BDSM world as a safe easy to navigate world, in reality It's not sunshine and lollipops/ Charly Tango and Million $ cars.<br /><br />But the story although unbelievable is very well structured and written.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|definitely keeps you busy ducks you have to play games to unlock different games.... its alsoe quite confusing on one if the levels I rarely play this game because ofbthe structure if it...n kindle fire
B001QJUX24|5.0|Please note that I saw this on TV so I can't comment on the quality of the video or its features.<br /><br />Amazingly, I had not seen this great classic until recently. It was on my must see list of course, and having finally seen it, I'm glad I did. It's a true classic, one that has influenced countless other westerns and even non-westerns (it's said, for example, that it even influenced Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, although I don't know the details).<br /><br />Filmed in Monument Valley (which is in Utah, not in Texas as in the movie), the cinematography is breathtaking. The script and story are so well known that I won't comment on that, except to say that the film's \\"intimate style\\" also influenced many other movies. Wayne is said to turn in the performance of his career as Ethan, who is driven by his hatred for the Indians and his desire to find his two nieces after the rest of his brother's family is killed by Comanches. In fact, Ethan hates the Comanches so much that he wantonly shoots buffalo just so that there will be fewer buffalo for them. But the entire cast is wonderful and there's not a false note among them.<br /><br />With a huge cast of characters, fine acting all around, a dramatic story, beautiful country and cinematography, and of course the great direction of John Ford, this is one of the greatest classics of the western genre and just one of the greatest movies ever made.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I was a little apprehenive when reading this story. I could never imagaine a place without any emotions. Living in a place that was a very communist community. Where people are even told what to think. It was more like they were robots instead of real people.<br /> I do think that Jonas is a very courageous boy, and want to read the second book. I have to have to find out what happened to Jonas and Gabe.

B002RSQGQK|4.0|Hey all,<br /><br />The movies from amazon are always of great quality. The movie is gripping alright but not as intriguing as hitchcock's other ones like spellbound, man who knew too much and many others.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch once,
B005MMYHFK|2.0|The acting is not very good. The plot moves far too quickly to feel you can really understand what's happening and why it's happening. I feel completely lost watching it. I have only a vague memory of how the traditional Camelot story goes- it seems that a person would have to remember most of the details of the story to fully follow the show, even from the first episode. I'm not planning on watching the rest of the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely brilliant! I couldn't put it down.  I found the book thought provoking and the plot very relevant in a world where civil liberties are increasingly under threat and reality tv gaining popularity on a daily basis.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|As a reader: I'm glad I had the benefit of friends' recommendations and warnings about this series, particularly the first book.  Had I not, I likely would have given up about fifty pages in.  The first book starts off with an intriguing opening, but then drags on with too much detail for far too long.  However, knowing that, you can skim read much of the family history and focus on what Larsson does best: tell an intricate tell through superbly developed characters.  Book one, though slow to start, had a good mystery with plenty of twists, but it's really worth reading for the character and plot development it provides for books two and three, which in my opinion where fabulous.  Be warned there are a few graphic scenes, including two rape scenes in book one, which some readers might want to skim or at least avoid reading directly before bed.<br /><br />As a writer: Having rewritten the opening pages to my first novel a dozen (or two) times, I was envious of Larsson after reading the very beginning of Dragon Tattoo.  Okay, I was downright jealous and therefore not the biggest fan.  However, I quickly fell in love with this author because he gave me hope-he proved even flawed novels can get published if your characters are real enough.  Larsson's characters are just that: real.They are lovable because they're simultaneously loathable.  He brings new meaning to the flawed protagonist.  The magic of these books is in Michael and Lisbeth's ability to have readers screaming at them one chapter and crying for them the next. No matter what one thinks of Larsson's style, which is often detail laden to the point of being inconsiderate to the reader, no one can deny this writer was a master of characterization.  Lisbeth and Michael will find their way onto readers' lists of characters they'd love to meet and hate letting go of at the end of these books.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you like intricate plots or love wonderfully flawed characters, stick with it; you'll be rewarded!ed!
0786956291|3.0|Hi,    I used to play D&D back in the 80s. I have very fond memories of many hours/days playing this game with friends.    I purchased this as a way to get my son (probably a bit young still - only 8) into the idea of playing RPG games.    I thought that the DM manual was missing lots of details about character creation and weapons/armour etc.    This is covered by a learn as you go approach. There are few problems with this:    1 - it takes away a lot of the fun of creating characters as many of the aptitudes are fixed and not variable  2 - doesn't allow for characters improving their skill sets  3 -  It is very unclear to a new DM as to what the rules are regarding character creation  4 - limits weapons and fixes armour to role choices which detracts from the ability of the DM to sprinkle goodies throughout the scenario  5 - fixes attribute values to choices of race (ridiculous - how can all humans have IQ of 18??)  6 -and the list goes on    It is all a little bit bizarre.    I think that I will introduce some of the rules from the following pathfinder link to help with character creation  [...]    And then I will probably introduce some aspects from    [...]    in order to help with some of the deficits.    So it is with a disappointed sigh that I give this one a 3.    At least it has some of the maps/counters that give  bit of a positive.    Although pathfinder is more expensive I reckon it is a better alternative.    Hope this helped    Cheers
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As a reader: Suzanne Collins had a number of successful young adult books prior to The Hunger Games, so I was not surprised when a few of my students recommend the title to me. I never expected, though, to be blown away with the sophistication of the writing and the themes. This is one of those rare books that speaks to readers of all ages and all genders. It is a twisted love story, a wrenching coming-of-age tale, and an action-packed adventure. What makes it truly a gem, though, is how it uses a futuristic setting to force readers into examining so many aspects of contemporary society. I instantly fell in love with Katniss, who narrates this book and the others in the trilogy. She is the epitome of an unreliable narrator, yet she is so strong that you find yourself believing even what you know is likely untrue. The supporting characters in the book are equally wonderful. They are flawed and unique, and Collins unfolds each carefully over the course of the book and trilogy, so that every page offers new insight into someone.<br /><br />As a writer: I was into book three before I realized what was off about the writing of these books. They are written in first person present tense, a very rare narration choice, but one that works for these books. First, it builds suspense; you can't assume Katniss will survive the way you could in a first person narration told in past tense. Second, Collins clearly is a master at it. The fact that such a unique form of writing can go unnoticed means the author is skilled in her craft. The reader is so in Katniss's head that it doesn't seem at all unnatural that the story would be told in present tense. As mentioned above, Collins is also a master of characterization. She creates a world where a large chunk of the characters, those from the Capital, could seem outrageous and unbelievable. She described them, after all, to look the way one might picture the performers in a Cirque du Soleil show, yet as we meet each, we love or loathe them for their personalities alone. The final skill I envy Collins for is her world creation. As I mentioned above, this is not an author who is new to fantasy writing, but the detail with which she describes this world and the various settings, creatures, and technology is amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line: I think I've gushed enough. Read it for yourself. Read it to your kids. Read it with your students. You won't need me to tell you it is worth the all-nighter.them for their personalities alone.

034580404X|4.0|As a reader: Like many woman, I picked up the first book out of curiosity. I wanted to see if Fifty Shades was really worth the hype. Unlike some soccer moms out there, I had read romance/erotica books before, so I wasn't expecting to be shocked or disturbed by the sex scenes. Overall, I wasn't.  J. R. Ward had explored the BDSM angle years ago in her Black Dagger Brotherhood series.  So what it came down to was whether the characters and plot could pull me along with or without the sex scenes (preferably with). The answer was yes.  Like in the Twilight series, I loved watching the heroine, Ana Steele, grow from timorous to tenacious. These books allow women to reminisce about our first loves and cringe over our struggles to grow from shy teens to confident young women. I equally loved watching Christian Grey, Ana's love interest, devolve from a rich, domineering sex-god, to a broken but healing, lovable human being. The initial fantasy of finding a rich, handsome, and dangerous lover is fun, but realizing that most of the time it really is nothing more than fantasy is comforting and more realistic.<br /><br />So although the sex was great, in the end it was the characters with miles of heartbreaking backstory and those bits of creativity and humor that sucked me in and kept me up to all hours of the night.<br /><br />As a writer: I found it comforting reading the opening chapter of the first book and recognizing that other new writers also struggle to get their stories out of the gate. It is clear as one reads further into the book, that James was still finding the voices of her characters in those opening chapters. Though the first person narration felt stiff and the dialogue sounded forced for those first few chapters, James got into a groove relatively quickly.  Soon, Ana sounded like a realistic twenty-two year old, both in her thoughts and dialogue. Her inner monologues often rang sadly and humorously true of a twenty-two year old in the throes of love and life.<br /><br />There were other flaws, such as overused words and phrases, which began to stand out as the series progressed. Plot development was also shaky, but this I understood as a writer. James was trying to balance the plot surrounding her characters' personal journeys with external plots. If the two plots aren't tightly linked to one another, as James's weren't, one can climax at an odd time within the arch of the book.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're an adult who liked the Twilight series and are comfortable with some untraditional sex scenes, you're likely to get sucked into this series, so go ahead and purchase the entire trilogy. You'll save some cash, and trust me, you won't want to stop reading long enough to drive to the nearest store.e.<br /><br />There were other flaws, such as overused words and phrases, which began to stand out as the series progressed.

0345803485|1.0|I'll just do what the author did and repeat myself,over & over & over & over .... Jeez! ...Oh My! As I bite my bottom lip I'm thinking, \\"Did a 13 year old girl write this?\\"<br />This book is very poorly crafted. I could only get about 1/3 of the way through it and gave it to a friend who also agrees with me.
B00846REIS|2.0|I hate to say it but I would not recommend this novel as I feel it was too similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. I am not an author or writer so I will not comment on the quality of the writing. There were way too many situations in this story that seemed to come straight out of the pages of Fifty Shades.  I wanted to read a new novel, not a poorly written copy of Fifty.....I think the author has potential if she finds her own story and characters.  Just my opinion here.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I have played Word of Warcraft for about 5-6 years, off and on. This controller is amazing when used for that game. I have used Logitech mice/keyboards for a long time, and trust that brand for durability and quality. This device is well made, comfortable, and gives you more access to more customized configurations than you'll probably ever need. I always ran into the hassles of awkward key placement with my keybinds (ex: Windows button between CTRL and ALT), and this solved that, and opened up even more options. You can basically program a series of commands/macros into a macro of it's own, and bind that. I would imagine it would work as well for any other MMO. I have used it on some FPS games (Combat Arms, etc) but they just don't use as many commands/keybinds - as stated earlier, this was well worth the purchase price just for WoW.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book. it is amazing. this novel is so good. i really enjoy this story it is very interesting
0307950689|2.0|I found myself struggling with the book after the first hundred pages.<br />The only entertaining part was the symbolic background and history behind Washington monuments.<br />The plot is very predictable. Countless repetitions, pages of monotonous descriptions. Sometimes I almost felt physical struggle of author with himself to add few unnecessary pages for unknown purpose.<br />At the end you asking yourself - why on Earth did the go through all of this? Seriously?<br />My personal advice - read the book if you have absolutely nothing else to do. When it gets boring - skip few pages until it gets interesting again. And if you fell like struggling with it - just put it away. Don't worry - you won't miss a thing.

B006ZJJ6XW|5.0|If there is a complete Beethoven symphony cycle on record without flaws, I'm unaware of it.  The BSO planned a new edition recently under James Levine, but his illness precluded that from happening.  Here we have an absolutely first-rate version under Leinsdorf, the BSO's music director from 1962 to 1969.  The orchestra sounds fine and the recording--while not always superb--does manage to capture a good deal of the special acoustic of Symphony Hall.  For me, the outstanding components of this cycle are the First, Second, Eighth and Ninth.  The first two probably are among the best ever and speak to Leinsdorf's special affinity for classicism.  The last two are also special and in the Ninth, you have the bonus of the young Domingo and Milnes as the male soloists.<br /><br />The middle symphonies are less exceptional although far more than adequate with the possible exception of the Third, which was recorded first and seems to these ears somewhat lumbering and prosaic.  However, as I said, there is no cycle without some debits and this one is really quite fine; and as others have noted, it has been historically underrated by many.  You will not go wrong in purchasing this edition, and at this price, it is also a compelling buy.

I was leery about purchasing this case but based on a review here on Amazon and a mention on the manufacturer's actual website (Medium cover fits: Kindle Fire... Nexus 7...), I decided to try it. Both references were incorrect... mostly. The case does *fit* nicely, it's just not very compatible with the placement of the Nexus 7's power button nor it's headphone jack.<br /><br />The power button is constantly held down by the top right strap. It's also dangerously close to the headphone jack. This case will almost undoubtedly cause permanent damage to your power button as the elastic is very strong and sturdy (buttons on small electronics aren't), it will cause your battery to die much faster as it could keep turning your screen on while you're not using it (or it *could* save you battery by shutting the tablet off for you, lol. it would probably just turn it back on though). It's also very possible that it would damage your headphone jack by tilting the connector when they're plugged in.<br /><br />A tablet without a working power button or headphone jack doesn't sound very fun. I wish the straps were half as thick, that would probably alleviate both issues. There are no feasible modifications to adjust the positions of the straps (without damaging the product).
B0070XFNDE|5.0|This is the third in the Trilogy which started with The Shadow of the Wind, then The Angel's Game.  It is a wonderful tale that shifts between events during the Spanish Civil War and a few decades later.  Same characters as the two previous books of the trilogy. A fast moving, tale, full of surprises, human events and emotions and some slightly magical things.  It is a fun, compelling read.
1469984202|5.0|WOW this book is good.  Best book I've read in a long while.  It's full of suspense, mysteries, thrills, action and great character development. There is so much going on here! I was intrigued from the start - by the end of the first chapter I couldn't stop thinking about what the hell was going on in this world.  I couldn't stop wondering, \\"Yeah, why DO people clean!?\\"<br /><br />Any fans of Lost would appreciate this book - the shockers, reveals, and twists reminded me of watching Lost every week and freaking out over every little detail and clue.  The only difference here is that (thankfully!) you don't need to wait a week to read the next chapter. It is so twisty! Like, gasp-inducing twists!<br /><br />Wow. I am so impressed. This book really brings you on a long and crazy journey, and I loved almost every minute of it.  No spoilers, but my favorite part was the \\"diving\\" chapters. Completely freaked me out.
B008CJ0KI8|1.0|In reality, this album is about 2 or 2.5 stars.<br /><br />Just because Ocean is \\"different\\" or \\"deep\\" doesn't give him extra points for me. I'm basing this off shear craftsmanship of the album and for the most part, the album is flat, monotone, and the lyrics feel a little contrived. Guess what I am trying to say is that the album feels like Ocean is \\"trying to hard\\" through most of it. There are moments of good like Pyramids or Pink Matter but the majority is very bland.<br /><br />Maybe if the album featured the songs from track 10+ it would be better because the first 9 tracks are very forgettable. I think the slowing record sales will show that the music is average at best because once the word of mouth spreads and people outside of his fans hear it, they will hear it for its musical value and hear what I hear...a below average album.
034580404X|5.0|Very, very good.  Really enjoyed all three books.  Am just sorry there aren't more.  Was a perfect summer read.  Yes, it's graphic but needed.  I enjoyed it more from a relationship and heart prospective than a sexual one.
B00846REIS|5.0|Books I enjoy are 50 Shades, Twilight and all Kresley Cole novels.  Bared to You is similar to 50 Shades without the cuffs, and whips. Also, the main female character, Eva, is not a virgin and not as shy as Ana.  I have to say I am torn between the two books on which I like the best.  Looking forward to the next Crossfire Novel coming this Fall. A definite read.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|This tool is wonderful for cutting glass; rather than going with the twine and acetone route which is more expensive and much more dangerous, I use this to make a small score in the bottle.  I put the glass in hot, boiling water, then run it under a cold stream of water and voila, it is a perfect cut!  And the Amazon price is much better than anywhere else online.  Just be patient when you first start, as it takes some practice to get the results that you want.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is kind of like the originalnonly you don't have to follow missions. your free to build W's you please but its harder to earn investment points so you need to spend them wisely
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am happy to hear other people's opinion on this book. I was so disappointed that this was a bestseller. If you can get past the porn part (which I was not expecting - my fault entirely) you won't be able to get past the horrible writing. I don't know about you but I'm not interested in giving my hard earned/saved money to books that are poorly written. This author is making millions and is setting the wrong example on so many levels. Don't waste your time or money! Gross!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Good strategy game which does not require fast reflexes for those of us who don't have good reflexes. Who would have thought saving bugs could be so much fun?
B000QQY8CE|5.0|I really have to say that I don't think anyone else can blow away the typical metal stereotypes as good as these guys can. Only recently did I come across Stratovarius, and now I am a huge fan of theirs.<br /><br />Beautiful melodies and harmonies, fused with high-flying vocals, and amazing neoclassical guitar shred... I really can't ask for more! Like with alot of their albums, some of the songs are really fast and energetic, while others are nice and steady, yet still full of sheer power and emotion. They might not be the most original band in the world, but they are definitely not one of those bands where every one of their songs sound the same. They are what they are, and they are experts at it.<br /><br />From reading the one-star reviews, all I am getting is that people are just too picky about them not being as much like other bands (i.e. Helloween, Gamma Ray, or Rhapsody of Fire) as they would like them to be. To those people, all I have to say is this: Get over yourselves, and give credit where credit is due! Just accept these guys for what they are, and don't try to make them something they're not.<br /><br />Overall, this album is epically amazing, and deserves to be in the collection of anyone who has what might be called a soul. So I beg of all those people immersed in the corruptive, brainwashing influence of today's American popular culture: Please go and throw away all those Nickelback, Fall Out Boy, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park CDs, and get to know Stratovarius for some REAL, honest music.
0439023491|5.0|With trilogies and sequels, you never really know which way it is going to go. Some are far from being as good as the initial book, others are better, and a few are just as good. Suzanne Collins has managed to produce a sequel to The Hunger Games which is as good as the first book, although not quite as innovative. Katniss Everdeen, the winner of Panem's Hunger Games is back to living her previous life, although a much better one financially. Her love dilemma between Peeta and Gale is still there, and the Capitol is more ominous than ever. When Katniss, the Mockinjay, finds herself back in sicker-than-ever games, the whole of Panem is in shock. The story is once again fast paced, violent, and terrifying, but less bloody than the first, which I liked (I found the first book far too bloody for young adults and would not recommend it to anyone). I liked this sequel, even if there is less tension (and less surprises) than the initial book. Collins delivers good writing, a fast plot, and a few twists... all good!
B002U3CCBK|5.0|The thing I really liked about this book was that it was written in various different ways, i.e. emails, memos, diary entries, etc. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I think this made the book varied and interesting.<br /><br />I think it was quite an achievement to make a book about fishing, something I know nothing about, seem so compelling! Torday cleverly uses the subject of fishing as the main premise, but there are so many other factors that come into play: politics, working relationships, romantic relationships, fear of failure.<br /><br />Highly recommend it!
B004MC0FO8|4.0|It's surprising to me how well this app works.  Out of 30 or so uses there's been 2 it couldn't identify.  It has a much harder time in noisy environs, but I suppose that's to be expected. Someone talking fairly close will make it fail evey time. So shut up and let it listen. :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is the best 99 cent game ever btw there are no more nag screens :) can not wait for next game
0345442970|5.0|Another great book of little events that happen leading up to Episode 1. Luceno's writing style doesn't suck me in like some other star wars authors, but I'm a little different when I read. I play books like a movie in my head while I read them. Others love his style. But it did keep me engaged, and I finished it without issue and immediately had to read the next book.
B007VTVG4C|5.0|1st things 1st, Im so glad I didnt write a review upon initial listen of this record! in about 90% of the reviews i read on this set i kept seeing a recurring plead of \\"give it a chance, listen to a few times and youll love it\\" so i went in this with a open mind considering how amazing her previous work has been. so i got the vinyl listened to it once and said out loud \\"shes lost her mind, this music is awful\\" but something strange happened and i was hearing some of the parts of some songs playing in my head making me literally crave to listen to an album i didnt like at all. then affter the 2nd time of listen to it front to back i started enjoying it a little more and then it increased in likeability each and everytime, i wont say what everyone else is saying but i will say this, listen to this album once through as if your having a strange, confusing conversation with fiona and the only way to communicate with her is through her singing and playing random bursts of instruments and the occasional holler! :)
B004U52VPS|4.0|Very entertaining game. Comes with cards that have structures built and how many and what type of birds you're supposed to use to knock it down. Its durable, its made to be built up and knocked down. Educational value is a little subjective, it does help your kid in recognizing and building the structures on the cards, not much more than that though, and if they're too young, wont get anything from it at all. But its a fun game to gather around and play for a half-hour or so. Kids love it, especially if they play on your phone all the time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun!! I can't think if a better game for kids or ice age fans!!!!

B006LSZECO|1.0|I am very disappointed in this book. It is a terrible read, very boring. Definitely not worth buying. This is by far the worse book I have read in a very long time. The entire book is just very plain and unexciting, The characters are not realistic and they are even boring. I love to read and rarely feel this negative toward anything I have read. I expected so much more from this book. What a big let down.

0440242401|5.0|I just finished reading Remember Me and I thought it was a great book!  I'm a huge fan of Cheryl Griffin and have read all of her books and have read rewiews that Sophie writes like her.  Well they were right they write a lot a like.  The book was funny and had me laughing out loud at times!  It was a great easy read with you wanting to keep turning the pages to find out more!  I can now add another great author to my list!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This really keeps my Teen girls occupied when I am in an appointment.  I haven't tried any of the games on it yet, but will have to check them out soon.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Let's just say I've had quite a few over the top sexual encounters and enjoy a good smut book (Jackie Collins, anyone?)  I read all the bad reviews but because it was smut, I thought, okay, maybe some of these people are a little prude.......well, I'm 38% in and not sure I'm going to finish.  Never mind the unrealistic, &quot;I came 3 times during my first sexual encounter&quot; crap, that was ALMOST bearable, BUT.....................<br /><br />From the moment Christian Grey enters the hardware store where Ana works, alarm bells set off in my head!  He's buying tie wraps and tape!!  More sixth sense, unsettling feelings when she goes to his apartment for the first &quot;date.&quot;  To me he seems like a CREEPER that is just one step away from kidnapping and keeping a young girl against her will for 18 years, a' la Jaycee Duggard!!!!!  As another person said, &quot;you can't UNREAD this.&quot;<br /><br />Jan 2015 Update:  I DID stop at 38% read and have never been back.
B00785P2QC|5.0|really good game.  I'm not that fare in. there is a lot to do it is really fun. Don't no what else totality about
030758836X|3.0|Reason for Reading:  I loved Flynn's Dark Places and was excited to read another book by her.<br /><br />I was excited to read this as I had enjoyed Dark Places very much and have seen the reviews for this popping up all over the place; while not reading them, I was taking note of the 4 & 5 star ratings.  I have to say I was a bit let down from my expectations.  As I started reading Part One,  I just really didn't find myself all that intrigued as I couldn't ge over how the events mimicked the Scott Peterson case item by item so of course I knew that meant the husband wasn't the killer because what kind of book would that be? So no suspense as everything was expected as it unraveled in Part One and I had thought of a few ideas as to what may be going on and was not shocked at the twist that came with Part Two.  Basically, the whole plot of the thriller didn't *thrill* me.  Now, I won't say I didn't enjoy it as I did once Part Two was under way, but I was underwhelmed.<br /><br />Secondly, the two main characters, both the husband and the wife, I found completely repulsive.  I didn't like either of them as people and was unsatisfied with the ending.  I connected with the sister, Go, but it just isn't that compelling to read a crime story about people you don't care for.  So overall, while the plot had twists and kept me reading to find out how it all turned out in the end, I found this book to just be ok.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|I got this for free and I love it. I had this album a few years ago and it got stolen along with my car. So happy to add it to my collection again!
B007JMW46U|4.0|Arthor Conan Doyle is always a good read.  One of the best at carrying the excitement all the way to the end.  These short stories are just the right length for one setting.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|An absolutely outstanding movie for the whole family.  If you like to watch movies with a Christian theme, then this is the movie for you.  It may bring a tear to your eye.  I watched it via Netflix and as soon as it was over, I immediately sat down at the computer and ordered it.  It is that good.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have run quickly through all five books - and like other readers had hoped that there would be some progression to an end. But no.  So many points of view now (IMHO).  I sense that the author is working harder and harder to get through each successive book and may not yet have sight of what the ending should be, unlike JK Rowling who evidently wrote out all the outlines for all the Harry Potter books before she started. Despite this, the author turns a great tale and wraps you up in it. Have to admire how he tracsk all the POVs, locales and players.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I just bought this app and it said it was cloudy in my home town. It was wrong cause i dont think cloudy involves a severe thunderstorm with hail...just bad...and disappointing.
1612183956|4.0|Ethan Burke awakes on the outskirts of a town whose name he doesn't know.  In fact, he doesn't know his own name, or why he's there, or what's happened.  It comes to him quickly enough, however: he's an agent with the Secret Service, sent to find two missing agents.  And this is Wayward Pines, Idaho, an idyllic little town ripped from the pages of a Norman Rockwell painting.  The people are friendly, the houses are beautiful, the crickets are chirping...and every single thing Ethan sees is a lie.  As Ethan slowly barrels toward the horrifying truth of things, he uncovers a world where nothing can be taken for granted, and no one--maybe not even Ethan himself--is who they seem.<br /><br />Blake Crouch has crafted a fine thriller.  PINES is a bullet; it starts strong and charges ever-forward, hitting a few sluggish spots (yes, you actually CAN make an action sequence stretch on too long) but ultimately staying strong and true.  Burke is an interesting, complex character, and Crouch has created an undeniably creepy town; Twin Peaks meets \\"The Lottery,\\" with a whole lotta Stephen King and Margaret Atwood thrown in for good measure.  Little of what you see here is entirely original (Crouch himself defines the novel as a tribute, particularly to \\"Twin Peaks\\" and the work of David Lynch), but the author has a way with words, and the suspense almost never slacks.  PINES is for fans of speculative, quasi-genre thrillers who enjoy tense writing, addictive plots, and some thoroughly disturbing images and revelations.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Exactly what I needed. I just wanted something quick and easy to use that was right at my fingertips. Plain and simple.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved this Masterpiece Theatre production of Jane Eyre.  I've seen several productions & this one is definitely the best.  The actors are wonderful & really get into their roles & it is also very romantic. Toby Stephens is not as brutal in this version as Mr. Rochester is protrayed in other versions. It's a wonderful movie & I enjoyed it very much.
0345803493|1.0|A couple of my friends, who apparently have horrible taste, highly recommended all three of these books. Book one was boring. I didn't buy the second book for about a month just to escape these boring characters and their stupid disfunctional realationship. I don't know if I can even bring myself to finish the second book.<br /><br />When Leila was found armed in Ana's apartment I wanted her to kill Ana and put her out of her misery. When Christian went \\"missing\\" I hoped he had gone down in a firey Charlie Tango crash. Lol. Of course none of that happened because there is a third book about these two.<br /><br />I find it incredibly dull that Christian is a gorgeous 27 year old gazillionair who buys Audis the way I buy paper towels. It's like the author asked an 11 year old girl to describe the perfect man and then wrote whatever she said into existence.<br /><br />I hate Ana more than I hated Bella from Twilight. She is a nit wit. Every single male character in these books wants to get into her pants yet she has this big internal struggle that boils down to \\"why is Christian attracted to me?\\" She pretty much IS Bella from Twilight.<br /><br />I also hate that Christian's \\"type\\" targets the chunky, plain jane women who are most likely loving these books. He only likes brunettes, and he doesn't like them too thin. In this book you find out the reasoning behind that which is creepy and gross.<br /><br />In Christian's organization he supposedly has an army of beautiful blond women whom he's not attracted to working for him. I picture a bunch of female Fox news anchors running around. I have to amuse myself in little ways in order to get through this. My brain also cast Don Draper from Mad Men as Ana's boss.
B008B3H4VQ|2.0|While the album is a vast improvement over their last two failures, it still leaves the die-hard Linkin Park Hybrid Theory/Meteora fan in a state of starvation, begging the band to produce that heavenly sound once again.
0811875555|4.0|I've always enjoyed a peek behind the scenes at a lot of the cartoons, films and productions I've experienced over my life, and these books are a nice addition to any personal library. It's both interesting and inspiring seeing how several artists develop an idea, building on the multitude of sketches, paintings, doodles, etc.<br />  I own several of the \\"Art of...\\" series, all very good....plus many other books/media that share a glimpse in the creative processes from all genres. If you're an artist or just a fan, these are good books to read all about the process from beginning to end (although sparse in some areas), or to just simply enjoy some really cool art.
B006VA3ZEG|5.0|We have enjoyed this series since the beginning.  Great storyline, excellent acting.  Can't wait for Season 3 with the addition of Shirley Maclaine to the cast!
B007G5K066|5.0|This film is one of the greatest I have ever seen. The best way to describe it is \\"the most boring film you will be on the edge of your seat for.\\" The cinematography is great, the story has a nice flow to it with flashbacks spliced to give more and more backstory to what is going on and eventually helps give the great reveal at the end. A true spy film that does not have shootings every 5 seconds. A must see for true fans of cinema. Gary Oldman is at his best in this film!
B003P2WJ6S|4.0|I had never heard of Hela. Not only is this a very important story, it is also extremely well told. It mixes science, history and politics within the framework of a sad human story, without being depressing. Excellent read!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great game. great great great great game. did I mention this great game is really great? isn't this great?
B007712XAU|5.0|These are the complete sets. I ordered them the last week of July and got the full versions a week later, no left out Christmas episode everyone was whining about. That episode is the only episode that was named and it would be easy to overlook and think it was part of the features so heads up about that. I also would like the add that one of the disks was scratched and the seller replaced it quickly and was lovely about it. These sets are great, filled with all kind of special features to keep you plugged into Downton Abby for hours if not days.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|It's sturdy and compact. Travels easily in my purse/suitcase. Like the 'stand' feature. And it matches my Droid phone case. LOVE it!
B000001GQB|5.0|Maestro Böhm has always been, in my opinion, the paragon of Mozart conducting. I have the original vinyls in my collection, now a little worse for wear. These excellent reproductions restore or even improve on the quality of those originals.  Böhm's meticulous interpretations bring out details often lost in other performances without appearing pedantic. They are all passionate renditions obviously arising from a deep understanding of the Mozart idiom.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love it. the sounds are soothing. my favorite sound is orchestra and it has a creative design. I shared the app with all my friends

I'm using this on a Macbook Pro Retina and it works great on my gigabit ethernet network.  The price is acceptable and not much more than the slower USB to ethernet adapters.

0345803493|4.0|WARNING: SPOILERS!<br /><br />Having read Fifty Shades of Grey, I was desperate to read the second book, Fifty Shades Darker and I was not disappointed.  It took me three days - I was even carrying it to work and reading it on my lunch hour.  I simply devoured it.<br /><br />I think it was better than the first book, although I get tired of the smirking and the inner goddess.  As anyone can see, if you look past the bondage, there is a beautiful love story.  I couldn't wait for Christian to admit that he loved Ana and the fact that he can actually tell her that he does makes it worth the wait.<br /><br />And finally, Ana was able to touch him.  He wanted her to.  That got a sigh from me.<br /><br />Ana's boss was, in Christian's words, a sleazeball.  But Ana put him in his place, and Taylor and Christian took it from there.  Why does he take revenge on Christian?  Does he really want Ana that badly?  Talk about obsession!<br /><br />But then Ana and Christian are so obsessed with each other, I guess I shouldn't be surprised.<br /><br />When Grace slapped Elena, I actually jumped out of my seat and cheered.  I hate that Elena woman and I commend Ana for telling her off.  She sure showed her true colors.<br /><br />The hearts and flowers were a nice touch.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the third book, which I have heard is the best by far.  I am hoping for a happy ending.

B007I2BZIE|4.0|\\"Rush has long been one of my favorite bands, so I was eager to get their latest effort.  I rated it 3 out of 5 stars.  Granted, from me a 3 star Rush album is a 4 or 5 album from most other bands.  This is not their best album by a long shot.  But that doesn't mean it isn't good.  The songs are interesting and original, and a die-hard Rush fan will find plenty to like about it.  If you're not a die-hard, then you may or may not.\\"    That was my original review in 2012.  Honestly, I don't even remember writing it.  Anyway, since then I have read the \\"Clockwork Angels\\" novel by Kevin J. Anderson, and I must say that my appreciation for the album is significantly enhanced in 2014.  To me, the story as heard on the album alone is too sparse to really know what the story actually is.  It makes more sense with full knowledge of the story.    That being said, having listened to the album numerous more times, it has grown on me.  It still isn't my favorite, but I've raised it from 3 to 4 stars.  And there are a couple of songs that I've grown to really love, namely \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" and \\"Headlong Flight.\\"  Also, \\"The Garden\\" is a very fine ending track.

0307474259|5.0|I'm not going to rehash other reviews.  This book is a follow-on to \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" and includes some practical suggestions as well as updates to the original work.  It is far more accessible to the general reader than the previous book, although that makes it somewhat less satisfying to the professional audience.  Regardless, the book is worth it for incorporating one additional study that appeared after \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\", and that is the A-Z study out of Stanford.  The study, which was widely reported in the press, was the first to directly compare various diets, as the diets were published, on parameters such as weight loss, blood pressure, etc.  \\"As the diets were published\\" is a key phrase--much of the science on this subject is flawed because the researchers, intentionally or otherwise, modify the low-carb diets in such a way as to invalidate their studies.  The Stanford study did not do that; it used the Atkins diet as recommended by Atkins.  The study found that the Atkins diet was far superior in all respects to the other diets, which included some high-carb, low-calorie versions.  The inclusion of that study in this book is worthy, but it's really the provision by Taubes of the back story that is most illuminating.  He reported that the principal investigator, who is himself a vegetarian, was surprised by and did not particularly like the results.  As a practicing scientist, I can tell prospective readers that when a scientist gets results he neither expects nor likes, he goes back through his own study with a fine-toothed comb before submitting it for publication.  Scientists don't often try to disprove themselves (or at least, not very vigorously), except in this kind of situation.  That the PI was compelled to publish the study, despite his personal feelings about the results, is extremely telling, and extremely compelling.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the game. Great for wasting time on a Kindle Fire. The higher levels can get quite challenging but you can skip levels and come back to them later.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen.  The principal characters are active duty Navy Seals and a Navy intelligence officer.  Only a couple of fairly well known actors play other prominent roles.  Be sure to watch the directors comments - they add so much to the background of this film.  Most of the shooting is live fire, the Seals did much of the dialog without any script, personal scenes such as the beach party were their actual families.  Each \\"Act of Valor\\" shown actually happened and were woven into the story line written for this movie.  These guys are the best that America has and no one should miss this opportunity to see what they do.<br /><br />Another shameless plug for the Seals - buy Marcus Luttrell's \\"Lone Survivor\\" about the 2005 Seal Team 10's fateful mission in the Afghanistan Hindu Kush and those who lost their lives trying to same him.  Unforgettable. IBSN-13: 978-0-316-06760-7<br /><br />Jim Krenik

B002RHL8DC|5.0|I happened upon this series by chance. I have not seen any of the other Stargate series other than random channel surfing on TV. So with no experience or expectations, I started watching this series online. After three episodes I was hooked. Season 2 is even better. I've found the characters to be complex and deep. The hero is flawed, the villain shows surprising humanity. Overall their time on Destiny is dark and claustrophobic -- exactly how I would imagine being trapped on an alien spaceship would be. Don't analyze the details too hard, else you will start picking it apart (like the \\"ancients\\" ships come stocked with silky tri-color comforters from Bed, Bath & Beyond). It's been a good watch and I have come to enjoy several characters.

0385335997|4.0|As with all the books in the Outlander series, this book reels and pulls you in.  The majority of this book is focused on the high seas where it contains everything from mayhem, pirates, slavery and shipwrecks. I love the fact that there is a continuation of characters both old and new. There is much courage throughout this book.  In this book the characters really grow and develop together and it's not all love and cherry blossoms. There is the agony and hurt of betrayal and the tenderness of forgiveness as love begins anew.  I gave this book four stars instead of 5 for two reasons: 1) The sexual encounters after awhile get to be a bit much. 2) The book drags a bit and some of the adventurous mishaps seem to be a bit too extreme and exhausting.  Still, I would read this book again and I love the series. As always with Gabaldon's books the ending of one is the perfect beginning to another new adventure and I'm looking forward to the next book, The Drums of Autumn.<br /><br />\\"I'm a man, Sassenach,\\" he said, very softly. \\"If I thought there was a choice ... then I maybe couldna do it. Ye dinna need to be so brave about things if ye ken ye canna help it, aye?\\" He looked at me then, with a faint smile. \\"Like a woman in childbirth, aye? Ye must do it, and it makes no difference if you're afraid - ye'll do it. It's only when ye can say no that it takes courage.\\"
B006OE7XM4|5.0|I remember when I was in high school and college.  Most of my contemporaries listened to the Beatles, the Stones, Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, etc.  I was drawn to Blood Sweat & Tears, Chicago (back when they were the Transit Authority), The Ides of March, Chase, Jethro Tull (pre-Thick as a Brick), Tower of Power, and the Flock.  Ah, yes.  Jazz-rock.  A movement that seemed to be over too soon; but fortunately, I caught the wave into fusion before it died.<br /><br />What does that have to do with Gregory Porter and \\"Be Good\\"?  Everything.  This album captures those days, more so than anything I've heard recently.  Down Beat's critics recently cited this as the third best album of the year.  In a way, I don't agree, and in another way, I fully agree.<br /><br />Certainly, Mr. Porter's full, throaty, Levi Stubbs-like voice is as suited for this style as was David Clayton-Thomas and Jim Peterik.  But I don't strongly disagree with the 2-star reviews above.  By far my favorite cut on this album is the impressionistic ballad, \\"Imitation of Life.\\"  Nothing else here really matches up to that, IMO, although I like \\"When Did You Learn?\\" and \\"Bling Bling.\\"  And the cover of Oscar Brown's (not Herb Alpert's!) \\"Work Song\\" is cool.  Ordinarily, this wide of variety of quality would lead me to 4 stars.<br /><br />The reason I am lead to 5 is my own bias.  If jazz is to survive and not be relegated to an art-curious form, somebody has to start capturing young people's imaginations,  the way that jazz rock in the 1960's-early 1970's captured mine.  And when you consider Ken Burns' 9-hour documentary on jazz, where Burns devoted all of 10 minutes (if that) to post-Miles jazz, it is evident that there is an awful lot of imagination-capturing work to be done to avoid \\"art curiosity.\\"  This album could be that ignition - just as BS & T was for me, 43 years ago.<br /><br />Perhaps coincidentally, perhaps not, Mr. Porter ends this album with an a capella version of \\"God Bless the Child.\\"  Query:  How many of you first heard this tune from Blood, Sweat & Tears, which in turn lead you to Billie Holiday?  And what if there never was a Blood Sweat & Tears?  Would you have been lead to Billie Holiday, anyway?<br /><br />That's why I think the Down Beat critics were right.  Buy this album, especially if you are young.  Jazz needs you to do so.  RC<br /><br />1/13/13:  Unbelievable.  This was the top-rated vocal jazz c.d. of 2012, per both Jazz-Times and Down Beat.  In fact, both periodicals had it in the list of top 5 c.d.'s of 2012.  I can't remember the last time that happened.  Yet, no Grammy nomination.  For that matter, nobody has yet to vote or make a comment on this review.  What are you people listening to?!

B005H2IAM6|4.0|I have seen the original Starblazers as a child in the 1980's along with a dozen or more animes; Thundercats, Voltron, Macross... to name just a few. I really did not have much invested or expectations that this be identical to the anime as it was live action which are often much different than the animated originals like Transformers (which was destroyed by Michael Bay). However, I am not a hardcore Starblazers fan either. They could have done better with the actors and there were many cheesy moments in the movie that could have been left out. The action scenes were great though especially towards the end. There was enough character development so you actually understood where the characters were coming from and going to towards the end of the movie.<br /><br />Space Battleship Yamato really can't exactly be compared to the Battlestar Galactica series because Battlestar is mediocre at best and the camera is too jerky in Battlestar.There is only one scene I can think of that is at all similar to Battlestar Galactica but I will not explain it as it would spoil it for anyone who has not seen this movie. The special effects in Space Battleship Yamato were much better than Battlestar Galactica and it actually had a decent plot and characters you actually cared about not the ultra lame everyone might be a Cylon crap from Battlestar. I am not sure how there are legal copies since Space Battleship Yamato was never (to my knowledge) legally released outside of Japan so it would be a Chinese knock off copy. Overall I would highly recommend this movie as a must see for anime fans. However, Starblazers fans seem to tear it apart (I am not sure why it is a decent movie!).

Christian's character is definitely fifty shades of messed up and I was always amazed Ana was able to walk half the time.You get to know Ana and Christian much better in the second and third book and it gave you a understanding of why Christian is the way he is.  I would definitely recommend that my friends that haven't read the books to read them and to keep an open mind through the first book because the second and third were much better.

044661758X|3.0|\\"The Concrete Blonde\\" is my second Michael Connely's book and my first Harry Bosch series book. My first Michael Connely's book was \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\". \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" is good but not as good as \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\". The book revolves around a court case filed by a widow whose husband, supposedly the serial killer Dollmaker, was shot by Harry four years back, alleging that Harry killed wrong the person.<br /><br />Based on book's summary, I expected the focus of the book focus would be the serial killer, but the focus of the book turned out to be the court case on Harry. I was not hooked to the book may be because of my different expectation. I will take a temporary break from Connely's book and explore some non-fiction books for a change, but I plan to return and read Connely's books such as \\"The Last Coyonte\\" and \\"The Poet\\".<br /><br />Happy reading !!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this series after my inlaws urged me to, and my sister telling me it was a horrible smutty dirty book. (My sister has not read it.)<br />1.) the media hypes up the sex, there is much more sex in Virginia Henely's books, especially \\"Enslaved\\" What is more shocking to me is the back story, and there is a beautiful back story. Maybe I feel like this because I am a foster mom, and have seen the effects of bad, abusive parenting. Which is more shocking, its America's dirty little secret, that people ignore, and turn away so they don't have to face whats going on in our own backyard.<br /><br />2.) What romance book doesn't have a reference to \\"throbbing manhood\\" or an over stated penis. What romance novel has a normal penis? Its FICTION, its not suppose to be real, its supposed be fantasy. Who wants to read a romance novel about joe schmoe with an average hose, and smaller bank account? That's everyone's reality. When I want to read a romance novel, its because for those brief few hours I can lose myself in a story, become entwined in the characters, and route for them or against them. To get a way from reality. its fiction not an autobiographical tale. I just hate when people read fiction and say \\"that is not real at all, that's fantasy.\\" Well yes, that's the point, its fiction, its not reality, there is no Hogwarts, there is no were-wolfs, there is no Lord of the Rings, but yet these were all great stories, that came out of someone's imagination.<br /><br />Honestly who wouldn't want to be swept off their feet by a billionaire and taken care of?

B004LWZWGA|4.0|The third and (supposedly) final of Christopher Nolan's Batman films ends on a rising note.  This film is quite long at two hours and forty-four minutes, but is hardly lethargic; it takes that length of time to address the many plot threads left dangling from \\"The Dark Knight,\\" as well as introduce a number of new characters.<br /><br />These new characters are culled from the comic book's past; for the uninitiated, they work quite well on their own, whereas Batman devotees will feverishly compare them to their preconceptions of the way they remember them.  This film avoids most of the pitfalls found in other third acts; while addressing previous installments, this film is not a mere repetition of them.  It develops and expands on established themes, and reaches a strong conclusion.<br /><br />Set eight years after \\"The Dark Knight,\\" \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" finds Bruce Wayne a hobbled recluse, shut off from the world due to regrets about his past.  The appearance of the cunning thug Bane, as well as the cynical thief Selina Kyle forces Wayne out of retirement and into a final reckoning with events established in the past two films.<br /><br />Like Selina Kyle, director Christopher Nolan steals from the best - in this case, the Charles Dickens classic \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"  \\"Rises\\" even copies the convoluted moral about class struggle in Dickens book: the working class is oppressed, and does have legitimate grievances, but for Pete's sake don't let them take over.  Pretty clever; both the ninety-nine percent and the one will feel vindicated.  The ending borrows from Dickens' novel, and if there's any doubt, the ending of the book is read aloud.<br /><br />One humorous problem with the film is Bane's muffled voice.  Speaking behind a tangled breath mask, wheezing like Darth Vader's love-child, Bane is often incomprehensible.  Arguments between Bane and the Dark Knight will have everyone turning up their hearing aid's.  Perhaps it is Nolan's act of defiance against viewers who complained about Batman's gruffly-garbled verbiage.<br /><br />And what's a trilogy without completion of a thematic circle?  Wayne/Batman must escape a pit which is strongly reminiscent of the well he fell into as a child in \\"Batman Begins.\\"  Schmaltzy perhaps, but it works.  So does the film.iewers who complained about Batman's gruffly-garbled verbiage.<br /><br />And what's a trilogy without completion of a thematic circle?

1401235166|4.0|First things first, if you haven't read the previous volumes then this one isn't a good place to start. It's not impossible to catch up with what you might have missed, but if you aren't aware of certain recent happenings then you'll be left a little lost at times.<br /><br />That said, this was a decent enough volume. It just wasn't great. The artwork is the obvious strong point of the volume and is why I awarded it 4 stars instead of 3. A good many authors contributed in this volume and as such, you get a wide variety of styles, particularly in the last few chapters. The short with the porcupine had to be my favorite and I keep flipping back to it in order to view the gorgeous artwork and colors. Everything in the porcupine short was pretty much perfectly done. Artwork-wise, this is a five.<br /><br />Story-wise, this was just OK. We do get a little progression with the discovery of the new North Wind and more foreshadowing of the other aspects of Ozma's prediction, but much of this is spent treading water and building up to the next big arc. Since this is Willingham the read is still a good one, but it sort of reminded me how long this series has been and that it's still far from over. The story here is solidly a three.<br /><br />Collectors of the series will snap this up regardless, but if you're one of those people who sort of slowly lost interest in the series as a whole (great artwork or no) then this probably won't be the volume that brings you back.

030758836X|4.0|Nick and Amy Dunne were both writers living in New York City, when the economy cost both of them their jobs, and then the couple moved back to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, Missouri, to help care for his dying mother. A born and bred New Yorker, she has to leave her parents, happily married psychologists who created a famous children's book series about Amy called Amazing Amy. The transition is tough for Amy, who doesn't find a job and finds it difficult to make friends, but she is supportive of Nick's buying a bar with his twin sister, Margo (aka \\"Go\\"). And even though their marriage hits occasional rough patches, they are making plans to celebrate their fifth anniversary.<br /><br />That afternoon, Amy disappears, and their home bears signs of a dangerous struggle. Nick cannot figure out what happened to his wife, although his interactions with the police and the media lead people to begin questioning his innocence. And Amy's diary paints an interesting picture of an increasingly difficult relationship. But as the clues mount and the surprises continue to be revealed, there is so much more to this relationship--and Amy's disappearance--than meets the eye. (And that's all I'll say for fear of revealing any crucial plot elements.)<br /><br />Gone Girl has been nearly universally hailed as a fantastic book, the one sure to launch Gillian Flynn's career into the stratosphere. (Her second novel, Sharp Objects was a best-seller.) I enjoyed this, but not nearly as much as others have. I flew through the first 200 pages and I had no idea what to expect, and then when the plot twists began to unfold, I found it more and more difficult to remain invested. It's a challenge to love a book in which many of the characters are so unsympathetic, but Flynn really is a terrific writer. (If you've never read her earlier books, Dark Places and Sharp Objects, they're both unmistakably creepy and well-written.)
0312576463|3.0|Of course we need children in the world, but we also need a world for our children. Does Franzen, though, think humankind worth saving? Dialogue is his forte - could be he's a playwright or screenplay-writer manqué - but humour is what he chiefly lacks or is at least here concerned to hide (I haven't read his others). On the other hand I *would* say he displays a markedly feminist side - his 'lovable'(p509) but ballbreakingly boring male lead evocative of women's magazines of yore (but all his males are boring and/or unconvincing), his women's angst altogether more credible - were it not for the novel's unremitting phallocentricity<br /><br />Plot-driven page-turner it may be, but beach reads don't come much more depressing than this; absurdity, futility and sheer rankness lurk just below the surface - but Franzen wants there to be a solution, bless him, or he believes one should keep trying. This is no doubt a necessary read if only for the spectacle of Franzen wrestling - very, very slowly - with his material. Unfortunately there's a passel of artifice in Franzen's supposed naturalism. What we excuse in Shakespeare is less tolerable these days, and anyway the execution's dire - I pick away at it in my longer review of the hardback; my third star is really for the effort the reader must put in, that s/he not feel s/he has entirely wasted her/his time. It should of course have been scrapped, but unfortunately this now fifty-some wunderkind could not afford to let ten years' labour go. (Something tells me Franzen is childless - and, I suspect, lonely? This is hollow at the core)<br /><br />[Who then will speak up for childlessness? Those who have had their family will be accused of having had their cake and wishing to deny others, those who suit their actions admirably to their words dismissed as shrivelled selfish (selfish!) envy-driven party poopers. But this is the topic par excellence, the one that isn't going to go away. We all need hope. Maybe if world population were to turn that corner and actually start declining, childlessness could become associated with hope (negative growth was never going to be a rallying cry; more land might be) but as long as we have free movement of peoples (the other elephant in the room) it ain't gonna happen]<br /><br />The critics? They too had a lot riding on this. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry that among n+1's four 'responses' (Number Ten) there was not one dissenting voice - does esprit de corps come any finer? (Symposium? More like a love-in! But it must have been their respectful chorus that, siren-like, ensnared me.) Thank heaven for the plurality of voices Amazon affords; I have managed to review this, excuse me, clunker, this major major disappointment, this soggy cardboard soap-cum-tract, this ugly, misconceived, misshapen object four times, four ways, two of them on amazon.co.uk - my very own symposium, in fact! Want a beach read that also qualifies as literature and will leave you time for that all-important game of volleyball with the kids? A Visit from the Goon Squad isn't half bad
0061692042|5.0|\\"First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later.\\"<br /><br />With those words, Richard Ford's weighty but superb new book, Canada, begins. Fifteen-year-old Dell Parsons, and his twin sister, Berner, are living in Great Falls, Montana, in 1960. Their father, Bev, was an affable Air Force pilot with ambition and dreams that were as wide-open as his personality, while their mother, Neeva, is his complete opposite: intelligent, sarcastic, fiercely devoted to hoping her children have a better life than the one she felt forced into. After Bev leaves the Air Force, he bounces from job to job, and finds himself embroiled in criminal scheme after criminal scheme, although he considers himself more of a middleman than a criminal. And when one scheme goes awry, Bev and Neeva decide to rob a bank in a small North Dakota town. Of course, their seemingly foolproof plan doesn't work out in the end, and the two are arrested, leaving Dell and Berner alone.<br /><br />After Berner runs away rather than face the prospects ahead of her, Dell is spirited away by a friend of his mother's to a drab, prairie town in Saskatchewan, across the Canadian border. There Dell becomes the ward (of sorts) of Arthur Remlinger, an enigmatic, moody, and quirky American who owns a run-down hotel. While Dell tries to figure out what his life will become in Canada, and hopes that Remlinger will be the key to a brighter future, he starts to realize that Remlinger, much like his parents, is not the person he thinks he is. And as Dell is used as a pawn in Remlinger's efforts to protect himself, it is another moment that sets Dell on a path toward a life different than the one he imagined for himself, one in which he realizes he is the only person he can count on.<br /><br />Like the Montana and Saskatchewan landscapes in the book, Canada is a bleak story. But while you know from the very first lines of the book about the bank robbery and murders that will take place, Richard Ford unfurls the plot little by little. This is a very introspective story, as Dell is disappointed by those in whom he puts his faith and trust, but it is ultimately hopeful as well, because he is able to take these life-changing moments in stride. Ford is a fantastic storyteller and no stranger to books in which the main character is faced with crisis after crisis, yet Canada is never a chore to read. I found myself marveling at Ford's language and wondering exactly how he would tie all of the ends of his story together. The book has a lot of weight (and it is about 450 pages) but it is both compelling and well-written.
044042321X|5.0|The art work is first rate; every frame is filled with interesting background and nuance.  Tyrion has always seemed to me a most heroic character so I was pleased to see how the artist gave him some physical attributes to match his mental toughness.<br />  At each shift in media, the author has refined the story line and better developed the main characters.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|Dexter and Kate Moore seem like your typical Washington, D.C. couple--Dexter works in banking (although Kate can't exactly explain what he does) and Kate writes position papers for a think tank. They're raising two small boys, although Dexter isn't home nearly as much as Kate would like him to be. And then one day Dexter gets a can't-refuse job offer in Luxembourg, so Kate quits her job and readies for her family's new adventure.<br /><br />The thing is, Kate isn't just another expat housewife. She has been keeping some pretty serious secrets from Dexter. And as Dexter gets more and more immersed in his mysterious job, and Kate meets another American couple she doesn't quite trust, she realizes that she's not the only one who has been keeping secrets. But are her suspicions correct? Is it her past that is being investigated, or something else? What will happen, to her marriage, her family, and her life, when all is revealed? Can she solve the mystery that seems to have engulfed their lives before she loses control of the situation?<br /><br />I found The Expats to be an entertaining read. I like the way Chris Pavone peeled back the layers of Kate's life and she started discovering all of the untruths around her. My main criticism of the book, however, is that it took a long time for the plot to really get going, and the setup--which tended to move from time to time, place to place--was a bit confusing. Kate is a fascinating character--more so than the other main characters--and I wonder if Pavone's somewhat-vague ending leaves the door open to further adventures for the Moores. This is definitely enjoyable, although it left me wanting a bit more.
0812974611|5.0|I visited the town of Herculaneum some twenty-five years ago, saw the devastation caused by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius one August day in A.D. 79, and wondered what it was like during that horrible time.  After reading this novel, I wondered no longer, thanks to Robert Harris's careful research and vivid portrayal of Pompeii's citizenry.  The novel starts out slowly but tension keeps building all the way to the end with many clues of the impending disaster:  sulfur in the water, the trembling earth and unusual increases of temperature on the ground.  The  protagonist is a water engineer named Attilius, responsible for the operation and maintenance of the region's aqueduct, with the job title of Aquarius.  I liked that literary touch (I'm a computer & communications engineer).  Altogether a most excellent literary and historical reading experience.

0802798225|3.0|Reviewed by Suzanne & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog<br /><br />Brittany Ellis is perfect. She has the perfect boyfriend, the perfect house, the perfect appearance, perfect everything. Or at least that what she makes people believe but with a disabled sister at home that only she seems to care about, a boyfriend who only seems to want to get in her panties and constant criticism from her parents, she doesn't feel so perfect on the inside, and things start to crumble when she is assigned to be lab partners in Chemistry with Alex Fuentes. Alex Fuentes doesn't try and hide his imperfections, with a scary reputation and part of the Latino Blood gang everyone thinks he is a thug, but with his mother and two younger brothers to take care of he does what he has to so they can do what they want. As Alex and Brittany see beneath the masks they present to the world the attraction grows, but will it be enough or are their worlds just too different?<br /><br />I have heard a lot of good things about this book and this series and although I am not a fan of YA, especially when romance is involved, I decided to give this book a go. Maybe it was all the hype and expectations I had, but when reading I kept thinking \\"what's all the fuss about?\\" because although I thought it was okay, I don't think I would ever rhapsodise about it.<br /><br />But I did enjoy it and I think it had some really great and heart wrenching moments in it. I liked Alex, he had the smouldering bad boy with a heart of gold thing going on; he tries to do right by his family and those he loves with the limited choices he has. Brittany...sometimes I would like her, the moments between her and her sister were really beautiful other times she just annoyed the crap out of me. Together...I just never saw the \\"perfect chemistry\\" Brittany always seemed to be trying to change him by manipulating him, some of which I understand, he was in a gang after all, and Alex seemed more concerned with how amazing her body was, again I understand he was an 18 year old guy after all! But, I still didn't feel it.<br /><br />This review is coming out a bit more negatively then I meant it to, but it just didn't click for me it was a but cliche, the characters although interesting and did have real depth, just didn't seem to fit as perfectly as I expected and it was all tied up a little too neatly at the end., again I understand he was an 18 year old guy after all!

034580404X|3.0|I am still in the process of reading. I am on the second book of the trilogy.  Good so far.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|First of all, I was never big on comics, just the movies/shows based on them. So, by all standards, this movie is a mildly interesting bit of entertainment and it can be fine for those who are a hundred percent familiar with it. Besides, the teeny quotes from \\"Toy Story\\" (\\"To Infinity and Beyond!\\") and \\"He-Man\\" (\\"By the Power of Gray Skull!\\") were a great laugh!<br />Secondly, it seems Amazon claims there are deleted scenes, but the only Special Features are a preview for comics I want no part of and a preview for a show that, on the one hand, gives me delight that Bruce Timm is still active, but, on the other hand, is of no use to me until it, like the movie, is in a physical format (in this time's case, either DVD or BLU-Ray disc) of video one can shelf like a hardcover book or paperback ready to be picked up and put to use.<br />Somehow, I doubt there was any lying, just sloppiness. However, I don't like much of this extortion of \\"Get this, if you want something more than a movie that's not technically musical, like deleted scenes, but if you want a modest purchase, get something with just the movie itself, even though it's the primary cause and no other effects will be given\\" and the digital copy discs can sometimes seem like a waist of plastic what with Amazon Unbox/MP3 or iTunes, unless it's arranged like HAPPY FEET TWO DVD or that Combo Pack for CAPTAIN AMERICA, something I bought with this one. To the point: Why isn't there a modest single-disc edition of GREEN LANTERN with something official and brief like deleted scenes?!?!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Gave this a chance and really enjoyed it.  Great concept and super well written.  Each story faded into the next so I am really grateful that I had the Omnibus edition!  Going to have to read some more of this author!

B007MDB71O|4.0|The first 'adult' books I read as a child were Edgar Rice Burrough's adventures of John Carter on Mars in hardcover editions that belonged to my father. My 11 year old self was fascinated by the adventures of the post Civil War Confederate soldier on the red planet that transcended space and time. So like many pre-adolescent fans of the books, I was pleased that John Carter was coming to the screen after many false starts over the hundred year history of the books original publication.  To prepare for the release of the fllm, I reread the first few of the books in the series. Time and my own maturity did not make the books age well to my eyes. The writing was awful. The dialogue was Victorian and stiff. The dated morality almost laughable. Racism and sexism, though taken for granted in the 1910's, was disturbing.  I  understood that the books reflected the early 20th century age it was written in. 'A Princess of Mars', the first John Carter book, was written  in 1911 and published in a pulp magazine in 1912 with the title 'Under the Moons of Mars'.<br /><br /> The books were written by a man who failed at every endeaver he ever tried. Burroughs grew up in the latter part of the 19th Century. His social and cultural outlook was painfully Victorian and he knew nothing of Mars nor of science, but he knew how to spin a good yarn that captured the imagination of young boys.<br /><br /> After reading the first 3 books again, I realized why the books had never made it to the screen. It was not only a matter of the need for the art of the motion picture to develop believable CGI  but also how to change the book to appeal to modern senses and culture. How to you film a book that was terribly written but which captures the appeal of it by generations of horny adolescents. So the director and writers altered the story of John Carter and hoped for the best. In my judgement, they succeeded.<br /><br /> 'John Carter the Movie'  loosely follows Burrough's 'A Princess of Mars'. Weare introduced to John Carter via the same method that Burroughs introduced him to his readers - through a story framing device. Burroughs inserts himself into the story as the nephew of the mysterious John Carter who has amassed a small fortune and dies in the mid-1880's. His uncle leaves instructions to his young nephew to follow his burial wishes exactly - to entomb his body in a mausoleum  that can only be opened from the inside. John Carter also leaves a journal of his astounding adventures for the young Burroughs to read. This story framing device was also used successful by Burroughs in his other great adventure series, the Tarzan books.<br /><br /> Th framing device of storytelling is as compelling as it was in the original book though the plot has been altered from the start to fit a more modern and more  believable  interpretation of  the Therns (the movie's villians). No longer are the Therns the bald priestly white race of Mars. They may not even be from Mars. More story alterations follow.<br /><br /> No longer does John Carter simply raises his arms to Mars in the Arizona desert and get magically teleported. He discovered a teleportation device instead.  No longer is he a confederate soldier searching for gold with a partner being chased by Apaches. He is escaping from the custody of US soldiers who stupidly shoot at a band of indians causing them to attack. A back story involving Carter's family is added to provide clearer character motivation for his subsequent actions.<br /><br /> The film was doomed to fail at the box office no matter what. Fans would see a different story then their memories.  Movie goers would watch it and wonder what the fuss was about. It was just another superhero movie with great CGI on a Mars that could not possibly exist. (NOTE: I may be incorrect here but I remember that Burroughs plotted John Carter's magical transport to Mars and back to earth and back to Mars again as a trip that transcended both space and time; that Barsoom was a Mars of many thousands of years ago. His Barsoom was not a desert world but a dying world with fields of red grasslands and purple vegetation )<br /><br /> The director, Andrew Stanton, has made a credible effort to bring the essence of Barsoom and the John Carter stories to modern audiences by extensive rewrites to the original story. Just look at who was assigned script writting tasks. Amoung the screenwriters are Michael Chabon and Colin Wilson. Predictably, the film did better overseas then in the U.S. where it was not the money making blockbuster that Disney hoped for. It was a tremendously over budgeted film but in what universe other than the unrealistic expectations of bloated Hollywood studios would a take of $271 million be considered a flop?<br /><br /> This is actually a good film, no better and no worse that then the parade of other summer extravaganzas that the movie going public is subjected to. It is worth your time to see it.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I originally stumbled upon some information that lead me to want to read Pressfield's book \\"Turning Pro\\", and upon seeking that title, found out that it (\\"Turning Pro\\") was actually the sequel to this book. Not being one for reading stories, or seeing movies, what have you, out of sequence, I had to read \\"The War of Art\\" first. Not only was it my first experience using an e-reader app (which I did enjoy, despite my predisposition), I found \\"The War of Art\\" to be an excellent read.<br /><br />Pressfield goes about summing up the emotions that every creative-type individual experiences, especially when one is feeling stagnant. Truth be told, as Pressfield summarizes, most of you out there who feel you should be doing something with your God given talents, ARE NOT DOING IT. He breaks down your laziness into a series of worthless excuses, grabs you by the scruff of your shirt, and kicks you in the @$$, hopefully sending your lethargic butt careening into the chair, typing, sketching, or whatever else it is you should be doing.<br /><br />Fortunately for me, I discovered that I have already been on the right path, doing my work diligently, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy the book. It's a quick read, and I couldn't tear myself away from it. After I finished, I still went ahead and bought \\"Turning Pro\\", which seemed a bit similar, even sharing some of the same prose of it's predecessor, but never-the-less, I really enjoyed both.<br /><br />If you're feeling like you should be working on an artistic endeavor or pet project, but you keep putting it off until tomorrow, I highly suggest reading this book, and probably the other one. I guarantee, you won't regret the purchase, and hopefully, it'll do exactly what it was meant to, and you'll get off your lazy behind and do something with yourself!!!<br /><br />I hope this helps.  ;)
B002N57KG2|4.0|Cannonball Run is a comedy action film featuring a host of superstars such as Burt Reynolds as JJ, Roger Moore who plays the role of a man who behaves like a James Bond. Also it must be noted that this film is one of the early appearances of Hong Kong-based action star Jackie Chan, who at that time was a rising star among Asian movie fans but yet unknown to Hollywood. It is based on the real cross-country race and what's funny is that the each team has its own strategy to deal with law enforcement officers. Jackie Chan is supposed to be an Japanese driver equipped with high-tech Subaru vehicle which might have given the inspiration to Knight Rider series. But strangely enough he speaks Cantonese and showcases his kanfu techniques. In American films Asian actors often play the role of characters different from the country of their decent. Japanese-Americans often play the role of Chinese the most notable case of which is Tamlyn Tomita. Hong Kong viewers might not be happy for Chan being changed to Japanese. While Japanese viewers enjoyed it as a practical joke.<br /><br />Verdict: Waste of talents? Maybe. But it's funny.<br />Rating: 80 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Fans of car action films and 80s films.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|as with everyone of Vin's movies I have seen they're great and this one is no different.lots of action and fighting(which is one of the best parts) the cars are the next best thing.

I will be awaiting the next great movie with the cast, they all are good in my opinion.

He's having a lot of fun with it.<br /><br />Great quality, too.  This Beyblade doesn't look or feel cheap at all.  The metal part is smooth and has no rough edges, and it's strong, i.e., not thin or flimsy.  The Beyblade and the launcher arrived in tact and in perfect condition.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|You know, without all the sex, lip biting, blushing, and overuse of \\"beguiling\\" and \\"oh my\\" it might've been a good short story!  Actually I did like the story part of the book, i was intrigued to find out how this man could be like this, so I am reading the second book.  I'm interested, i want to know if she changes him, if she gets what she wants, etc.  However, reading this about 30% of the way in i saw the obnoxious similarities to twilight.  It really is twilight porno with no vamps.  instead of an Indian suitor who the female character is interested in, we have a Mexican.  Our star is good at everything, and wealthy, and incredibly smart, good looking, tall, and dark haired.  our female is clumsy and inscure. she has a strange arrangement with mom and step-dad including living with step-Dad for the latter part of her teen years.  Mom has recently remarried.  She drives a run down car, and he showers her with gifts.  he warns her he's no good, tells her to stay away, yet she is drawn by some \\"electrifying chemistry\\"  Ladies and gents, if you want to read the porno non vamp version of Twilight THIS IS YOUR BOOK.  Now, in all honesty, it is not well written, much like Twilight, but the story is so compelling, yet, since I have read the Twilight series, I feel relatively confident that I can predict the outcome.  Well, that was a ramble, and please excuse my poor grammar.  it is not the page turner of the century, but it is intriguing.  you decide.

I used it professionally for small business vids and it pulled its weight.  Then, it just took its ball and went home.  It stopped working so I thought for sure it was the battery.  So i replaced it, it didn't work.

0061726834|5.0|Delirium was a very interesting science fiction book. The premise is that in a future U.S, love is called a disease, and at the age of eighteen, everyone has an operation to get rid of love (basically, their desire.) It sort of reminded me of Uglies, (though I haven't actually read it), in that there's a required procedure to fix a perceived problem. The main character, Lena, is looking forward to her procedure, to being disease free. But everything changes when she meets Alex. And of course, she falls in love with him. (Also her best friend Hana has been going to illegal parties.) The United States has been closed off from other countries; I kind of wished that Oliver went into what was happening in the rest of the world. But I guess the main characters can't know about that.<br /><br />Delirium is one of those books about how valuable something is when it is forbidden. And the love that is removed during the operation is really the desire for life and happiness (though the government says the operation is to make you happier and more secure). You get matched up with a spouse, and have children, but you can't love either them. You can't love literature or music or relatives, or anything anymore. Life is flat. A nightmare, huh? Throughout the book, Lena suddenly comes to realize that everything she's been told by the administration (in the Book of Shhh) is a lie, a blatant lie, a network of lies. Of course, she has had experience with love; her mother could never be cured. But it's all suddenly quite immediate.<br /><br />Delirium is obviously a YA romance as well. It was quite engaging; I had difficulty putting it down once I started it. And of course, it ends on a cliff-hanger. There is a sequel, Pandemonium, which I look forward to reading.<br /><br />You can read all of my reviews at my book blog, novareviews.blogspot.com.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I am excited about getting my copy of The Lorax movie out on DVD.  I am a huge fan of Dr. Seuss and have been since I was a child.  I have The Lorax tattooed on my leg so you get the idea.  I went into the theatre understanding that obviously to make the book into a movie that the actual story, that most of us are used to, would need to be expanded on.  Knowing that I went in excited to watch the movie and watch how The Lorax story was adapted to be on the big screen.  I loved the story.  The Lorax with Danny Devito as the voice was a great choice.  I also thought that the two children characters (Ted and Audrey) was a fun was of honoring Dr. Seuss and his wife.  The basic story was still in the movie and I found myself saying the lines that came from the book because I know them by heart.  All in all my husband and two children and myself truly enjoyed the movie and we are excited to receive our own copy for home use.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read some of the other reviews, and I tend to agree that there are some editing errors.<br /><br />However, if you look past that, this book is yet another good read in the trilogy.  In fact, I think it was better than the first one ONLY because the Cliffhanger is not as daunting.  The author left us with a good idea of who the culprit will be in the beginning of the 3rd book.<br /><br />Gradually, Christian is learning what it feels like to be loved. Yet he is envisioned as oh so hot and sexy.  I am thinking that this would be more a ladies book, ALTHOUGH it could be either or, especially if you are aiming to please your significant other.  There are a few tips that many men can take from Christian Grey (personal opinion), aside from his dark past. Compound his kinky sex life with the love, and nurturing from Anastasia that has been instilled upon him, and he makes for one Romantic Christian Grey (personal opinion).<br /><br />Without giving the story away, I think that \\"Darker\\" in the title doesn't necessarily reflect upon Christian, but a particular Ghost(s) from his past, and perhaps a certain someone that is Anastasia's higher-up at the company that she works for.<br /><br />Christian Grey is everything Anastasia hoped for and vice-versa, and I suggest reading to find all the surprises these companions have in store for each other throughout the book, amidst the conflicts that take place within the book.<br /><br />I loved the book, and I can't wait to get lost in Fifty Shades Freed.  Thank you E.L. James!
0756405890|2.0|So I've never written a book review before, but I felt compelled to because there must be others like me who have always loved fantasy and was hoping this book would renew my sense of wonder. Based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this book, you'd think this would have done it for me.<br /><br />However, I agree with all the negative reviews here that touch upon the mediocre writing, the horribly anachronistic dialogue (which uses presentday slang and refernces), and healthy doses of melodramatic hyperbole.<br /><br />And that's not even touching on the story elements. Sure, parts of the story are intriguing (The Chandrian are a very unique anatagonist), but the book is definitely full of filler. And not the good kind of filler in terms of side quests or anything like that. Also, when logic would have it that Kvothe should act a certain way but doesn't, the author explains away the plotholes with statements akin to \\"oh, if you think it would have made more sense to done so and so instead, then you just wouldn't understand why I didn't.\\" It was an annoying way to keep the story going in parts where you're scratching your head.<br /><br />This is not to take away from the 800 or so people who gave this glowing reviews. But, I want to say, this book is probably geared toward younger and/or lighter readers. I may have loved this book when I was 12 years old. Nothing wrong with that, the author has found his audience.

B005LAIH54|1.0|This movie creators just wanted to add a second movie to the first one, just because. It wasn't a good idea at all! They totally bombed on this one!<br /><br />The first one \\"Clash of the Titans\\" was good and well-made, but this one had a fading plot, HORRIBLE acting, and a never ending story.<br /><br />They should have just ended the first one the way it was and not have added a second one like this, because it was a waste of money, time, and just energy of everyone who helped make it and everyone watching it.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Dark Roots of Earth sees Testament diving quite a bit back into the classic musical stylings of their first 5 records while blending that most beautifully with their more crushing & heavier sounds of 2008's Formation of Damnation. The things that will stick out almost immediately is the more melodic nature of the album which sees powerhouse vocalist Chuck Billy delivering possibly the best & most well rounded performance of his career. Fans who were put off by the dips into guttural vocal stylings displayed on 1997's Demonic and 1999's brilliant The Gathering will really dig what Chuck brought to the table on this release. But don't worry about the band losing some heaviness, this release is truly a head crusher.<br /><br />One of the big changes is how much more lead guitarist Alex Skolnick was involved in the songwriting on this release versus the last. While Formation of Damnation was mostly rhythm guitarist Eric Peterson's show, this is much more of a true collaboration between the two. Eric even steps out a lot more on this album with some great lead work too. Greg Christian's bass gets a bit buried at times but still rumbles most pleasingly for the most part. Gene \\"The Atomic Clock\\" Hoglan's drumming is amazing and technically brilliant as always.<br /><br />What I really love about this album is the sheer variety on it versus the last. There's truly something for everybody on this release. I've been a Testament fan since the beginning and I like all of their albums but there's a sense of purpose & drive on Dark Roots of Earth that is truly infectious. I truly believe that when end of the year metal awards are given out that this release will garner quite a few nominations and wins. It's truly that great. Testament have never been better than they are right now at this very moment. How cool is that considering they celebrate 25 years now since the release of their debut release The Legacy in 1987.!<br /><br />I should mention that I bought the CD/DVD deluxe edition which contains 3 bonus cover songs in addition to an extended version of the track Throne of Thorns. The bonus DVD has a very cool half hour making of the album featurette along with a 20 minute live club performances and Eric & Alex walking through their gear setups. Well worth the few extra dollars!ition which contains 3 bonus cover songs in addition to an extended version of the track Throne of Thorns.

B008EQIK90|5.0|Very well done. Great fun. I liked the original 21 Jump Street and it's a good thing that I knew that this movie was going to be nothing like that.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|I don't know what it is about this guy. He's refreshing. If someone were to ask me if he had a good voice, I would say no. HOWEVER, if someone were to ask me if his voice was good for his music, I would say unequivocally, yes. His voice just works. It's soothing and alluring at the same time, and coupled with his colorful and outlandish lyrics, it makes for great listening. Both his quiet jams and his party anthems are wonderful. I love this whole album. I've listened to it like 800 times, give or take a few.
B0086700CM|5.0|i like this and so do my kids. they think it is fun to jump in the water or crash into the trees.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wasn't really interested after reading the synopsis but starting getting a little curious with all the hype.  Then read the more realistic and genuine-sounding of the reader reviews...thank you, thank you, thank you.  I HATE wasting money on over-hyped books.  I wonder how many of these over-the-top reviews were real or just part of the hype machine?
B00026WU7I|5.0|This is a great album. Even if you do not think you like Bob Dylan, buy this album. Lyrically, it is a masterpiece.

B003E8P9G0|3.0|Well, as much as I loved this book, it was just, well, BAD. I knew Rick could do better and this was just his worst book. It was good though.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|Two PS2 era classics bundled together!? What more do you want? These are both amazingly atmospheric and unique experiences, made to look even better in HD here on the PS3. For more information on each game individually I would recommend visiting the specific game's pages but suffice to say, they were very well received critically, and personally, both stand out as defining experiences on the console. This collection makes them look and sound sharp, enhances existing details while maintaining a lot of the classic effects both games have. Get this one today, even if you had them on PS2, these are worth re playing!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great layout. Very easy to use. Keys are easy to touch with the finger top. This game has great response.
B007SGM084|1.0|Everyone & their mother was talking about this series so I thought I'd try it out. What a waste of time! First of all it was over $18 for the kindle trilogy, holy moly that's expensive. I breezed though these 3, they're super easy read, but they could have made this into 1 book, it just drags out on & on. The characters have no substance & they're kind of annoying, especially Ana's inner goddess, ugh I wanted to strangle her. It seems as though the author had to google definitions of S&M, contracts, & toys. Then she tends to get lazy & I think she just started copying & pasting things she'd written previously. For example: \\"his skilled hands,\\" \\"he cocked his head to the side,\\" \\"Ana bit her lip\\" seriously count how many times she says that. I don't know what all the hype is about, its a \\"smut\\" novel but its not even that risque or good, the sex isn't any big deal. Stupid, waste of time, expensive, lame. If you still want to read it, borrow a friends copy or get it from the library, don't waste your money!
B005MMYC7I|4.0|I absolutely loved Spartacus Blood and Sand and watching Gods of the Arena I really enjoyed watching how it all started but there was still something lacking in this that I couldn't put my finger on. It is enjoyable to watch, I loved it from beginning to end but I liked Blood & Sand a lot more.
1451648537|5.0|Great book about a man with a great story.  As one reader noted it may not have all the facts about every minute of Steve Job's life but it really didn't need it.  Instead Isaacson got me engaged by telling a great story as a whole through a series of smaller but well organized ones.<br /><br />I always read the headlines about how controlling Steve was, stories of his temper, and Apple and Pixar's great rise.  Isaacson creative writing not only showed but makes you feel some of struggles Steve went through, both from Steve's perspective and those around him.  In the end I think Steve's reason agreed/wanted to do the book was fulfilled wonderfully.<br /><br />I started the book thinking I would get to know more about an iconic figure's life but ended up believing I understand him a little better.  Enough to empathize and maybe begin to understand the love and passion he had.  Yes by his own admission Steve was no saint and from what I can tell he made no attempts to hide it.  Here is a life filled with demons, and \\"broken glass\\" with plenty of examples not to like him; but in then end you have to a least respect if not admire Steve's passion.  But the book did more, in the end, I saddened by Steve's passing as I would a good friend.<br /><br />Thanks Walter for letting us see the Human Being behind the Iconic Figure.
B000O5B5FK|4.0|This CD is the heaviest the band with a strong guitar from the beginning to the end of the album. It is a more prog-heavy than any other style. It is much less introspective than other CDs Porcupine Tree and also without much cloudiness characteristic of the band. The marked variations in other CDs is not seen with intensity in this album. The songs are well done and there is only one change, changes in an alternative band that ever was in the stillness. Very good!
B0063GORYU|5.0|easy to pick up and play. it's great that there's a definite strategy to winning, it takes time, it entertains, and rarely if ever does random chance prevent you from solving a game. so far, out of dozens of plays, I haven't lost yet, but I don't feel like it's too easy. you definitely earn your win.
B000A6EXNO|1.0|This rubber eyecup is simply too flimsy to be functional. Luckily I was able to read another reviewer's take on the Hoodman eyecup. I had an old Hoodman 22S eyecup laying around from my Nikon D200. Removed the rubber eyecup from that square plastic frame. Voila! The portal was round not square. Was able to place it around my Nikon DK-17M and use this setup on my Nikon D700. A tight fit but far more useful than the DK-19 and did not cost me an extra cent. Who says photographers aren't creative? Re-purposing has saved me a bundle over the years. I know from experience that the Hoodman eyecup rubber provides a very tight light blocking seal. I would say the DK-19 is simply not worth the money.

034580404X|4.0|I liked the books okay but felt some of it was predictable...too much from a woman's perspective...Christian got to needy toward book 3.  The second one was my favorite
0446579939|4.0|Okay the reason I bought the book was because the trailer for the movie really got my imagination spinning. I didn't see the movie since I wanted to read the book first. The book is good. Predictable, typical but even still good. The one thing that was different to an extent was how bad the bad guy was lol. And the ending was shocking but a bit cheesy. But for the little I paid for it it was fine :) I am looking forward to renting the movie now.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game for the road.... but gets much harder, still pretty fun and I'm only rating it for the points!
1594135851|5.0|Okay I only read the first hunger games book because I heard so many people talking about it. When I started I understood why. Then I got to the end and I was like how can there be more for the other two books. Was I wrong! The second book picks right back up from the first and I couldn't put it down! As soon as I read the last page of book 2, I ran downstairs to get the third book. This trilogy is one of the best I've ever read and I don't go a day without a book in my hand so that is saying something. :) I would wait till the second movie comes out because the mass media paperback will be out then and might be a bit cheaper. I do have to say I mistakenly received the hardback copy when I purchased the paperback and the hardback was very pretty. Cool black mockingjay stamped onto the cover.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|This movie is not as good as the book, but its worth watching. It does not clearly define the key points of the prophecy and the importance of understanding them. If you watch the movie be sure to read the book.

B0012GMZMW|5.0|Steve Augeri did a great job on this one filling Steve Perry's absent shoes! The show must go on as most of the band did back around 1999-2000! There aren't any clunkers on this one INMOP! Great mix of the rockers & ballads from start to finish here! Standout tracks include Higher Place(great intro. track!), All The Way (Nice ballad/rock mix), Signs of Life(Don't Stop Believinesque with a powerful edge!), All The Things(Nice mid-tempo rocker!), Livin To Do (Neil Schon doing multi-guitar licks all around), World Gone Wild(Kicking/loud!) With Your Love(Very nice ballad & rock mixed/Perryesque track!), Live And Breath(one of the best tracks on this album/great keyboards, bass, guitar, nice drumming/everything on this one!), To Be Alive Again(A fun-filled rocking/Perryesque style track with awesome J. Cain keys throughout!), and We Will Meet Again(excellent guitar/hard-hitting drum/slow keys turning to symphony mixture for this album's ending song)!<br /><br />Overall, this album got mixed reviews when it came out/underrated during the time most Journey fans were unsure how the band would carry on without SP? Bottomline, Arrival delivers a solid punch and has all the band's well-known music elements to continue the Journey! Well-worth getting this one!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this because it has huge numbers and it also has a % . There are a lot of apps for calculators but not many with % and not to mention free!!

0307352145|4.0|Succinctly subtitled: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking.  This book expresses an opinion I think needs to be heard, in a readable way. The most useful part for me was the examination of the terms \\"high reactive\\" and \\"low reactive\\" and what those might mean to different people and in different situations.  It is sometimes an odd mix of scientific interviews and reports on various experiments, mixed with \\"let me tell you what happened to me\\" sort of stories, or human interest bits about this or that client.  Very occasionally interspersed with \\"how to\\" and a few short quizzes of the \\"personality type\\" sort. This is a subject I think we need to continue to consider in our go-go-go world. End notes enlightening and helpful.<br />About me: I'm a middle school/high school librarian<br />How I got this book: I purchased it for the school library
0345525558|5.0|A great pace.  And a great story plus the bonus of learning some new things, too.  Not too soppy altho definitely a chick book -- but a really good one.  Generally I get a bit bored with novel, especially if they are shop worn themes.  But this one delights.
B001GMQALY|5.0|great buy, it arrived on time and looked exactly like the picture on the website. I am still waiting for my husband to return home from his trip to see what he thinks about it.  it always helpful to have a set that you can wear when need one around.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The last half of this book totally redeemed the book as a whole. It was excruciating getting through the first half of this book, very boring!!! Then all of the sudden a very interesting twist started and kept you intrigued enough to finish the book.<br /><br />Worth the price: Absolutely not!<br />Would I recommend: Probably not.<br />Will I read it again: NO
B00701L5XS|5.0|fun app.... I love having this at my fingertips. Animation world awesome. Would suggest to any boy scout.<br />Or boating enthusiast simply to tie up his boat.

B007MNV5WU|1.0|I'm glad that I read recent reviews before I updated this game. Having to reinstall and have ALL your previous progress/levels, etc. wiped out is totally ridiculous. I loved this game, but having to start over from the beginning? I don't think so!!

I do understand they got hammered by the Music co lawyers, but all my mp3 are legal. Its not like amazon is storing a new copy, its called de duplication. They got the hard drive space and its costs them next to nothing.

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I was uncertain how to feel about Haven the first time that I watched it.  I have never been a fan of Stephen King, but something about the show kept drawing me back, and I have to say that by the second or third episode I was completely hooked on the show.  The stories are weird and unusual, although in some cases somewhat predictable.  The show's creators make a valiant effort to throw twists in to keep the viewers on their toes, and for the most part succeed brilliantly.  Part of the draw of the show is the relationships between the three main characters Audrey, Nathan, and Duke (played brilliantly by Rose, Bryant, and Balfour) and the mystery that lies at the heart of Haven - why is Haven afflicted with the troubles, and what connection does Audrey have with the sleepy little town?  As the mystery deepens each week, even side characters are revealed to be deeply involved in Haven's secrets, from Nathan's father the Police Chief, to the two brothers who run the town's newspaper, to the sinister minister who has a mysterious hatred for Nathan which is just as equally reciprocated.  This first season is a wonderful kick-off to the drama and mystery which continues to unfold in the second season, and hopefully well into the third when it premiers in September.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes stories about secrets, lies, mysteries, and the supernatural!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I have a Kindle Fire.  I wanted to give this 5 stars and it should have 5 stars.  The reason I give 4 stars is because you have to stay in the application to listen to the sounds/music.  It would be great to be able to listen while reading.  I can't wait to listen to it tonight at bedtime.  Thank you for such a pleasant application.  :)

1936719010|1.0|from book blogger Margaret Yang of the \\"Writing Slices\\" blog<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure why DO THE WORK is a book. It has about as many words as a longish blog post, arranged in the poorest layout I've ever seen. Each sentence is a different font size, positioned all over the page, with more white space than words. I bought the hardcover book, so it wasn't an ebook formatting problem. This was a deliberate design. Some pages have only one word on them, as if the publisher will do anything to stretch the minimal text into 98 pages, justifying a hardcover print run with a matching price.<br /><br />The entire book is about \\"resistance,\\" in other words, the normal human response to doing a hard task. Pressfield compares this resistance to a dragon who wishes the writer's death. Of course, the bigger the monster, the braver the writer gets to feel. Pressfield imagines writers as \\"heroic knights\\" for doing nothing more than putting pen to paper.<br /><br />Let's get real. If writing is truly that difficult for Pressfield-for anyone-maybe he shouldn't be doing it. Most writers (me included) love to write. Sure, the words flow more easily on some days than others, but overall, we write because we enjoy it.<br /><br />The bulk of DO THE WORK is trite observations like \\"suspend the inner critic\\" and \\"this draft is not being graded.\\" Pressfield's advises writers to make a three-sentence outline of our novels (beginning, middle, end) and then fill in the gaps to have a complete outline. No...really?<br /><br />Pressfield stands in awe of anyone who finishes a novel of any quality. Awe! He likens it to the difficulty of losing forty pounds, kicking crack cocaine, or surviving the loss of a loved one. Writing must be a truly ghastly experience for him if it equals the pain of daily self-denial, drug withdrawal, or acute grief. If it's so bad, why does Pressfield write at all? Nobody is forcing him to. Anyone who finds writing that difficult should maybe find another job. I'm not saying that writing isn't important. It is deeply, deeply meaningful. It takes courage and a lifetime of dedication. But come on! It's not life or death.<br /><br />As for me, I will take the title of the book as an invitation, not a punishment. Do the work? I'd love to. Right after I put this little stack of useless paper into the recycling bin.m not saying that writing isn't important. It is deeply, deeply meaningful.

B001NOQI3U|5.0|I have always loved Barbra Streisand so when I saw Yentyl for the first time, I loved it. I had looked through used tapes at Blockbuster Video for a long time.  My daughter got me a VHS tape for Christmas one year and I was so excited I hugged it.  I love the song \\"papa\\" she sang in the movie because I could relate to it.  It is one of my favorite movies not only due to the relationship she has with her father, but her drive as a person, and as a woman to learn only what jewish men were allowed to study.  I love that she had the guts, the drive, and the ambition to make it.<br /><br />I decided to check on Amazon recently to see if the CD was available and lo and behold..it was.  Oh happy day! I am so thrilled to have it now and can watch it any time I want.
1475212607|4.0|from book blogger Margaret Yang of the WritingSlices blog<br /><br />David Gaughran makes an unusual choice in the introduction to LET'S GET DIGITAL. Most people would start by listing their credentials, but Gaughran admits he has none. He's not a best-selling author. He's not a digital superstar. He's a nobody. And that's a good thing. Because he wants you know something important. Anyone can publish an ebook.<br /><br />LET'S GET DIGITAL is divided into three parts. The first is philosophy. Before we can understand the how, Gaughran says we need to understand the why. He starts by listing the reasons big publishers are in trouble and why print books are in a death spiral. He makes good points, but he also assumes that his readers have zero knowledge of the publishing industry. Most writers have spent years working (or trying to work) within that system and know it well, so this part won't be of much use. Besides, the audience for this book won't need convincing that they should self-publish. They'd just like to know how.<br /><br />The second part is absolutely bursting with useful information. It covers the how-to of editing, covers, formatting, uploading to sales channels, and pricing. Throughout, Gaughran urges writers to produce nothing but their best, and shows them how to do just that. He also covers post-publication work like sales, marketing, and reviews. A lot of this is common sense and the information is widely available all over the internet. However, having it all in one convenient place feels like a gift.<br /><br />Gaughran also discusses how to handle a sales slump. This is somewhat of a taboo subject among indie writers and Gaughran is courageous for tackling it. His advice is mostly of the \\"keep calm and carry on\\" sort, but he also offers a few tricks to goose sales such as a revamped book description and extra promo work. However, the only thing a writer can really do is keep writing. Nothing boosts sales of a book like more books.<br /><br />Part three is inspiration. Thirty-three successful authors tell their own publication stories in short essays. Every author took a slightly different path, but some common themes emerged. Self-publishing wasn't a lifelong dream for these authors. Many of them stumbled across the idea almost accidentally. Many authors also talked about the ease of self-publishing. Turning a finished manuscript into a book really isn't that hard. All of the contributors exceeded their own expectations. Most are doing phenomenally well, seemingly overnight. This last one might be a bit of a downer for people who don't immediately see big sales numbers, but they are called success stories for a reason.<br /><br />The other thing that came up many times, from many authors, is the importance of other people. None of them succeeded alone. They all benefited from the strong indie community that has developed on the blogs, the Kindle boards, and Twitter. Writers have always helped writers by sharing what they know, and it's clear Gaughran has that same generous spirit. The introduction is correct. With the information and inspiration found in LET'S GET DIGITAL, anyone can publish an ebook.

B0088TG252|5.0|One of my favorite movie.  My wife who likes drama enjoyed the movie.  We watched it with our two boys who are often very critical of movies but they enjoyed this one.
B005LAIGRS|1.0|The first 45 minutes was choppy and the story line unsatisfactory<br />I say first 45 minutes because about that time I called it a day and<br />figured myself fortunate that it was a library copy and not $$$$$<br />I also got very tired of Frost's mouth.<br />Why Weston didn't gag him is beyond me. I would have.<br />They just could NOT figure out how the thugs knew where Frost had<br />been taken. They watched him walk into the consulate and all they had to do<br />was set up surveillance but CIA could not figure it out?<br />(((rolls eyes))))))<br />There was so much of that.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Like the title says! Started playing the game and it definitely one to come back to every time I put it down. Very addicting and easy instructions! Just the way I like portable electronic games :)
B005ZUR724|5.0|I love it. you can pick your person and battle a lot of different creatures. it does lag a little bit but varies person to person
B007IXWKUK|1.0|i am so upset that i paid good money for this book.  it is completly awful and boring my inner goddes is falling alseep.  i cant even finish it because its so bad.  terrible horrible boring and bad

B005LAII12|4.0|\\"Ted\\" is a comedy genre film starring Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane.<br /><br />The narrative revolves around the relationship John Bennett (Wahlberg) and his boyhood soft toy Ted (MacFarlane) have maintained into adulthood. A wish by Bennett as a child gave Ted the capacity to actively function like a person.<br /><br />Despite their adult ages Ted and Bennett are still very boyish and are like a couple of teenagers when it comes to their approach to life.<br /><br />They are transfixed by the 1980s and what seemed amazing in childhood is still much the same.<br /><br />No one is safe when it comes to humour in this movie as it is unreservedly directed at mainstream and minority groups.<br /><br />The style of hilarity is often quite crude, and viewers who are inclined towards coarse comedy will feel right at home with this film, smiling from beginning to end.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B007L3BMGA|1.0|One of the worst books I have read in my life. Boring, overated and badly written. I really can not understand what all the hype is about?? Don't waste your time.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|John Green's audience is centered more along the lines of readers who are in the early to mid teens, in the sense of problems that they usually hold. Yet, being someone whom always read books above the average level at a different time frame of life than the young teenager, I can still appreciate his book. An Abundance of Katherines is written with a sense of who am I & what is my mark in this world? Ever since the adolescent time frame evolved into society, there has been a need to conquer the future of yourself at the time. I honestly love this book, for the character begins this odd journey of discovering that there is more to him than his Katherines.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The film opens up by giving us quick and witty introductions of the main characters. For one reason or another, they are opting to go live at the Marigold Hotel in India. They are the first guests of this Indian entrepreneur Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel,) in a Hotel that has more character than convenience. Once in India and over the culture shock, our group start to adapt at different rates. Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) keeps an on-line blog about the events which adds some first person narration to the tale.<br /><br />In India, the scenes switch back and forth to the various guests' activities which intersect at times, similar to many indie movie scripts. During this time we get to know the characters much deeper and see them change in a nation of contrast of old traditions and the modern era. The film touches on the caste system and prearranged marriages which are common themes in Bollywood films also.<br /><br />The acting and script were top notch. The film contain the right amount of comedy, drama, and even romance to make for a delightful tale. Dev Patel, whose acting ability I thought was undeveloped in \\"Slum Dog Millionaire\\" takes it up a notch with this all-star cast. Kudos to Maggie Smith who managed to play a difficult character with perfection.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: 1 quick totally unnecessary f-bomb with an accent, sexual references, minor back nudity.
1612183956|5.0|If Crouch wasn't in the big leagues before, he is now!  Reminiscent of a Rod Serling Twilight Zone episode, this book doesn't let up from the first page to the last.  But, beyond the action and tension, there is a fantastic use of prose throughout the book.  Moments of incredibly good writing that puts Crouch on a plane with King, Koontz and even Ketchum when it comes to exploring the limits of the supernatural.<br /><br />At no point does the story seem so far fetched that you have to back away from in and, in fact, it draws you in deeper with every page.  Seldom do I pick up a book and finish it within twenty-four hours but I kept returning to this book in every spare moment.  Hey, the Olympics are boring to me so what better time to have received this book!<br /><br />While I'm a big Crouch fan and have read everything else he's written, this is, by  far, his best effort yet.  His biggest mistake with this book may be in under selling it in the e-format.  If some of the so called best selling authors out there can get us for $15 for a often mediocre e-book, something of this quality is a steal at the suggested $4.99.  While I got it as a review copy from the Vine program, I wouldn't have regretted for one second paying paperback prices ($7.99) in e-format.  Support of e-authors of this quality is important to keep them writing and if it makes them filthy rich, God bless them.
B004COCPTE|3.0|This is definitely a kids' movie and one that may be difficult for adults to sit through. The animals in the forest not only understand English but are well versed in the laws of physics and automobile operation. The Japanese boss is unmercifully stereo-typed. Animals attack Fraser, who is leading the way to destroy their habitat for the \\"green\\" company he works for, except no one but him sees the animals.<br /><br />Eventually the animals let out a full assault on the humans. Extremely kid friendly as no animal dies in the movie. The message is that companies which claim to be green are not really green. It would be a good movie to watch along with some BP ads. There is some toilet humor. Most of the humor is of the slapstick variety, with maybe one joke aimed at adults.<br /><br />How many Daily Show stars can you identify in cameo roles?
B004SBBDB2|1.0|This cable is not worth the money because it has horrible quality when I use this to hook up my iPad to a Sony HDTV. I would absolutely not recommend this to nybody. I wound up returning it.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|In my opinion, this book is the modern day version of Dale Carnegie's epic How to Win Friends and Influence People. The book is not long, which is a good thing, because the techniques are not overly involved or complicated, but they really work. Instead of bogging the reader down with over-explanations and wordiness for the sake of wordiness, Dreeke delivers a complete and concise guide to building rapport with anyone in a matter of seconds. The best part?... it actually works! I read the book on a recent flight and when I was off the plane, waiting for my bags, was actively engaging complete strangers and using the techniques in the book with (*Borat voice*) great success! There are great exercises at the back of the book which will help you apply the techniques and challenge you. This is definitely a reference book and sits on my shelf alongside the greats like Hadnagy, Cialdini, Bernays, Ekman, and Carnegie.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I bought this on the strength of all the hype and because I enjoyed the sample sent to me. However as the book unfolded it was not to my taste. Sado-masochistic and other practices of sexual control are the order of the day. A certain level of soft pornography is enjoyable but the darkness in Fifty Shades of Grey this left me uneasy. Because of the popularity of this series of books, I wonder what the social ramifications are going to be. More outrageous sexual expectations from men and women. As if there aren't enough. However, if this is your bag, have at it and enjoy, it's well written.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very happy with my app would reccomend this to all of my freinds with a kindle fire.<br />I hope to see some more great apps

B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is fun and also a good stress relievers.  The game freezes up every once in a while and the movie clips take a long time to play.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This is my least favorite of the trilogy.  This book, more than any of the others, was written for those \\"mommy porn\\" readers.  This book progresses much faster than the other two and it appears as if the author was struggling to get the third book written.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love the way that this app works except that it doesn't always work in landscape mode. No complaints aside from that, though!
B003TXSF5C|3.0|The Hawking books I have read are \\"A brief history of time\\" and A briefer history of time\\". I really like both of those books. But for this one, he tries to focus on M-theory in which I think it is very interesting. But he adds a lot of details that I feel a bit boring to read. A lot of philosophy and old thought of believe that are not relate to science. Some how I like only Science but not Philosophy so I do not feel like this book that much.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|This is a great Cd, there is only one song i dislike, but every other song has a long replay value. I'm not even really a SP fan, but I love this CD.
B006RUJST6|3.0|This book was a fine beach read, but I can't at all understand why it gets such rave reviews. It was a cute love story with a few surprise twists, but definitely not the best book I've read even recently let alone of all time. If you are looking for a short, light read and you like romances, then this will do. But I don't really think it's worth the 5-stars.
B004CYKZZA|1.0|The product arrived in a timely manner and the packaging was intact.  My daughter used them one time and complained that they didn't have good range, maybe 10-12 feet.  A couple of days latter I attempted to use them but they were dead.  We left them plugged in for a couple of days to charge the headset battery, but we were unable to turn them on.  For the first time in her life she actually cleaned up and threw the packing away so we are unable to return them to Amazon.  I went to the company's website, but it is in Germany and there doesn't appear to be any warrenty process.  $40 wasted.  If they had worked, I would say the ear cups seem too small.  They are definately \\"on ear\\" headsets not \\"around ear\\".  Wish I could give them a zero.  The product no longer is available from the distributor...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun and interesting. id recommend this for young teens and adults may be difficult for some younger children.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I agree with most, it has some similarities to the relationship of Bella and Edward..but in a different way! The ONLY thing I didn't like about it is how the writer says some of the same phrases repetitively. I will be buying the second and third books soon. :-)
B0086700CM|4.0|it gets kind of buggy the more u play it.... at first its a lot of fun but then it skips so bad u cant even play
B005P1YCNK|5.0|I have read a lot of books on how to better your life and motivate you. This book is simply the best read out there! It should be required reading for all High School students. I am now on my second read. Follow the advice in this book and your life must and will change for the better!
B00846REIS|5.0|One of the BEST book I have read. Can't wait for the second one. You get so into the story, is difficult to put it down. I definitely recommend this book.

0790729636|5.0|I really like this movie the passion that the characters have for what the work for. How they live their lives on the edge every time just to be able to study twisters. The plot the characters just everything. After watching this movie I wanted to study natural phenomenon. I highly recommend it.
B007SNMVH2|5.0|Great movie! There were some parts I felt a little lost on, but it tied up at the end. I would recommend this movie.
B006P0FD4W|5.0|This trilogy of horror films in my opinion are great, very entertaining. I very good plot, everything ties in together really good. Showing how It all begins is a great ending. I'am ready for part 4. Kim Jones
B007Z9QA8K|3.0|It was entertaining, but its not the BEST movie ever. I'm glad i waited for it to come out on dvd to watch it.
0345525558|5.0|An entertaining and thought provoking book, dealing with issues seldom addressed in fiction. The main character is quite possibly somewhere on the autism scale, and we see life through her eyes. The writing is fluid and intelligent. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it this game is wonderrrrrrful its fun and have lots of game and it only keep u going
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Real good book.  Takes alot of the confusion out of working out.  Love the free report you get with the kindle version.
B004EPYZQC|3.0|The movie was excellent thats really the reason I bought it.  However it did not come with its original case which I really hated.  I collect movies and without the case it was pointless buying it from this buyer.
0515142247|1.0|I like action a lot, and I guess this one will have lots in the last 20 pages or so.  But getting there through the terminally drawn out suspense is no longer worth it so I'm ditching this crummy book.  I'm really a Childs/Reacher fan but this is boring tripe.  And anyway how many more times is he going to execute an escape?  I won't even mention the totally unlikely co-incidence underlying this farcical plot.  I like action, but it's got to make some kind of sense.  Call me when he writes something good.

006197806X|4.0|When I read the first book in this series, Delirium, it was hard to ignore the similarities to Ally Condie's Matched. And even though I knew it wasn't intentional, it was had to keep the books separate. When I picked up Pandemonium, it was unfortunately right after I read the second book in the Matched series, Crossed. So I began with hesitation, worried that it was going to follow a similar path to Crossed. I was pleasantly proven wrong.<br /><br />Pandemonium, picks up right were Delirium left off, and we see Lena's struggle to survive from the first page to the last. The story is told in a Then and Now format, with Lena's initial survival alternating with the Now in which she's involved in the revolution and finding a way to move past the death of Alex. With his absence comes the love interest opening for Julian. Initially I couldn't stand his character. He seemed whiny and weak, but as the story progressed he kind of grew on me. Although I did feel like Lena's character wasn't as strong as I wanted her to be. She spends a long time mourning him, constantly thinking about him and what he would be doing if he were alive, then all of a sudden she was in love with Julian. It just seemed like she gave into the need to be with someone.<br /><br />As for the ending, well, I won't say what happens, but damn! This has to be one of the greatest cliffhangers I've read in a long time! I will unquestionably be picking up the third in this series.

0545123291|4.0|There were so many things I expected of this book and I don't know if they were completely delivered. Regardless there were so many things I loved about this book.<br /><br />To start if you have not seen the  book trailer check it out. For me the trailers for all three of the books are wonderfully done and tell so much about the books, some of which I didn't make complete sense of until I read the books.<br /><br />The tone of Stiefvater's first Mercy Falls book Shiver is continued perfectly here.  Linger is poetically and beautifully written. Stiefvater's writing flows smoothly and her occasional use of poetic style is well done. The one problem I had was that things moved sooo slowly. I wish things there had been more of a sense of urgency.<br /><br />Grace and Sam's love is tested even as it builds. There were moments where I felt like there was a gap between them that didn't feel natural for two young lovers, but Stiefvater was able to pull them back together. Grace's parents drove me nuts in their suddenly inconsistent behavior, but in a way it worked to build some suspense. Hopefully there will be some resolution to their actions in the third book.<br /><br />The additional focus on newcomer Cole and Isabel was probably where I found myself the most conflicted. While their story lines were interesting and I really enjoyed the interactions between the two of them, I found them a distraction to Sam and Grace's story. Shiver was really about them discovering their love, but here with the added multiple points of view I just felt less connected to them.<br /><br />The ending was a bit hard for me to take. About two thirds into the book, I knew what was going to happen and I wasn't happy with it. While the first book in the trilogy left me with hope and a light feeling, Linger was anything but. There was a confusion of action and then boom! it was over exactly like I expected. I have hope the third book will work better for me.

1594744769|5.0|It's hard to put into words what I felt when I finished ready this book. I absolutely loved it, but it was nowhere near what I thought it was going to be. As always, I fell for the cover. The creepy girl levitating in black and white was enough to get me interested, that it takes place in Wales was just a bonus.<br /><br />Throughout the book are scattered photo's that tie into not just the characters, but also the background story of Jacob's grandfather. They were creepy and dark, and some of them were disturbing, despite their innocence. The photo's alone were enough to keep me turning the pages. I felt like a kid again with my first chapter book, frantically reading just so I could figure out the meaning behind the pictures.<br /><br />Photo's aside, the story is solid. Although it starts out a bit slow with information, it did have some immediate action that made me curious enough to not to skip pages. Jacob's character has some typical boy moments and he comes across as a believable and likable character. The other characters are a bit more on the eccentric side (apart from Jacob's parents). The mix of Peculiar's was great. Yes, there was almost an X-Men feel to them, but they have a believability to their reactions to their situation. Emma is the only one I found hard to follow. She swings back and forth with her feelings about Jacob and his grandfather, and frankly the idea of Emma and Jacob in a romantic relationship was the creepiest part of the book.<br /><br />Riggs does do an amazing job with the time travel aspect of the story. I've always found time travel books a bit frustrating (check out my upcoming review of Julie Cross's Tempest for more about that), but Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children manages to explain it and still make it understandable. The idea of loops that allow a pause in time while the present continues on was intriguing.<br /><br />I did feel as though the author was trying to leave it open for a sequel but I really don't feel like I'd want to read any further. My interest in the Peculiars was satisfied, and unless the concept sounded amazing I'd be happy with the way this one ended. Sometimes, it's better just to stop while things as good and I can't see this story getting better than it already is.<br /><br />This is a definite recommend, and although it looks like it would be for older teens, I think younger teens would find it more enjoyable.

1597801585|2.0|This is the first time I've ever reviewed something that I haven't actually finished yet. I'm usually vehemently against such a practice but this particular work has compelled me to break my own ethic.<br /><br />I'm exactly 100 pages into 'The Windup Girl' as of this morning and I'm getting dangerously close to giving up and moving on to better things. There are so many recommendations and oh so little time that I hope you'll forgive the trangression.<br /><br />Let me tell you what we've got so far: A pretty unlikeable (and simultaneously uninteresting) dude by the name of Anderson Lake is wandering somewhat aimlessly around a dystopian future Thailand looking for fruit. His reluctant (and equally unlikeable) partner - Hock Seng - is wandering around aimlessly and occasionally thinking about money. We've got the titular Windup Girl - Emiko - who has made but one brief appearance in the only interesting chapter so far. And finally we've got a fella by the name of Jaidee who I guess is all hoo-haa about freedom-fighting. I say 'I Guess\\" because it's all so oddly written that I can't really get any handle on who any of the characters really are yet.<br /><br />That's it. 100 pages. No joke.<br /><br />Well okay, there is another character - and that's the locale of future Thailand itself. So far it's easily the most sympathetic character in the book. It's smelly and dirty, it has big elephants and dirigibles, and it's a whole lot more interesting to read about than any of the ill-sketched denizens Bacigalupi has populated it with. Props for that at least.<br /><br />So yeah, 100 pages and I'm desperately hunting for some kind of inciting incident, or some kind of promise of elevating conflict, or some obstacle-littered motivation that would take any one of these characters and propel them into... oh what's that thing in novels usually called again? Oh yeah, that's right... a STORY.<br /><br />You know, if I'd dug this book out of the clearance section of some ratty old store and picked it up because I thought it sounded promising, that would be one thing. But this book has practically become famous. I saw an entire display dedicated to it in Barnes & Noble! Is this what literary sci-fi has fallen to? Throw in a dirigible here and an uneccessary foreign word there and you're golden? I don't like that one bit.<br /><br />I'm going to read on, maybe give it fifty more pages, and if things change I will come back here and edit my review and publically eat my kink-spring hat, but I gotta say I don't hold out much hope...

B006RUJST6|1.0|Do not be fooled by the reviews.  There is a reason why books should be vetted by publishing professionals.  The characters in this book are inconsistent and unbelievable, and the writing is sophomoric.  It seems as though the author strung together a story outline from her favorite songs by her favorite band.<br /><br />The storyline of Â«beautiful older boy meets beautiful girl and becomes totally enraptured at first sightÂ» has been so over done lately, that it has become nauseating.

B001AP11LQ|5.0|Here is where it all starts kids, the WHITE STRIPES lay down their first album and let us all know that they are just going to get some drums and guitar, turn it up, and rock it out, thank you very much.  IF you want to listen, great, if not, then Jack will keep working on furniture!  As an old fogey, and a music addict, there was a time 10 years ago where I was wondering whether or not I'd ever get into a \\"new\\" band ever again.  I was OK if the answer was NO.  I still don't know every single Doors, Creedence, or Stones song, and I'm very happy to continue to listen to Zeppelin, Purple, Sabbath, et al (yes, I listen to other music as well).  SO, then a little band called the White Stripes comes out.  I'd heard of them, and the \\"garage rock\\" label, and I just hadn't come across their stuff yet as I don't listen to radio, and MTV stopped playing ANY music decades ago.  So one night listening to public radio, they say here is the new song by the Stripes \\"Seven Nation Army\\" off their new album Elephant.  I'm INSTANTLY hooked.  I go out and I get their first album and Elephant, listen to them both and they BLOW my mind!!  Of course, I pick up White Blood Cells and De Stijl.  LOVE them too!  The rest is history.  I see them in concert, I buy their Blackpool NIghts DVD, and get their movie and new live album, all of it, so damn good!  Now they are done, maybe they do something again, I don't know, but if not, they left their mark, and of course, Jack continues to let the music flow thru Raconteurs, Dead Weather, and now, solo offerings, Keep it up Boy!  cheers.

B005LAIGF0|5.0|\\"Margaret\\" was supposedly filmed 7-8 years ago, and for reasons I'm not sure of, sat on the shelf until finally a group of film critics advocated for its release. After watching it, I can understand why ... it's a difficult film, hard to categorize, but also rich, provocative and brilliant.<br /><br />The superficial storyline of the film involves a 17 year old girl, Lisa (Anna Paquin, looking much more natural than she does now in her toned, blond TrueBlood persona) who is indirectly involved in a fatal accident in which a woman is killed by a bus. Confused and guilt-ridden, she goes about trying to do the \\"right thing,\\" which in her mind involves making sure those responsible (including herself) are held accountable, as well as trying to get justice for the deceased. But at every turn, her effort is met with the ambivalence, apathy, and bureaucracy of the adult world.<br /><br />However, as much as the film follows this dramatic central storyline, the film is also a portrait of all the much more mundane and subtle predicaments of being 17 years old. Lisa is no longer a child, and no longer coddled like one. She is expected to behave like an adult, but at the same time the other adults in her life constantly remind her of her youth and inexperience at every turn. She's impulsive and emotional, but also insightful and self-aware. She also wants to explore and experiment, and is aware of the power of her youthful sexuality, but also quickly finds out the repercussions of it. Around her are the archetypes of the kind of people most of us probably had in our lives at her age: her mother who is equal parts self-absorbed, caring, and clingy; the goodhearted but awkward friend who wants to date her; the experienced bad boy who she finds much more interesting; the pathetic teacher who is more interested in holding onto his tiny source of hubris than exploring a student's genuine ideas; and sadly, the one well-meaning, compassionate adult in her life who she hurts just because she can.<br /><br />Paquin's performance is formidable, and would probably be award-worthy if it wasn't so old. The film itself, by alternating between high drama and subtle character exploration, serves as one of the best depictions of modern adolescence I've seen. \\"Margaret\\" isn't a perfect film, but the fact that it's a flawed masterpiece might make it even more appealing.use she can.<br /><br />Paquin's performance is formidable, and would probably be award-worthy if it wasn't so old.

B0086KHE2I|5.0|I have to admit, I was really busy the first three attempts I tried to read this novel, but it wasn't the novel, it was me. Once I had the time to really read it, I read it in one sitting. I love how the spirit told her story, which is how I like to write. The Lovely Bones is beautifully written and I'd love more by this author. I'd like to say I loved how the spirit came back into her best friend, and I was on pins and needles reading when her sister almost got caught. I'm not one who likes to tell the entire plot of someone's book. I want you to read it for yourself and let it unravel. You'll love it!

B0002VFXFE|5.0|Well, i use this product on every processor and micro processor. Even graphic cards this is an awesome product. I really needed a tub of it, as i use it alot with what i do, but for the price, fast delivery & you can get alot done from 3.5 grams, its worth it. You don't need to use much at all and it will last for years from the first application. Need something fast ? Need it to be an easy application ? Looking for something that is worth its weight in gold, then what are you waiting for ?

0002247399|1.0|The primary purpose of this &#34;review&#34; is to voice my deep disappointment; to add another 1-star review to the list. I only wish that I could vote negative stars.<br /><br />Most of the &#34;plot&#34; or &#34;action&#34; involves new characters (or at least characters who first appeared in novel 3 or later), whom I only vaguely remember, and couldn't care less about. Sure &#34;old favorites&#34; (Daenerys, Tyrion, Arya, Jon Snow, and Bran Stark) make welcome, even if brief, appearances but usually muddying the plot line (if there is a plot line) rather than advancing it in any foreseeable direction. Everything of interest (at least to me) which happens in volumes 3 to 5 could be well (and completely) related in 100 pages. Something like 5000 pages into this epic, there is still no &#34;closure&#34; to any of the substories---nor at this point is there even hope that there ever will be closure in subsequent volumes.  For example, there are no Lanisters left to &#34;get even&#34; with.  Every time a little momentum gets going, the protagonist (invariably one of the few interesting characters) is killed, and the &#34;viewpoint&#34; shifts to a different character POV) in a different story line. It's even worse when murdered characters come back to life a thousand pages later (after having been burned to a crisp or beheaded etc.) because they weren't really dead. Is Ned Stark going to be resurrected in volume 6? The &#34;theme&#34; of impersonators (for Arya, Sansa, Theon, etc.) is way past moldy. Sure, some &#34;bad guys&#34; are killed or humiliated---but there is no feeling of justice having been served. They &#34;get theirs&#34;, not for the evil they've done, but rather for pointless political reasons. Even when Tyrion kills his father (a sick old man sitting on the toilet), it's just pathetic, not triumphant, not even satisfying. I'm tired of my interest being piqued by interesting new themes or side-stories which are abandoned and never developed. I'm exhausted by the cancerous convolutions and the lack of continuity. I'm particularly annoyed by the frequent feeling that I must have accidentally skipped several chapters---caused by abrupt jumps (leaving gaps) in the main story-lines, which are never filled-in.<br /><br />As far as all that praise for the &#34;reality&#34; of the story. Yeh, the series is more like &#34;real life&#34; than is traditional fantasy literature. I happen to be a published historian. I research and write &#34;real life&#34; stories (history). Despite those (usually) horrible high-school and college courses we all suffered through, well-written history is fascinating because the stories are real.  An appreciation of real history actually has value in living our lives. I read literature, particularly fantasies, as a vacation from reality---to enjoy a simpler (imaginary) world in which things are simple, problems are resolved, and justice prevails. It may not be reality, but it is a form of hope. Reality--yes, read history. Fantasy---yes, read Tolkien and Rawlings.<br /><br />Many reviews extol the lack of magic and fantasy (another way of praising the &#34;reality&#34;).  One woman approvingly wrote, &#34;When a character is killed, he stays dead&#34;.  What novel was she reading?  Although I love Rawlings, Tolkien, etc. the fact is, the relatively little magic in &#34;The Song of Ice and Fire&#34;, is a distraction.  Besides, most of the magic in TSOI&F is &#34;scary old icky magic&#34; (zombies, possession, reanimation of corpses, etc.) not the appealing imaginative magic of Rawlings, Tolkien, etc.  Giants and dragons undoubtedly hook many prospective readers, but so far GRR Martin has little more than mentioned them in passing. TSOI&F might indeed be better without the little magic that it contains.<br /><br />Yeh, I know, there are already a thousand 1-star reviews and nobody will read this one, nor yours, but that's no reason not to &#34;vote&#34;.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|I'm a big Again fan in general. We have a kindle, three kindle fires and three Android phones in the family that heavily utilize Amazon apps. We have Amazon prime. We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really isn't worth the new $25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.<br /><br />The Amazon mp3 app itself was ok, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked ok, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids love it.  it will keep them busy on trips so we wont need bathroom breaks every twenty minutes
B008MEM24S|1.0|why is this .99 when it's free for ipad/ipod? That's so lame. If it's the same game it should be free as well.
076781326X|3.0|Columbia is the worst as far as distributing their films on DVD.  This film should have been on BLU RAY long ago.  The version here is unaccepatable for this great Academy Award Winning film of 1968.  It is brilliantly acted, direcetd, photographed, set, and scored.  The film is not long enough to be on two sides of a disk.  Funny Girl is the other film of 1968 that is long over due on BLU RAY.  Columbia, what is the problem?
0783231202|5.0|Every time I see Djimon Hounsou's character interrupt courtroom proceedings to cry out for freedom in very broken English, I get a lump in my throat.  Spielberg is a master at pulling very strong emotions out of his audiences, and AMISTAD is no exception.  With extremely unsettling and disquieting backstory, this film is basically a courtroom drama based (loosely) on an actual slave mutiny aboard a slave ship, a mutiny where most of the crew are killed.  The Spanish ship 'Amistad' is captured by the U.S. Navy in American waters, and the Africans on board, knowing not a word of English, are imprisoned and charged with murder--plus a court must determine actual ownership of the alleged slaves (who are not slaves at all; by the mid-19th century slaves must be born into slavery according to American statutes, and the 'Amistad's' \\"cargo\\" was kidnapped directly from west Africa).  The trial creates a national sensation in America, already teetering on the brink of Civil War, with President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) pulling all the strings he can to make the problem quietly go away.  It's a riveting trial, ultimately going all the way to the Supreme Court, followed by an unforgettable ending.<br /><br />The cast is the very best, including Hounsou (who has been remarkable in every role I've seen him play), Morgan Freeman as fictional abolitionist Theodore Joadson, the late Pete Postlethwaite as formidable prosecutor Holabird, and Stellan Skarsgard as abolitionist Tappan.  I'll even give props (although I rarely do) to Matthew McConaughey playing down-on-his-luck defense attorney Roger Baldwin; here, the actor is anything but annoying.  But special kudos go to the sensational Anthony Hopkins as former president John Quincy Adams.  When Baldwin and Joadson persuade the great orator to argue their case before the Supreme Court, it summons one of the most compelling scenes in the entire film.  Warning:  Spielberg is exceptionally graphic with his depictions of what takes place on the 'Amistad', and it is difficult to watch, but sets the stage for the powerful drama that ensues.  Spielberg has an impressive cache of remarkable films, and AMISTAD is one of them.<br />--D.

0061124265|5.0|This is a very well written novel. If you are looking for some answers about life and could not find, or if you are on the edge of life, I strongly recommend to read this book. I read this book in 2005, I do not remember mainly what happens, but I do remember what I get from this book. It was one of the stones that helps me to build my self confidence for sure!
B000E1MXSW|5.0|I read \\"The Nun's Story\\" when I was 12 years old, and was impacted by the personal trials of \\"Sister Luke.\\" Audrey Hepburn is perfect in the role, and portrays the character with insight and soulful clarity. The journey from postulate, to novice and then, final vows depicts the nun's story. The struggle for perfection, striving to balance humanity and it's sin with a spiritual connection with God has never been more beautifully presented. This movie is entertaining, moving and engages the viewer like no other. Recommend in this DVD format. The perfect movie!
