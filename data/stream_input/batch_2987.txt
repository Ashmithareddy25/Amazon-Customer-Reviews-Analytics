B0098HGNGG|3.0|I purchased for non-photographic purposes, to measure the light intensity of back-lights.  The CD/m^2 readings are calculated from ev values.  Sekonic round the values but in sort of an odd manner.  If you are using CD/m^2 above 100, I strongly consider you consider using other units or make inquiry to Sekonic (or MACGroup) tech support to get the conversion tables.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I thought I wouldn't of liked this book but, I learned to not judge a book by it's cover. It's a good read for all ages. And it's different from the movie too. But it's now one of my favorites
B00CT6EJEG|3.0|Great movie, great acting and story. I love the locations used in the film. One of Matt Damon's best movies
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a story that hooked me from almost the very beginning. A truly great fiction story that could be considered either science fiction or fantasy. I can recommend this novel to any fan of either genre.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I loved this season..Beckett and Castle finally gave into their feelings for each other..<br />Great writing, great direction and the cast of Castle really shone this season..<br />I recommend this to anyone who is a die hard Castle fan.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Initially, I played The Last Ship as background music to my web surfing. I only half-attended to the songs. Being short on big drums, bass, and guitar; it was easy to overlook them while distracted. Then, determined to give Sting the dedicated listen he deserves, I put aside my hobbies and just inhaled The Last Ship as the songs sailed through the air.<br /><br />No doubt, Sting has become rather indulgent in his mature career as a songwriter and musician. These are not radio-friendly tunes, even as they are a part of a larger project (a play) destined for the masses. Despite his doing what he wants as he wants it done, Sting somehow manages to pull me into his schemes and carry me along into a place of his imagination and heart... and moreover, his soul.<br /><br />The songs have all the elements that songs need to make them likeable, but what matters is how they make us feel. Sting is a painter of stories, using music as his paintbrush. These are beautiful, soulful paintings and The Last Ship will move you through an emotional ocean.

B005LAIIGW|4.0|This film is visually stunning, technologically challenging, and psychologically tense.<br />It's also nearly ruined by being overly sentimental.<br /><br />It stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Actually, they aren't just the stars, they are the entire live-action cast. Anyway, they both play astronauts as part of a team fixing something on the space shuttle. When a Russian satellite is destroyed, the resulting debris causes both of them to start floating away into the depths of space, where they will die a horrible lonely death unless they can find a way to rescue themselves. The whole movie is just the series of attempts made by Clooney and Bullock to get back into some spacecraft that can carry them back to Earth.<br /><br />This is probably the most scientifically accurate space movie I've ever seen. Without being anchored into a specific direction by gravity, there is no such thing as up and down, left and right. The film is shot with this constantly rotating perspective (if you get motion sick easily, this may be a problem for you). The film also acknowledges that since there is no air in space, there would be no noise - this is mostly followed in the film, although apparently fire extinguishers are exempt from this rule. Oh, and their actual plan to return to Earth is also scientifically impossible. I'm not giving anything away on screen, but in real life, they would be doomed 15 minutes into the movie.<br /><br />Although now that I think about it, their plan is not more impossible than the idea of Sandra Bullock being a genius astronaut (I mean, really? Considering only one female actor was needed for the entire damn film, how did we end up with the star of \\"Miss Congeniality\\" and \\"The Net\\"?)<br /><br />The movie plays on the term \\"gravity\\", exploiting all the definitions of the word. At the same time, the movie tries to be about the importance of holding on to life in the face of near-certain death. This caused some emotionally manipulative moments that brought the natural drama to a screeching halt and threw me off the film's trajectory quicker than a corpse attached to a jetpack.<br /><br />Visually, the film is a masterpiece and should be seen on the big screen. It is creative, nerve-wracking, and serves as a fairly realistic impression of what it must be like to work in space.<br /><br />In terms of story and acting, however, you can wait for it to appear on Oprah's network.hat brought the natural drama to a screeching halt and threw me off the film's trajectory quicker than a corpse attached to a jetpack.<br /><br />Visually, the film is a masterpiece and should be seen on the big screen.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|You get more value for the money you pay. Though it feels a little cheap but it does protect my kindle. It doesn't look that bad too. Although there are better looking covers but it provides the basic functionality. One great thing about this cover is that its extremely light. If you don't want to spend a lot of money on buying a cover go for this product.

B00CATSONE|5.0|This book delves into what fuels a genius, the passion that exists within them and how one man Tesla remained unbridled in his quest to provide energy to the world. To me it was all about how you define success. If you only simply see it in terms of financial glory, you will fail to recognize how truly successful Tesla was. I enjoyed it. I will give great thought to my  passion from this point forward. In the past I have let the people around me dissuade me but not anymore.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|A mix of the best of Bollywood, Hollywood and indie films, made by a the protean Danny Boyle who seems always unafraid to tackle new genres and forms.<br /><br />I find the first 80% flat-out magnificent; Dickens set in India, as a street urchin spins his horrifying tale, intercut with his unlikely success on India's version of &#34;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&#34; The ending is a bit more Hollywood than indie, but even if it could be accused of being manipulative, it did make me cry. There's an honest sweetness, bravery and energy to the film-making and acting that's endlessly infectious.

B000B5OD4I|5.0|I'll begin my review by stating that this is my first automatic watch but not my first Seiko.  I'm very happy with my skx007 despite the fact that it isn't made in Japan like the description states. This watch is skx007-k1, do some research and you soon find that it is made in Malaysia or Singapore. There is no stamping either on the dial or caseback stating it is made in Japan.<br /><br />Despite this annoyance, I still rate this watch with 5 stars due to the fact that it is of the highest quality and accuracy. My watch is running an average of two seconds fast every 24hrs. It looks spectacular. One change that I will be doing soon is changing out the bracelet. The jubilee style bracelet is okay but there are a couple of aftermarket oyster bracelets made specifically for this watch that match it much better.<br /><br />In short, I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend this watch to anyone who is on the fence about buying one.

B00H83EUL2|5.0|\\"Gravity\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Dr. Ryan Stone is a brilliant engineer on her first shuttle mission with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalski completely alone--tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth...and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.<br /><br />The cast led by Sandra Bullock (as Dr. Ryan Stone) & George Clooney (as Matt Kowalski) is brilliant. The directing by Alfonso Cuaron (who also wrote the story & screenplay, produced and edited) is brilliant. The story & screenplay by Cuaron & his son Jonas is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Steven Price is brilliant. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is brilliant. The film editing by Cuaron & Mark Sanger is brilliant. The casting by Richard Hicks & David Rubin is brilliant. The production design by Andy Nicholson is brilliant. The art direction by Mark Scruton is brilliant. The set decoration by Rosie Goodwin is brilliant. The costume design by Jany Temime is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Neil Corbould & Manex Efrem is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Tony Clark, Matt Kasmir, Richard McBride, Ben Morris, Chris Watts & Timothy Webber & coordinated by Siobhan Bentley, Fiona Carruthers, Emma Lian Cooper, Cara Tallulha Davies, Claire Galpin, Eoin Hegan, Lucinda Keeler, Lauren Knowlton-Parry, Bonnie Lin, Sarah Lister & Nidhi Seth is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Mark Henson is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliantly-crafted and entertaining film that is intriguing, interesting and well-crafted. It is also well-made and outstanding. Sandra Bullock & George Clooney both give well-crafted performances, worthyenough of awards consideration. Alfonso Cuaron has made what could be his best film of his career, so far. This is one of the best films of the year, possibly, the best movie of the year, and also one of the best movies of the fall season, possibly, the best movie of the fall season. This is a film that will definitely be considered for awards consideration.
B00F91H666|4.0|The first half of the movie kept you at the edge of your seat.  After that, except for a few scenes, the movie got slow and predictable.

In addition, the massacre at Nanking and the other atrocities carried out before and during World War !! should be know by anyone who wants to how learn from history and wants to understand current Chinese-Japanese relations.  Iris Chang did an amazing research and analysis to provide a gripping explanation of what happened that should not be missed.
B0094M2ITG|4.0|Big Fish gives new meaning to tall tales.  Really, it's one heck of a fish story.  And now that I've got that out of my system I'll move on to the review.<br /><br />Edward Bloom has always been destined for bigger things.  And his stories are the stuff of legend.  He packed a lot of living into his years.  It's a shame his son doesn't believe a word of it.  And a certain wedding speech alienates them for three years until Edward is diagnosed with cancer.  While visiting his dad, flashbacks to Edward's incredible life come through and we see how he left his home town, his time with the circus, his time with the army, and most important, how he met his wife and love of his life.  And he needs an end to his story, one that he heard a long time ago but is the only tale he hasn't told.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Albert Finney: Old Edward Bloom<br />Ewan McGregor: Young Edward Bloom<br />Christopher Mcpherson Jr.: Child Edward Bloom<br />Jessica Lange: Sandra K. Bloom<br />Alison Lohman: Young Sandra K. Bloom<br />Billy Crudup: William Bloom<br />Marion Cotillard Josephine Bloom<br />Helena Bonham Carter: Witch/Jenny<br />Hailey Anne Nelson: Young Jenny<br />Robert Guillaume: Dr. Bennett<br />Matthew McGrory: Karl<br />Danny DeVito: Amos Calloway<br />Steve Buscemi: Norther Winslow<br /><br />Ewan McGregor has the largest part in this movie and he does very well.  He's completely cocky and fitting to the personality of Edward.  But he's still likable.  And he's a good storyteller.  Older Edward is not quite as charming, but then again he's on his sick bed so that's understandable.  I think the hidden talent in the movie though is Jessica Lange.  She plays a quiet part, but acts completely devoted to Edward and makes the relationship beautiful.  I especially loved the tub scene between the two (and no it's not as dirty as it sounds).  The other characters are in and out of the movie at irregular intervals, but they are all unique and special.  I think they chose well for the parts as everyone is funny without being over the top.<br /><br />Since this movie is based on tall tales, everything in it was a little over the line of being outrageous.  But it was interesting and I can't say that I've ever seen something like it before.  The movie weaved its way through Edward's life in somewhat chronological order (except when it's showing him as older and dying).  Even the little touches were well done, like the life with the circus and various jobs that Edward had to perform.  It's not often you have a movie that can combine War, daffodils, elephant poop, and witches.  Although I should warn, there's back end nudity of both men and women in this movie.  Not that that's a big deal, but still thought I'd have the warning here.  My only real complaint with the movie is that it had some pacing issues in some parts.<br /><br />The cinematography is outstanding.  Unlike most of Burton's movies where everything is dark, this one has a lot of light.  Lit-up towns, a bright circus, performance during war, everything has a lot of color.  It's a pleasure to watch because of it.  And even the special effects, although somewhat cheesy, are well done.  I especially enjoyed the catfish that was featured throughout the movie.  The music is so-so.  It fit with all the scenes but I can't say that it was memorable.<br /><br />Big Fish is a good movie.  It has a lot of emotion and while it's not perfect, it is perfectly enjoyable.<br /><br />Review by M.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Due to circumstances beyond your control, this is the first new fiction I have read in years. What a joy to come back to Danny Torrance of The Shining, one of my favorite character studies of all time (the first half,that is). I was enthralled from the first page to the last.After years of non-edited King,I finally got a tight, coherent,gripping story from my favorite author. It was the 70s again, and I was home.
B00459EZLW|3.0|SECOND HALF OF Season 2 was more hopeful than 1. Appreciated character development and team building. Still has flaws but better. Wishing for a season3 that will probably never happen, sorry folks. More realistic characters and plots than the other Stargates. Still a lot of copying themes from other science fiction, not a lot of originality but what can you expect. Fairly decent acting however and enough originality to keep you entertained. On the whole liked it but with some reservations, especially since it may never be finished.  PS  the whole premise of the stargates in general involve more evolved races which I find a flawed worldview to begin with but again, this is not an original idea and its still entertaining. Enjoy with many grains of salt. But that's true of most fiction.<br /><br />Addendum (added in 2015): I forgot to mention, Stargate SGU is NOT morally clean. For Christians, please exercise discretion. My review of season 1, I think, included this disclaimer. I do not recall any language problems, just situations and relationships that were not right. They were, however, usually presented either in a neutral or somewhat negative light, I.e. the consequences of these relationships and actions were not pretty. In most episodes, these were sidelines, however, to the main stories, which were simply speculative sci fi.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Mature reading, wish the story line was more mature. Hurting for more romance - not so much senseless sex. Not a far fetched story though.

1577314808|1.0|This book is so lame, you would have to be completely out of touch with reality to think that there is anything of value in here. Quit reaching out and start looking in...any problems you have can be handled by using the tools that you were taught in grade school. In fact, I wish Tolle would have paid attention to the basic rules of writing taught in any high school. His writing is all over the place, ducking and twisting from an easy flow into a sporadic mess and back again. I can't make heads or tails out of his intent but the writing comes through as if processed by a fool. Which makes a fool out of anyone who puts a value to the words. \\"The predominance of mind is no more than a stage in the evolution of consciousness\\" (23)...are fricking kidding me? Do you know how far I had to get into this book to even find a quote that was written into a correct sentence? ...I guess it was 23 pages...and the quote is so far out of truth that it makes no real sense at all..this is nothing but an attempt to seem smart by someone who obviously is not. Shame on all of you followers who got something out of this. This is garbage and you are indeed lost in space...with Tolle! \\"The predominance of mind is no more than a stage in the evolution of consciousness\\" (23)..LMFAO! Life is not really that hard to figure out...put down the book and walk outside. Peace.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I found this book frustrating and hard to follow initially.  I found it much more clear once the letter had been read.  But then I struggled with the dilemma over the right thing to do.  It seemed obvious to me and I was frustrated that it became such a hard thing for the character.  In the end I did enjoy the story.
B0084AZXKK|1.0|The time period is in the early 1900 and they're from England so the whole time they're using words that most people have never heard and then they drag it on. It gets annoying. The same thing is happening in like 10 pages. The subject needs to change!
B00EY8ARYS|1.0|Just curious that it is on Amazon and you have to pay for it when the network has it online for free. Why carry something for pay to view when it is already online for everyone to see for free?
B00B2V66VS|3.0|If I had to pay, I wouldn't.  I'm finding it harder and harder to find a &quot;free&quot; game these days that captivates me and in general won't make me wanna delete it after playing it once. Like I said, this game is ok. Big said.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|My Order was placed August 1, I received the Chromecast on September 10th. It was back-ordered so that's understandable. However, the unit I have never worked right. Streaming for my pc, my iphone, my ipad, my sons laptop - works for a short time, then the Chromecaster reboots/resets itself.<br /><br />It could be iTunes, YouTube or anything cast from Chrome itself using the tab-cast method. Same results regardless. Works for a bit (5 or 10 minutes) - then boom - reboot. And once the reboots happen, it seems to shorten the time until hit happens again.<br /><br />I called customer service and at first they were very helpful. Trying any number of things, resets, moving it to a different hdmi port on the tv, moving it to another tv. But none of this helps. It still happens.<br /><br />And the customer server has gotten worse and worse. At first they stayed on the line and waited for the result - then they moved it to emails, where I had to wait days if not longer in between replies and those replies were useless, suggesting things that had already been tried or demanding things like proof of purchase and then not replying for a week after it's provided.<br /><br />I would have sent it back and gotten a replacement but they were still back ordered in September and I figured Google would actually take care of their customer. I guess that was my mistake.<br /><br />Here I am, a month later and no resolution. No response from customer service and no working chromecast.

B000FC10MU|2.0|An interesting start, but after a while I had to force myself to finish it.<br /><br />I thought the book had lots of potential, but failed to deliver in my opinion. The story, in its distilled state, was about gods who live with us, whose power has wained because they have become forgotten over time. New gods of the IT age are the ones with power now. One man becomes enlisted in a fight between the gods, and struggles with his own demons. Although the premise of the book  seems enticing, and the individual stories of how individual gods were worshipped was interesting, the book seemed more like a quilt of information that when viewed in whole, still looked like a patchwork of stories rather than a well designed, favorite comforter.<br /><br />I praise the author for his research of past gods and the way in which he tried to combine diverse mythology into a story, but the book was like an international food buffet that despite all the preparation was still a buffet.

0307592731|5.0|When I look at the title of this book the song \\"Born To Be Wild\\" comes to mind. I've always liked the music but I never identified with the lyrics. I'm not a wild child. In my high school yearbook my friends wrote \\"stay as sweet as you are.\\" I didn't smoke pot or take LSD, I tried cigarettes in college but I didn't like the taste of smoke and I couldn't light matches, and I have had a few drinks over the years but I don't like alcohol enough to get drunk.<br /><br />Cheryl lost her mother at an early age and spiraled into a hellish existence because of that. Losing what she loved, what she knew, what she depended on made her a little crazy. Most of us can relate to that. Our lives are made up of routine and habit. We don't deal well with change, even when we choose it. So when tragic circumstances are forced upon us, we resist, we rebel, and sometimes we go haywire.<br /><br />But deep inside her the wish to be at peace led her to a miracle in the making: hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). It didn't matter that she had no hiking experience or that the trail is over 2000 miles or that she planned to do it alone. [I know from my own experience that sometimes it's better not to know what you're getting into.] But as I turned the pages and read about her journey, both mental and physical, I found myself thinking no way, no way, no way would I hike the trail and I wondered how the hell she did it. My excuse is that I'm tall and thin and not athletic at all. I hate camping, I whine when my backpack weighs more than 10 pounds, and my body hurts even when I'm just sitting around. What kind of fool would attempt to hike the PCT for 3 months through all kinds of weather? Not I. But then again, I didn't lose my mother when I was 22.<br /><br />The intimate tone of Cheryl's writing pulls you into her journey, through the grit and the pain, over desert and stony paths, through the rain and the muck, across snow-covered slides, up into the mountains and down into the valleys.You feel the agony of blisters and thirst and raw, bleeding skin. You see the beauty of fresh snow and pristine lakes and the ruffled fur of a fox. You ache as she hurts. You rejoice when she sees with new eyes. As Lance Armstrong wrote in his book, it's not about the bike, and for Cheryl, it's not just about the hiking. Putting one foot in front of another gave her the opportunity to push past her endurance levels, to test her body and her mind, and to give her heart a place to grow and expand and forgive.<br /><br />I admired her fortitude, her determination, her drive to complete her goal. The PCT is not for the faint-hearted, and even experienced hikers have given up. I admired her for continuing even with extreme pain. I admired her for expressing her emotions as she hiked, for getting in touch with the truth of her feelings. I want to do that, but I'm often unwilling to get down and dirty with myself. I also greatly admired her writing. You will keep turning the pages. You won't be able to put this down. And you will be the better for reading it.

B00DNUSG0U|4.0|*BLU-RAY SET REVIEW*<br />THE FILMS:<br />I'm sure that the majority of you have approached this release with some trepidation just as I have.  Universal Studios' track record has shown that it is completely unconcerned with the quality of its home video releases as long as they bring in a few bucks with a minimum of cost to the studio.  The [[ASIN:B003YCI1O8 2010 Blu-ray release of the original &#34;Tremors&#34;]] was a sad victim of this trend, with an appallingly filtered video transfer, decent audio and no new special features.  Well, three years later, Universal has reissued the first film along with its first three direct-to-video sequels.  How does this release fare, you ask?  As a seasoned fan of the &#34;Tremors&#34; franchise since the late nineties, I will attempt to shed some light on this issue.  I assume that you have some knowledge as to the nature of the films in question so I'll spare you plot synopses.<br /><br />1990's &#34;Tremors&#34; is the ultimate cult classic; a film with decent critical repute and a loyal (if limited) fanbase.  It's the rare gem of a genre picture that manages to blend horror and comedy elements into one cohesive and effective package.  Despite it being one of my all-time favorite movies, you'll get no argument from me if we're dissecting its flaws.  The film doesn't have much in the way of character development and frequently violates its own rules regarding the graboids (the not-so-friendly creature antagonists of the franchise).  That said, director Ron Underwood's film is still one of the most genuinely likable movies I've ever seen and its merits far outweigh its flaws.  The characters, each perfectly cast and well-performed, are all likable.  Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are great as Val  McKee and Earl Bassett, respectively, and Michael Gross gives it his all in his signature role of Burt Gummer.  Notably, none of these characters are stupid and only one of them is a teenager, in stark contrast to your average horror film.  The creatures themselves are well-realized with unique designs and convincing special effects, with some genuine scares to be found herein.  I'll spare you a more in-depth review given that if you're interested in this release, you've probably long since made your mind up about the original film.  As for me, I'll go on record as calling &#34;Tremors&#34; the best horror comedy ever made.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors&#34; (1990) Movie Quality: 4.5/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />As with most franchises, the sequels are a mixed bag.  The original film, while successful at the box office, was not a blockbuster.  It found an audience in the home video market, spurring the release a straight-to-video sequel by the name of &#34;Tremors 2: Aftershocks&#34; in 1996.  I'm not sure why the filmmakers felt the film needed a subtitle, but I assure any fan of the original film that the end product is far better than such a goofy heading might lead you to believe.  In fact, I like &#34;Aftershocks&#34; just as much as the first film and, depending on the day, sometimes more.  Despite its bargain bin pedigree, this sequel's production values are almost on par with its predecessor; the special effects are quite good and frequently impressive, with some great action sequences to boot.  Fred Ward and Michael Gross return from the first film and give it their all, with Michael Gross going even MORE over the top this time around.  Christopher Gartin fills in for Kevin Bacon, who decided not to return for the sequel, and Helen Shaver plays Kate Reilly, Ward's love interest.  While the chemistry between Ward and Bacon and the rest of the characters from the original film are missed, it's not detrimental to the film's overall entertainment value.<br /><br />As silly as the film's premise is, there are plenty of new ideas in play.  In fact, &#34;Tremors 2&#34; had an arguably bigger effect on the ultimate franchise than did the original film.  The genesis of the graboid lifecycle, the methodsused to hunt them and Burt's penchant for ridiculous overkill are all sealed here.  Many of the gags are amusing and there is some decent suspense in the middle of the film when the creatures unexpectedly metamorphose, successfully retaining the tone and atmosphere of the first &#34;Tremors.&#34;  My uncle and I had a &#34;Tremors&#34; double feature one night, starting with the first film and ending with this one.  He couldn't believe it when I told him that this one was straight-to-video.  I'm not pretending that &#34;Aftershocks&#34; is as good as the first film nor that everyone will like it, but no one can say that the filmmakers didn't try and try hard to live up to the promise of the first film.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 2: Aftershocks&#34; (1996) Movie Quality: 4.0/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />&#34;Tremors 3: Back to Perfection&#34; is where the franchise begins to falter, in my humble opinion.  Remember how I said that the second film is on par with the first in terms of technical quality?  That sentiment no longer applies here.  Somehow, this 2001 film feels cheaper and more forced than it's mid-nineties counterpart.  Unlike the previous films in the franchise, the effects of this outing are lacking anything &#34;special.&#34;  The graboids themselves look stiff when practical effects are on the screen and the CGI looks like it was ripped from &#34;Toy Story.&#34;  These technical shortcomings could be forgiven if the rest of the film was up to snuff, but sadly that is not the case.  Whereas &#34;Aftershocks&#34; had some new ideas, &#34;Back to Perfection&#34; hinges on its namesake of returning to the town featured in the first film.  Michael Gross returns once again as Burt Gummer, but his role is played more for laughs and the character is more of a parody of the likable survivalist from the previous films than a effective lead.  Don't get me wrong: he's always been funny, but he's never been such a buffoon before.  I love Burt just as much as the next&#34;Tremors&#34; fan, and as such I don't think he should be portrayed as the butt of all of the jokes nor as an incompetent monster hunter that needlessly destroys his possessions.<br /><br />A interesting wrinkle concerning this third film is the returning cast members: all of the survivors, save for Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter and Reba McEntire, reappear and are played by their original actors.  That's quite an impressive feat for a straight-to-video sequel to a somewhat unsuccessful theatrical film that was released eleven years later, and ultimately more notable than anything else concerning the film itself.  In fact, it's quite infuriating that unlike the first film, the characters here frequently make stupid decisions, and it's more disconcerting when one stops to consider the fact that they seemed much smarter just two films ago.  The graboids return (obviously) but are no longer threatening due to their constant presence via the &#34;marketing&#34; employed by newcomer Susan Chuang as Jody Chang, niece of store-owner Walter from the first film.  Fellow newcomer Shawn Christian plays the equally charming and annoying &#34;Desert&#34; Jack Sawyer, who runs scam graboid tours, one of which results in an all too predictable gag once the real creatures show up.<br /><br />By extension, predictability is really the film's main drawback.  The creatures change into another new form that, like star Michael Gross, is played more for self-parody than horror, and there are precious few surprises in store.  There's a distinct lack of tension and almost none of the gags are very funny, with Burt's constant one-liners becoming a bit grating by the film's end.  While there are positive elements, they are given a run for their money by the bad, which makes for a mixed experience.  It's hard to believe that &#34;Tremors 2&#34; spawned this misfire, much less the original film (or that this misfire spawned a short-lived TV series for the Sci-Fi channel, which is surprisingly much better than &#34;Back to Perfection.&#34;)  Back in the day, I used to catch the first two &#34;Tremors&#34; film on various primetime slots on various channels such as TNT, USA Network and the like.  It should be telling that, to my knowledge, this film has only ever aired on the Sci Fi Channel.  &#34;Back to Perfection&#34; is the definite low point of the series, in my not so humble opinion.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 3: Back to Perfection&#34; (2001) Movie Quality: 2.5/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />Despite the hit-or-miss response to the previous films, &#34;Tremors 4: The Legend Begins&#34; is where the fans REALLY divide.  I personally find this 2004 entry to be much more entertaining than &#34;Back to Perfection&#34;, which should be telling as I tend not to care for prequels.  The facetious reference to the series as &#34;legend&#34; aside, there is really a lot to like here.  First and foremost, the production values once again appear on par with the first film (despite an even lower budget than for the third film), though not without a few shoddy spots.  The story, while a clich&eacute; western parody, features the most well-rounded characters of the sequels.  All of them are distinct and series mainstay Michael Gross turns in a great performance as Hiram Gummer, ancestor of Burt, who is essentially the total opposite of his descendant and even has a nice, if predictable, character arc.  Unlike &#34;Tremors 3,&#34; many of the gags in this film are funny, with at least one laugh-out-loud moment in the film's midsection.<br /><br />Even though I have a soft spot for &#34;Tremors 4&#34;, I completely understand why some fans resent it and even agree with many of the criticisms.  Setting the film in the 1890s, effectively making it a western parody, can be a little grating if all one cares about is seeing Burt blast graboids and destroy his own property.  One gets the sense that this film is more of a side story than a continuation, which makes it all the more depressing that it was the final gasp for the franchise for over a decade (and the last to involve the original creators, as of &#34;[[ASIN:B011KME78M Tremors 5: Bloodlines]].&#34;).  Director S.S. Wilson mentions in the one of the featurettes for this film that &#34;part of the fun of prequels is seeing how the new characters learn the rules&#34; -- all aspiring filmmakers, please take note: despite my opinion of &#34;The Legend Begins,&#34; this sentiment is DEAD WRONG.  I normally dislike prequels for this reason, but this one clicked with me when I first saw it in 2004 because of its charm and likable characters.  Otherwise, seeing new people that we fans don't care about learning the rules everyone already knows is one of the most tedious filmmaking exercises in existence.  Having a returning character to guide new characters is one thing; wiping the slate clean is another.  Regardless of my fondness for &#34;The Legend Begins,&#34; I'll agree with anyone that this film ended the series with more of a whimper than a bang at the time due to its nature as a novelty.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 4: The Legend Begins&#34; Movie Quality: 3.5/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though it would have been a nice bonus, the aforementioned 2003 television spinoff &#34;[[ASIN:B002ZHKZGA Tremors: The Series]]&#34; is not included in this set.<br /><br />VIDEO QUALITY:<br />The biggest point of contention among &#34;Tremors&#34; fans with the 2010 Blu-ray release was the horrendous video transfer.  Rather than spend money restoring or remastering any original film elements, Universal simply repurposed the HD DVD transfer from 2007, which was also less than perfect.  Further compounding the problems is the fact that &#34;Tremors&#34; has likely not been remastered since the late 1990s, as evidenced by the shoddy quality of its home video releases and the consistency of their flaws.  I've seen the original film quite a few times through various different formats and while the Blu-ray was definitely an upgrade, it was also quite offensive to the eyes.  While it should come as no surprise to anyone, Universal has neglected to restore or otherwise clean up the film.  This print is the same one that has been used for all of the previous versions I've seen of the film, with a tad bit of the filtering removed (leaving something of a grain structure for once).  I'm not a videophile and couldn't tell you the intricate differences between this version and the original Blu-ray, but it DOES look better, if only marginally, with more pronounced textures and less of the excess tampering that plagued the original Blu-ray.  Dirt assaults the screen at random points, but color reproduction is quite good.  &#34;Tremors&#34; will probably never look as good as it could given that Universal will likely never give it the restoration that it deserves, but it frequently looks decent here.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors&#34; (1990) Video Quality: 3.0/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />Surprisingly, &#34;Aftershocks&#34; looks quite good on Blu-ray.  The opening scene looks better than the entirety of the first film wholesale, and it only improves from there.  A few scenes in the middle of the film are almost reference quality, with a splash of colors across the screen, good fine detail reproduction and a nice depth to the images.  Again, I'm not a videophile, but as far as I could tell this transfer features no digital tampering and looks quite natural throughout.  It's not an amazing transfer and you won't see it playing on any of the TVs at Walmart, but the picture is still impressive when one considers the film's direct-to-video origins, age and the fact that Universal was involved.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 2: Aftershocks&#34; (1996) Video Quality: 3.5/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />Similar to the film itself, the transfer for &#34;Back to Perfection&#34; is lacking.  With the exception of a few key scenes that pop, the entirety of the film looks softwith a lack of fine detail throughout.  There's also little depth to the image and the colors are a bit dull, but this seems to be more representative of the source than the transfer itself.  There's a bit of grain and some dirt, which is surprising given that the print has likely been locked away in Universal's vaults since its original release in 2001.  Overall, there's not much to say about this one.  It's an upgrade, sure, but I wouldn't recommend it if it were a standalone release.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 3: Back to Perfection&#34; (2001) Video Quality: 3.0/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, &#34;The Legend Begins&#34; is the best looking of the bunch.  In fact, it looks SO good that I'm sure that some fans are going to complain as it's a whole TIER above the first film.  I'm not sure whether it was shot with film or digitally but it looks great either way (I assume film as there is dirt and speckles that appear, though it could have been transferred to a print for mastering).  Fine detail is consistent and apparent throughout and colors are bold with a nicely saturated hue.  Depth is also quite good, with many of the images practically popping off of the screen.  Again, I'm not an expert, but &#34;Tremors 4&#34; looked quite good to my eyes.  It's not quite reference quality, either, but given the nature of this film and the studio behind the release, it's quite impressive.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 4: The Legend Begins&#34; (2004) Video Quality: 4.0/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />AUDIO QUALITY:<br />Whereas the video transfer for &#34;Tremors&#34; is only decent, the audio is quite good.  It's not in the same league as &#34;Jurassic Park,&#34; but it does the job nicely.  The graboid roars and destruction in the film all sounded quite nice when coming out of my speakers.  Solid is the key word, and it tells you all you need to know.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors&#34; (1990) Audio Quality: 4.0/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />&#34;Aftershocks&#34; favors it's predecessor in the sound department, with a solid but not necessarily exceptional soundtrack.  I don't have much to say here; it sounds good and clear but won't necessarily knock your socks off.  Effectively, it does its job, and it's a testament to the original sound crew and designers that it's as dynamic as it is.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 2: Aftershocks&#34; (1996) Audio Quality: 4.0/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />Even though it sounds like I'm hating on &#34;Back to Perfection's&#34; technical presentation just because I'm not particularly fond of the film, I assure you that I'm giving an honest opinion of its technical presentation.  Audio for this film is bland, with dialogue having a muffled quality to it and the rest failing to impress.  It doesn't help that the sound design has a generic, public domain quality to it, with virtually none of the effects sounding in the least impressive.  If you've played a video game or seen a cheap action movie lately, you've heard these effects.  That said, this is how the film has always sounded to my ears, so I guess the Blu-ray is simply working with what it has as with the picture.  But that doesn't make the results any less unremarkable.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 3: Back to Perfection&#34; (2001) Audio Quality: 3.0/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />Like the visual presentation, &#34;The Legend Begins'&#34; soundtrack is also the best of the bunch and just below reference grade.  In stark contrast with &#34;Back to Perfection,&#34; the dialogue and sound effects of &#34;The Legend Begins&#34; all sound clear and crisp, as if they're happening right in front of you.  The sound design is also better than the previous film and helps to bolster the soundtrack's quality.  It's quite good.<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 4: The Legend Begins&#34; (2004) Audio Quality: 4.5/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES AND EXTRAS:<br />The Tremors Attack Pack comes in a standard Blu-ray case with an embossed slipcover, with the four films spread over two discs.  Despite early reports to the contrary, the films are housed on single-sided Blu-rays, with a simple menu that allows the viewer to choose which film they want to see (in typical Universal Studios style).  Special features and technical options are accessed via the pop up menu.  Unsurprisingly, the only bonus features that appear here are the ones that graced the DVDs themselves, which leaves the set a bit unevenly weighted.  The first film has a decent but limited set of behind-the-scenes material, the second has absolutely nothing, the third film has a lone featurette and the fourth film is absolutely bursting with content.  The material that IS present is all good and quite entertaining, but there is nothing new here and nothing that is in HD or that takes advantage of the Blu-ray format.  Still, who would expect anything extra when we can't even get the studio to properly restore the actual films?<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors&#34; (1990) Special Features Rating: 3.0/5.0 - - - - -<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 2: Aftershocks&#34; (1996) Special Features Rating: 0.0/5.0 - - - - -<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 3: Back to Perfection&#34; (2001) Special Features Rating: 1.5/5.0 - - - - -<br />- - - - - &#34;Tremors 4: The Legend Begins&#34; (2004) Special Features Rating: 4.0/5.0 - - - - -<br /><br />OVERALL SCORE AND RECOMMENDATION:<br />I obviously like &#34;Tremors&#34; and this set's success or failure rate is dependent upon your own feelings toward the films.  If you already have the first film on Blu-ray and don't care for the sequels, I can't say that this is set offers anything resembling an upgrade.  However, if you DO like the sequels, you might as well go for this set.  It's a bargain bin release and the price reflects this distinction.  Given the films and limited exposure of this release at the outset, this set is likely to drop in price quite quickly.  For around $20.00 for a consistently entertaining series with varying technical presentationsand bonus features, I'd call that a deal.  For me as a fan, it was money well spent.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has placed me mid-center of a fantastic story that played like a real-life movie in my head. It taught me so much. It taught me about worth and honesty and love and loss. I felt every sentence as if someone was writing them on my chest. This is a great book, and to me is more than simply this great star-crossed love story. Thank you John Green, for helping me notice the universe.

B00ADQ7JCS|5.0|This is withoutadoubt the best prog release of 2013. John Young, who cut his chops early on with Dave Greenslade, heads this new group. Guest stars include Steve Hackett and This Van Leer of Focus.<br /><br />The sound is based very much in the 70's progressive rock category, with today's technology. That the producer is listed<br />as a member of the band should tell you how great the sound is. Crisp, clean harmonies over intelligent lyrics, with<br />beautiful flutes, majestic keyboards and melodic guitar figures. LIFESIGNS has it all. Anyone into progressive rock, both old and new, would do well to pick up this release!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I feel like this series is just a \\"classier\\" version of Fifty Shades of Gray. And by \\"classier\\" I just mean pretty much the same story but the heroine isn't quite as annoying, and there is some semblance of a plot. I mean none of this in a bad way, because the Crossfire series is like crack and I can't seem to get enough it.<br /><br />The more I read of this series, the more dysfunctional Eva and Gideon seem to get. I want them to be together, to be happy, and to stop hurting each other, but I'm not sure if any of those things are ever going to happen. They need a whole trunk full of therapy to sort out all of their issues.<br /><br />Entwined with You picks up pretty much right where Reflected in You left off. We know that Gideon has done so messed up/extreme things for Eva, and I'm not 100% sure how I feel about it. I don't actually think there will ever be any consequences for Gideon's action, because I am mean, how romantic and fun would that be? But as I read Entwined with You I just couldn't ignore that giant elephant in the room.<br /><br />Entwined with You was what I expected it to be, and I like this series for what it is. Is it the most brilliant thing I've ever read? No, but overall it is enjoyable and I will be reading Captivated by You.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Was madly addicted to this game and loved it until I reached the point that I could no longer progress without spending $50 on gems just for the 3 quests I was on. To finish the entire game will cost a couple of hundred dollars. There are very few ways of earning gems in the game without buying them,  and lots of the ponies and shops cost so many gems that it would take weeks,  or months,  to earn enough by game play alone.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Let your child have this!!With colorful fun characters.And<br /><br />You will love  Action packed levels!  I love it!You can do it for<br />Love
B00F35BV64|1.0|This was a shockingly bad movie. Let me amend that, the sets, special effects and performances were all generally superior. The script however was practically incoherent. It screamed of being \\"by committee\\" with multiple conflicting voices none of whom had a particularly good command of the language. In fact muting the sound, putting on a great piece of music and just watching this as a visual experience is the way to go. Otherwise skip it.  This film is a perfect example of the degree to which every aspect of film making sets, FX, performances are far outdistancing the s***ty scripts being delivered.  Very strange.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The first book ends leaving u in suspense so luckily I didn't start reading this trilogy til all three were released because it is a great one! It is not purely sexual there is a plot so give it a try

B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie reminds me of Oceans 11. The characters  and plot are fun. The only problem for me was that someone besides Mark Garrafalo should have played the lead. Everyone else was great. Its about magicians getting involved in crime through the use of illusion. Very fun.

B0095P31L6|4.0|You'll either like it or not... it's a bit strange but I got into it! Some highly creative writers and animators put this together.

B00BMCAM6M|4.0|I am always on the prowl for music discovery or just music apps in general. I'm not into the stuff on commercial radio and at first I was a little leery when I saw a lot of curated lists that were titled &quot;top hits...&quot; however they were worded. There is not much of a way to browse lists which is disappointing but it does not stop me from using it and exploring. If there was a simple way to browse I would know more about how things are cataloged and would be able to get more use out of the search utility. Regardless, I have tinkered with it and have found it useful.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|If you are one in transition and are unsure of what to do, I would recommend this movie. One of the key elements that keeps most people from moving forward is fear, which can cripple or stricken a person easily. Fear only takes over if it is allowed too. Watch and learn!
B008OOYALE|3.0|Well here's the thing. I loved the game pet shop story and decided to buy this. Well it's great at first but then once you use up all your space it's impossible to expand. So then it's basically got no point. However there are cute dragons and ok graphics, but that's about all I like.
0385486804|4.0|Pretty good book. Not very long. I read it in one day. It certainly convinced me never to try living in the wild without proper supplies.

B000002GQE|5.0|Best album ever from the Moody Blues. Brings me back to my old hippie days and memories of my first apartment.
B00EE3HVMO|5.0|I put off watching Broadchurch for much too long, because I thought I knew what to expect from a \\"whodunnit\\" series. Then I watched a few interviews with the actors from Broadchurch about the making of the show,  and was intrigued by the fact that they did not know who the killer was through at least the first five episodes of the series.  This forced the actors to really listen to each other, and be suspicious of others, just as their characters were in the program. Moreover, the interviews showed the actors, writers and directors seemed to genuinely care about bringing a thoughtful perspective and realism to the program.  I bought the first episode of Broadchurch since it was no longer available \\"on demand\\" for free.  The minute it ended, I bought the other seven episodes.  Once I started watching, I couldn't stop.  David Tennant definitely deserved the award he won for acting in Broadchurch, but every other character in Broadchurch was wonderful, realistic, three-dimensional and thought provoking as well.  The first episode does not begin with the discovery of the body, and the final episode does not end with revealing the murderer.  In fact, you know \\"whodunit\\" near the beginning of the last episode, but there is still a lot left to tell.  This is not some cookie cutter cop show where the audience is just trying to be smarter than the writers and look for clues.  I felt as though I was watching in as real people lived their lives in front of me.  The murder in this small town blows it apart, before finally beginning to bring it back together beautifully at the end.  There were several points where I cried during the show, and it was never because of something shocking gratuitously thrown in for effect; it was because I identified with the pain felt by the characters in the story.  Season 1 of Broadchurch was wonderful; I can't wait for Season 2
B008NA3I30|5.0|If you're a certain kind of viewer, this movie is extraordinary and beautiful. This movie isn't for popcorn munching. It's for reflection on choices and the value of intimacy and, IMO, monogamy. If you enjoy a movie that will actually requires you to make some conclusions to get the point of the movie and cause you to reevaluate your values, this is a movie to watch.    It's about a woman, five years into a too-comfortable, sexually frustrated, but intimate and loving marriage. And the choices and consequences that come her way once a smoldering, seducing, handsome stranger appears in her life. Michelle Williams is subtle and good, but not as great as I know she knows how to be. A bit phoned in. A little like a modern day version of her character in Brokeback Mountain. She's meant to be a despised protagonist, which is incredibly hard to pull off, but with Sarah Polley's help, she does it. Seth Rogen has more vulnerability and dramatic range than you would believe if the first thing you thought of was \\"the stoner guy from Pineapple Express.\\" Think Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind quality rare dramatic performance from a comedian. He breaks your heart when he says, \\"I thought you'd be there when I died.\\" Really, the movie is worth a watch just for him.    Luke Kirby's character has the smoldering, dominant sexuality to back up the sparse, subtle written plot. Think a deeper version of the seducer in Unfaithful. Hot. And Sarah Silverman has a gem short performance as the always-recovering alcoholic sister in law who accepts her life for what it is - one big mess of screw-ups strung together by communication, struggle and lasting, forgiving love. She's a bit her stock character, especially at the end, but she gives in a similarly surprisingly poignant performance as Rogen's.    The film is like a novel. You have to read the dialogue and the physical exchanges in each scene (lots of scenes of awkwardly trying to initiate sex) for this film to be morethan just a bunch of random moments strung together in someone's s***ty life. The characters are unique in film as they don't fall into easy moralities. Everyone's at different levels of fault in what happens in the film. There is some revolutionary camera work, esp with montage and use of the female gaze. And the cinematography and use of a frame narrative both contribute to the beauty of this film.    Just, do yourself a favor. If you were interested enough in my review to read until the end, watch this movie. You'll be recommending it to your film geek friends in no time.
B00000331V|5.0|When I was seventeen I thought these guys were just okay; fun but forgettable studio albums and pretty embarrassing music videos (I think they invented the paint-spilling theme - see the hilarious movie \\"Tapeheads\\").  But I was invited to see them at The Long Beach Arena in 1978 after having suffered a string of disappointments by all the 'major' bands in rock and roll (The Who, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and even the Stones, who had the audacity to have a fireworks show at 5:30 in the afternoon in summer!).  All I can say is that Mick Jagger, who I still admire greatly couldn't hold a candle to Peter Wolf, and the rest of the Stones and all those other 'superstars' couldn't hold a candle either because they all seemed to leave their soul(s) at the hotel, or more likely at the bank!  The J Geils Band however managed to make a 10,000 seat arena seem like the local tavern in anytown USA.  The entire crowd wasn't just on their feet, they were on their chairs and all of us never stopped jumping, dancing and screaming.  Thirty-five years and countless concerts later I can still say that it was the best concert I've ever been to and if there is any doubt that they are and always will be the best live band of all time, here is the proof... funky, raunchy, sweaty and exhilarating... and not a bad song in the lot!  I suppose 'Geils' never got their just acclaim because they lacked the edge that attracts so many people to the more popular bands.  They weren't glitzy, they weren't dangerous, they weren't geniuses; they were just fun.  The J Geils Band is simply the best cheeseburger ever, which in my opinion is the best praise anyone can give a great American band!

B000KKPN5C|4.0|While this is a Speedlight, it is the most basic Speedlight there is. It is completely controlled through the camera and has no controls of its own (other than pointing the flash head up for bounce flash - the main reason I bought this unit).<br /><br />It is a significant improvement over the on-camera flash. More powerful and quicker recharge without taxing the camera battery are immediate benefits. Learn to pivot the head and use bounce flash to provide gentle, even light from the ceiling and your indoor photos will improve dramatically without the harsh, direct light and sometimes unwanted shadows straight forward flash can give you. This capability was the main reason I invested in the SB-400. As others have mentioned, though, the SB-400 only pivots up so if you turn the camera for portrait oriented shots, you can no longer bounce the light off the ceiling. I've wished a few times for sideways pivoting as afforded by the higher-end models, but not enough to regret buying the SB-400. Other reviewers have noted other limitations, but this is the only one I have been troubled enough with to make me lower my rating from 5 stars to 4.<br /><br />You can also play with adding a cap or homemade softbox to diffuse the light for a softer effect. You could try this with the on-camera flash, but the puny output won't add that much light. For the casual photographer with a Nikon DSLR, this is an effective, budget-friendly way to add more flexibility and quality results to your shooting. More serious photographers will move on to the larger units, but moving up to any Speedlight can get you results orders of magnitude better than the on-camera flash. So if you're looking for ways to improve your shots (especially indoors) this is a good way to get results without spending a ton of money.

B00B52F278|4.0|there was more action and story in this video than any other action video I have veiwed in quite awhile
0770437400|4.0|I thought this was a really interesting read. It is very different from the movie, instead it is as if 'Brad Pitt' had jotted down the stories of what people had experienced as he traveled, rather than finding out through one persons POV you get snippets from all over as it spread and the aftermath. Very interesting
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This was a lot of fun especially after I got ussain bolt. He's a crazy amount of fun since then. No doubt.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I didn't expect to like this book as well as enders game, most sequels disappoint, but speaker was every bit as good as enders game. A good book will make you think, to look at things from a different perspective to question what you know. It will also make you feel like you know these people ,been to this place. This book does that.

B000FC130E|5.0|This book was a very fun read. After reading this book I was introduced to a London that I could have never imagined. The book splits London into two divisions; the London Above and London Below. This descriptions and plot of the story are unique.
B00CX7OW1G|5.0|I'm an unsophisticated and quite ordinary moviegoer and am not qualified to review a work of art. Personally, I found the film to be beautiful beyond words yet disturbing in portraying the fallen nature of man. That is our lot in this life, weak humans that we are. Yet, we are privileged to touch heaven in our ability to love. Most moving to me was the transcendental love portrayed by the priest played by Javier Bardem. Despite all lack of the ecstasy of eros he was able to love the most unattractive of humans. Despite his loss of the sense of the presence of God, he found Him in his daily devotion to duty and love for the poor. That is so Christ-like and the way I want to be.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I need to say I'm not a good reviewer, I give every book 5 stars because all books are miracles to me. I can't imagine what it's like to come up with a beginning ,middle and end.

B008Y5OW20|2.0|What is it with British rock stars and their need to make tribute albums to the music they grew up with? Paul McCartney, Jeff Beck, and others have done the same thing, usually with rockabilly, and with the same disappointing results we see here. I've been a Jeff Lynne fan ever since he joined the Move--a band that would hardly seem able to be improved on--and he has done a lot of great work. This CD is not among that work. Oh, it's fine in it's way, I suppose. His trademark production is there (still sounding an awful lot like Roy Wood's sensibility), and he really is incapable of making a bad record. But what's the point here? These are songs that have been done to death by every lounge singer and wedding band in the world, and while Lynne's style gives them some slight lift, they are still the worn-out chestnuts they always were, and Lynne is just not enough of a vocal powerhouse to carry it off.<br /><br />His strength is in his own songwriting, and that's where he needs to be focused. It's just like Jeff Beck doing his rockabilly record: that music was great in its day and in its way, but Beck took the music to a level several light years beyond that--rockabilly artists should be doing a tribute album of his material. And while Jeff Lynne may not be able to claim a similarly superior skill to some of the songwriters represented here, he's certainly not below them. The man who wrote \\"Do Ya\\" and \\"No Time\\"  and \\"Can't Get it Out of My Head\\" needs no excuses and takes a back seat to no one. This CD may be loving, but it's lazy. When you've had that much success, it's all too easy to lay back and make pet projects like this. But that's doing a disservice to the gift you've been given. You have to stay hungry. Here, Lynne is way too well-fed.

B000WGWQG8|2.0|The opening incident of the first episode of this series is so painfully slow and belabored that I'm not inclined to watch any more. There is nothing in it to engage the viewer. I'm sure that Paul Giamatti was chosen for the title role because of his facial resemblance to Adams, but someone else should have been cast.
B004JMZWMG|4.0|One of my favorite albums 30 years ago  Remastered CD brings out sounds and dynamics absent from old format.  Excellent music, but my particular copy was marred and did not play properly.  BTW, Procol Harum with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra was the best.

B003WC5EQI|1.0|Spoiler alert!  This was such a tragic story from the beginning to the end.  Nothing good happens to this poor girl-she just couldn't get a break.  You should also be warned that there is nudity and rape in this show. I also felt that it should have been rated for an older audience.  The only reason I finished it was because I kept thinking that at least all would end well.  I'm sorry but being hanged because she finally killed the man who raped her and ruined her life was just too much for me.  Hated it!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I finished Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea by Barbara Demick.  Fantastic set of stories that feed my morbid fascination with this cruel Stalinist anachronism though I think Russians had it far better.  The stories of the people Barbara interview are fraught with tragedy and terror yet they end with hope for a better future. I tore through the book in a little over four hours because I wanted to see how the interviewees lives fared.  Barbara spins their tales in such a way that you really care for the individuals while still getting an unfettered look at life in this criminal regime.

B0095G5AFU|1.0|Created a book, typed one page, and now there is no menu or anything to save the page or close the book. I have a new 2013 Kindle Fire. I wasted my money on this app.  I really wanted this to work. One app to organize all my lists. Good idea. Poor product!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This very practical guide to proving your thoughts make your world is an exciting venture. I highly recommend using it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Liked it lots. Wish things didn't break down so frequently. Love trying to move things around. Money gains fast, but the other stuff takes a long time.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I've loved it. The song is cute. The only reason I'm rating four stars is because the screen goes black sometimes. Otherwise, it's challenging and funny. My daughter watches the song over and over. I love to see her having fun. (If u thought this review waz helpful say yes if disappointing say no)<br />Jessina
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved this book. I went into it thinking it was more about a love story, but I was very wrong. I couldn't put this down.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I have owned these since 2007.  They are lightweight and very comfortable.  I have since purchased headphones that cost three times as much and the difference in sound quality is negligible.  These are supremely accurate phones;  they reproduce just what was recorded.  If you are looking for deep bass, for example, you are not going to get it unless deep bass is what was recorded in the first place.  At sub $90, these are an incredible value.
B002RKSZS0|2.0|I couldn't stay with the story; found it very trite and boring.  Didn't go beyond the first four chapters.  Maybe it gets better; but I didn't want to waste any more time on it.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I had greatly enjoyed reading The Kingmaker's Daughter by Philippa Gregory. I learned more about Anne Neville and her family and marriage to King RichardIII.
B009Z5975A|5.0|five stars for the memories these three movies brought back! picture quality on  gremlins2 is probably the best out of the three. This is considering how old goonies and gremlins 1 were. No high def back then of course but some tinkering on blue ray player settings really took care of the VHS look. If you like the whole grainy old school look then I'd just pop em right in. I chose to put TV on &#34;sports&#34; mode to give a more &#34;HD&#34; look. Sound quality is solid.  Hearing Sloth in 5.1 was pretty cool. :))
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great for McGuyver wannabes like me. I'm excited to see what is coming next.  Excellent game! Thank you!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This story was beautifully written and was able to hold my interest throughout. I loved the way Kate Morton moved from past to present and back again. It was a little difficult to keep track of the story line at first but the book was totally engrossing. A great read!
B005723JSQ|4.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down. However, the footnotes did NOT work most of the time, which is a shame because they really added to the story. So, be warned about the ebook version!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Once I went through the tutorial, this game was a blast. Great pointers on how to solve the puzzles. Many hours of play here, with beautiful graphics and pleasant sound effects. Just great, all-around fun!<br /><br />I do wish the higher level puzzles (10x10 & 15x15) allowed for more mistakes - it is hard to complete some of those with only 3 misses allowed.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a great game. I love this game, I have been playing this game since I bought it. I hope the make a #2. I rated it 5 star. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!! :p
B0092S4WLY|5.0|The game was great.  It wasn't too difficult, but it was challenging and kept your interest.  I was disappointed there weren't more floors. Just as you are getting into the game, it ends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids have enjoyed this game very much. It is suitable for all ages. It is a very appropriate game for kids of all ages. If your kids enjoy subway surfer they will love this game.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|At first all the timelines were disconcerting, but then they became  woven together.  In ways so unforseen, Abe and pari s' reunion was beautiful.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Gritty. Can it approach reality? I can only hope not. But it is fascinating all the same. I enjoy not having to wait a week between shows.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a story of individuals finding out the truth and lies of their underground community. I loved the flawed but realistic relationships that were intertwined with revelations, adventure and redemption. This was a great read. I am excited to read the next books in this series: Shift and Dust. Thank you Hugh Howey for such an amazing story.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|i love this app because my son loves and minecraft lovers this game is for GET IT ITS SO FUN
B0018LX9T4|5.0|This movie is about the mind and its' perception of and need for love. The alternative path  in this particular style was based totally on the trust necessary for every individual who allows another to possess their body and soul to the unbound limits of joy....which is shared by both. I guess it is like the saying &#34;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder&#34;  Mr. Spader and Ms Gilynhall  were exceptional in their roles. the setting was perfect and the supporting actors were  on spot. what an awesome way to tell  a story of alternative Love. It was great
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like it but they should really keep it up to date by updating it every month or something(kindle fire)
B008Y212PI|4.0|Most are easy but yet you have to think thru your options.  An entertaining way to idle away some spare time
020530902X|5.0|Would recommend this publication for paralegal professionals.Helps to answer many questions in an easy format; price was excellent as well.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Very intriguing and addictive. Satisfaction is always guaranteed when you finally open the door!!! Please keep the levels coming I just can't get enough!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I like this game ...add me 38e632 .  Don't know where I can find friends. can someone help me. Need friends .
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|The game is loads of fun and really exciting to play.  Maybe a little unexciting for some players, but just right to relaxes to at the end of a day.
B005SAZFWK|5.0|It contains a lovely story line, the director is a genius, the actors are great! I enjoyed it very much.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love all the angry birds, but this is my favorite so far.  And it free, another plus. Great graphics.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This may be the best book I have ever read.  An easy quick read but also profound.  I am older so I have read hundreds of books...it is rare for a book to cause me to think about how I am living my life the way this book did. I can't remember the last time a book had that effect on me.  A gift when it happens. Just a wonderful book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I spend hours playing this and I'm not done with it yet. It's a great little game. I love that you can upgrade vehicles and all tnat. Maybe it gets a little dull sometimes when I'm just trying to score coins to buy better upgrades, but overall it's awesome.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This book kept me going non-stop.  I thought I had the ending figured out at least three different times.  What a surprise.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I got addicted to this show really fast , so I'm really happy to have all of Season 1 to watch whenever I want to.
B00BQ83VJM|3.0|Very light, escapist fiction.  Has several decent (not great) characters and a so-so plot.  If you've read any of his other &#34;Lincoln Lawyer&#34; novels, you won't be greatly disappointed with this one.  It's not what I would call a memorable book, but that may no0t be all bad.  You can read it again next year.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Decent game, too slow to earn stuff. Decent graphics, need more ways to earn money. More adventures &amp; ways to unlock things.
B00EJ2WBX4|4.0|Seems like the EP for Chvrches was everywhere - so either they are just that amazing or they have an amazing promoter.  Turns out, it's a bit of both.  Lots of good songs here and enough diversity in the album to keep you entertained.  Standouts include Lies, Lungs, The Mother We Share, Recover and Gun.  I like the expansive nature of the sound and the lyrics.  Definitely worth full price - a must have if it's on sale.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was both a page-turner and book that was hard to read.  It is hard to face the reality of the unbridled power of white men in the era of slavery, and the enslavement was not just of black people but of women, as well, in a very literal way.  This is a brave book and as difficult as it was for me to read, I am  deeply appreciate the clear, precise yet deeply compassionate way Kathleen Grissom told the story of the orphaned white girl, brought up with and by slaves.
B0000VCZKW|1.0|5 Stars for the movie, but 1 Star because NOT WIDESCREEN!  Nobody wants so-called \\"Full Screen\\" anymore, so why do these people keep producing these narrow DVD's?<br /><br />The British (Region 2) get this same movie in Widescreen, so why can't we get Widescreen in Region 1, where the movie was made?
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is good fun and ad long as you are prepared to wait (sometimes quite a while) is entertaining. Play other games similar to this and somehow they seem to move forward quicker. I do not pay for any extra bits and do not use friends to play as find they get pestered
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great graphics and easy to play. I play it on my Kindle and it works great. Easy to level up and easy to okay with your Facebook friends.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love it. It has helped me out with my Spanish class. I feel like my progress has moved forward a great deal!!!1
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Not a big sci do fan but really liked this book..Will read sequel.  Couldn't put it down and that is the main factor in how I grade a book
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a fantastic attorney show.  The acting and story lines are awesome.  Keeps you glued to the show the whole time.  I can't wait to watch more!!
B00C7E3ELE|5.0|Most reviews on this listing date back to 2002 when the MGM DVD of THE FOG was released<br /><br />well it's definitely time to update to this new Scream factory version.<br />THE FOG which John carpenter's 2nd film which i think is pretty Good Horror/thriller film<br />more of a supernatural thriller than a Horror actually.<br /><br />I know that Scream factory's version of THE FOG is much better DVD release than the 2002 MGM release, 10 times as better<br />here's why<br />first of all the Widescreen picture and audio has been given a brand new High Definition transfer personally by Cinematographer Dean cundey<br />who actually was the D.O.P on the Fog as opposed to some other Cinematographer coming in to do a new HD transfer<br />so there is big Difference in Picture and audio quality compared to the old 2002 MGM release<br />the picture quality looks amazing and beautiful and the Audio sounds really Good on this scream factory version.<br />plus the cover art can be flipped around to show the original VHS cover art which i prefer.<br /><br />About the special features/extras<br />well all the extras from the 2002 MGM release are all on this scream factory release anyway<br />TALES FROM THE FOG which is a making of Documentary with new interviews with cast and crew interviewed back in 2001<br />FEAR ON FILM INSIDE THE FOG Featurette which is a behind the scenes making of filmed in 1980<br />there is also outtakes, Trailers, Photo Gallery Tv spots etc<br />and the Audio commentary by John carpenter/Debra Hill recorded back in 2001<br />so all the extras from the 2002 MGM release have been brought over<br /><br />but there is also some brand new interviews aswell, a brand new Jamie Lee curtis interview goes for 15mins and a brand new Dean cundey interview<br />Horrors Hallowed Grounds- a new look at the films locations which is interesting<br />there is also a brand new Audio commentary by Adrienne barbeau, Tom Atkins and Tommy lee wallace<br /><br />so ignore theold reviews on this listing that are about the old 2002 MGM release, you might aswell sell the old release<br />amazon should seperate the old reviews with the brand new scream factory reviews cause no one is going to want the old MGM release<br />when this scream factory version is much better with all the extras brought over from the old MGM release<br />plus Dean cundey as personally supervised a brand new HD transfer<br />So Definitely get this updated 2013 scream factory version of THE FOG, Definitely worth the money.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|This version of Angry Birds makes me angry: 1. because I paid for it; 2. because I cannot get my money back; and 3. because I wasted 1 second of my life playing this poorly designed game.
B00CL151G4|5.0|This product was to my satisfaction. Shipped fast and arrived on time. If you like this type of show you won't be disappointed. Great show, love it.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This version of Angry Birds works and is enjoyable. I finally found a game from Roxio that was worth the money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a good game but I think it needs villagers,pistons,the end like in minecraft for Xbox and Pc,and I think the world's should be bigger,golems,and enchantment tables.
B004SBX112|3.0|Just average no real improvements or challenges. Difficult to add additional words to review to meet word requirement as this game is just average.
159514188X|5.0|It has been a long time since I have picked up a fiction novel to read, and an even longer time since I read an entire book in one day but that is exactly what happened when I inexplicably felt myself compelled to purchase this book.  Asher manages to simultaneously convey the overwhelming pain of Hannah, the young woman about whom the book revolves and the struggle to understand and come to terms as experienced by Clay as he hears Hannah's words.  The book is written in first person, but the reader gets to experience Hannah's story and then the immediate reactions of Clay, who is hearing it for the first time unaware of where exactly he fits in.<br /><br />Throughout the course of my book I found myself identifying with Hannah's experiences and with Clay's reactions to them.  There is pain, beauty, laughter and that difficult task of coming to grips with what one can never reconcile.  Ultimately, it would be extremely difficult to not be touched by this book and to find one's self really evaluating the occurrences of one's own life.  You really never know when it is going to be the last time you do something, say something or see someone and this book manages to express that, perhaps with a little nudge towards making sure that you are treating people the way you'd want to be treated.  It certainly seems to carry a theme of treating others well, but it doesn't preach it to you.  It allows you to learn that on your own.<br /><br />As the book comes to its conclusion, as Clay comes to a point where he must make a choice, I found myself reliving many moments of my own life and having to make a similar choice.  There is no way you can read this book and not begin to wonder about some of the people who have come and gone, or who still remain, in your life.  Where do they fit in, what do they mean to you and have you told them all the things you've wanted to?  If nothing else, this book will leave you with the haunting notion that there isn't always going to be a tomorrow to say what needs to be said.<br /><br />This book was written in an humorous, intelligent manner that could be read and understood by a teen as well as an adult.  Some of the subject matter dips into things which may appear \\"controversial\\" to more conservative minds, but if you're fifteen you've probably experienced some of these things already, even if your parents don't know.  Regardless of that, nothing is shown in an explicit light and those things which may be \\"controversial\\" raise important points which we should be able to discuss in a more direct manner.<br /><br />Highly recommended for someone who is looking for a book that will pull them in, keep them fascinated and maybe even change your perspective on life.w to say what needs to be said.<br /><br />This book was written in an humorous, intelligent manner that could be read and understood by a teen as well as an adult.

B004GYY714|3.0|Easy to operate but did not find many stations that either I listened to or played genre/playlist that I enjoyed.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I can usually predict the ending within the first couple of chapters. This story kept me guessing, with so many twists and turns. In a previous review someone had mentioned that it seemed like the second half of the book was written by someone else. At first I had to agree with that and it threw me off for about two or three chapters.  Now that I finished the book and saw the story unfold, I see that the twist was intentional. I could not put the book down and kept me guessing throughout. I gave it three stars just because it had a few crude paragraphs that made me cringe.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Lots of fun and no need to buy add-ons to move to new levels or gain new vehicles or landscapes.
B005IZLPME|5.0|Was looking to build my 3D library and trying to get all the Avengers individual titles at a price I could afford.  This Seller came through with a great price and superfast shipping.

0143122061|4.0|So here I go again, amazingly having to criticize one more author who astonishingly stumbled into the same slippery slope as another writer (Roland Baader) I had recently pointed out for committing the same mistake, that is, basically recommending the same \\"moral guidance\\" as guidebook for free individual human beings as Ferguson does. It seems to be a common error among conservatives, a twist of the mind that philosopher Ayn Rand precisely identified.<br />I'll start first with what is most necessary: Approving the largest part of \\"Civilization,\\" the book (also available as a most commendable DVD issue of the TV-Series) by Niall Ferguson, for it is a marvelous book (excepting its final part), a book that would have to be (here again with the exception I'll point out below) a \\"must read\\" for everybody, particularly every school-ager, every student, for it describes in precise terms the history of mankind's civilization and the six, as Ferguson calls them, \\"Killer Apps\\" that produced modern civilization.<br />Ferguson's deduction of the \\"Apps\\" themselves and their content are a true \\"tour de force,\\" for they clearly show what is required to follow the road of progress and steady betterment of civilization and the individual's life.<br />However, before writing the final part of \\"Civilization,\\" Ferguson should have read his wife's brilliant essay \\"How (and Why) I Became an Infidel,\\" where the brave Somalian (by birth) Ayaan Hirsi Ali describes how she found out what is the main problem, the main hindrance blocking a great many of civilization's fruitful, pacific and productive members from reaching a life of personal wellbeing and happiness. For Ferguson commits the mistake of including in his proposal to develop free individual human beings some books that lead directly to an irrational and, thus, harmful behavior due to the lack of an ethically defensible position. His final conclusions suggest, among others, which are valuable, as \\"foundational\\" some texts that aremost deplorable, among them the King James's Bible, Adam Smith's \\"Moral Sentiments\\", and William Shakespeare's plays.<br />History in itself clearly indicates that religions in general, and the Bible as one of its main culprits, are one of the main basis of hate, persecution, criminal acts, war and destruction. The Bible itself lacks the very basis of morality, for the Genesis prohibits the imagined inhabitants of the \\"Paradise\\" to taste the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil, the opposition between both being the very basis of morality. Hence, the Bible and books like Smith's \\"Moral Sentiments\\" cannot be recommended as a moral guidance. Further on, Shakespeare's plays relish the display of hate, murder and destruction. Hence, no ethical instruction can be found here either.<br />Ferguson, in all probability, stated his recommendations due to not having read Ayn Rand's Philosophy of Objectivism or, having rejected it, wasn't able to prognosticate the creation of the New Age of Reason and, through it, full human progress. Still, her short essay \\"The Objectivist Ethics\\" should have been pointed out to him, for it contains the essence of a truly ethical guide for mankind. Added to it, Diamandis & Kotler's \\"Abundance\\" rounds up a clear view of what future marvels can be expected of mankind's further historical evolution.<br />By not having paid attention to the foregoing details, Ferguson was forced to assume, as most historians do, that Western civilization is fated to its own destruction. History, i.e. mankind's development, highlights, however, a very different path. If it wouldn't, mankind's evolution would never have left any of its earlier stages, nay, life itself wouldn't have developed, in spite of all the necessary elements being available on the planet. For evolution doesn't operate only by destruction but does so mainly by change, which builds itself up unnoticed, specially by those who should be first aware of coming events.<br />Just a fewexamples should suffice to make my point clear: 1) While during the Middle or, should I better say, Dark Ages the authoritarian domination of religion pretended to eternalize its domination over society, the Renaissance happened, triggered by some individuals confronted with reality, which obliged them to search for answers that weren't irrational and \\"otherworldly\\". Copernicus, Kepler, Galilei are a few names that come to mind among all those that did not destroy the then existing society but CHANGED it to bring civilization forward; 2)At the end of WWII Germany continued to be run by the \\"economic\\" system that had been established by the Nazis. And yet, even under different circumstances, this kind of economic organization was unable to endure and were finally replaced, in 1948, by the so-called \\"Economic Miracle;\\" 3) At the very verge of the breakdown of Germany's territorial division, which seemed to be everlasting, several political figures officially declared that this division would remain forever. And yet, shortly after voicing this assertion, and without any shattering violence happening, the whole Communist \\"empire\\" crumbled to pieces, and 4) Same happened in China, where Mao seemed to have raised an \\"eternal\\" domination. But then came Deng Xiaoping, shoved Communism as an economic and industrial hogwash aside and established a semi-Capitalist type of society, Capitalism being the social system on the upsurge which, through however many loops and turns, will not just place China but the whole world on the road to continued progress.<br />Niall Ferguson should have taken all these facts into consideration at the time of writing the final part of \\"Civilization,\\" instead of becoming so infatuated with Max Weber's Protestant \\"ethic,\\" for it wasn't this what produced the modern way of civilization of progress and wellbeing, but what Ayn Rand recognized as what truly is the dynamo of human progress: Personal Egoism. Same, on the basis of the ethics she deducedfrom reality itself, determines mankind's future.<br />Keeping the warning voiced through this comment in mind, Ferguson's books are evidently most readable and should be read by all readers of this analysis.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|IMAX 3D was created for a film like this. I felt totally immersed in space--watching the scenes unravel as if it were happening in real time! The first opening scene was unlike anything I'd ever seen before on film--a continuous shot of about 10-15 minutes worth of soundless space, a stunning view of Earth, and then...was that Ed Harris I heard?  Oh man, the right stuff was back!<br /><br />Alfonso Cuaron and his crew (the supporting players both on and off screen) deserve every accolade possible for this masterpiece. Cuaron is a cinematic genius! I read in an article that this filmmaking endeavor took him and his son, Jonas, four years before production started. What a feat in filmmaking! Everything about \\"Gravity\\" is spectacular. Oscars will be flowing for this film...<br /><br />Sandra Bullock, well, she was born to play this role. She gave the performance of a lifetime. There were no quick takes.  These were very long scenes--and for an actor (all alone)--no interaction to play off another... for her to had conveyed that sense of helplessness and terror and heart-wrenching hope. How did she do it?!<br /><br />The supporting cast was great: Ed Harris' voice-over at NASA's Mission Control Center and George Clooney--the comic relief.  I don't normally like him, but in this role, he was fantastic.<br /><br />Steven Price...where had he been all this time??? This man was another genius!  The film score was impeccable.  The music added to the intensity and action of the film--and the climax--WOW!!! It was an edge of your seat ride--literally!<br /><br />Hands-down the best film of 2013!!! Also, it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's a groundbreaking--unique movie experience--which has been long, long overdue. This is the kind of movie that makes me so passionate about films.  Thank you, Cuaron, and to everyone else who was a part of the making of \\"Gravity\\"!!!! This is something I will re-watch time and time again.
1781162646|5.0|I have recomended this book to everyone.  Especially the audiobook version as it makes you feel as your a part of it.  It takes you to a time in you childhood that brings back great memories and another sweet remembered love affair you too may have had that failed. Didn't we all at one time or another??  Another wonderful story because he is the master!!! I buy everything he writes even though I work at our local library.  That way I can savor and enjoy it like a fine wine.  I truly hope he keeps writing and making t.v. shows too.  Also I wish Tabitha would write another book. I have all of her books too.  READ READ :) :)

B007VDN1PA|5.0|I opened the box and got ready to scan following as best I could the directions but could not get it to scan nor would it connect to my computer. After several hours of trying to get it to work, I e-mailed the customer service and within 15 minutes I had a message asking if Sam could call me.  Sam solved my problem.  Dumb me I was holding the scan button too long. He walked me through the workings of the scanner and I have successfully scanned all my husband's Vietnam slides and ready for more.  Great little scanner and I would highly recommend it and Sam.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a wonderful story. I didn't figure out the ending until I was almost there.  The book is very well written and was a joy to read.
B00441GYZ6|5.0|I love practically any film that focuses on law.  I am especially drawn to crazy, &#34;OMG&#34;, and funny law movies.  This movie has all three.  If you haven't seen it, little warning, it has graphic (and some may even say tasteless) images but they are what makes the film.  It is based on true accounts which makes it even better.  Woody Harrelson does a fantastic job playing the founder of Hustler Magazine.  It is a far cry from his character on Cheers haha.  Edward Norton did a great job as well.  It may not be for everyone but if you are a movie buff and/or law movie fan then this is one to have in your collection.
B005LAII3A|5.0|I am a big fan of Colin Farrell movies and this is the best one I have ever watched, Thanks
B007TR1R22|4.0|I am a fan of both Rachel Weisz and the very handsome Tom Hiddleston.  This is not a very well known movie but it is one I have recommened to many people.  You can't help but feel compassion for all the characters in this film.  I'm sorry but I rarely give plot details in a review, especially in a movie that many haven't heard about.  I suggest, if you are a fan of both or just one of the title characters, that you own this film.  It is a great film to watch when you are in the mood for a dark romance movie.

A break in the line can result in failing to eliminate targeted symbols or failing to reap the benefits of a power-up.<br /><br />WITH a good stylus, such as<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007FXMOV8 New Trent Arcadia 2PCS Micro-Knit \\"Clickpen\\" Stylus (TwinPack, Black + White), for iPhone 5 4 4s, iPod touch, iPad: 1st gen/2/the NEW iPad/ iPad 4th gen with Retina display, Samsung Galaxy Tablet and Phone, Motorola Tablet and Phone, Blackberry Tablet a...]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0064REJ3C New Trent Limir Stylus/Styli Touch Screen Cell phone Tablet Pen Champa Dual-Purpose with Micro-Knit Technology Capacitive Stylus and Fine Ball Pen]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008UC7LRA Chromo Inc.® Mesh Stylus Father's Day Gift Set - Extreme-Durable Pro Series, 1 Black & 1 Silver Stylus in Chrome Gift Box]]<br /><br /> the game ran flawlessly.

B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is fun but having to post stuff for goals is annoying.<br />Other than that it is a fun game.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|A very clever novel, - I am surprised it hasn't been picked up as movie material as it keeps the reader on the edge of the page so to speak right up until the very end!  Wilde's written language is superb and keeps one totally intellectual engaged. I am sorry I didn't read this earlier. I thought he was just a British dilettante from another century.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Amazing and infuriating. Sensual but perverse. Erotic yet frightening. Dreamy and scary. Powerful but intimidating. Invigorating yet heart stopping. I am looking at people differently on the street. Who lives this life?! I'm intrigued.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|5 stars hands down!  This book is a prime example of why reading fiction is a worthy pastime. This was a thoroughly thought provoking and mesmerizing tale. I did not put it down until I finished it.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Movie was great but the rental was a three day purchase ad after watching it once I was no longer able to access it to watch it again.This sucks,Thanks Amazon!Just want to add to this review that after a brief call to Amazon they fixed the problem and I am greatfull to them for there great customer service.Amazon rocks.

B007HO392S|5.0|Arrived with split box  but CD is ok, thankfully.  Love this CD by Carrie, very special meaning for me in &#34;See U Again&#34;, that was the song played for my grandmothers funeral, that was the drive behind me getting this Cd. My mother in law was buried with one of Carries other songs of a greatest hits of various artists song was How Great Thou Art, I held my grand daughter on my lap & sang along I didn't care if I wasn't in key, it made it easier to say good bye to my mother in law.
B003B02O14|4.0|I've been a fan of John Grisham for years.This book ranks up there with The Firm. The Partner is a must read.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|This was just an okay book with no new twists and so so characters.  I enjoyed reading about places I had visited but I doubt that I would recommend this to my friends.  It was fine because it was free and a quick read.
B000001EL3|3.0|Well, I just had a listen to this at Youtube. The whole thing. Ummm... Things were looking pretty good up until \\"Flaming Youth\\". Then I heard \\"Sweet Pain\\" (one of my favorite Kiss songs ever), and I hated it. Not sure what to make of it, quite frankly. Nor do I care for the reworked album art, though Ken Kelly has always been one of my favorite artists.<br /><br />Fortunately, even as I listened to this cd, I was scouring Ebay for the 1997 remastered edition. I just ordered it minutes ago. There are some pluses to the Ezrin remixed version, and I may very well end up getting it someday. For now, however, I just want to hear \\"Destroyer\\" the way I heard it back when I was twelve.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|At $35 this is impulse buy territory. Takes less than 3 minutes to set up, and instantly give you the ability to stream youtube, netflix, and any open tab you have on your Chrome web browser. It's worth it as it stands today, let alone the fact that they'll keep improving it and adding support for new apps (Hulu plus was added like a week prior to my typing this).
B0058YPILY|4.0|The series is almost flawless! All disks play smoothly, the delivery arrived promptly, and nothing was damaged. My only concern is the new, large singular plastic case that replaced the individual sliding cases on the previous seasons. The disks seem a little less secure- but other than that, I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Have not had the opportunity to view the series yet. the 1st season was great so the verdict is still out on this.

B00C2VIA52|5.0|I'm not usually into battle card games but I'm hooked on this one. The graphics are cool, the story line is kind of basic but once you start playing it won't matter.

B00594XOZU|1.0|So I deleted my kik because my cousin kept hacking into it, but when I downloaded it wouldn't let me log in. I have tried everything , deleting and downloading the app, turning on and off my wireless network,and restarting my kindle. This is starting to really frustrate me. Someone please get it working!
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This is the best game ever it reminds me of GTA I love this game so much I posted<br />Reviews on every version of this game but my God this is the best version yet!!  NOTE NOT A WATSE OF MONEY TRUST ME IT MIGHT COST SEVEN FRIGGIN DOLLARS BUT WHEN YOU GET THE GAME YOU'LL BE LIKE WHAT SEVEN DOLLARS?

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched all three seasons back to back.  Can't wait for season 4.  I now understand all the hype!  I however was sad with the Season 3 ending :(.
140006922X|5.0|There is so much to learn here. Aslan doesn't just start and end with Josephus as so many other popularized books do. He has researched and exposed many Roman, Jewish and Christian sources that we rarely see to get at the whole cultural milieu surrounding Jesus life and times.<br /><br />It isn't that there is anything new here--though it may be new to some readers,--but most people who simply read the New Testament never discover the culture, history and politics which lie behind the basic narrative. Of course the New Testament gospels were written at least forty years after the death of Jesus. So nothing there is of first hand knowledge. It is all &#34;hand me downs&#34;. That doesn't make it all wrong, but simply makes it impossible to know, for sure, what is in any sense &#34;factual&#34; and what is accretion from second and third generation Christian community.<br /><br />But more important, understanding the meaning of the story does depend on understanding the historical backdrop. Ignoring the latter, the Jesus story becomes one of many personalized stories of a miracle-worker who purports to be somehow tied directly to God. But the historical background shows the underlying political center of the life of Jesus.
B000V5ZIBU|4.0|When Deep Space Nine came out, essentially replacing Star Trek Next Generation, a lot of us didn't like it much. For one thing, the aspect of the show was dark; the space station seemed dark and rather dreary. And the new characters, Sisko, Odo, Kira, didn't seem to blend well with favorites like O'Brien from TNG. And then there were all the Ferengis. If you had to pick an alien species to focus on, why the Ferengis? Annoying little trolls with irritating habits. Did they have any redeeming qualities?<br /><br />But after watching \\"The Emissary\\" and then the series, one after the other in streaming video, I realized, this is a very good sci-fi series, even if Ben Sisko will never be as popular as Jean-Luc Picard. The Bajor-Cardassian conflict makes for some good conflict and plenty of plotting and planning revenge. What is that Garak doing, a Cardassian as a tailor? And Quark, the Ferengi bartender, is acted so well by Armin Shimerman that he develops as an interesting character.<br /><br />While the characters never seem to take on the personality that happened on Star Trek Next Generation, the writing is excellent and the episodes full of adventure. It did not take three seasons for this series to find its way, and in fact the first two seasons are quite good, not the case with Next Generation, which took three seasons to become popular and frankly, the first two seasons are awfully hard to watch.<br /><br />While you can purchase these as DVDs with extras such as Deep Space Nine: A Bold Beginning, crew dossiers on Kira Nerys, and stuff about Quark's bar and the imaginative aliens, I watch mine in Amazon Prime. Long series with many seasons make for good evening watching, when you can download two or three episodes and really get into the series. While the characters never seem to develop as well as the Next Generation (Troi, Picard, Crusher, Data and Geordi) the writing and plots seem actually better in Deep Space Nine and it's one of the best science fiction series ever aired.ies ever aired.
B005EHILV4|2.0|I purchased this at the same time as I purchased a Behringer microphone. The combination was noisy and even with the gain reduced to zero, pulsed and made a cycling sound. Whether this was caused by the microphone or the mixer was impossible to tell as I didn't have an alternative for either so as to swap them out. Because of this I returned both of them. My uncertainty is why I am giving both products two stars.<br /><br />I am unlikely to purchase another Behringer product, even though others have had some good reviews and will probably go with one of the competition.<br /><br />I must say that Amazon accepted the return without question and refunded my money. I don't often return products, but when I do I'm pleased with this company's attitude. (When I returned something because I screwed up, I did have to pay a small fee for shipping and handling, but that seems absolutely fair.) So while I gave both the microphone and the mixer two stars, I do give Amazon five stars.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Amazing panoramas, colorful, inventive, lots of slapstick yet the storyline draws you in, especially if you've got a teenage daughter (or son, I'm sure).  Many of the creatures are absurd enough to lighten up the story and are well placed.  The voice characterization and dialog was great, &#34;Belt&#34; was a good accessory yet didn't show up enough to make him a blatant advertisement for the toy trade.  Watched as an instant video, but this may be the first purchase I make that is not physical media (I may still purchase the DVD too, but with younger ones it's safer to have a backup in the cloud when you find yourself handed scratched dvd's with tears with questions like &#34; why doesn't it play?&#34;).
B0064W667Y|5.0|I suspect I'll end up with the series.  Seventy years old and I'm still a comics fan.  I really like the stories and the art.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|As always, excellent. Did not put it down until  after the review. More more. Looking forward to more of Theo and more books by Mr. Grisham. Thank you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It really makes you think and get creative. My grandkids and I like to play it together!<br />Can't wait for new levels to come out.
B007BLEKPM|4.0|Interesting story - well acted and compelling.  Clint Eastwood again proves his skill at directing and casting in this movie.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|Gravity is a pretty easy movie to sum up. Beautiful visuals thanks to 100% convincing CGI, great acting and a musical score that adds so much to what you are seeing. There is not too much of a story other than survival in space, though some character development emerges as the movie goes along. Sandra Bullock delivers a performance that should get her another Oscar nomination. Her acting here is very natural and believable. George Clooney is likeable and a perfect contrast to Bullock's uptight and nervous character. I expect to see Gravity up for multiple awards (Picture, Director, Actress, Visuals Effects and numerous other technical ones). Sure it is more of a thrill ride than a structured movie, but it is unlike any movie I've ever seen, especially in IMAX 3-D.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|App works just like the version on other available platforms and is easy to read and use. This definitely adds functionality to my kindle fire hd.

0060392584|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Consistently held my attention which is rare. Very honest, non stop interesting. I loved the book!
B00FAIW0ZA|5.0|I was very impressed with BBT's The Underfall Yard, which led me to also buy The Difference Machine.  When English Electric part 1 came out, I felt it was better than the other two.  It has very memorable passages and a clear theme.  Part 2 is just as strong and carried the same themes.  With Full Power, they've reordered the songs and added 4 new tunes, all together clocking in at more than 2 hours of great stuff.  The new music serves as sonic glue piecing the two together.  English Electric is very emotive and solemn at times.  This is outstanding music, both in the writing and sheer talent of the performers.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Like a satisfying meal......delicious but no post gustatory regrets. I didn't realise how much Danny was missed until he was found.
B00DB2JQ7W|3.0|I was pretty excited for this release as it had been awhile since a new studio album from Warren Haynes and Co. Warren certainly continues his virtuosity but the material and lyrics, especially early on just aren't some if the band's best. Much of this sounds very much like (too alike) their last release. The great songwriting of the past just isn't here.  I've always said the vast majority off songwriters have just so many good songs in them. I hope this isn't the case here with Haynes.
B0007KTBIU|2.0|Upon arrival, the disc appeared in excellent condition.  Unfortunately, when it was played, it stopped (hesitated) several times during playback.  Even after cleaning the DVD player, the disc still hesitated during playback.  I am not overly happy with this product.  This is the first product purchased through Amazon that has not proved satisfactory.
B00B2QG3K2|1.0|Paramore can perform, and put on a show, she has tons of energy and a voice I have fallen in love since day I heard her. I understand the band was trying to show another side of them, I honestly think they should stick to their old style if they want to keep the name PARAMORE. The reason I started to listen to Paramore in the first place was that hard sounding not-so-mainstream rock music where Haley's passionate, powerful, perfectly pitched and extremely flexible, angelical voice that was sent into battle armed with a set of heavy drums, hot-picking power chord distorted guitar. This album did not give me the sensation i got from the rest of Paramore albums. So to anyone that liked Paramore's original style from previous albums such as Riot, this album may be a dud. i have to make one exception &#34;I am into you&#34; (thats why i gave it one star. One star for one good song the album had.
B001LF3YQK|3.0|We used this wipes case for a couple of months after our son was born. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work very well for us. Wipes dry out easily, it doesn't fit many at a time, and it is much more cumbersome than I expected and takes up more space than a bag of wipes.<br />We just stick with a \\"refill\\" bag these days as it is more effective.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I'm always curious about the certain time periods and how our country thrived. This book transported me to the late 20s and I enjoyed the story immensely. Beautiful friendship between the 2 characters.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I think of this guy often now, Sorry he was taken from us. True warrior, he seemed to be a real Texan type of guy.  Great stories in there, any buddy in the Mil would like this for sure.<br />Thanks Chris, God Bless

B00000ADG2|5.0|Nothing could ever be wrong with a Lauryn Hill CD. Great price just to buy to have it on hand. No one listens to CDs anymore but it is cool just to have it for decoration or a collection maybe.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I never wanted to watch this when it was on tv, but I found myself completely absorbed in the stories. Somehow the intimacy of watching it on my Kindle Fire made it my little &#34;secret&#34; pleasure. To my surprise, it is intelligent and witty. I'm not sure the premise will hold up for a long series, but season 1 was fast paced and actually almost believable. Many other &#34;legal&#34; shows begin to challenge reality, but here, it was only necessary to believe in our star and her solid determination to keep going what ever the day might bring.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I read this book in one day. I heard it was a good book so I bought it. It was first person which I love so that really helped in my reading this book. It was a good book for the most part. Sometimes I feel like it drags and that there are certain parts that aren't even needed in the book. And honestly I think they were all horrible reasons for committing suicide.
1400049628|5.0|I loved this book!!  It was easy to read and follow.  It had a lot of great tips.  I will be offering copies of this book at my upcoming &#34;Emergency Preparedness&#34; programs for my community....Emergency Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse.  This is supported by the CDC and FEMA.  &#34;If you are prepared for a zombie apocalypse, you are prepared for any emergency.&#34;<br /><br />I would recommend reading this book before offering an emergency preparedness class of any kind.
B003F9RHU4|3.0|I stopped watching a month or so ago, and I just started watching again. It is a struggle. I will try to make it through season one, but this is a one dimensional show with a cast to match.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works pretty well...I have had some connectivity interruptions.  I would recommend it to anyone with a &#34;dumb&#34; TV.....BOOO YAAAAAHHH! Whammy!
0981951252|5.0|This book had an strong positive effect on my life.  The author explains that we have all the knowledge we need, now we just have to act upon it.  The rest of it is about hard work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game.  Good challenges that work your brain pretty good.  Can't wait for more levels.  Hopefully they'll make more soon.
0345525558|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was so good, I could not keep it down. I was hooked from the very beginning!!<br /><br />I love this book because it was very sad and tragic, however there was a real person dealing with her internal struggles and winning her battles...after some damage that is. But it was inspiring to read about this young woman's struggles and see her mistakes but watch her change too.<br />This was also a very interesting sub-plot with regards to the flowers. I had not thought about it much but this was another entirely interesting piece to the book.<br /><br />I loaned it to a friend and she hasn't started reading yet and I wanting to ask for it back because I really do want to read it again.<br />Ha!!
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Not normally a big fan of puzzle type games without an RPG element. This, however, was compelling enough. I really enjoyed the artwork for one, and two the mechanics (including the talisman powers) really hooked me. I got it for free on Amazon, and then proceeded to play the story till the end. This makes me reconsider the puzzle genre, and even with the story down, the survival challenge are great.
0788859544|5.0|My granddaughter loved it, I loved it, Ariel is a cutie,  what else can I say, but buy it for all of you.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|FUN GAME This was a first for me and I found it fun and challenging. I look forward to playing it often.
030758836X|4.0|I really like the book and had high hopes for it. It was very good until the end. The end was weak. Overall, the concept of the story and the way it is put together is a lot of fun though.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Fast paced action and love the variety of armor styles. This game is like a combo of need for speed and subway riders
B00DIZS4LQ|5.0|This is one of the best recordings now available. Very moving and the sound was incredible. All the soloists were superb..
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a nice game to fill up time. The tasks though, take too long and I have to spend a lot of energy and money, which makes it impossible to buy things. :( But overall, I guess it's a pretty good game. :)
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Good book full if twists and turns. Keeps you guessing throughout.  I can hardly wait for the next addition to come out.
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a beautiful story. I can't wait to share this one with my sister and start another by this author.

B008Y212PI|5.0|Building a picture by solving puzzles is a very unique concept.  You are presented with a high quality photographic background with question marks dispersed through out the image.  Each question mark represents a puzzle and a picture element such as a bird, dog, flower, etc., though you need to solve the puzzle to see what the image is.  To view the complete scene you will need to solve 8 or 10 puzzles.  I often found myself guessing what image each puzzle might reveal, which added to the enjoyment.<br /><br />The puzzles are divided into levels of difficulty from easy to very challenging.  There is a short but very good tutorial that any age group can follow and does a very good job explaining the process to follow to be successful.  The basis for solving the puzzles centers around deductive reasoning.  Each puzzle consists of a rectangular image divided into rows and columns of square tiles.  You either 'paint' a tile with a brush to keep it or you use a hammer to smash it to pieces to create an empty space.  Both actions are accompanied by an appropriate sound.  Your shown at the beginning of each row or column how many painted tiles there are and the spacing between individual or groups of tiles.  The blank spaces left after smashing tiles is a great help in determining which ones should be painted.<br /><br />First of all children will love seeing each image revealed and make them want to solve more puzzles.  In addition, it's a fun and addictive way for youngsters to learn and understand deductive reasoning.  But it's just as well suited for the elderly, they too will enjoy the images and it will allow them to exercise and maintain their mental acuity.<br /><br />I highly recommend this app for everyone!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I can't say too much about this spy comedy without ruining the story for you. An all-star cast led by, Willis, Malkovich, Freeman and others will have you laughing so hard you'll have to watch it again just to watch the parts you missed while laughing so hard. The film was a big hit and gave way to a sequel even funnier than this one was. Buy them both, you'll love them. Malkovich is especially a riot to watch in a comedy roll if you've only seen his dramatic performances.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout shares her informative yet entertainingly humorous take, on putting the law of attraction into action.  The experiments are fun (and funny!) and only take a short while to complete.  Your outcomes will be as big as you dare.  Compared to other books on the subject (and I've read a few over the past 20 plus years!), this book cuts to the chase yet manages to include God, Einstein and pet turtles - and that's just Experiment #1.  Read it.  You have nothing to lose.  There are only off-the-wall amusements and possibilities to gain!
B009NQXXZ6|4.0|I like this movie very much.  Good story, really good music, and I like Streisand and especially Kristofferson in this film.  I own this movie in Blu-ray book form and it's awesome!  I would recommend this film.  Very entertaining.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the app I play the most and I love it. And I got a cheat app that makes it even better LOVE IT!!!!
B000N3AXQU|5.0|This is SUCH a good film.  Sylvester Stallone does a really great job in this film as the &#34;over the hill&#34; fighter who's tryin' just one more time and giving it his all.  Love the story, the acting, and seeing some of the original actors that were in the very first Rocky movie.  I'm not really a Sylvester Stallone fan BUT I really enjoyed THIS film.  Very entertaining!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Finished this, and all I can say is... wow. Ok, maybe I can say a little more....<br /><br />The last 10 years or so, I've though King has gone a bit down hill. Duma, Key, Lisey's Story, Under the Dome, The Cell... I enjoyed all of them, but by the standards I hold Stephen King to, they were mediocre. Then came 11/22/63. Not only does that make an extremely short list of best King books ever, it makes my top 10 list of all time favorite books. If you haven't read it, you've really missed something special.<br /><br />So is he back to top form? I haven't read Joyland, mainly because it's not available on Kindle. But Doctor Sleep would suggest the answer is a resounding yes! I don't think it's as good as 11/22/63, but not many books are. He really seemed to have poured his heart and sould in to that one (I know that sounds corny, but to me it's a very beautiful book on so many levels). But Doctor Sleep is good enough for me to say it's one of his top 5 books, along with The Stand, 11/22/63, The Dark Tower series (especially The Song of Susannah) and IT. Ok, i can't leave out Hearts in Atlantis... so make that top 6...<br /><br />I'll be curious to see if you like this as much as I did... Catching up with Danny Torrance was like running in to an old friend...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love it. was really gun and I played it a lot it is a most get more coin yeah y
B0089EHWQE|5.0|After my friend told me she couldn't put this book down, I ordered it for my Kindle. I couldn't put it down either! The story line sounds quite dark, but the situations are handled so compassionately, I was drawn into the story from beginning to end. There's lots of humor, lots of heartache, a really insightful look into human nature. A lovely book.
B004LWZW24|5.0|This item arrived quickly and was a great watch. It is well worth the money. Will definitely be buying the second movie.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|Love this bought it whilst it was only $17 now it appears to went up in price  but even for $32 i think its worth it, if your not somebody who cares to much about articulation like me then its fine, the pose is already awesome and the accessories are great, he looks good with and without the hat+glasses the only down side is like other people have mentioned. That is that the cant stand up whilst holding the bag of money without falling to his right because of the weight however im sure there are ways around that.<br /><br />Other than that for the quality great product!
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|Show was a little slow in spots but the music is worth it. If you like music coupled with a descent story line you will like Smash
B0064MGU98|4.0|Great show.  Good entertainment value; holds your interest. Good subject matter that is easy to follow.  I highly recommend it.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|Great price especially when buy just the dvd or just the blu ray was more expensive.Good movie ,my girlfriend loves it. Even months after I got it for her.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I have been keeping up on both first and second season. Keep up the good work. Waiting for the third season so I may  order it.
B00DT99BX6|5.0|The thing I loved most about this book was the absorbing plot. From the very beginning the reader is drawn into Camille's privileged world.<br />But she is unhappy with her life where she is forced to hide away from the world unless she is accompanied by body guards. Camille is feisty and head-strong, determined not to be tamed and when she escapes for a holiday to Turkey she experiences the first stirrings of love for a stranger who rescues her from a mugger.<br />When she returns home, Camille is unable to forget this mystery man and when things become too much for her, she returns to the place where she experienced such happiness to see if the man is still there.<br />Unfortunately their reunion is rocked when Camille is kidnapped and once more the stranger comes to her rescue.<br />Discovering his true identity when she safely returns home, Camille feels betrayed by her father and those she trusted most.<br />Once more her feelings are confused as she battles between her love for a stranger and trying to forget him and find some normality in her life.<br />Without wanting to spoil the ending for anyone, I recommend this book for anyone who has an ounce of romance in them. There is also plenty of menace and excitement in this tale of love conquering all.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books. Any chance to a fourth book? I know they are making a movie.<br />Its just not the same the books were fast read and truly enjoyable!
B008N1LL42|4.0|The overall movie is entertaining, and some scenes surprising.  I did not particularly care for how Navy personnel were portrayed in a few scenes as I have a deep respect for their training and ability, but I understand the need in Hollywood to create.  The music is great, but a true sound track is not available.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book to pick up and escape, fast read. Looking forward to the next book!<br />Thank you for Ana and Christian; you chose to love them both.
B00005JLK1|4.0|For a &#34;scary&#34; movie this is well done.  The acting is better than average, and the story line is compelling.  You can't go wrong with this one.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|Beautifully shot, acted, scored, and executed.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of space survival type movies, but this one hits all the right notes, including a reasonable run-time. There's really only one small section where I felt like \\"okay, get on with the plot already.\\"<br /><br />This is the type of movie that I feel benefits from the grander scope offered by a movie theater viewing, but I'd also be interested in getting a blu-ray or dvd copy to see all the extras and behind the scenes stuff.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock's picked some interesting roles of late, but here, she gets to prove she can really act. (Because it's really all about her character - Dr. Ryan Stone - digging deep to find the will to keep fighting against mounting despair and failing machinery.)<br /><br />A worthy addition to a movie collection.
B000000OU0|5.0|We waited for what seemed a lifetime for this album, and being able to listen to our favorite songs with a more refined and mature sound.  The remake of Hotel California is pure Nirvana.  The vocal ability of this group of true artists is second to none.
B00138KJY0|5.0|Who is not a Michael Jackson fan?  Anyone??? NO!!! Okay than this album and many others are the reason why he is doved the pop king.!!!
B00007KWHG|5.0|Great and timeless music from an era of drive-ins, jukebox, and good times.  The songs on this album have good sound and are clear.
B008M4OYYY|5.0|I love Legos and these are just a miniature version of those! Easy to put together and small enough to put on my desk at work!
B00005N6KG|4.0|This design idea has been around for years.  It keeps direct sound impact in check, but does let in background noise.  The sound is very good, and the build quality is good as well.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|A very good product. Easy to setup. I have two mobiles and I connected both of them. Quality of sound is excellent ( except when I was driving on the highway but it's ok). Delivery took around 2 weeks (I expected it faster but again not a big deal). Probably will buy another one for my wife.
B00005O3VC|4.0|A good flik for &#34;remembering&#34; & refreshing watching. Thought Ihad - looked - looked - looked - &#34;Nope&#34; - so ordered & now do !
B002H3T3TM|4.0|Limited music tracks but love it. I've watched twice within the same day until my bluray player gave up on me.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm still reading this book, but I am really enjoying it. Since I lived through the 60's and 11/23/63 (JFK's assassination) and it was such an intense time (I was only 10), it's very personal to me. I've always loved Stephen King's novels and this one does not disappoint. After I finish, I may end up giving it 5 stars, but want to wait!!<br /><br />10/27 update  -  OK - 5 stars now!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Good game, graphics are good, puzzles are challenging but not impossible. Was a prefect way to spend a rainy afternoon or two.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|A4, 8.5x11, and legal are the only print sizes offered. I think some of the more often used photo print sizes could be included.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Fantastic quality for a fantastically-written web series.  Love the fact that the commentary track is a whole new set of songs.
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|This game is pretty dope.... I think you guys should get it. Highly recommended for any gamer type.<br />Plus it's not a bad price so just get it already.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Just a beautiful set for a beautiful and tragically short series.  It has a great set of extras, and the HD really makes you feel like you're there in Serenity with Capt. Reynolds' family.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|The episodes are great.  Lots of characters and lots of action.  The DVD quality on the first episode was bad so I got a replacement.  The replacement didn't work either. (Both shipped from &#34;lilies&#34;.)  I just skipped to the second episode and have watched the first 4 so far without any further problem.
B0000T6JGU|5.0|He was thrilled with the album, that I gave him as a present for his graduation day. He is collecting 33RPMs now.
B00F91H15W|1.0|One of the worst movies ever<br />I guess the actors were some what portraying the time characters,<br />but not really.<br />It was like valley girl pumped full of Valium meets euro trash.<br />I do agree see the trailer and that's all the entertainment torture you need.<br />This story was a 5 minute splash on the local news back in the 80's and now they tried to make a movie of it?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've had this book in my Kindle since it first came out.  Yes im just now reading it or should say have read the book.  I don't read a lot due my job. Always reading documents for it.  I could not put it down.  I loved it.  So i also had 2 read the other ones as well.  In one week i finished all 3.<br /><br />Parts of the book make me feel its from a teenage crush.  Parts make wish i could find a man with some of the inner goodness Ana sees in Christian Grey. I know they are out there, however sad to say most want the young ones. Not someone their age.  And his money has nothing to due with it.  I look for what is on the inside. I feel when you read the other books you will see. She wants truly what she sees on the inside of Mr. Grey.  She never wanted his money.<br /><br />Im ready to read more books from E L James regarding 50 shades.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Fun game but on kindle fire you can't save the moose or fly the plane without dying. Very irritating when that appears on your last life. Don't get this game if you have a kindle fire!!!!!!!!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome and awesome book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Best book that i have ever read in my whole life till the next one though.
B00E3DC2EW|5.0|I highly recommend it. If you like time period stories, romance and simply well written work this is perfect for you!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved how much you can really get into all of these testimonials like this actually happened. Anyone looking for an epic read should buy this book. I'm not even a zombie fan but I love this!!
B002APS61I|5.0|Beautiful movie, timeless story. I love how the romance plays out in this film. It's beautifully filmed and well acted. One of my favorites.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love the game and the chat room comments from this group are entertaining.  However lately I have been losing so many games during the free tournament due to drops and freezes often I'm lucky if I am able to complete one of the five free rounds.  This is very frustrating as this causes a loss of power ups used and all points gained.  There is no recovery of any losses during the tournament play.  Fix this problem and this is a perfect Bingo game!!!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Such a great movie. Fun, quirky, and amazing cinematography. I love the story and have rewatched it multiple times. So good!
B004G0SJU8|5.0|This movie never fails me!  I must have watched and listened to it over 200 times!!!  The theme, the soundtrack, the idea behind it makes this a MUST SEE!!!  It makes you think, feel, and appreciate your life.  Everyone should see this movie!!!  If I could give it 100 stars I would!  If I were trapped on an island with only one movie to watch...this would most likely be it!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|bought this for my wife ( BIG qzzie fan ) --( a sweetheart gift) SHE LOVES IT --(and I hate to admit it --I do like it also)
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|I used this tablet all summer with no problems except there is very little information on how to operate it.You also have to use a 3rd party program to download android 4.0 programs.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|great  2nd showing of the NEW stra trek reboot -- great fun --worth the price and fun to rewatch<br />the only issue I have is that with an ENTIRE universe  and NEW time line JJ Abrams went back to &#34;old&#34; material ( IMHO -GREAT material) and added some twists BUT I guess he will play with that NEXT time ---DO NOT miss this for your collection
B00746O3X8|4.0|It worked very well overall.  Make sure you read the instructions; I thought I would just know everything I needed to know by looking at it, but was surprised when I had trouble removing the camera from the holster. Upon looking carefully, I realized the mounts have a slot mechanism that requires you to rotate the base to remove it from the holster, which is a good safety feature so that the camera can't get lifted out accidentally, such as by kneeling down.  The only thing I was dissatisfied with is that the post that screw to kept coming loose after a while, and I kept having to re-tighten it by hand.  It needs a pressure washer or some other mechanism to keep it in place.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|Lacking in the thrill and epic moments found in the first two books in the series.  I found myself not liking and eye-Irolling at much of the actions and dialogue of the main characters (mostly the girls). I hope the storyline will be more captivating in the next book.
0143124544|5.0|I had a horrible, trying-not-to-cry headache reading this book in the waiting room while my car was being repaired. Later, when I returned home, I had to literally put the book DOWN every couple of pages to regain my composure.  This book was so well-written and engrossing and gut-wrenchingly perfect.  I loved it and would highly recommend it. You will think about it long after you finish it.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Beautiful!!  Wonderful singing and music.  Les Mis is an all time favorite and this is a spectacular cast with amazing talent especially Alfie Boe!!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|No violence!!!! Just great human interests stuff Enjoyed i and the well played rolls of the actor actress and actorst
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for, a straightforward calendar easy to set up and just as importantly easy to review.
B008S80OU2|5.0|I rediscovered Blue Oyster Cult about 6 months ago listening to tracks from &#34;Fire of Unknown Origin&#34;.  I had never really listened to the first three albums, and stopped buying them after FOUO.<br /><br />All of these cd's are decent, and many of them are fantastic!  The last two studio albums, Revolution by Night and Club Ninja aren't as strong as the rest, but they both have a couple of outstanding songs that make it worth it for the price you pay here.<br /><br />The Radio Broadcasts are the real gems so far.  Some great moments there.  And of course discovering the brilliance of the &#34;black and white&#34; period.<br /><br />If you like 70's and 80's hard rock, this collection captured the best of it.  Blue Oyster Cult were one of the most advanced, creative, and interesting bands of that era.<br /><br />In 16 cd's there isn't a bad song that I can find.  Club Ninja might have a clunker or two, but beyond that, even the &#34;Imaginos&#34; album which isn't even really a BOC album is very interesting to listen to.  It's a solo album with a lot of BOC guest vocals.  But it's a very interesting album.<br /><br />I'm really happy with this purchase.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's a really fun game and I have dragons named EPIC Cutey and drake I love this awesome game but getting trees removed is expensive
B00BE909NO|3.0|I read this based on its reputation - and the upcoming (now released!) film starring Hugh Laurie. I was expecting more. Yes, it is a charming story; the problem was I didn't find it engagingly written. The characters were not as rich as I had hoped, to the extent that I was largely unmoved at the climax of the story. Perhaps the movie will provide a better representation of the characters and their experiences.<br /><br />As an aside I read Great Expectations after finishing Mr Pip... and I enjoyed Dickens far more.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|I watched this classic with my daughter. She loved it. It is colorful, sparks imagination, and encourages you to never give up. Even when she thought she lost everything, the main character remained a princes at heart.
B009P25TQE|5.0|All the songs in this CD are written by Pablo Alboran.  He sings them and plays the guitar and the piano.  My favorite songs are &#34;En Brazos de Ella&#34;, &#34;Toda La Noche&#34;, &#34;Donde Esta El Amor?&#34; and &#34;Extasis.  The songs are romantic, soulful, sexy, potent.  Not to be missed!
1595826971|5.0|My niece is into art, anime to be more specific. The book has some very interesting and graphic drawings. However she loves it. Not too I personally would ever get it for myself but as for a gift for my niece. 100% satisfied!!!
B0050BPIB0|5.0|This is the first CD launched by Pablo Alboran and in it is the song  \\"Solamente Tu\\", a song that has inspired millions and has made him a well known artist in dozens of countries.  The whole CD is just magical.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Robert Preston rules!  A must see movie musical.  Perfect family fun.  Everyone from kids to seniors should watch this a few times a year.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I grew up on the original Star Trek, then watched TNG, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise and of course all the movies. This is one of the best I've seen. Action non stop, that's what I like.
039472903X|5.0|Great book written by the master.  The content is fantastic,  getting his true and candid thoughts, but  I was really impresses with the quality of the book itself.  The pages are thick and the photos are very high quality - he gives a ton of examples of ads he liked and ads that he did not like with details on what went wrong.<br /><br />Very easy and fun to read.  The guy is hyper intelligent.  You can tell he is a master student and his wisdom shines through in this book.
B00CEZJT2E|2.0|It's a 6000mAh power bank, so it should be able to charge my HTC One about 2 times, and the truth is...I used it to charge my phone from 16% to 100%, the power bank itself dropped from 4 lights to only 1 light...I'm not satisfied about this! This is the third Anker power bank products that I purchased, they all let me down, maybe I should try another brand...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was really fantastic. I've read it before and I love rereading it to get the full emotion. Ms. Collins knows what she is doing.
B003P9VZ0W|3.0|The description of this product state more than the quantity enclosed. Like another customer posted this set only came with 37 items. Since it is a gift I can't open it to rate the quality but disappointed in the lack of correctness in the description. Maybe I, along with the other customer, received some old stock.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King rarely has a miss - that's why I pre-order his books without waiting for any reviews - and this is no exception.  The Shining was one super scary book - I live near the hotel that inspired it and have taken their Ghost Tour but cannot bring myself to spend the night - and always wondered what happen to Danny.  Glad he re-visited Danny and his life (maybe Abra in a few years???), it was worth the wait.<br /><br />Also - thanks alot, will not be joining the RV crowd anytime soon!
0060734191|5.0|some of my *favorite* books (young adult, but i'm an adult) - great female main characters, great stories, not the simplified crap they try to feed to some young adults.<br /><br />my favorite is &#34;Lirael&#34; (2nd book) in the library, but then you can't not read the next book &#34;Abhorsen&#34;. . . and all 3 are great.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|Note to Tarantino----A spoof is supposed to be funny. See Spinal Tap to learn how to film a spoof.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Tarantino although I enjoyed Jackie Brown very much. I have tried to watch Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, etc., but find this director largely tedious, perpetually stuck in adolescence, and vastly overrated.<br /><br />I sat through three-quarters of Django, a truly silly movie, because a relative brought it from the library and I was curious. As another reviewer said, the exploding ketchup pack theme has been overdone. After an hour or so of resting our minds, we half-heartedly turned the film back on and watched it to the ludicrous end.<br /><br />Tarantino must be informed immediately that film is a visual medium and having DiCaprio, a meager talent at best, sit at a table with other actors and blabber on and on for over 30 minutes is simply not interesting. There was way too much dialogue in this film and a mediocre script to boot. Django needed a script doctor badly as it was about 45 minutes too long.<br /><br />Tarantino should be banned from attempting to act in his films. In this one he attempted an Australian accent, wore clothes and hat that looked like they had just come out of a dry cleaner, and had too much flesh on him to be believable in 1858. By the way, the Civil War started in 1861, not 1860. Can't anybody on his staff do any research?<br /><br />I also agree with other reviewers who were critical of rap music being used as background and dialogue containing slang that no one had heard of in this country until after 2000.<br /><br />Hide all of the cameras so he can't do any more harm to American culture. Let this be the Last Django in Hollywood.

B0039OGGVQ|5.0|My husband is definitely a heavy rocker. He loves this cd, he keeps it in his car to listen to it all the time.  Great music.
B00005YUPO|5.0|Excellent! Bought this for my son when it first came out when he was a baby...now he plays classical music! Any link? I think so! Bought this for my 1 year old nephew, hope it works again!!!
B002VZC9CY|5.0|Great cd, I love Natalie Merchant when she was with her whole band and I now love it when it is just singing.  Very pleasurable to listen to.
0143124544|5.0|Wow. I'm not sure I will ever forget this story - the characters are really interesting and the story so moving. Wonderfully written and well told. Highly recommended.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This whole series &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; is one of my all time favorites!  For people who love fantasy and adventure.  I love generational books.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I had a really bad few weeks and then I read this book and my attitude made a 180 degree turn. Thank you, Auggie. The power of books, amazing.
B000002KIK|4.0|While Black Sabbath's last albums with the original lineup, Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die! have been neglected by the critics and some longtime fans for years, the latter album is actually pretty good. The raw garage rock production works here as the band attempt to get back to basics while still adding a few new wrinkles to their sound. First off, there are no classics here at all. Nothing on the level of \\"Iron Man\\" or \\"Children of the Grave\\" or even \\"Megalomania\\" or \\"A National Acrobat\\". However, this is more consistent than the more celebrated Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage albums. The glorious title track kicks things off on high gear. \\"Johnny Blade\\" starts out with a lot of spooky synths but once the drums and guitars kick in, it's a scorcher that keeps its momentum throughout its changes in mood. \\"Junior's Eyes\\" is led by a funky Geezer Butler bassline before  in the chorus. For a band known for its gloom and doom, \\"A Hard Road\\" is downright joyous. The second side bounces the wicked \\"Shock Wave\\" with the moody and jazzy \\"Air Dance\\" and \\"Breakout\\" and the latter tracks work better than you would expect. \\"Over To You\\" and \\"Swinging the Chain\\" are the lesser songs on the album but are still better than nearly all of Technical Ecstasy. Never Say Die! is one of the more underrated Sabbath albums and if you don't go in thinking you're going to hear Paranoid, you will pleasantly surprised by what you hear.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|i lost my file cause i had jt on facebook and now i have to start over but otherwise it was great
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is super fun,you hardly ever get bored with it.<br />I recommend this game fir anyone who has  love for horses :)
B00E3BK0QQ|1.0|I have been trying for 2 days to get this game to download. Good thing it's a freebie, I guess.  Trying to get it on a kindle fire.  Would really give no stars if I could as of right now.  But will update if I can get it to load.
B008LCR9W6|5.0|This DVD set was a gift for my nephew (a huge fan if the show) and he loves it! He watched the episodes back-to-back and will watch them again.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I just started reading this book and was so blown away in the first few pages.  I you liked The Shining, you will definitely be drawn into this one.  Looking forward to getting back to reading it.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I love the original Angry Birds Star Wars, but this was a great sequel. Very creative with the varying characters and the abilities each has as well as the adding of the Pork Side game play. A lot of fun.<br /><br />Only complaint, I am playing this on an older tablet and sometimes it has some slow down, as well as having this from Amazon market it is missing some of the features that are available to those who have it through the Android market.
1439190275|3.0|I purchased this book used & the condition of the book appeared fine. However upon further review I discovered that the entire chapter on the power of protein was ripped out! I guess the chapter was important to the previous owner
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for bands like Dream Theater... There are already hundreds of reviews out there, with more to come. However, this is not \\"business as usual\\" for DT. Understand that I'm not a 'knee-jerk' DT fan. I'm maybe a little older than a lot of fans. I grew up on Yes & Rush and got on board with DT with \\"When Dream & Day Unite\\", then \\"Images & Words\\". I have bought every DT album through the years, but the only other album that's totally killed me was \\"Metropolis: Scenes From a Memory\\"... One of the best concept albums of all time. The band has done some great stuff since, but most of my friends call them \\"wank-athons\\" between Rudess and Petrucci. Although there are a few good SONGS here and there, I tend to agree. This self-titled release has turned a corner. ~Somewhere between \\"Awake\\" and \\"Falling Into Infinity\\", this is the most experimental, yet song-oriented album the band has done in years. I'm not super-thrilled with the mix. I can't quite define what the problem is... It fluctuates from song to song. Overall, the drums are buried (which, of course, wouldn't have happened with Portnoy). The keys and guitars fluctuate between over-the-top and buried... inconsistent. I was able to re-mix the CD in my car, by pumping up the mids and lows, so it sounds pretty good,... but, be warned. This is really my only criticism. The guys have balanced great writing along with musicianship and simpler song structures, but they are now more complex in rhythm, time signatures and meter. If you were like me, and had somewhat given up on the band, check this one out.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging. Enjoyed the puzzles. Definitely good for you brain . If you enjoy challenges this is the game for you
B005IYNQAY|1.0|I could not get past the first third of this book before giving up.  I liked Ender's Game well enough so I bought this book.  I then learned about Orson Scott Card's anti-gay views and just couldn't stand reading an entire novel whose message is so clearly that of tolerance and understanding for people unlike ones-self, not to mention the characters have zero personality and the world itself is thoroughly boring.  I read a synopsis to make sure I didn't miss any mind-blowing reveals (I didn't) and am never picking up this book again.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This is one of those Lego sets that's a collector's item for sure!  I love it. The detail is great! The box was in perfect shape and sealed. Everything was new. Love it!  I got it as a surprise for my nephew.  He loves Lego and is a whiz at putting Lego sets together. He's really into Minecraft right now but this set was a great distraction and that's good...because who wants someone to be obsessed with one thing (Minecraft).<br />I saw Back to the Future when I was a young child, so I thought this was a cool toy and was excited when I saw Lego release it.
0307719774|5.0|I love the questions. Some are thought provoking and others are fun and easy to answer. My husband will sometimes ask &#34;what's today's question?&#34; or I'll ask him for what his answer would be. I'm in the first year but am already excited to see how my answers will change. I haven't missed a day of writing since I started in January!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I don't know how I missed this on TV.  I love the series.  The two lives...the rich and the poor.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This case is a good one for protecting the Kindle Fire. I got it as a replacement case when my original made lines across the protective film on my screen. So far so good. It's lightweight but protects it. I don't use the stand feature much but the few times I tried it, it took several attempts to get it to stand up. I would recommend this product.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Will not work with hot spot service on cell phone. Worthless...didn't advertise the fact that it wouldn't work with hot spot service...
B00005JKQ6|5.0|What a great movie.  This is film.  This is art.  This is a classic and always topical tale.  Inventive and unusual.  Beautiful.  Buy it.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|Having just seen the new Ron Howard film, Rush, I thought I'd watch Grand Prix for a comparison.  Both films are excellent and well worth watching, but I have to say, I'd still give the nod to Grand Prix.<br /><br />While Rush delved into a fascinating relationship between two real-life competitors who both hated and ostensibly needed each other, Grand Prix has the advantage of being filmed in 1966, the 60's being the golden age of Grand Prix.  The international flavor of the circuit was captured more vividly in Grand Prix, with the American driver teaming up with a Japanese car maker, portraits and motives of the international drivers fleshed out, as well as the glamour of jet-set touch-and-go hook-up romantic relationships.  Just as importantly, I thought Grand Prix did a much better job of portraying the actual experience of driving the track.  In Rush, the portrayal of driving is meager, leaps all over and becomes visually confusing, while Grand Prix actually focuses in to allow the viewer more of the terrifying and exhilerating experience of what it would be like to race.<br /><br />Grand Prix has aged well, but perhaps it is ironically weakest in the characterization of its main character, portayed by James Garner.  His personality is the least developed, having little more depth than just the strong-and-silent macho American, a characterization perhaps better left to soldier movies.  Even when driving, he seemed to have a laconic, half-bored attitude, intensity sacrificed for a seeming expectation of innate American superiority.<br /><br />Both Rush and Grand Prix are thrilling, expertly-rendered movies.  If you are going to see one, you must see the other.  Together they seem to round each other out for a satisfying portrait of the glamorous and dangerous sport of Grand Prix.
B00F91H15W|1.0|I love Emma Watson and so watched this move. So boring. Lots of scenes of these vapid young people stealing designer stuff and doing drugs.. Most scenes went on too long. Yes these are valid characters but movie showed absolutely nothing interesting about them. Hated it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Very well researched, written and very enjoyable whether you run or not.  It has changed the way I think about running and life.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|Read again after many years.  These are still excellent and timeless stories. What a wonderful insight into the human soul.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|This isn't the Dark Shadows I knew in the 60's by any means.  Tim Burton, shame on you!  Go back to Rocky Horror where you were the best.  You destroyed \\"Dark Shadows\\" completely - save for the 3-second party entrance with Lara Parker, Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott and David Selby.  As a stand-alone version, barely watchable.  Yawn!
0345525558|5.0|A very enjoyable book. I know someday I'll be looking for something to read, and will be delighted to find this on my bookshelf. Characters are solid, story line is good ... and believable all the way through ... the backdrop of the flower stories is a very nice touch.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I liked this movie a lot. I felt it had a good story, a lot of funny moments, and some heart as well.
1401917186|2.0|Nothing new here, just a reprint of an earlier book, Earth Angels (which was pretty decent and interesting.)<br /><br />Granted, oddball topic, but this one really goes over the top for non-earthly things. Tossing.
B008Y7DTVS|2.0|I bought this movie because of Luke Evans. But I found myself in the oddest story once I watched it. I expected a typical romantic comedy, but there are some characters that just take it out of that genre (like the two school girls). The storyline gets complicated fast and darker as the story moves on. If you're looking for a light British rom-com, don't watch this movie. If you don't mind being puzzled while watching, try it out.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this to stream from my devices to my TV/Stereo system.  The Chromecast only work with a few apps and even fewer on iOS.  If you're trying to stream music from your iPad or iPhone to your stereo system or stream movies from your iOS apps it will NOT work.  The only thing that's of any use that works is Netflix streaming, which I already had through either computer hooked up to the TV, Roku, etc.<br /><br />Chromecast's limited appeal doesn't do it for me and it's going in the junk drawer.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Well, you will need to read the book cause I want spoil the fun.<br />But definitely this sequel is King at his finest.
B00B7FOQCK|3.0|I was looking for a small USB 3.0 hub without power adapter so I could take it on trips with laptop.  This was the smallest one I could find and worked with no problem, but it is still bigger than what I would like.  I used to take a couple of small Belkin USB 2.0 hub/splitter (see the photo uploaded); not sure why the USB 3.0 hubs could not be made smaller like the USB 2.0 hub/splitters.  It is powered by the USB 3.0 port on the macboo pro, did give a warning about not enough power when a 64GB USB drive and the apple DVD drive were connected simultanously through this hub.  USB 3.0 generally draws more power and it could be a problem with four devices connected on the hub.  This would be expected though for hubs without additonal power.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|love these movies and its nice to have them all in the same box to keep them together  Susan k&#62;
B000VSYDRM|1.0|Another twisted misogynistic movie. Shame on you, Amazon, for even making this available. Atleast put a warning on such movies.<br />My boyfriend feels the same way I do and commented, himself, on the misogyny in this picture. Shame on you Dustin Hoffman for lowering yourself.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|Pretty good movie. I like how the zombies are the way they're described in the zombie survival guide book. Now I want to read the book. The end of the movie is the only reason I wouldn't give it a five.
B00AEFXXFU|5.0|My husband had never seen Ferris Buellers day off so I purchased him the film. First time seeing it on blu-ray. Loved having it to watch
0064430170|5.0|I'm sorry this is so late in coming, but I wanted to say thanks for book and the timely shipping.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|After a remarkably long read, very few of the characters were resolved... And the author's response was &#34;to be continued&#34;. I felt tricked. Enough for me... I'm not about to invest any more time in this read.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love it fun game. The game has almost everyone from the movies but no Sam jackson. Best game next to simpsons.
B00CWVBV4E|4.0|It was fun to watch--very entertaining.  I loved watching this with my two boys and they liked it as well.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|Happy with the case. Easy to grip. For the price it was well worth it. I would buy this case again.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This is a fantastic show that not enough people are watching. Finally, a strong female lead that I can root for. She is human and flawed and has everyday problems like the rest of us albeit with a bit more drama. The supporting characters are also fantastic and really fleshed out. There are also great bits of levity which is absolutely crucial when dealing with all the serious fare in the courtroom. It is great that CBS is finally figuring it out that streaming is the future and letting Amazon stream this free for Prime members. Hopefully this wider availability will have the similar success that Breaking Bad and other shows have enjoyed by allowing people to binge watch previous season to catch up with the live broadcasts. This show has a terrific plot especially considering that it is a network show, it hasn't been bogged down by the number of shows it has to crank out per season which is twice that of cable or the restrictions on content that cable shows don't need to concern themselves with.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Honestly, You care for your own horse in this game.<br /><br />The default name is beauty, but it is changeable. It is so realistic!
B006S08RLU|4.0|Aging well, also. Catch the actress in the movie Dirty Pretty Things, several years old, well, well worth your time.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love the app. It is very easy to navigate and has a wide selection. I also love how it lets you preview your books before you buy anything. I just wish it had a center store. I don't always know what book I want to read so if I could see a list of new books or popular books by genre that would be great. I'm sure they have it online, I just couldn't find it on the app.
B001T6PXFG|5.0|Very good, with very enjoyable and very sad moments, all true to life.  It needed a lot of detail to tell this inspiring story and do it right.  I am not a  Catholic, but I married into an Irish family and Peck's character is certainly believable and well done.  Being taken from a true story, the movie is almost a documentary but the director made sure to keep it a very human drama rather than a historical adventure.<br /><br />I was a 9-year-old in California following WWII in detail at the time of these happenings.
1476729085|5.0|This is a highly enjoyable novel about an Asperger character who is on a quest to find a suitable mate --and ends up finding unexpected love. His quirky habits and mannerisms are often comical, a la Sheldon Cooper in the Big Bang Theory. But his genuineness is highly endearing and you find yourself rooting for him all the way. Congratulations to the author on his debut novel.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love this thing!  Held out buying one cuz we have an old CRT TV from 1990! No HDMI of course.  So when I found that there are devices out there that can convert the hdmi signal to analog for playback on our old tv, I had to try the converter and chromecast out (together).  Note: we bought the &#34;Sabrent HDMI to Composite/S-Video Converter 3RCA DA-HDRC&#34;  from Amazon to use for the conversion.  Works like a charm!  I did the initial set up of the chromecast using my nexus 7 tablet, (note, you can't cast (stream) webpages/videos using a tablet yet..google is working on that.  I use our desktop computer for that), but you can use the tablet for all the other chromecast features.  Anyway.... I've casted youtube videos so far, hulu plus shows so far, haven't tried the Netflix movies yet.....but have streamed (casted) lot's of misc. website videos like those on yahoo for example.  And even casted our local news channel, KTVU channel 2 news, right from their website to our analog TV using the Chrome browser which is the only browser that will work with the Chromecast.  Quality isn't bad..seriously!  Neither is the sound!  Though there is a slight delay with the words people speak (the soundtrack) is off a TAD, not much though.  Guess that depends on the speed of your internet.  Ours is pretty fast.  So.... guess we (and others) do not NEED to buy a new TV with hdmi ports in them.  We personally, love our old tv and have no desire to chuck it out just yet.  I'm glad to be able to use new technology on old technology!  We're happy.  Thanks for reading!  Enjoy your Chromecast if you get one!  They are neat!!!  :-)
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Good product but not enough apps to go on , also only works off apps thought you would be able to show your videos and pics from my iPhone
B00BEU19ZU|3.0|This a good app but I have noticed that some airport terminal maps are out dated. For one is the milwaukee terminal map gate c and d have been switched months ago. Other then this the app is useful when in New airports and when checking flights.

B0082Z447U|5.0|I had never heard of this book or of Wilkie Collins until I was looking through the \\"Classics\\" list on Amazon. I have thoroughly enjoyed other 19th century authors in the past--Austen, the Bronte sisters, etc., and the summary of \\"The Woman in White\\" sounded fascinating! I'm so glad I found it! Why Wilkie Collins isn't as well known and read as Austen and the Brontes is beyond me! A wonderful, complicated mystery that eventually has all the loose ends tied up by the separate commentaries of the different characters. What always amazes me in reading the books written in this period, is that no matter what the circumstances are, the characters are always so \\"civil\\" to each other! I enjoy taking a peek into the past and seeing the manners and \\"hearing\\" the language of that other age.<br />  This is a well written book that will keep you interested and entertained on every page. Highly recommended!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed this book, one never knows what goes on behind closed doors.  I wonder if there will be a sequel?
B007L96SI6|5.0|Haley's first album is full of enthusiasm and clever lyrics. Too bad this album was not better promoted. This artist actually has a VOICE, style, control.
B007SGM084|5.0|She spins a good tale.  Her character development is great and the email banter is humorous.  You long to read more when you finish the first book so buy all three to be prepared!
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a good game for those who are not in a hurry.  It's not a game to sit down<br />and play, but to check in on every day.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|As a teacher in public schools, we are often talked to about the school to prison pipeline and how we want to prevent our kids from going that direction. If an educated woman like Kerman had such a difficult time understanding how her time served as an appropriate consequence for her mistakes, how do we expect our barely educated population to learn from their mistakes in a system that doesn't seem to educate inmates to improve their situations in the outside world?
B003W5C0VW|3.0|So I wake up and it's, what, 1972 already? I mean, really. You could've flown me higher than First Class from Ocho Rios all the way to a secret Swiss clinic in the middle of the night, baby, and it still wouldn't have prepared me for THIS.<br /><br />Think about it:  I escape Merry Very Olde by the skin of what's left of my teeth and end up making records in some Nazi-forsaken French basement. There's Mick Taylor (sometimes), there's that other Mick (rarely), and of course there's Charlie and even Gram Parsons whenever my five strings need a chorus. The old lady's got the kid asleep upstairs, I'm assuming, and downstairs it's as hot as an ungrounded amp in Sacramento. Nevertheless, the Stones manage to crank out a [[ASIN:B0039TD826 double album]]'s worth of material in record time, pun possibly intended, and then it's time to return to America - the land of NOTHING'S for free - and mount The Tour To Top All Goddamn Tours. Or so we thought.<br /><br />\\"Ladies and gentlemen, The Rolling Stones!\\" went the announcement for the next two months, seven weeks, and sixteen songs in thirty-one cities over fifty-one shows. Not to mention, while we're doing numbers here, one hundred and thirty-one arrests - including my own on of all places Rhode Island, perhaps not entirely coincidentally - and probably a hundred Altamont's worth of injuries and OD's to top it all.<br /><br />Nevertheless, that tour's been called everything from \\"part of rock and roll legend\\" to \\"one of the benchmarks of an era,\\" in the words of noted rock scribe Dave Marsh. Well, I do beg to differ, dear Dave. Unless you consider Dick Cavett cornering Bill Wyman for a televised toke in the bowels of Madison Square Garden something of a benchmark. Or Truman Capote sucking up to all the celebrity willy he could. On OUR bill. Or Jagger's bill, to be truthful.<br /><br />Now I must regretfully admit to missing many of no-longer-little Stevie Wonder's opening sets during this excursion, as the plane we rented from Bobby Sherman really was the ONLY way to see the USA that summer. From 30,000 feet, that is. And with all the \\"tea\\" and sympathy one could inhumanely hold. But after the whole damn thing was over, we didn't even get a lousy album out of it, thank you very much again Mr. Allen Klein. Oh, there were lots of books and magazine articles of course, and Jann Wenner's been going out to dinner on our fabulous exploits that year ever since. But save for Robert Frank's \\"unauthorized\\" [[ASIN:B0019Q6RLU lump of underexposed tripe]], it didn't look like we were going to be able to squeeze even a movie from the entire four-ring circus.<br /><br />Never underestimate the money-hustling instincts of one Michael Phillip Jagger, however. When push came to financial shove - meaning after our last [[ASIN:B001WCN232 album at the time]] sold about as hotly as Bibles outside the Chicken Ranch - he managed to get the '72 tour footage finally assembled and into theatres. But, being Mick, not just any Saturday afternoon matinee, no sir. \\"Ladies & Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones,\\" as he titled this cinematic spectacular, was blown up from 16-mil and mixed into then-fashionable (for about a week or two) four-channel surround quadraphonic sound. To be exclusively shown ONLY in theatres that could handle it all, mind you.<br /><br />Of course, in the mid-Seventies few could, so we were forced to \\"four-wall,\\" as in rent at our own expense that is, movie houses into which we had to import specially designed concert-size sound systems (and audio engineers who knew how to operate the stuff) in order to screen the bugger ...and schlep the bloody gear and crew all 'round the States on 14-footer flatbed trucks to boot. Jesus. We should've just gone back out on the road ourselves. Would have been a lot easier. And we would have actually seen some coin from it.<br /><br />\\"It's the next best thing to seeing The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band in Concert!\\" screamed the ads. \\"Get this fruckin' movie OUTOF HERE,\\" screamed the various promoters brave, or should I say foolish enough to mount this entire charade.<br /><br />Dear, dear Mick. He's still trying to make movies. But at least whenever he tries to make Rolling Stones movies, we now insist on real equipment, adequate staging and, most importantly, real directors. Marty Scorsese did [[ASIN:B00AEBB928 our last concert film]]. I even got to give Bill Clinton's mother-in-law a smack on the great behind in that one. Or was it his wife? Same difference, chum.<br /><br />So. Cut to 2010. And \\"Ladies & Gentlemen\\" lives again, in all of its Quadra-Sound - or 5.1 as it's called nowadays - glory on DVD and Blu-ray ...and probably even vinyl if they can figure out a way. There's Mick Taylor playing an extremely mean lean \\"Love In Vain.\\" There's Charlie, being as good as it always gets. And there's Mick Jagger jumping from white jumpsuits into purple (continuity, anyone?!) while jumping all over stages which in 1972 seemed enormous, but today would scarcely even hold the man's traveling wardrobe bunker.<br /><br />And there's NOT Bill Wyman. Ruthlessly cropped clean out of all the front cover packaging, justice duly, if belatedly served. We airbrush him out of album covers and reunion [sic!] concerts nowadays too. So why not DVD covers?<br /><br />Plus, there's yours quite truly, friends. Belting out \\"Happy\\" as if I actually were, and giving ol' Brenda a run for his Binaca - or should I say Bianca - as we extremely-close duet to scrape the Bakersfield right off of \\"Sweet Virginia.\\" Classic, karmic entertainment for all of you who, this century, prefer to get your kicks in front of the flat screen as opposed to the L.A.

B009AY04A8|3.0|I played this on the 1st generation kindle fire.  this is the 3rd hidden object game from nevosoft, I find it very annoying that the game can not tell if you are pinching the screen to enlarge the screen or randomly tapping the screen. which after a few times it deducts 20seconds from your time as a penalty. good thing the game is easy .

B000BT97AO|5.0|...it's a delight: lovely, little tale of a young girl's quest; a little bit of humour; a little dark; visually appealing.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I started reading this about 2 weeks after I finished 50 Shades of Grey. The story is great and I think the story of Gideon and Eva is right up there with Christian and Anastasia, in fact to me this Sylvia Day story is better.  The one down fall is the wait between segments. I would not have started reading this series, if I had known it was a &#34;series&#34; and that the ending segment had not been written yet. I started reading this series over 9 months ago and now have to wait who knows how long for the ending????  I'll read it when its published, but this has turned me off of reading this type of &#34;to-be-continued&#34; stories.<br /><br />Recommend  you wait to read it once the third and final segment is completed.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've spent the past four months working out using routines and diets that I found online.  I was making modest gains but knew I was capable of achieving better.  I lived online, searching numerous sites and forums and found conflicting information everywhere.  The problem with seeking training via the Internet is that there are tons of information and no shortage of opinions.  The hard part is deciding which information is good and which is bad, so I finally decided to go with a book.  I purchased the Kindle version of Bigger Leaner Stronger so I could have it handy on my smartphone in the gym as well as on my Kindle.  Matthews tells you everything you need to know about training, diet and proper form in a clear easy to read manner without getting too verbose.  He covers everything: exercises, proper form, diet, bulking, cutting, maintenance, alternative exercises, cardio, proper warm-up, supplements and much more.  It covers the core exercises with in-depth illustrated instructions for proper form.  It covers the nutritional requirements during bulking, cutting and maintenance phases.  Although Matthews also sells a recipe book, the essential information of how many calories and how many grams of carbs, protein, and fats should be consumed is all clearly spelled out in Bigger Leaner Stronger.  The book tells you how to plan, regulate and closely monitor your food intake, even avoiding hidden calories.  In reading this book, I found numerous mistakes that I was making in my both my diet and routine.  Matthews also includes a bonus PDF called The One Year Challenge that outlines an entire year worth of training and includes a few sample recipes from his other book.  The Year One Challenge along with Bigger Leaner Stronger has everything I need to confidently workout with the knowledge that I actually have a definitive blueprint rather than a questionable concoction of routines and diet tips cobbled together from the web.<br /><br />Another plus to the book, and one of the biggest, is that Matthews stays connected with his audience.  I had a question, so I sent Mike an email and he replied within 24 hours.  I was impressed because it let me know I'm not merely a quick earned buck to an author.  He has a genuine interest in his readers and it shows.  In addition to the Amazon reviews, I strongly suggest visiting Matthews' web site and looking at some of the content and feedback if you really want to know just how vested he is in the success of his readers.  By the way, for any older lifters out there, that was my question to Matthews and he assured me this can be performed by us older fellas.  So far, I've had no problems with the routine and actually find it less time consuming and taxing than some of the so-called \\"over 40\\" routines that I've found on the web.f the biggest, is that Matthews stays connected with his audience.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|A really fun movie, the creativity of the whole movie was excellent. It moved along very nicely and the Minions were alot of fun.
B00400NHRO|5.0|I read this first when I was a medical student, and re-read it as a staff physician.  It is an incredible story and masterful satire.  I heartily recommend this.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Set it up, worked for 3 days then it died :(<br />Took hours to get through to Google support who suggested restarting my router (useless and of course didn't solve the problem), then after attempting to reset the unit (which isn't documented anywhere - power it on with electric connection but take off tv then press button for 25 seconds, should stop blinking then turn red light).  After unit could not be reset (never got to red light) agent agreed unit was defective!<br />Unit was displaying chromecast screen on tv but without \\"ready to cast\\" - I think the units wifi stopped working b/c it kept trying to connect (blinking white light) but never did (many other units were connecting fine the the wifi which was working).  WHY DON'T THEY DOCUMENT THE WAY TO FACTORY RESET THE UNIT?  It would have saved me hours if I could have done this earlier and found out the unit was defective!
B000OVLINI|5.0|Truly amazing novel.  I have recommended this to everyone I know.  I really admire this book and am so impressed by the way the author crafted it.  The only thing I don't like about this book is the realization that I may never have such a wonderful experience with another book.  I will re-read this book.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Finally a good Sailor Moon figure!  One of the most iconic anime characters and this is her first good figure and its amazing.  Everything is flawless as you would expect from a figuarts figures.  Perfect paint, sculpt and a ton of extra parts.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I've read other 1,000 page books, including Follett's masterpiece Pillars of the Earth and Lonesome Dove.  Both of those novels I wished for hundreds of more pages- I wanted the stories to go on and on.  This novel just KEPT GOING.  Even after the War was over (hope this isn't a spoiler- WWI is over...), there were still hundreds of pages about the Bolsheviks, and on and on...<br /><br />I'm am amazed and absolutely impressed with his writing and the research that goes into Follett's historical fictions, but this one would have been nice at 25% off.  On an up note- I learned more about WWI in this novel than in either high school or college.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, it is incredibly realistic and easy to use, if you accidentally delete it from your console the 're download it, it remembers your details and you can get you game back.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|This is the first Angry Birds that I didn't get bored with.  I love playing as both sides of Star Wars.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults, but there are some parts that could scare children  under 5. The main vampire turns his face really red and demonic when he's mad. He only does this for a few seconds but if your child is prone to getting scared this may not be a good one. After all it only takes one image for a nightmare.
031623480X|5.0|This book is well written.  The author, a neurologist, gives clear information.  He does not recommend that a person go on a gluten-free diet willy nilly.  Rather, he encourages people to be tested for celiac disease or gluten sensitivity before embarking on this diet.<br /><br />As a health care professional, this is one of the first books I have read that doesn't sensationalize a gluten-free diet.  In addition, the author makes it clear that even though one goes on this diet due to diagnosis of necessity, there are still carbohydrate pitfalls.<br /><br />As a celiac for 22 years, there was little to nothing available other than rice cakes at the time of my diagnosis.  Now, there are so many choices it is mind boggling.  As Dr. Perlmutter states, carbohydrates are just that  whether or not they are gluten free  I know from personal experience how wonderful it can be when someone newly diagnosed can finally find tasty gluten-free brownies, cookies, candy bars.....and the list goes on.  Many of us find we can't get enough of these because we miss what we used to eat.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter brings up important points about weight gain from too many carbs, diabetes and new research about how the brain is affected.<br /><br />Just a reminder, though.  When most people are diagnosed with celiac disease, it is not uncommon to gain weight on a gluten-free diet.  Many times, this is due to that fact that the body had not been able to absorb nutrients properly due to small intestine damage from gluten.  Don't expect a flat belly instantly.<br /><br />Also featured are great recipes using common ingredients, meal planning ideas and exercise tips.<br /><br />The incidence of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity is high; however,always remember to work with your primary health care provider before undertaking the gluten-free diet on your own.
B00C27LB20|5.0|I almost didn't even bother listening to the sample for his album because it looks like something out of Beiberland.  Never judge an album by its cover.  This guy is anything but Beiber.  For starters he plays and sings music.  His lyrics are way beyond, \\"I'm like baby...\\"  You can hear Dylan, Cash, and hint of Lou Reed shining through his music.  This is a musician not a pop star.  Every song on the album is really really good.  There are few albums that I sit and listen to in its entirety.  This is now one of them.
B0052OSTOS|4.0|What was she talking about? ....I have NO idea.  I only woke up to write this review......Lol! Seriously this is a great app. for relaxing ....
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games is the best of the series. Poignant, new thinking, violent, hard hitting, another &#34;Big Brother is watching you&#34; novel. Reminds me of &#34;The Lottery&#34;
B007712XAU|5.0|I love Downton Abbey!!!!!!!  Mary is my favorite.  I love watching her change through the series.  I also love Anna.  She is so kind and love the way the show developed the relationship between her and Mr. Bates.
1932100660|5.0|I am just getting to the finish - I have been changed forever on the foods I personally will eat. This book should be a number one book to read. We need to be a voice for the younger generation.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have read this book so many times I just realize that I never did a review for it, wtf was I thinking by not review this book. This book was everything to me, Travis is my dream guy but too bad he's not real damn. Dude is freaking hot, the bike and the underground fighting make him ten times hotter and let's not forget those gorgeous tattoos yummy.  This book was so darn sexy I have it on kindle and paperback so I can pass it along, you have to read this you'll not regret it.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|WHAT IN THE WORLD!!! Everything in this book I didn't understand.  Please make this in a kids version. Thank you.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I had trouble putting it down and was sad when it was finished. Creative, thoughtful, and magical in an adult, non-childlike way. Truly a great book.
B003U74NQW|1.0|This was rated quite high as a suspenseful thriller on a few websites.  I found it confusing, scattered, and overall messed up.  I know it's supposed to be sort of a dark thriller, but it is just plain disturbing.  And I generally love thrillers, but this one would get a zero if it were an option.  The plot was very confusing, drawn out and actually boring.  I forced myself to finish it, thinking it would get better but of course I was disappointed.  I can't put it in any other terms, just messed up.
B004PIKPTY|1.0|Worst headset I've ever bought. Cord twists like crazy and gets tangled very easy. No presence of bass whatsoever, unless you use the virtual surround sound which sounds like crap. Uncomfortable and shorted out after 4 months. Definitely not worth the $80 I paid for it. In fact, it's worse then the $30 Plantronics headset I had
B00CSYR432|5.0|Fantastic movie! I loved every minute of it! One of Studio Ghibli's best works so far! I highly recommend it!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Pulitzer prize winners are always a good bet. No exception here. I agree with the concerns about the story not being linear, but this lends itself to the atmosphere of unreality that is the reality of life in North Korea. It is a wacky, perverse, and dangerous place, where one minute to the next you don't know who you are, much less where you'll find yourself. In this framework what might otherwise be a too dreamlike (or nightmarish) tale becomes a richly rewarding story of redemption.
0062238868|5.0|This is a great book about  chris kyle, our american sniper with over 150 confirmed kills.  A true american hero.

B00005AREQ|5.0|I can listen to Jeff Beck all day. His artistry transcends many other guitarists as his variety of music never fails t oboth please and surprise me
B002Q5L024|5.0|I remember this film taking everyone by surprise, myself included, when it was released ( I was rooting for it to win the Oscar for best pic!).  Many years later it's still as fresh and fulfilling as ever, like a good BBQ meat.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This CD is truly more than a collection of music. I had seen this on cable, and decided I just had to have it. Joe B live is an awesome presentation of multiple styles that keep you listening to every note.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|An outstanding, if chilling, read for anyone interested not only in the abstracts of nuclear strategy but also American cultural and political history as well as the nuts and bolts of how nukes were supposed to be delivered and how the US tried to keep them safe (spoiler alert: even though there haven't been any accidental nuclear detonations, many parts of the nuclear arsenal were patently unsafe and unprotected). Impeccably researched and cited, this book effectively does what so many similar books haven't -- it adds a palpable human element by providing the perspective and recollections of people who were on the front lines of the Cold War, and this makes the story even more chilling. Completely captivating -- I read all 499 pages in two days.
B000002JSN|5.0|I recently realized I didn't have this in my collection (thought I did). This purchase was to complete my Zep collection with perhaps their finest studio work ever.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun game. Pictures are pretty and games are challenging. I got it free but worth two bucks
B00E00OGE2|1.0|I brought my 2 kids to watch this movie and they were bored. Sorry, I just didn't agree with the other's..
B0036S4B6M|5.0|One can't never imagine life in prison and sometimes not even the magnitude of our choices.<br /><br />Piper brings the absurdity of our prison system and its startling ineffectiveness right into our consciousness.<br /><br />This book should be read by every teenager hungry for adventure and every penal and justice system employee, but most especially by the people who develop and dictate the laws.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|This was one of my favorite books as a child. Now I get to share it with mine.  A classic
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Apparently this was an awesome game.  My daughter really loves this game.  And the best part about it,  it was FREE!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn does it again! Another seat of your pants story that keeps you in the drivers seat until the very end.
0307346617|5.0|Liked the movie, however I really liked the book.  The book had certain sections with f bombs, might not be appropriate for young adult readers.

B00422LESO|5.0|I really liked it, it kept me guessing through the book.  I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very entertaining! A page turner. You will not want to put it down. Have all 3 books ready because you will want to finish the series.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Was playing this game for awhile then asked for me to download an update not I can't play at all how can this be fixed.? It is such a great game hope to get back to it soon.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Uno is the best game ever. Give it a try and see for your self. You will not be disappointed
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|I see that a lot of people gave this game one star because of 1) in-game purchases, which you don't need at any point, or 2) &quot;it's ripping off the Gravity Suit from Jetpack Joyride&quot; although that didn't turn the whole game into a puzzle-platformer. Even if the protagonist is the same, the games are distinctly different. Gravity Guy requires much quicker reflexes, making it more difficult. In Jetpack Joyride, the Gravity Suit lasts until you get hit, so there's more margin for error. So overall, GG is a fun yet challenging game that deserves to be played.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A good app to have if you need to check the battery life of your Kindle HD.  I highly recommended it.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This version is just OK ! I really like it better with the hourly forecast and I has always been pretty accurate...Could be better of you had the hourly back
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is really cool though at the beginning it is a bit hard to get coins without spending money
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is sooooo addicting! I absolutely love this game and the beach is a great addition do this! Plus adding things to the other theme u go thru awesome too! I highly recommend this game!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|&quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; game is amazing and very addictive once you start playing. The storyline is pretty fantastic and interesting, I would love to give this game five stars - I want to so bad! But the only thing stopping me are the graphics.. The graphics are okay, they could be so much better.<br />  But Overall this is a really good game and it is worth every penny ! :)
B00DU74U74|5.0|This movie is very much worth your time and your money. Something possessed me while watching this movie for the first time that just brought me to tears. Sadly, I have not read the book, and if you haven't either then theres no pre-judgement stopping you from appreciating a wonderful movie! Do as you want not as youre told by others. Get your own opinion on the movie instead of \\"taking someone's word for it\\".
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The chromecast is great on paper - until it stops working within the first month you own it. Good luck getting anywhere with Google on support resolution. The warranty center is clearly unmanned, and there's nothing to do except contact your credit card company and reverse the charges on your card.  Don't purchase until Google gets its act together on the support side.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been reading science fiction for a few years, like 45 and I tell you this is good science fiction. I'm going to go find some more by Hugh Howey.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|I had no idea that I was going to enjoy watching the Harry Potter movies as much as I have done so.
1476727651|5.0|What a delight! Like Mr. King, I have been wondering what happened to Danny for the past 30 years...and I was not disappointed!<br /><br />Let me first say that yes, I AM a SK fan. But he has written a few books that I had trouble finishing, and a few that I thought weren't up to par. Doctor Sleep was not one of those books! It took me a week to read, not because it was slow but because I only had time to read from 9-11 every night before bed! The last two days I carried the book around with me hoping for traffic or long waiting lines!<br /><br />My favorite thing about Mr. King is the way he gives his characters clay feet, but makes them totally redeemable and lovable at the same time. Danny T. has not had an easy life (and didn't we all wonder how anyone could overcome The Overlook? I know I was scarred for life!) and his shining has made things even more complicated. When he finally hits rock bottom, he finds his way home, finds a job and a family, and then finally puts his demons to rest. A thoroughly engaging, delightful read...not The Shining, but very good all on it's own.
B00271DNP4|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching the Harry Potter movies, much to my amazement.  Held my attention and the story was a little complicated for me, but my grandson kept me informed.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Linklater has created a true masterpiece with this trilogy.  Saw Before Midnight this summer and re-watched Before Sunrise.  Finally saw Before Sunset which is as wonderful as the other two.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Azkend works well on my Kindle Fire HD. It is a simple game, which doesn't require much thought, but I still love it. Great graphics and music.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|This is a terrible app for composing email. The keyboard on the Kindle Fire completely covers what you are writing. Plus you can ONLY use the app in landscape mode. It is OK for reading mail. Just terrible if you are trying to reply or compose new mail.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|What is happening? This game was fun til last week it stopped opening. Please fix or do an update. My kids can't play. It's been over a week now.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|First of all, I can't believe she is only 16! I wish I were that cool when I was that age. OK, very cool album. Very mature. Mellow. So much better than anyone in the USA right now. I don't know what else to say. Buy it!
B00F35BV64|3.0|Very fun and exciting movie. I enjoyed it. The only thing is there are some huge plot holes and things that are just wrong. For example being able to teleport to the Klingon planet and the fact that we now have super blood that brings people back from death. These two things pretty much change history, but they are overlooked in the show like \\"Hey, it's a fun movie if you don't think about it or realize the history of the show or what these two things mean for the future.\\"<br /><br />Another thing I don't like is the over acting. I mean way over acting. Much of the cast is like an exagerated version of the origional people. Benedict did an amazing job though I should say.<br /><br />The movie is not really true to the series ... The series is very nerdy and it's important to the series to try and be accurate. The whole show is about understanding and exploring. This movie was was about gun fights and explosions.<br /><br />It was still fun though. Cool aliens at the start. Some romance. Some great lines. Drama. Very exciting. Love Spock and Uhura.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I hated this game on my phone so I took a chance with it on my fire. Love it! Great graphics, smooth transitions &amp;&amp; highly addictive!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have played many of these types of games and this was enjoyable. The hidden object games were easy, as we're the dominoes games that you can play instead of the hidden objects. The puzzles were not taxing. The story line was quite strong.  The graphics were good.ON the whole a good game to while away a few hours.<br />NIcky[[ASIN:B00ATDOVNK Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden]]
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|This game was originally sold for 4.99, but has been reduced for the time being to 99 cents. It is fun. Beautiful. And well worth the coin. Also, don't worry about in app purchases. You can... but you don't need to. If you train once a day, and then buy skills with in game currency earned by unlimited quick plays which  take mere seconds and you can easily finish it without buying anything else. If you like boxing and own a kindle fire, then do not hesitate. Also it is way less space than I thought it would need at around 200 to 300 mb<br /><br />Correction: You can train once every 5 fights for free and not just once a day like I previously wrote, and it costs 500 in game currency to train if you fight less than 5 fights. If you fight 5 quick fights, you get 500 coins. Then you can train twice, and repeat. Or, you could also fight 5 league fights and make 1250 coins and train several times. After playing a few more hours, there is no need to ever buy anything via in-app purchasing. Even all of the outfits, customizations, and \\"perks\\" are really cheap to buy with in game currency awarded by winning fights. The only thing you might want to buy are 2 arenas (Rome and Moscow) that are not included in the 4 arenas that come with the game. Also, it may not be as pretty on Kindle as on other devices, but I think it looks unbelievably good.
B00772M1F6|3.0|Ok, but nothing like their live performance. we saw them at the HD 105th in Milwaukee and they were awesome.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|It's great if your looking for a chick flick.  Funny in some parts, slow in others, no sex or nudity.

B00EFNXPFK|5.0|This is a great cd.  I loved all the songs and then went online to see what songs belong to his former girlfriends and Katy.  I have all of John's cds and as a former Bridgeport, Connecticut native I am one of his favorite fans.  I feel for him trying to find true love and growing more mature each album.  Keep up the good work John.  Genius or not what difference does it make in my eyes you are a perfect Connecticut guy.  Jean B. Mastroni

B005ES11VK|3.0|I purchased these shoes as a birthday gift for my husband and after wearing them for about a week they actually shrunk and no longer fit him! I have never heard of such a thing before and am very sad since now it is past the time to return them.<br />I would just now like to add that after reading online I discovered that Crocs have the tendencency to shrink if left out in the heat.  As my husband did leave his out in the heat I am sure this is why they shrunk.  It is surprising for a product that is not cheap that this would happen.  Just please be mindful and if you purchase these shoes do not leave them out in the heat!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This was even better than the first book. I could not leave this it alone... Now, on to book three.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I liked this story quite a bit. The author did a good job of making the characters and the settings very real.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|This movie is excellent. Highly recommended. GREAT action. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome and did an awesome job in the movie. The new enemy is VERY powerful which makes the movie very electrifying and action packed. There are a lot of new and excellent qualities in this movie that make it a great and fun movie experience. I loved this movie in theaters and I love it just as much on 3D. I love this version.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|The movie Yentl is a timeless classic that tells the touching story of a young Jewish woman who dared to dream outside of the box of tradition with the courage to pursue it in spite of objection from her countrymen and the lonely and potentially dangerous journey that was necessary. As she begins her new life disguised as a young man thirsty for wisdom and knowledge of the Torah, it is evident that God is with her by providing protection and answers to prayer. The unselfish love that unfolds in Yentl's relationships is heartfelt, and the music is just simply superb. This must be Barbra Streisand's greatest work ever.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|WARNING: Spoilers for Gravity follow below.<br /><br />The theme of rebirth and the visual motif of human pregnancy runs prevalent throughout Alfonso Cuaron's long awaited new film, Gravity. The film I think first takes a scientific view and then gradually moves towards a more spiritual, religious one at the end. We first see Earth and then the space shuttle and Hubble appear as a dot getting bigger and bigger as we (or they) come closer and closer to the screen. It's when they first appear as a dot that I got the feeling that I was seeing a picture of a Hydrogen atom orbiting around it's nucleus (the Earth). Hydrogen, as we all know (or should) is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, yet it is also the smallest and simplest one there is on the periodic table. The first shot mimics this idea of the Macro and the Micro, with us starting off in extreme long shot and eventually going in on a single bolt that Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) has to retrieve for Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). Nuts and bolts are also very small, simple things that are essential parts of bigger structures, much like Hydrogen. We then hear via Houston (Ed Harris in a genius bit of voice casting) say that the Russians have sent an anti-satellite missile that has inadvertently caused a lot of high speed debris to hurtle towards the shuttle. While this is the inciting incident that kicks the rest of the film into gear, we never see the missile hit the satellite. However, you could interpret the missile and satellite as a sperm and an egg respectively. A sperm and an egg coming together is what causes the chain reaction that leads to a baby being born, just as the missile and the satellite coming together causes the chain reaction that leads to Ryan's rebirth. At the beginning Ryan is actually referred to by her last name, Stone. Like a stone, Ryan is essentially lifeless more or less, oblivious to the wonderful view of Earth and the stars around her. She is only focused on completing the task at hand. It's only later on that she is called by her first name, when the rebirthing process has begun and she has started to become more characterized. Another thing I found intriguing was that there are three main places in the film: the shuttle, the Russian space station, and the Chinese one. They remind me of the three trimesters that make up a human pregnancy, which, when added together equal nine. The film itself is 90 minutes long, which can also be divided up into thirds, or the typical number of acts that make up the story structure of a feature film. Three is also a reference to the Holy Trinity in Christianity although we get an interesting close up shot of a miniature Buddha statue in the Chinese Shenzhou capsule. Take that to mean whatever you want it to (or anything else I write here for that matter). One shot shows Ryan in a fetal position in the Russian station, which is more or less the same position a fetus is in when in it's second trimester. When Ryan has decided to give up and commit suicide, it's like an attempted abortion. Ryan attempts to \\"abort\\" her own rescue mission after finding out the Soyuz has no fuel.At the end when Ryan finally does make it back to Earth, she has to strip down to her underwear as her space suit is drowning her. She takes her first gasp of air and drags herself out of the water into the earthy mud. Water is an elemental symbol for life and earth is the stuff we all came from originally (if you believe in the bible. I do for one). Ryan then then offers up her first ever prayer, \\"Thank you,\\" to whatever deity she has now chosen to believe in, then gets to her knees, then to her feet, and then takes her first steps, reborn as a new person, facing a green wilderness of unknown possibilities.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br /><br />I enjoyed the references to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Having there be no sound in space, the prevalent breathing sounds of the characters while in their space suits, effectively them fish out of water in the ocean of space. Even the fetal image of Ryan reminded me of the Star Child.<br /><br />A bit of a reference to Alien with Ryan announcing over the headset that she was the only survivor of her crew, and the fact that she's a woman.<br /><br />Gravity feels like a companion piece to Children of Men. I'll let you draw your own conclusions as to why.<br /><br />I enjoyed the score, especially the rising musical que associated with the menacing debris field. Reminded me of the Joker's theme from The Dark Knight.<br /><br />I thought it was very silly having Ryan move around with a fire extinguisher. It reminded me of Wall-E.<br /><br />I didn't particularly like the shot of the satellite burning up in the sky. Looked too much like the Columbia. Just a quibble but it made me cringe a little bit.

B0015DRPJU|5.0|Originally posted on my blog: [...]<br /><br />Shadow Kiss was my favorite one of the series! Is it because we see lots of Dimitri? Hmmm.... perhaps. =)<br /><br />I loved this one so much, just seeing Dimitri and Rose's forbidden love. They can't be together. And yet, it's the one thing that seems so right in their messed up world! Dimitri made my heart kind of seize and flutter or some kind of arrhythmic activity -- bottom line, he was affecting my heart in a big way. I loved seeing how awesome of a fighter/guardian he was and fierce and badass and then have it flip and you see his tender, emotional side as well. But only with Rose. That was just the best, seeing them fight against the feelings but knowing THEY ARE MEANT TO BE!<br /><br />Rose is so much more mature in this one. She's trying to deal with a death and it forces her to grow I think. It shows so much that she is Dimitri's student and I love that she respects him so much.<br /><br />Adrian is just as lovable in this one as the last and Christian is awesome -- as always.<br /><br />LOTS of action in this one that had me glued to the book and you get to find out more about this shadow kissed business between Rose and Lissa. Very intriguing and I loved how Richelle Mead works everything in! The twists! The turns! The.. everything!<br /><br />The ending will shatter your heart. Your soul even. I had a mental explosion moment. If I remember correctly I was tweeting like crazy and then had to DM Sheri with ALL my feels. From my notes: \\"holy eff, how are things going to be ok??\\"<br /><br />The ending had me frantic and anxious and I needed the next book like an addict needed their next fix. Seriously, that bad. Instead I had to sleep and go to a volunteer thing bright and early the next day for FIVE hours. It was torture. All I could think about was the book and it was killing me. In fact, I had developed a killer headache, probably due to lack of sleep from reading, and hopefully not related to any... \\"supernatural\\" happenings like Rose experienced.<br /><br />Anyway, needless to say, I headed to B&N ASAP after that volunteer thing and bought the next book. =)
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Great app. I like the way it is set up and the features it has. However, the precipitation readings are not accurate at all. Right now the Louisville area is in the middle of some torrential rainfall with all areas getting 2-4 inches of rain or better. There are flash flood warnings and this app is reading the precipitation at .03 inches.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I've never played the first edition of this game, but if its similar to this one I'd give it a try.  There is just enough variety of ways to build your defense , that you could play for hours on end without getting to bored.  Not to bad for a free app!

0060245867|4.0|Not much of a story, but still cute.  The little mouse is cheeky, and is  adorable in his little denim overalls.
B004HOXWW8|3.0|28/1 - Read it for year 12 English. Probably would have enjoyed it more if we hadn't been forced to read the whole book out loud as a class - some of the scenes were not the kind to be read out loud with idiotic teenage boys jeering at the sex scenes (well, I thought they were sex scenes when I was 17). Despite that horribly embarrassing experience I enjoyed the story and should probably read again now that it's 10 years down the track.
6304806418|5.0|Evita is mesmerizing. Although Lloyd Webber's music is often criticized for sounding all the same, which is true, this movie comes in the category of all music non-dialogue movie, like Umbrellas of Cherbourg.  Evita in the modern tradition is a one-song movie, like Hello Dolly and Damn Yankees. This is one of those. There are other songs in this one, but all the others sound much the same. But its haunting music pervades the movie ending in the conversion of its most famous song Don't Cry for Me, Argentina into a funeral dirge played as a slow tango, so appropriate.  Yes, this is one of the best movies to come out of London, yes London, not Broadway, like Cats and Phantom.  Broadway was just one stop on its road show.
1451629192|4.0|A horrible story. I found it hard to understand how Stockholm syndrome could have damaged her mind so much that she wouldn't attempt to escape, especially in the later years when her kidnappers gave her more freedom. I know that Stockholm syndrome is a psychological condition that is recognised and documented in many different cases, but it just boggles my mind that the even when she was at the police station at the end of the book she kept repeating the \\"story\\" of being on the run from an abusive boyfriend. Why couldn't she see that she was safe? I also found the passages with bad grammar irritating. At the beginning of the book she explains why her writing seems to jump around and change topic abruptly (not something I actually noticed), but that doesn't explain why the grammar couldn't have been editied to make it more readable. The rating lost 1/2 a star because of the grammar.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Its a good brain workout. It makes you think outside the box using things we use every day with our smartphones.
159413586X|3.0|I have really enjoyed this series. Mockingjay was the least enjoyable book. I was really disappointed with the ending. Everything was going fine up until the point where she leaves the fashion store and joins the crowd of citizens walking to the capital. From that point on it felt like Collins had suddenly gotten tired of the story and was simply writing it to get the series finished. She didn't seem to have put as much thought into the final chapters as she had any other part of the series. As I was reading the last two chapters I kept thinking \\"Did I miss a chapter, maybe the book was printed with a defect.\\" It felt like Collins had skipped bits, or maybe the editor decided it was too long and cut parts out. I had considered buying the series after reading the first book, I'm glad I didn't as I would probably never read it again as the ending will always taint my feelings toward the whole series. I wouldn't be able to read either of the previous books without thinking of that horrible ending. I gave it 3.5 stars because, despite the horrible ending I really enjoyed the rest of the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|An amazing book. You truly cannot predict the story line! Will read again and recommend this book to everyone I know!
1250037751|4.0|27/06 - Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is about a bookstore and the slightly fantastical people who frequent it, for either work or pleasure. There's a secret society that funds it and keeps it going in the background, and to start with I thought there was going to be some actual magic worked into the secret society. While there were no wands or incantations, there was still magic in the story. There was magic in the way the 26-year-old star and narrator of the story believes that physical bookstores will carry on because people still like the way books smell, and you can't get that through your Kindle (I read an actual book edition). There was magic in Robin Sloane's final message, that being immortal isn't about living forever, it's about what you do with your life and your impact on the people around you. And I have to disagree with his assertion that this book, like all books before it and after, will fade to the back of my mind - I don't think it will fade at all, I think I'll remember the descriptions of Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore with it's three storey shelves and the waybacklist for many years to come.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|This album is fantastic - totally worth the price. There are 2 cd's with about 15 tracks and, once again, Mika did a fantastic job.
0385333846|3.0|17/07 - It's a bit hard to know what to say about Slaughterhouse 5 that hasn't already been said by much more intelligent reviewers than myself. I am of the opinion that while I understood the book - the words, sentences and even some complete paragraphs - I don't think I exactly got what it was about. Most of the themes and oblique references that I caught a fleeting glimpse of went straight over my head and disappeared in the rear-view before I had the chance to fully examine them. Other than the generic 'war is bad' theme that most books like this feature I couldn't really give a name to any of the other themes that were flitting about. I found Billy Pilgrim's time travelling especially strange and confusing. I wasn't sure if it was meant to be real time travel or a metaphor or some kind of dream sequence where the only real parts were when he was the oldest and the rest where dreams of his past experiences.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|A fitting way to end the series. Mankind survives to start anew. The Chancellor had a nice failsafe after all.
B00C2IF9SQ|4.0|I had always wanted to be in gymnastics when I was young, especially after I watched the magnificent seven perform at the Olympics. Dominique was my favorite gymnasts and I was in awe at how amazing she was. Little did I know she was living a private hell each and everyday she spent with the Karolyis. I remember watching Bela Karolyi and thinking how lucky these girls were to be trained under him as he seemed to care deeply for them. I was even really excited when I saw him appear on an episode of one of my favorite shows \\"Make it or Break it\\". I cannot believe how deceiving this man and his wife truly are. I think Dominique was brave to come forward and tell the world the honest truth about the secrets no one could have imagined were happening behind the scenes. From the rifts with her father, to being starved and emotionally tortured by the Karoliyis,and the emotional reunion with a sister she never knew she had, Dominique knows how to capture and hold a readers attention.

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />If you are a mecha fan, you know what I'm talking about: how can you not like a movie with a giant mecha fitted with a rocket punch and GM drive that the pilots have to 'pilder-ON' to ride it?  And that take-off lift.  AND THAT SYNCRO RATE THING.  I thought I was having a heart attack first 10 minutes into the movie...<br /><br />As far as I know, this is the first hollywood movie that features a robot that requires pilots - a monumental moment in the history of mecha fandom. Same time, not making a same mistake of focusing on human instead of robot alone makes this movie superior to Tranformer movie series.<br /><br />Some may lament that the narrative is a bit weak.  Well, it is pity that they couldn't fit all the story explained in the novelized version, but I think the movie still flows considerably well enough.  Besides, WHAT ARE YOU DOING LOOKING AT HUMAN, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT ROBOTS!<br /><br />I watched this movie two times with and without 3D and I can you tell you - you HAVE to watch this in 3D, at least once!  You can only truly appreciate this movie in such way because subtle details like debries flying and water vapors are most visible that way.<br /><br />Fan sentiment aside, this is a very enterntaining movie.  I think the only thing this movie is missing is a pile bunker, but that's just me.<br /><br />P.S  There is a little girl crying in middle of a japnese city and Gamera doesn't show up?  What!?<br />P.P.S  Such a shame that japanese voice track is not included.  Would have been funny to watch the same thing while listening to Bullet and Ayanami Rei in a same mech...
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Love this CD.  Recently found out about Rodriquez.  He is an amazing man and singer.  What an honor to own it.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|I was excited about this movie and couldn't wait to finally see it. The plot is fresh and a new twist for a scary ghost story. The acting is good, especially the little girls, they were awesome. But it could have been so much more than it was! It dragged at times and was a little too predictable. The way they ended it was a total fail. Maybe my expectations were just too high going into it. I give it 3 stars.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it. The game is challenging and keeps me going. I didn't realize at first there was multiple rooms per floor though. Took me a minute to figure that out.

193700788X|1.0|I just finished reading this and I am just at a loss. Was this penned by a bad ghostwriter? It reads more like bad fanfiction than a Sookie Stackhouse book...<br /><br />I just finished re-reading the entire series (Deadlocked and this were a first read) and while Dead in the Family wasn't as bad as I remembered, it's clear that's where Harris began to lose interest in her world. By this book, it is quite obvious that she is overly eager to get it over with as quickly as possible and the story suffers.<br /><br />Be warned, there are spoilers within...<br /><br />First of all, Harris has never once used third-person in this series and it is one of the reasons I suspect a bad ghostwriter. Third-person narrative takes up probably half the book and it isn't even well done. What's even worse is that Sookie's storytelling is also just different... and not in a good way.<br /><br />Let's take a moment to acknowledge my biggest pet peeve with this book--she destroyed my favorite characters. Eric is turned into a meek shell of what he has been in other books. He doesn't fight against Felipe or for Sookie and is hardly in the book at all. He basically shows up and tells Sookie that he loves her,  publically divorces her, shows up expecting her to drop everything and move to Oklahoma to be his mistress. Then he gets mad when she says no and TELLS Sookie that he should have turned her without asking!  Seriously?! Sookie then recovers from her heartbreak in the blink of an eye and a relationship that has been built up arguably since book 2 is ruined. None of Eric's motivations make any sense when you see how easily he gives her up and how readily he just falls into line. Odd, especially since he ruthlessly mutdered Victor and his goons just a book or two ago for trying to force him out...<br /><br />The entire feel of this book is just off and as the final Sookie Stackhouse book, it just didn't cut it for me. What a crap ending for a spectacular series.<br /><br />And Sook's HPE doesn't gibe either. After several books' worth of our beloved heroine wondering whether she and Eric loved each other or if it was the blood bond, the lazily written line about how she 'didn't care' if the cluviel door had caused her and Sam to care about each other was just plain awful.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend buying this book to anyone. I feel pretty sure there is fanfiction out there that wraps this series up a lot better and now I'm off to find some.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|we have a battle going on in our home with this game. we fight for the kindle and best score.

B00CL8D83U|5.0|so pet shop boys are pretty much back to the basics. if you are in your mid 30s like me, this album will bring you to tears and will take you down memory lane when you were just a 20 something year old boy discovering dance music and looking for inner strength. this is also a great addition to your work out list. bolshy is the only mediocre song on this album;; all other songs are pretty great, combining what the boys are best known for: great colorful melodies along amazing synth/dance music.<br /><br />get ready for an auditory orgasm with axis. this is a tune you must listen to with headphones on and high volume. adrenaline rush is an understatement. once the song is over, you will feel like a bomb just exploded inside your brain, ...in a good way that is.<br /><br />enjoy electric, from beginning to end.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Really fun classic game. Great execution making the game addictive. Love it. Make sure you don't start playing a game before going to bed or you may be like me right now and playing it when you should be sleeping

0385743564|4.0|I always expect an entertaining story from Mr. Sanderson, and was not disappointed in that regard. Well-developed characters, imaginative action, engaging banter, and a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed, however, that it was such an easy read. A little too easy. By this I mean that I had to look up only one word -less than in some of his YA books. I never had to look back and re-read anything. As the story progressed, I was getting the feeling he dumbed this one down a bit, making it less challenging.<br /><br />Personally, I don’t want everything spelled out for me. There was even one moment where I was slightly insulted, when the main character recalled various events/clues in the book – all in one breath- to explain a particular mystery. I get it, but did he have to mention all of them? All at once? In the right order? Wouldn’t David, the main character, have required a few moments to put them all together like that? Revelations are more fascinating if they make you think- make you read the book again and again to catch all the hints yourself.<br /><br />Pointing everything out is great for a movie I guess, but not so much fun for the discerning reader. I feel as though Mr. Sanderson is making some compromises for the general masses. No insult to the general masses. In fact, give us some credit please.<br /><br />On the other hand, I always appreciate the clear and easy-to-follow action sequences, especially for those of us who are a bit challenged in keeping up with gun-slinging, seat-of-your-pants combat scenes. I don’t require a movie to envision Sanderson’s descriptions. If a film studio ever made a movie of Steelheart, I bet I’d be a bit let down. Like hard lining, inking and coloring great sketches. The process always wipes out some of the original charter and emotion (the soul if you will) of the action. Gotta work on those metaphors… :)<br /><br />Still, I'd Love to see a GOOD movie of one of his novels someday...if that's possible.

B0004Z33F0|5.0|Her we have Sly Stallone  being John Rambo  again  in his 3rd installment  of the series  in this flick John winds up going to Afghanistan  and joins forces local resistance to fight off the Russians.  Good flick overall.
B001QL35D6|5.0|Michael Jacksons high water mark as an artist, there were many highlights in his career but this is the best for mine. Few albums in my collection qualify into the category of &#34; every song is a must hear&#34; but Thriller is just that. Sony have a recently introduced technology somehow connected to blu ray called &#34;blu spec&#34;. It has loads of detail and speed. You hear layers in your music you may have missed. It is brighter than DSD in many ways, a technology used on Super Audio Cd or SACD another technology Sony played a big part in. As an Audiophile I love to hear the differences of all recording technologies. Worth buying if you love this recording and have a system needing some lifts in detail.
B0013D8LG8|4.0|Yeah we like it  its a pretty decent Arthur story  with Richard Gere  playing Lancelot and  Julia Ormond playing Guinevere  and of course Sean Connery  playing Arthur  a one nice little flick.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|Did not purchase two movies.  Therefore no rating for this one movie.  So why do I still have to rate something I did not purchase?
B003HKN52U|1.0|The disk was cracked. I had a party and it was to show Interview with a Vampire. When it wa opened, it had from the center of the disk a one inch crack. The party was a falure and I am not happy. Please review all the itiems I have purchused from you and szxee this is not an acceptable way to do bussiness with a loyal custmer. very displeased. I want a phone number that I may speak with this matter to a person
0385535147|5.0|Another page turner by John Grisham.  He is my favorite fiction author and I have every one of his books.  Excellent!!!
6305428387|5.0|This movie is always a joy to watch. And I have to add more words apparently. I need 4 more they tell me.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I read this because my son says he wants to be a chef.This book was more enjoyable than I expected. A quick read.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|As always Dan Brown has managed to work fact with fiction in an exciting story of intrigue. Thoroughly enjoyed this .
0375869026|4.0|I got Wonder from a yard sale and read it in one day. R.J. Palacio's writing is amazing and I fell in love with Auggie and his family. His parents were warm and real and adore their son despite his several facial abnormalities and treat him with humor and genuine affection. The part where Auggie says, \\"Mommy, why am I so ugly?\\" absolutely broke my heart and made me cry. Who doesn't feel like that at some point in their day, week, year, life (insert whatever word to substitute for 'ugly') no matter how normal-looking?<br /><br />I must agree with the teenaged reviewer who didn't love the changes in point of view - that did stop the flow for me, too. I kept thinking, if the author was going to do that, why not have Mr. Tushman write a few chapters (I LOVED Mr. Tushman)? Or his parents? I write children's books so I'm guessing she wanted all the points of view to come from children and I realize that having different points of view gives the reader insight into the lives of those around Auggie. I loved Auggie's voice more than all the others and would have preferred having the entire book told from his point of view.<br /><br />The other reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is that I was pretty surprised by how \\"old\\" the kids in the 5th grade sounded. First of all, where we live, 5th grade is still elementary school and middle school is 6th-8th or even 7th-8th (Jr. High). It felt to me like these kids with all their talk of the \\"popular crowd\\" and noticing how \\"hot\\" girls were and being \\"flat\\" were really about two years older than typical 10-year-olds. I have a 5th grader and these are not words in his vocabulary so though I loved the message of the book and the ending was amazing, it's not a book I would recommend to him for a couple of years.
1616550414|5.0|Amazing book, amazing edition, love it... Edited by Black Horde, what else can you ask for?<br /><br />Go buy it now! :D
B00006DEFA|5.0|Such a great movie a complete historical fantasy<br />This is a one of a kind movie the three hours just fly by

B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this app and will buy all of them! This is a great app I just wish I had more time to play. Works great on my kindle fire.
B002VPEAM6|5.0|This is so much better than the movie. Usually we read the book before the movie but it was the reverse this time. The book stands out as one of our all time short reads.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I liked it alot ,great movie . Well put together, Interesting stuff, pretty actresses  would highly recommend. is this finally enough words to finish.....
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like pretty visuals!  This one is beautiful and effective.  When I see the sunny picture I want to go outside, when I see the cloudy picture I want to read on my Kindle HD.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Read it on a dare and I really liked it! Liked it so much that I'm reading the third and final book now. Collins characters may be in their teens, but the craftsmanship of the writing is strictly grown up. Would consider other works by Collins.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read. It's up there with the Great Gatsbys and the Catcher in the Ryes!
B005COO1X6|4.0|The Boogeyman maintains true form: spare nothing, spare no one. Improbable, yes. Captivating, always. Looking forward to another four or five decades.
B004X2JVW4|5.0|Powerful I give it as a gift often. You will find wisdome every time you read the words on the page.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|Cue the epic score.<br /><br />The movie received all the fame, as it is rightly due, yet the novel is a companion that would be a sin to ignore.  Alone, they are great, together, they become something greater.<br /><br />It's difficult to discuss the book without referencing the movie.  In this case, it isn't a bad thing because the novel was created with the film in mind.  Having said that, the novel is an enjoyable read full of engaging speculation.  Some of the science may not hold up but it is quite forgivable.  If you're looking for a solid Science Fiction read or want to enrich the film/novel experience, pick up 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is an amazing story of two kids with cancer falling in love. I couldn't put it down. I literally read it in one day.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I bought it for my 23 year old daughter and she was thrilled!!!  Have watched the movie several times 'so far' and the phaser is displayed in her room in a safe place!!!
B004ZH66XO|3.0|Love the controls, but the game gets repetitive. I wish there was more fun stuff to buy. Great for the cost (of 0 dollars)!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I got this app and started learning French and it teaches words a  you go.  It is easy to use and I&acute;m only 10 years old.  This is a wonderful app.
0802473156|5.0|This is such a wonderful book. I would recommend to any married couple. Whether it's a bad, good or great marriage!
B000JMKTLO|1.0|Sorry I paid for this one. Would not recommend I am hesitant about this author girl gone was ok twisted ending  this one was sick
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|The game seems fun at first but then it's money money money. When you finally open the aquatic side, you will not find DNA unless you spend money. I am so sorry that I wasted my time on this game.
B000XUAEUS|4.0|Until late this September, I had never heard of William Boyd.  This is a fascinating book, and it rings true, despite its many coincidences.  The reader who lived through WWII, or who is interested in the era, will be drawn into Boyds milieu.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Both my daughter and I enjoyed this. We look forward to the other FlipPix games. I like that we can sign in as different users so we can play different grid sizes.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I decided to read the trilogy after a conversation with friends at work who insisted I read all three books. I'm not into erotica but I am curious about this trilogy and the upcoming movie next summer. Let me say, I am delighted to say I'm now a bona fide fan of the two leading characters, Christian and Ana. This series was not at all what I expected but is so much more.<br /><br />E. L. James created an amazing love story tucked inside erotic literature. The prose is simple but, for me, it was perfect for the story being told. Christian and Ana are deeply involved in a complicated and intense relationship that left me breathless more than I care to admit. Anna's innocence is in stark contrast to Christian's experience and when they are in balance, it is earth shattering. I LOVED Christian's pure Alpha Male personality juxtaposed directly against his willingness to be vulnerable in order to have Ana's love. He will move heaven and earth for her yet all she wants is his trust, heart and love. They learn about themselves while navigating their intense relationship which is a gift all by itself.<br /><br />I have no desire to read anything else in this genre because for me, this trilogy is \\"it\\" and perfect. Excellent job!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Watching 720p videos on my kindle fire is Crystal clear quality. The ads are a little annoying, but the quality makes it worth it. Highly recommended
B00F2362IE|4.0|I really like this app. However it can take up to five min. to load. I enjoy that you can pick your favorite turtle(mine is Raphael) it is a lot like temple run two but you are fighting the foot and bugs while being chased by a ship. great game def get it
B00AON2X9O|5.0|A timeless classic with John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in BluRay.  Can't beat it. Love it.  Great.  Stupendous.  Outstanding.  Wow.
B00A83075M|5.0|I first watched this movie the second it came out and knew I had to purchase it the second it came out on DVD.  I've watched it more than five times and love it every time.  Fast shipping and great movie!
B00CXLQG0M|5.0|The BEST Nerf blaster evar! I think it is without equal for aesthetics, ergonomics and just sheer Fun value. Not made for little peoples hands -unlike many of the new Nerf Elite range at the moment. Cannot wait to repaint it.
B00AIBZLVY|2.0|Ok, in a nutshell, this movie was freakin' terrible.  SLOW, awful, boring piece of crap movie.  If you're looking to watch something good and scary, try Sinister or The Strangers.  This does not even compare to Sinister...not even a little.  I don't know how this movie got any good reviews.  Maybe if you drink a few strong alcoholic beverages first, this movie will appear decent.  Otherwise, colossal waste of time.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Liked all the  games. The variety appealed to everyone in our family. Worth the 99 cents. A must have a
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Every song on this album is good. Every song is not the same sound, as many artist have a problem with, and they are fun to listen to. I love this album.
B00000IQV7|5.0|Prefer to have DVD versions of my movies. This is a true and touching story. Like the special features. Item came on time and in perfect condition.
0783219695|4.0|Always enjoy watching this mostly-accurate re-telling of the unfortunate mission. Thought full version was missing, but finally found it on second disk. LOVE special features.!
B001O1O71C|5.0|This is a terrifying account of what can happen when we don't pay close attention to the people and places around us.<br />One boy was so sheltered he didn't even know what kind of work his father did. The other had seen much much more than any human should have been exposed to.  A unique friendship develops and each gets the opportunity to see how the other is living at that time. Then the unthinkable happens.  Everyone is a loser.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|First book I've read but loved it. Thankful to have discovered her.  I an now officially a fan and ready to read all!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|I love everything Michael, and gave this a try, It is very good and a compliment to him and his family. Thank you
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Very moving.  Grabs you from the first few pages.  I'll read more by the author.  Maybe more of a woman's book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Can't wait to start over and up the ante... This book was a blessing and arrived right on time in my journey! Looking forward to continuous growth and understanding.
B00EJYGQFG|3.0|Live and learn I guess.  No more Pre-orders of music from Amazon. I ordered this from Amazon not a third party and it was labeled Pre-order, thought it was for entire album.  Wasn't expecting CD until November, received Single cd in mail....so i paid $8.99 for a single and instrumental...wow...great...
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Very good game but some things are almost impossible to see. The game has a very interesting premise with ghosts and other strange things.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Freezes, kicks you off app, erratic back arrow behavior ... usually won't take you back to the screen you &quot;jumped&quot; from, insisting on making you &quot;pound&quot; the arrow and if you're lucky it won't kick you off....touch screen accuracy is wanting.....<br />I could go on!
B00915G6MG|5.0|characters, humor, fast paced, good story arcs, great acting, the absolute best tv series currently on tv bar none.  not stupid reality based junk
B00ESY827C|4.0|I LOVED how well it stuck to the book, but the soundtrack was too modern.  They took songs from today and combined them with 1920s music and it didn't work.  Everything else was good
B008220DGE|4.0|After watching \\"The Master\\" last night, I was wondering if I had been too sleepy to really \\"get it\\" or that perhaps I DID get the movie's meaning but I couldn't believe that I got it, because it seemed so ambiguous and perspective dependent. So I plugged \\"meaning of The Master\\" into the search engine this morning.  There I found that many literary reviews pretty much confirmed what I had been thinking -- the movie was a deep character analysis of all the major players--their base desires and motives, from their projected personal images to their shadows--some of which were more prominent and blatant than others, like Quell's. It showed how each character's personal motives and interactions with the others intensified the drama of life itself, post-WWII, through their individual and group searches for life's meaning. And speaking of allegorical and metaphorical ambiguities, WHO was THE MASTER here???  You initially think it might have been Hoffman's character, because he plays the guru with the following. But look at the Rorschach-like image of the movie DVD above. Who is Hoffman pointing to in those bilateral reflections?  Yes, ...this is another one of those \\"Which story would you prefer to believe?\\" movies (The Life of PI\\") where the viewer becomes a player in the drama of life itself and sees what he or she wants to see, and takes the life lessons that he or she is ready and willing to accept.  Now even in saying that, I will need to see the darn thing all over again to fully appreciate the nuances and skill of all those complicated, interconnected, character studies playing out over the course of a couple decades. But that doesn't mean that I want to see it because I truly enjoyed it. It means that it will drive me nuts to NOT see it again to pick up more clues and skillful insertions of images and psychologically-rich dialogue. And the past-life references that Hoffman's character is so focused on exploring--that is very pertinent to the story and the deeper meaning of it all. This movie has the depth of a deep-sea crevice--it's possibly bottomless. However, I wouldn't call it pleasant to watch. More so like knowing that you need to go to the dentist to eliminate a toothache sort of thing, and then actually making the call.
B00CO52NLI|4.0|I think this game is awesome but you have to buy multiple things on the app it's self.It is a wonderful game for you to be playing!!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book has the perfect mixture of action and adventure. I actually felt as if I were in the story.
0803731094|5.0|My three year old grand daughter is in love with this book. She has the video on her I pad and watches it constantly. It is always one of the three books that she chooses for her bed time stories. I also purchased the stuffed animals, mouse, and the Gruffalo. I had to purchase the Gruffalos child book and doll from the U.K. But it was worth seeing her face light up when she opened her gifts.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator on my desk and this free version does the trick, easy to use and the ads are not a distraction.
B00E9P959O|3.0|First Blush/Short Review:<br /><br />As some others have noted, some things are better with this mix and regrettably, some worse.  On the positive side, Geddy's bass tone is awesome in the remix -- sounds like more of his bridge pickup was mixed in, yielding the old \\"growler\\" bass tone, filled with a near-perfect balance of percussive, piano-string ringing and smooth, yet punchy, deep-end bottom, which he made famous years ago.  Also, Geddy's vocals seem to stand out a bit more clearly from rest of the instruments, which some may or may not like.  With the original mix, Geddy's voice seemed to be a part of the sonic wallpaper, blending in to a unified, but very compact and yes, often muddy, sound.<br /><br />On the less positive side, the guitar and cymbal sounds, while more defined and spread out in the remix, are quite harsh and grating, now.  I find it difficult to listen to for more than a couple songs at a time without succumbing to annoying ear strain.  Which brings me to the subject of my review.  My feeling is that this studio recording was not their best, from a technical recording perspective.  Seems like it was a bad soup of poor microphone choices/placement, mediocre recording engineering and awful Analog-->Digital conversion, none of which a great mix can ever fix, as we can witness here.  Consequently, while the wall of sound in the original recording has been exploded out into a more definable sound stage with the remix, the underlying recording is rearing its ugly head in a way that was, perhaps, better masked by the flatter soundstage with the original mix.<br /><br />Finally, in my opinion, the drum sounds simply suck in this remix -- very little depth and resonance; again, likely due to a poor recording of them from the get-go.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by the drum sounds in so many of their other great recordings, both before and after Vapor Trails.<br /><br />Having noted all of this, I enjoyed hearing a fresh expression of Vapor Trails and am not sorry I purchased this.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I've been playing this game for about three months now. I love it, I never get too bored playing it. I can set the level of difficulty I want to play with. The game is simple to learn, and strategy can grow as the game gets more difficult. It isn't perfect, I would like it if there was some better information, but I enjoy it nonetheless. And at a buck fifty, well, I've certainly got my money's worth out of it.
B00FGEO9NE|2.0|I've seen the first two episodes and if it doesn't improve, then who would want to watch it further, let alone own it?<br /><br />They better step up their game and improve their storytelling or it's going to lose a lot of viewers.
0385743564|5.0|I was really excited to read this one. I mean, we've got Brandon Sanderson, the master of magic systems. We've got superheroes, so I knew there would be a diversity of magical powers. And, knowing Sanderson, he would add the right balance of needed logic, limitations, and creativity.<br /><br />And this book did not disappoint.<br /><br />This has one of the best openings I've read since, well... Elantris. It gets you immersed into the world right away, and then throughout the book we get to learn more and more about what is really happening in this new world (which is actually just our world, but reformed. The entire thing takes place in Newcago, an Chicago). I really enjoyed Sanderson's world building and character development. The superhoroes are all unique, with a lot more variety than you'd expect. Most superhero stories seem to have heroes that are copies of stuff from Marvel and DC, but Sanderson made sure that you got a band of new superheroes. Only, the catch is, they are all supervillains. Even better!!<br /><br />Of all the Sanderson books I've read, this is the first one I thought, \\"This would make an awesome movie!\\" I loved the book and, after I had some time available, I could not put it down as I quickly read through it.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Typical Follett thriller.  Follett is one of the best.  Follett researches and puts a spin on fiction.  Always a pleasure to read
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Love all the new Dr Who. Very<br />highly recommend for family to watch together although monsters may scare really little ones.
B00FEN000S|3.0|This is a good movie in a tired genre. As over-the-top of any Michael Bay film, this one at least doesn't have any superfluous hand-held camera hero shots.  But it does still remind me of a Godzilla/Transformers cross-over.  What I did find to be unique and interesting was how the humans controlled the robots.  I wish it would have gone into that more, but of course, we have to have scene after scene of monster fighting combat.  I think this movie would have done better had it come out before any Transformer movie, but now it just feels like we've seen this all before.  Having said that, I will still say that it makes for an entertaining Saturday night.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Dredd won't change the way we look at movies.  It won't win any awards.  It won't be lauded in history of film textbooks.  But it's still a great little movie.  It has a clear vision of the story it wants to tell and how it wants to tell it.  It then sharply executes that vision.  Urban is great in the role being the character that he needs to be.  I haven't read the books at all so maybe I'm way off here but as a neo-law-officer who acts as judge, jury, and executioner his Dredd is exactly what I would expect.<br /><br />Watch it with an open mind and enjoy the ride.  You won't be disappointed.
B00EQF2EIG|3.0|If you are a fan of both Shakespeare and Joss Whedon, this is right up your alley.  As for me, I love Joss Whedon and the odd mix of modern day and the poetic form of Shakespeare language was a bit odd (I've never been a fan of these films).  But in the hands of Joss Whedon, still fun.  Filmed in 12 days at Joss Whedon's Santa Monica home, it does have the feel of a party weekend and the actors make it enjoyable.  Will I watch it again?  Probably not, but it did make for an entertaining Saturday night at home.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|Excellent Read.  Integrates Very Low Carb Ketogenic eating with the Gluten Free World.  Connects the dots and clearly showes why it is not an either or.  Although not directly criticizing mainstream Paleo which relies on high starch veggies and fruits, he explains why that form of Paleo is just not good for you.<br /><br />The only weakness - a lack of of focus on Protein.  He leaves that as almost an after thought.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It was easy to install and it works perfectly linked to my laptop.  I recommended it to my neighbor and she installed it easily and linked it to her smart phone. However, it only streams stuff from Netflix. Hope they add Amazon soon.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the series, was able to watch the first two seasons on Hulu and just &#34;had&#34; to see the third before the fourth season starts later this year.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use this app every day.<br />The information is useful and presented in large, clear numbers and images.<br />My only complaint is that using this on a Wi-Fi only tablet, I find the app is definitely in need of a very fast high performing signal (not always available).<br />The similar app on my 4G phone is sometimes faster.<br />Regardless, I always go to The Weather Channel for my info. It's easy to find where I am or where I'm going.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Great show fast paced, with likeable characters that you just can't stop watching. I am not a huge tv person and I can watch more than a few ep in one day.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this app, reminds me of when I had my own horse years ago.<br />Lot's of things to do. Graphics are great. Try it you won't be sorry.
B006TLZNDI|4.0|everything was awesome.<br />except billy crudup. wow he really phoned it in.<br />great movie otherwise. you should definitely rent it.
B00FKSJ3YG|5.0|I love the whole Marvels movies with the Iron Man trilogy, Thor and the Avengers which I have watched so many times it is crazy.  When I saw this on amazon I had to check it out.  I am a huge fan of Phil Coulson and I was so upset when he died in the Avengers movie.  I cannot wait to hear the real story of his death and resurrection.  After watching the first episode I had to go ahead and buy the second one.  I love that amazon has these on instant video because so many of my favorite shows are on at the same time.  I cannot wait for the next episode.  I am so glad that Joss Whedon did this show.  Please help to make it a keeper - so many new shows come out that I love and then get canceled.  It is very frustrating when you become invested in a character or characters of a series.  The characters in this series are great.  I love the dynamics between them all and just love Fitz & Simmons and all of their fabulous gadgets.  You could see after the second episode how they are coming together as a team.  It takes time for a team to come together - just like in the Avengers - there was animosity and distrust but they ended up finding that common goal - Coulson's death.  I can't wait to see where this series goes from here.  Go Team Go!!!!!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I bought this game for my 7 year old as a reward.  I thought it would be too hard for him because the graphics looked to advanced, but I had promised he could pick the game.  He said he loves it.
B00F5BON8O|5.0|I've been a fan of Sarah Jarosz for a number of years and three albums now, so that bias not withstanding this album is excellent.  Each track contains something unique.  It's a  more mature style and sound than her previous efforts.  The songwriting is top notch and she's clearly pushing the boundaries of traditional &#34;genre's&#34; (if that means anything these days).  Her instrumental prowess (and that of her bandmates and guests) will find fans throughout bluegrass, blues, rock, and singer-songwriter etc. and her vocal excellence is showcased spectacularly.<br /><br />Its been on heavy rotation for me for the last few weeks, and that's about as much of an endorsement as I can give.
B007P3TMW2|3.0|The story is odd..the topic difficult to live thru for any age group but the star power makes it a journey. Worth seeing.
B00CEQ1JOO|2.0|My daughter was so excited to add this doll to her collection, but one of the legs broke the first day she played with it. She now has a cast on her leg made of duct tape.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this book as a light read and to see if it was like the movie. The movie follows it rather well, I think. Personally, it's too much of a young adult book for my tastes. Not as much depth in the characters, the scene, or the background. The author could have spent much more time and detail on the dystopian society, but then it would not have been geared as much to young adults. All in all it's a quick, easy read for adults and a great book for young adults. Very much recommended.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I loved this app so much!  It matches up perfectly with the Youtube video and the minigames are easy but get harder as the game goes on.  I have a very hard time trying to stop playing it and would/have recommended it to all of my friends.  The characters are so cute!
0307279189|5.0|After reading this book, I have changed my approach to running and to life.<br />It compelled me to run out the door and experience the thrill it so vividly described.<br />The story has it all: science and belief, life and death, humour and tears.<br />Above all, it has passion and ground-breaking truths.<br />Superb!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|not sure how to rate this ? I bought this for a friends daughter for her birthday. Considering the small size im a bit unsure if she will enjoy it. I know for sure im not pleased with the size perhaps 'micro world' should be part of the title or description if its not in there. also the price for this?! seriously?! i could have bought triple the legos in a store for the same amount i spent on this thing. but of course this is what i get for shopping online so jokes on me and my wallet.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This futuristic set movie does a great job of presenting technology and human interaction that is credible for the future dates in which it is set.  The story and plot are very well thought out and complex enough to keep your full attention and interest.  The acting was good.  I was thoroughly absorbed and entertained.  The ending was good and appropriate to the movie.
B0052Z0MJW|5.0|Excellent book full of suspense<br />Great work Dan Brown keep writing this type of novel and I will keep buying
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  The story and the acting were excellent.  The characters were interesting.  I can recommend it to anyone without reservation.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a great way to kill boredom...I have to admit, though I am an adult, that I found this quite fun.
B0053ZOQMK|3.0|The movie is a hoot in spots and fun entertainment.  Great for viewing on an airplane flight.  I have to admit that it did run a bit longer than it should have, it seemed the writers of the story could not find a way to end it.  But all in all it was funny and entertaining.
B007HNXIF2|5.0|Excellent and inspiring recipes, all of them exactly like you would expect from Nigella.<br />If you like baking this is the book to buy!<br />I think the pictures should appear bigger, taking advantage of the display's quality. Instead they appear very small, which is a shame, especially when it comes to food pictures.
B000I9YX06|3.0|I purchased the movie as a download for a domestic flight of a few hours duration.  I found the movie held my interest and I enjoyed watching it on the flight.  Nice light science fiction escapism.
B0055CS4UG|5.0|If you like Nigella I advise on buying this book, which I believe to be the best one she's ever published.<br />I think the pictures should appear bigger, taking advantage of the display's quality.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|Bought this to read on a flight back home to KS from DC, it was very compelling and I finished by he time I landed on my return flight. Good read, already bought the second one
B002RI9SC4|4.0|A nice ending to the story, worth reading if you are a fan of the Twilight Saga.<br />I like the little changes and evolutions in the story and characters, although I'm not sure one would like to read this book without knowing the story of the other 3 books!
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is challenging and fun.  I find it much more challenging than regular solitare.  Easy to follow and doesn't get old!

B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Really long download, but reviews move me to believe that it is worth it. You could always check Youtube to decide for yourself, though.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Replaceable &#34;stones&#34; are a nice feature, feels a little small in my hand. Overall I like the product. Thank you
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I find this game unremarkable. I also think they should. Give more free items. You have to pay for everything.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Very easy to use and understand.  The slow down function when listening is very helpful. I like it better than Rosetta stone!

B005544TRQ|5.0|Good story with good acting that makes much more interesting to watch!<br />I like how characters relate to each other and the chemistry emanates.<br />Entertaining and interesting enough to keep watching in to wee hours.<br />Recommend with warning; can't go to sleep..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I give this book a five star rating because it grabbed me into the story and kept me there!!!! I admit, I was a little apprehensive to purchase this book but am so glad I did. Can't wait to move onto the second book in this trilogy. This is my first book by Hugh Howey, but intend on reading more. Way to go!!!! Awesome Read for anyone who loves a good book.
B005PK57IK|5.0|great show, excellent writing & acting, love the character development, hope the new seasons are as good as the old ones

B003V1WTMM|3.0|It kept your interest but it could have been shorter.  I wouldn't read her again.  I'm not sure what the climax was.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Interesting movie that is somewhat enjoyable for both adults and kids. Gets a little better each time you watch it

B00563M11M|5.0|I have read several books in the Discworld series, and I'm happy to say that Terry Pratchett never disappoints me. Snuff is yet another witty and fun fantasy story, which puts Sam Vimes in the countryside, playing loyal husband, doting father, and unintentionally performing his job as a copper all at once. I love books that make me smile and laugh, and I like that Terry Pratchett can fold in some ideas about righting wrongs and stamping out injustice at the same time.<br /><br />Worth it.
B00275EGX8|2.0|Hurt Locker is an amazing film. The feel / look of Iraq is amazing and looks right. And the message it sends about the effects war / combat has on some people's psyche is harrowing, but the film has major issues.<br /><br />First up, procedure wise the guys in this film come of as cowboys, winging it with no discipline. The portrayal of the main character being a renegade or cowboy (though all three main characters have issues) working to Hollywood cliche's is terrible. Secondly, the pacing isn't bad but the shifts in tone that affect the pacing are disruptive. The tone changes abruptly and similarly the speed at which events happen, for example: There is a scene where the guys get stuck in the desert sniping insurgents, waiting in cover for sunset. This is slow and painful and for the viewer this is okay. This is the \\"gritty realism\\" so many speak about in the context of this film, but then it moves on to drinking and the resulitng drunken fighting session between the characters, with no lead in or transition (well they do get back to base) but it grates.<br /><br />Then there is the event with a kid getting killed (or not) and the film attempts to make a statement about sentimentality and sensitivity (James) vs kindness and compassion (the CO / psychologist [this is a bit bizarre]), in both instances in the face of achieving the job. Predictably the movie now goes for the cliche'd \\"futility of war\\" and \\"no good deed ever goes unpunished\\", and then messes the later up ... sort of.<br /><br />There are no concrete statements in this film, everything is just a random thing until it finally clears things up at then end finally justifying the quote from the start (\\"war is a drug\\") and giving context to some of the statements that are unsubstantiated in the film. And again it falls flat.<br /><br />There is a lot to like about this film, and in many ways it's heart is in the right place, but much like James's actions, they just don't achieve the desired goal. Gritty realism is confined to a few events and the look of the movie and some subtle moments of clarity, but by and large it is just a lick of paint that can't hide the misdirected movie made to a spec of Hollywood Gritty Realism (TM). And from there little can save it. Yes the direction is good, the camera work is mostly okay (again, to achieve gritty realism certain things are required, and they look terrible but fitting, let's just say it's to spec). Acting is ... shallow. It's not that the actors are doing a bad job, rather that the characters are so reduced to a single attribute (hardass, renegade and rookie), there is no acting being done here. They are just ... caricatures (and I'm not sure that can be praised).<br /><br />Maybe off topic, but style wise there is a lot of similarity to old cowboy movies, and I'm not certain it was the right look go with. This is likely a budget issue (only 15 million ... only ... how sad is it that 15 million qualifies as only ..., but given the hardware involved that probably explains a lot of the choices that drag the film down ... like a total of three Humvee's in the entire movie).<br /><br />So yeah, watching the film it does move you, but at the end you are filled with a big question: what's the point? Some guys are soldiers for the adrenalin rush. Not sure that needed a 2 hour movie with confused sub-messages.lism is confined to a few events and the look of the movie and some subtle moments of clarity, but by and large it is just a lick of paint that can't hide the misdirected movie made to a spec of Hollywood Gritty Realism (TM).

B0089LOG02|5.0|When a book prompts me to do my own research into certain topics, I consider it a worthy book. I had never heard of the orphan trains and never really gave it a thought about what happens to the orphans early in our country's history.<br /><br />The Orphan Train is well-written and simply told. Within the first few pages, the characters come to life. I won't get into what it is about because anyone can read the synopsis. The ending is uplifting and sweet but I finished with tears in my eyes without truly understanding why at first. I think it is those \\"might have beens\\" and \\"what-ifs\\" ... what would have happened if this happened instead of that ... it is truly remarkable how a life can change so drastically by one event or happenstance. The domino effect of having one bad thing after another happen only to bring the story to a sweet ending ... was it all worth it to the characters? I think that more than anything is something we have to figure out on our own.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|In Typical Dan Brown fashion, fact and fiction are masterfully intertwined into a tale that is plausible enough to keep you wondering. Just when you think you have things figured out, the story takes another turn and throws you off track. I also like that Dan Brown 's vivid imagery always has me seeing what is happening in my minds eye...as though I am seeing a movie at the same time I am reading. If there is any downside at all, it is that is books are such good reads, I finish them quickly.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I had a hard tide getting into this book with more then one story line going on but yet it kept pulling me into wanting to find out the next thing.  It was worth reading it all the through and learning the outcome.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Plot is difficult to follow and the characters roles need to be more defined. It is difficult to compare, because of the rich and well developed downton abby
B0089EHWQE|4.0|ENJOYED BOOK, LOT MORE THAN I EXPECTED TO. COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN FOR LONG.GOOD author Jojo Moyes. THIRD Book I Read by this author.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHER READERS.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|great movie, great story, great visual, great audio.  this is the most clear 3d movie ive ever seen. definitely worth it
B00FFVML74|5.0|The last episode didn't record on TV, so I had to buy this. It's a very good show. I cried at the end. My heart breaks for the family and all involved.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This movie is a must see for zombie fans. Not over played, really well done and thrilling. I recommend it.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|If you have seen the video then the game explains a lot. You try to save the people in many different ways before they die. Examples, flick the bees off his face, blow to keep an airplane in the sky, tap as fast as you can to reach someone, etc. I personally like this game because I like the video.
0143121316|5.0|Great book. It met my expectations. I strongly recommend it for someone who whants to understand Chinese politics. Best regards
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a good book.  I did have a little trouble keeping up with each group of characters.<br />I had a nice twist.
B006P8KKYW|5.0|I like this album.  It's certainly not a typical soundtrack.  While it's not as abstract as Ghosts I-IV, it's more like that than a polished album.  It is structured enough that it keeps me working but not so much to be distracting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard great things about this show but was always hesitant to watch it.  What an unexpected surprise! Superb production values all around-  Great direction, great cinematography, great writing, excellent performers by all cast members.  Love the costumes.  Simply stunning.  How do they fit all of that in an hour and a few shows each season?
B004GJYRKA|5.0|Watching Bruce on film is, for me, something bizarre. He commands my attention, I can't take my eyes away. He has the potential to do anything at any fraction of a second. This movie is his American crossover, his biggest film (not my favorite), but a masterpiece. I'm not a movie guy, I'm actually a music guy. But watching Bruce in action is philosophy in motion, truly a movie that will haunt me with its greatness my whole life over. I am a true Bruce Lee devotee. He wasn't an actor, he was a fantastic human being. A human who made the impression of a dragon's soul inside a human's body. His life, philosophy, and pursuit of his potential are touching. He has improved the quality of my life, and his acting is where quality itself resides.
B0040I09RM|5.0|great series i recommend it to anyone who likes action and adventure very exciting , you have to watch more&more
1451626096|5.0|I've read all of Gregory's books about the period, and enjoyed them all. I highly recommend them.  The new Starz series &#34;The White Queen&#34;  combines three books. It's interesting to see the characters portrayed by actors. Most of them are like I pictured them.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Best show ever!  We made watching an episode every Sunday night a family event.  Could not believe my 15 and 24 year old sons were just as captivated as my husband and I were.  Can't wait for season 4!!!!
0380715430|4.0|Love this book. Very funny and educational at the same time, like his other books.  Good chapter on swearing :)
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was really excited to read this.  I was sufficiently disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get to a good part and when it did I actually said out loud...'finally!' It was then that I looked to see how much I had left to go and I was at 50%.  Seriously, I had read half the book before it started to get good. I was still hopeful though, it was on the best seller list right?  Anyway it was pretty much only kind of good and then I kept waiting for something bigger to happen, some closure, maybe some excitement.  Nope.  Just a crappy ending that left me frustrated that I wasted my time and my money.  Best seller list...whatever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I play it nonstop all the time and I even have  a really big high score ( from my brother).

B008EKMGUU|5.0|This production of Rinaldo makes me wonder if Robert Carsen was bullied as a child and is reliving his revenge fantasies. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. I found it all very entertaining and for those of us who actually went to school in England it also provides some recognizable images (which may inspire nostalgia or horror depending on one's personal experience). For me, transposing the story to an English boarding school was an ingenious idea. For a modern audience (and probably for the original audiences too) the stories of Baroque opera are as irrelevant as they are historically inaccurate. They exist only as a framework to hang the stories of human interactions (usually love complications of one sort or another) in order to explore human emotions (and, of course, as a showcase for vocal display). Most of the plots are ridiculous if taken literally so I don't see any harm in reinterpreting them so long as the underlying and intended emotions still arise convincingly from the altered scenario. This new production succeeds in doing that. What schoolboy hasn't indulged in fantasies, a la 'Billy Liar,' about being a great warrior and rescuing a fair maiden in distress? Particularly if he is subjected to bullying and in need of a little escapism and some means, if only imaginary, of bettering his persecutors? By wrapping the old crusader story in this modern super-scenario, Carsen has made it more believable and added an extra dimension of pathos. Of course, none of this is strictly necessary. Telling the story straight and in a traditional setting would be just fine and I would have greatly enjoyed it, I'm sure. But Carsen has given us a new way to relate to this story and that is not a trivial thing. Its moments of great humor are not out of place and do not short change the deeper emotions. The end of the opera, when Rinaldo is stripped of his armor and finds himself back in his old school and his old predicament (presumably unchanged by his fantasy) adds ironic poignancy to the traditional, victorious ending.<br /><br />The singing and acting are all first rate. Sonia Prina is believable as a schoolboy and her rich contralto is very satisfying in the role. Brenda Rae as a \\"dominatrix\\" Armida is breathtaking and sounds  as authoritative as she looks. She is also able to effectively demonstrate vulnerability when needed. Luca Pisaroni is brilliant as Argante. He's one of the finest operatic baritones today and has a great instinct for his roles and incredible stage presence. His acting steals the show in whatever scene he is in. Anett Fritsch has a wonderful, luminous voice though she is a little nondescript in the role of Almirena. She is, however, sufficiently waifish and vulnerable to credibly portray an adolescent schoolgirl. Tim Mead has a particularly marvelous countertenor voice and his Eustazio is very enjoyable to hear. Handel's music for this opera is a thing of wonder. One hit after another from beginning to end. There's not a single aria that doesn't grab one's attention, especially when played by one of the finest Baroque orchestras in the world along with singers of the caliber we have here. All round this is a great and highly entertaining production of Handel's first London opera which explores all the meaning and emotion inherent in the opera within a context that gives it an added relevance. Don't let the naysayers turn you off to this one. It has a lot of things in its favor and the purists only hurt themselves by refusing to accept such innovations.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey is his usual, witty, self in DeMilles's \\"The Panther.\\"  Twists and turns only begin to describe John and Kate's trip to Yemen.  This on was hard to put down...per usual when seeing the world through John Corey's eyes.

B003VANOFY|4.0|Although I had read unfavorable reviews by other buyers of this product, I went ahead and purchased this headset as it had the features that aI was looking for.<br />Several reviews pointed to a loss of signal that caused the headset to turn off momentarily. So after I purchased this item, this is one of the problems I looked for. The problem did arise, but it was cured by moving the sender away from interference. When I did so, the problem went away and has not returned.<br />This headset is compatible with everything that I have tasked it to do since my purchase some time ago and I haven't had any problems, the sound quality is fantastic, and the range of the headset is all that it was specced to do.<br />I would recommend this item and would purchase another if the need arose.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Beautiful people, lavish sets, gorgeous production, every element is present for an enjoyable story ...<br /><br />The music?  Seriously?  It was like being rudely awakened, uncomfortable, incongruent.  Didn't work<br />for me somehow.  Earlier in the week I revisited the version with Redford as Gatsby.  Redford IS Gatsby.

It sounds like a college of sounds I love.  I have no idea whether it will age into a classic or not because it's way too much fun to listen too.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Loved the way they made this movie. The mind drifting was a great concept and the movie seem<br />like it could be a real thing. The size and scale of the sets and machines were totally awesome!<br />I loved the Transformer movies, and this was close to the same but with  more mature actors. Its a<br />new twist to scifi movies.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good science fiction. Warning how far government programs can go (reminiscent of the Jason Bourne movies (which were nothing like Robert Ludlum's books)). Orson Scott Card separates simulated training with actual war very well, though the characters are too young for the violence. Looking forward to the movie (release Nov '13).

It clearly explains the benefits of a wheat free lifestyle and suggested menus and recipes to get started.  After only 6 weeks on the program the results are amazing; weight loss, joint pain eliminated and energy level enhanced.  I was a skeptic but now I am a believer!

B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My granddaughter is four and loves all things having to do with a Princess. She has been to DisneyWorld and has met Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. She sometimes is bothered by 'mean characters', but she understands what is reality.<br /><br />In 'Sofia The Princess' Sofia has the voice of Ariel Winter. She is a commoner, living in the Village with her mother. Her mother is beautiful and makes boots. Sofia's mother, Miranda, whose voice is Sara Raminez, marries King Roland II, whose voice is Travis Willingham. Sofia and her mother leave their small Village and move to the Royal Castle where Roland and his children, James, whose voice is Zach Callison and Amber whose voice is Darcy Rose Byrnes. Sofia becomes immersed in the royal life, the Princess lessons, curtsey lessons and all the table lessons at Royal Prep Academy under the guidance of the Three Fairies. These three fairies have shown up in other Disney films and my granddaughter recognized them. Amber, the new stepsister is jealous that everyone who meets Sofia loves her.<br /><br />When Roland announces that he's hosting a dance in Sofia's honor, Sofia worries that she can't dance. Tricks are played upon her, and her feelings are hurt. The magic sorcerer is indeed a meanie and we worry for Sofia. This film offers a lot of action and fun, but also many lessons are learned. For young children this is a wonderful way for them to learn.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant, the songs are rich and delightful, the characters are full and believable. The storyline is perfect for children from 3-90. I enjoyed this film as much as my granddaughter.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-07-13

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Stimulating, agonizing, insightful.  Saw the movie and enjoyed that also,  even our 6 year old twins were held transfixed to the screen.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Judge Dredd as a comic anti-hero should translate better to the movies than the first two attempts.  At least in the first version of the movie, Stalone took his helmet off and was semi-human.  In this version Karl Urban, who is actually very good in these types of movies (loved him in The Chronicles of Riddick) never takes his helmet off, and just walks around as a semi-automaton, shooting stuff up.<br /><br />Judge Dredd reflects a future where crime is so pervasive that the justice system has combined the primary law functions into a single human - if you can call them that.  The woman who plays his mentee/cadet starts out human - too human, and eventually becomes another uncaring walking justice system dispensing justice (I mean death).<br /><br />These movies would be more appealing if they dealt more with the inner conflict a judge encounters, being also the jury and executioner.  This movie just has them not caring at all.<br /><br />Being a sci-fi and horror flick aficionado I certainly can understand the need for violence in some cases for theatric emphasis.  But this movie is the definition of mostly pointless and gratuitous violence that really does not attach well to the story.  If you are going to that, add humor like the Arnold movies.  This movie has ZERO laughs.  None.<br /><br />Gave it three stars just barely . . . / mike

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It worked great to clean up my Kindle Fire. I have had my KIndle for over 3 years and never did a clean on it so this was just the trick. Easy to use and did the job.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Love the whole series and character-reader relationships, but the chapters (particularly in this book) tend to drag on in unnecessary detail to hit you with a climactic last few pages.<br /><br />But who am I kidding? I'll still buy the next of the series as soon as it's out!
B001M5UDGS|2.0|I'm a tech geek and I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spin-offs.  I also like The Guild.  Unfortunately, I found this to be mostly just awkward.  It had its funny moments, but it felt more like yet another Saturday Night Live skit that started funny, then just went on way too long.  If you like SNL from the 90's, then you'll probably like this (that's the only decade I tried to watch SNL, and hated it, and I haven't seen evidence that it got any better).
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Accidentally hooked on it after watching first episode and wanting to see how a few things turned out.  Decent plots that keep you coming back for more.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I have an original HERO and this works perfectly fine as a viewfinder.  As stated on the gopro web site and several reviews here, the touch screen is NOT functional on the HERO, and that's fine.  The image is distorted, I guess it is showing the raw unprocessed view from the sensor, but that's fine too.  I just want to see what the camera sees, I'm not going to be watching Netflix HD on it.<br /><br />They really should include this with the camera.  With the HERO3 you can use wifi, but HERO has nothing.  You have to hope you set it up correctly.  This LCD is a must have for the HERO.  I guess getting the wifi pack might work too, but that seems like more of a hassle.<br /><br />Once you've set up the shot and locked down the mount, you can easily remove the LCD if you're worried about draining the battery.  I presume turning off the screen should also not drain the battery, but I'm not sure, didn't test that yet.
B000ICXQU6|5.0|Excellent film. You get it all. Comedy. Love. Drama and suspense. Being based on a true story adds to it also!
6305428042|5.0|Got the movie quick and it was new as promised. I love Hocus Pocus and glad I was able to get it for a great price!
B0000CDL93|4.0|Oliver Stone did a masterful job of explaining the who and why behind JFK's assassination. He has since been sucked back into the illusion as a means of self preservation I am sure, but his yeoman effort in producing the movie is much appreciated.<br /><br />Reviewers who still just see this movie as either good \\"entertainment\\" or conspiratorial garbage are either stupid or unknowingly suffering from cognitive dissonance. Stupidity I can understand given the educational (indoctrination) system in the country's schools and colleges.<br /><br />For further understanding as to why JFK had to be killed, read everything Colonel Fletcher Prouty (Mr X) wrote such as the Secret Team. You can start by listening to interviews he has given to credible investigative journalists.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|At last!!! Screen writers and directors and actors who can bring beloved Marvel characters to life without the schtick have been brought together with these releases.<br />Grab your pop corn  and Jujubes and be prepared to finally be entertained.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|Heartwarming and funny with Cinderella-like fairy tale ending... I've watched it several times and so has my youngest daughter!  Really cute!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This movie rarely has a moment in which it sits still long.  I enjoyed the piece overall as well as the nature of the infected which takes aggressiveness to a fast paced form.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Good now and will get better when more apps interface with it.<br />For desktop it was not compatable with vista.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|I have to say, I really enjoyed this movie.  Just left a great feeling at the end as boy and father come together to create their long missing relationship as well as overcome the odds of the world.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Love this series! Love the books, I definitely recommend both. Cant wait to watch season two and three :). Watch it!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I have long held that &#34;Too many people take too many drugs&#34; and have recently been investigating the impact of foods on our health. &#34;Wheat Belly&#34; lit the fire and &#34;Grain Brain&#34; added fuel to the idea that what we believe is food may actually be toxic drugs. This adds to my original declaration about too many drugs.<br /><br />The evidence is becoming overwhelming, yet the vast majority of people ignore it - and continue to suffer.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|He never takes off the helmet, which was perfect. It was visually well edited, and much better than the Stallone version. Watch it.
B0082XJGRK|5.0|I have an advanced degree in philosophy and wanted a portable copy of the various texts that have shaped philosophical thinking over the millennia. This Kindle version meets my needs. There is no way I could honestly evaluate the book as it is as it is - unless someone altered this version to not represent what the sage originally offered.
B00CHIY5OK|5.0|This is a good album, somethings a bit different, but after getting use to it I play it when I need that quality boost.
B001HN6922|5.0|My grandson is a huge fan of both Cars I and II. This was a very good movie and he adores it. Fast delivery. Would buy from again. AAAA++++
B00CATONCA|5.0|every season is worth buying, its the best show on tv, thanks to amc for giving it to us, season 4 starts sunday.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I have enjoyed Angry Birds since it first came out, and have all the variations.  This one is even better for two reasons -- it combines the best of other games (AB Star Wars and AB Space), and it gives you the opportunity to play &#34;the pork side&#34;.  This is actually a lot of fun to play from the other side of the Force.  Looking forward to even more games and options in the future!
B0035OC7PO|3.0|Interesting and funny but not up to date...  The information  about places is at least twenty years old.  But it is worthwile
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is a tribute to the literary skills of Christina Baker Kline and the touching survivability of children that she unfolds in ways that make you hurt for their history.  It is also a reminder to us all of the importance of family to children.  (And it's brilliant, as the Irish would say, how Ireland, Minnesota, and North Dakota came together to impact this wonderful writer and story.)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|YouTube videos and Netflix stream smoothly, sound is awesome. It just needs more supported content providers. For $35 you can't go wrong, though.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|limited alarms sounds and low volume<br />needs better options<br />you would have to be sleeping with your head on top of it to hear to wake you up
0345472322|5.0|A must read for anyone in any situation in life.  Carol Dweck is dead on used real word examples to explain her theories.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I read almost exclusively on my droid RAZR now. Always fast to open, never glitches and I love the new update for &#34;time remaining in chapter&#34;!!
B001V7UXG2|4.0|Lets get this out in front. These stories, as written by Wodehouse, and as realized by these actors, is caricature. If you want a somewhat more realistic picture of English upper classes before WW II, see Brideshead Revisited (the 10 hour series, not the movie).<br /><br />As caricature, even if stretched over four different plots, can become just a bit tedious. That is why I deduct one star. You do not get the kind of freshness we see in the best films from The Marx Brothers, where they are intent on breaking conventions, rather than suffering from them.<br /><br />Having gotten that out of the way, there is no question that Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are masters of parody. They push Wodehouse's characterizations to the hilt. Our only disappointment is that the sword is rather short. Of the two lead actors, Hugh Laurie gets by far the more flexible role. There are far more ways to be stupid than there are to be smart, and Jeeves is very smart, far brighter than his master, to whom he is a valet. Both actors get some chances to do cross gender roles, which were so common in their \\"A Bit of Fry and Wooster.\\" But once you see Jeeves' demeanor in one episode, you basically have him down pat. If you delight in a freer interaction between these two comedy geniuses, check out the complete set of \\"A Bit of Fry and Laurie\\", where, oddly, they look older than their roles in the later \\"Jeeves and Wooster.\\"<br /><br />I have never read any of Wodehouse's Jeeves novels, so I am not sure how thoroughly they have captured his humor. My last thought of any substance is that I find drama, especially detective stories far more re-watchable than comedy (except perhaps for the Marx Brothers), maybe because plots have more substance and there is usually some danger involved. Shakespeare knew all about that. All his best comedies had an element of threat or danger to one or more characters. There is none of that here. All is sweetness and light except for some artificial crises, which mean very little in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />A good practice when you have bought this set is to watch one disk, then let the set lay fallow for a few weeks before you go on to the second disk. There is very little carry over from one to the other. It seems as if the three or four episodes on each disk were based on one of Wodehouse's novels, since the setting and characters run through all the episodes on the disk.mean very little in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />A good practice when you have bought this set is to watch one disk, then let the set lay fallow for a few weeks before you go on to the second disk.

B009JZSC9S|5.0|I enjoyed watching glimpses of me in the background, and Diane playing Judy the  court stenagrapher, who really deserves some lines... People talk to Judy, her character, but she has to respond mutely...
B0053O89IS|5.0|As usual, with so many good reviews, it is hard to find something new to say. I think the main virtue of this shortened season (abbreviated to accommodate Emily Deschanel's real pregnancy)is that it was just the right mix of the old and the new. The old is all the original cast, but with a healthy salting of our favorite recurring characters, Caroline Julian, Max Keenan, Billy Gibbons, Hank Booth (Ralph Waite) and Colin Fisher (Joel David Moore). To this is added Brennan's pregnancy, a brand new relation between Brennan and Booth, and a new, very dangerous, serial killer. I dare not say more about that character, for fear of giving away some important spoilers. I will say that the new antagonist leads to what may be one of the series' most dramatic season cliffhanger, in a show which has had its share of better than average cliff hanger season enders.<br /><br />I case you did not notice, this season's set has only 13 episodes, instead of the usual 23 - 26. That was due to the hiatus added to allow for Deschanel's pregnancy. What is puzzling is that they did not add in episodes from \\"The Finder\\", a spin-off created by Hart Hanson which, as far as I can tell, only created 13 episodes. That would have created an very nice 26 episode package.<br /><br />The jaw-dropping final episode appears to promise that Season 8 will remain fresh, now that the event which seemed inevitable from early in the first season has finally happened, that is, Brennan and Booth become romantically linked in a substantial way, with the risk that that will dull the interchange between them, which \\"drives\\" the show (that turn of phrase was intentional, since most of their best conversations happen while they are driving, a tradition which dates back to season 1, episode 1, when they were not nearly as chummy as they are now.)
B00EIR5N9O|5.0|Beautiful book. Love Mrs. Ramsey, Love the flawed Mr. Ramsey. Love everything about this book, except that it ended. If you love fine literature, read this.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love this show!!! A great mix of drama, comedy and law. It is great for any one that loves a good mix of Law and family drama with a bit of political controversy
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love it does everything you want from downloading videos. Works flawlessly for me and I have no complains. Try it and see it for yourself!!!
B008JFUN6E|5.0|I made the mistake of seeing a crappy version of this film.  It was great.  I am so getting this on blu ray.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This works perfectly on the fire. It is a must hAve. It has never failed me and allows you to never over charge.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I though this was going to be a fun movie about mechs blowing up aliens and that's it.  It was more than that.  It had a great plot and great side plots with great directing, acting, sound and visuals.  I don't want to spoil anything actually but I will say that this film is worth the money to get it on blu ray, new.
0449000729|1.0|Rutherford has Sarums' characters growing corn, and worshipping a corn fertility goddess, in England a few thousand years before Europeans ever knew of its existence.<br /><br />I know it's fiction, but come on.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I remember when SOA first premiered several years ago. My first reaction was, &#34;A biker show.&#34; After the first episode I was hooked. If you like your drama on the edgier side, look no further!
B00DHHWYAW|1.0|In the disc's extras, director Baz Luhrmann goes on and on about how much effort went into making everything as authentic as possible, from the set design, hair styles, costumes, the cars, even the cars' sounds. I kept asking myself, why? He sure didn't care that the music and the dancing was as inauthentic as it could be, having absolutely nothing to do with the music of the 20s or the way people danced in the 20s. Why not have a 60&#34; HDTV hanging on the wall playing music videos?<br /><br />Why was it so important to Mr. Luhrmann for the sets and costumes to be authentic to the early 20th Century, when the soundtrack and choreography were doing everything possible to take the viewer out of that era, slapping the 21st Century into one's face at every turn?<br /><br />I felt like I was watching 'Moulin Rouge II'. Don't get me wrong, I loved 'Moulin Rouge'. The modern music worked in that film because it was a musical. A musical, by the sheer fact that people break out in song, is fantasy. But this film is not a musical, making the soundtrack (obviously heard by the characters in the party scenes), and the dancing especially jarring.<br /><br />When you're dealing with a straight period drama, one based on a classic no less, I want to get lost in the PERIOD. This is impossible when the authenticity is ripped away by modern hip hop and dance music, with the early 20th Century characters doing some lame, stylized, 21st Century Charleston! Not only is it awkward and ugly, but it ruins any emotion that the time period evokes in the viewer.<br /><br />Please, don't let Mr. Luhrmann set his sights on a remake of 'Gone With the Wind'. God only knows what kind of music Rhett and Scarlett would be dancing to!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app and love this web site.  I never tire of going there - always something new and interesting.  App works great on my Kindle.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Great movie - love it.  Love the blu-ray as well.  Not more to say - great movie - looks great in blu-ray.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|VERY very very helpful.  This is one handy app and I am glad to have it on my Kindle. Well worth it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This one was a great one by Mr. Sparks! I felt myself clinging to every sentence, wanting to turn every page! This one excited  me and infuriated me all at the same time. There's parts where it seems like a beautiful love story, but then reality strikes--reminding you that while true love exist, reality very much does too.  A must read!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|really enjoyed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />excellent book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />it is rediculus to have to give more of a review so here is the five words reguired

B000083E79|4.0|Had songs that I was unfamiliar with and i had hoped it would have had more of her older hits
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King remains one of my favorite authors and he continues to clinch the top seat with this riveting story. I could not put this book down from the moment I read the first chapter. Very original and refreshing story line.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This is an amusing yet complicated Mystery and Romance.  I found it humorous and entertaining.  The mystery and clues kept my interest as well. I do recommend.  Still. you must allow poetic licenae for much of  the heroines behaviour was too incredible to be believable ...{SPOILER ALERT}... going from a timid and fearful.  almost joyless behavior and lifestyle to completely changing her attitude around in less then seven days.  Actually confronting her enemies.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|That a magical mystery tour and read this book, than the next and hold your breathe for the next!  Of course you will hate the wait.
B00FJTYDKK|2.0|Maybe because I couldn't get past Nicholas Cage's voice as Grug, but I wasn't thrilled with this movie. It was an easy watch, but pretty bland. There wasn't much humor or excitement.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|This is Johnny at his best.  I have listened to Johnny and his brother Edgar for 40 years, and let me tell you, this guy is still cooking.  If you like old Johnny Winter material, you will love this new album.  Would recommend to any Johnny Winter fan, or anyone who likes good old Texas blues and boogie.

0199535523|5.0|Is there any better &#34;read&#34; than a Jane Austen novel?  The book speaks for itself and doesn't need a review from me.  The order was fulfilled promptly, giving me the pleasure of digging into the novel within days of my order.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|One of the few movies that is as good as the book. It is my favorite book and the characters are exactly like I pictured them. It was great.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie follows the style of the original Star Trek series, where the ship always has problems and the characters are always taking a chance and yet things just somehow workout. The graphics is also very good and shows many features that one would expect for a futurist science fiction movie.
B00C9PQ7I8|4.0|This is a great cd.  The shipping was prompt.  The only complaint is that the case was busted for lack of a correct mail bag.
B00CN8U60Q|5.0|Great CD, the last song &#34;Carry on Jon&#34; is really good almost like fine wine for the ears and shows Richie Blackmore's guitar skills. I wish more of the songs on the CD included more guitar riffs inline with this one song.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This is one of those rare finds--a book that actually changes your life! Learning that Resistance is a force of nature, and not a personal failing, enabled me to move forward in my life like nothing I've ever experienced before. Read it and weep for joy! Thank you Steven Pressfield!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great book for the aspiring mind. However maybe a little more in child hood and on later experiments. He was a true genius
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Best  CD to date.  Loved the music and David Foster did a great job.  Together they are great. hope they do more.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was so different from anything else I've ever read.  It was mesmerizing and intriguing.  Not my typical style for reading choices, but my book club chose it and I'm glad they did!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Will unlock the full version.<br /> graphics are tremendous!<br />THE STORY IS FUN.<br /><br />Back to more fun, need more bricks,<br />Time is wasting
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Had to read this book for a psychology class, and I thought it was going to be awful. I hate self-help books. However, this book is really eye-opening and easily understandable. It will certainly open your eyes. For anyone with relationship problems, I tell them to read this book. You can really apply everything in this book to your life!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|A great book turned into a play and now into a movie/musical, great actors and actresses, perfect music and just a wonderful film in general. My boyfriend and i adore this and watch it often, forewarning, this is not a film for the weak hearted.
0547391005|5.0|One of my favorite books from my childhood...and now I have it all over again!  And the software wants 5 more words...I should be a few over by now!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This is an amazing show that the network cancelled way too soon. It is possible that the people watching did not know how to understand it.
B009X01ELC|5.0|Excellent purchase and really a great quality item.  I am happy with the purchase of this item and would recommend it!
159463176X|5.0|Great book!  Beautifully written, what an imagination Khaled Hosseini has.  I'd read anything he wrote.  This author certainly has a niche on human emotion!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|It used to be fun, now it only works when it wants to.. ALL OF THE ANGRY BIRO games stop functioning at the same time for days at a time.  You need to fix it.
B00631VJIC|4.0|I like the CD, play it daily in my truck, and will most likely buy other CD's for Son's of  Anarchy music.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|Very typical Stephen King ending.....Will need to think about it for a while to determine how I truly feel about it
B00CE27NE8|4.0|Had not seen this in many years - it's a little dated and not very accurate as far as the Army goes; but still a decent movie with good characters (Melanie Griffith!), and a good plot, Not everyone would enjoy it though.
1451626096|2.0|As is her style, Ms. Gregory ties threads of historical truth together on a web of uncertainty with bits of whimsy, telling the tale of the early years of the reign of Henry VII of England through the eyes of his wife, Elizabeth of York. Yes, it could have happened the way Ms. Gregory tells it and it could have actually been a good book. However, her portrayal of the paranoia at Henry's court over pretenders to the throne is extremely tedious, very very painful to the reader. But I guess that's what you have to do when you have to write a book of over 500 pages with little to go on.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|We bought this for my son and he loved it! hope. He is reading all the Percy Jackson books, hope to catch the current movie in the theatre.
B009WUBERW|5.0|entertaining. lots of excitement, This is a good weekend movie to get involved in while having a relaxing weekend. great
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Great movie! Sean Penn gives an outstanding performance in his role. Excellent casting. Strong emotional story about karma and choices.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I loved the approach to this book. I enjoyed the warts and all insights. I felt like I knew the Brown family when I was done with the book. I highly recommend this book.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Won't let me log in or create a new account. Keeps saying that it's taking too long. Please fix this! :/
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|Did not expect it to have the original dialog.  I did not consider it much of an adaptation.  This would only appeal to a specific audience.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I love the intrigue. It's a bit lengthy I'll admit, but subtlety usually is. It's hard to get attached to any character as you never know when or if they will be next to die in the game of thrones.
B00FEN1C50|1.0|Horrible!! Graphics are bad- character development suck. Story line sucks.  We were very disappointed. Wish I would not have wasted my money.
B0050IY61G|4.0|Because it tells it all everything you want to know about Aspergers syndrome and much more there's so many different types.
B003NX75B8|5.0|John Green's books.... All of them... Have changed my outlook on life.<br />This is not the exception.<br />I read this book one night, and it was raining.<br />It reverberated through me and shattered my thought process, becoming all I could think about for days... Hell, even weeks.<br />David Leviathan's book &#34;Every Day&#34; is the book for my book club currently, and I am thoroughly enjoying it.<br />These men may well be the next Marcus Zusak and Lemony Snicket.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Lately I think Mr. Sanderson is pulling out all the ideas that he's ever had and parlaying them into novels.  In general this is great!  Hey, I'm going to buy them.  His characters are lovely; the dialog is great; the action exciting.  I wish though that he'd take a little more time.  I was pretty appalled by the magic system in Elantris (even with the sop that other regions didn't have such ridiculous bases) though again characters save the day, I started hurting my brain trying to work out how two dimensional creatures can take a bite out of you w/o just passing through in The Rithmatist, and in this novel I guessed every single twist ahead of time, except the main one (I was with the protagonist's early theory, and was delighted that he threw me off that way).  Would I buy this again, though?  Yep.  Am I going to read the next one?  Yep.  I still care.  I like the comic book feel, the fact that the Superheroes aren't what you'd expect, and I quite like the twist that our hero is a normal guy.  I very much liked the world, the devices, and the flow.  In general, BSs books make you feel good about people.  I sometimes feel like his and Jim Butcher's books help repair some of the damage done to my psyche by the news and TV.  :)
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart witty law show with a shade of grey. Characters are deep but not in a contrived way. Plot is interesting though sometimes the drama seems manufactured.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|This highlights the key aspects of the history of the band, and doesn't hold many punches when it comes to talking about the conflicts between band members. The story seems a bit bent toward Henley and Fry, as you would expect if you are familiar with the dynamic of this group. Overall, I would recommend this to any Eagles fan, or anyone interested in the history of rock music. Read Felder's biography for a different perspective.
B00ABO573A|1.0|It was a depressing movie from start to finish. What a waste of time. I was really tired of the relationship and was relieved when it was over. It was toxic.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|As of Oct.9, 2013-I did find that and now have the Chromecast ICON on my TV, saying \\"Ready To CAST, but although Chromecast is now linked to my Home Wireless Network, thus my computer, the Blue Icon is not showing up. I have clicked and clicked the \\"Download\\" the \\"Extension\\" to my computer, but all you see is constantly is \\"searching for it\\" and it never finds it. This is an attempt to add the little Blue Chromecast icon to \\"YouTube\\" or anything else that is available for viewing. Suggestions?<br /><br />As of Oct. 29, 2013-I still am only giving the Chromecast 2 stars. The biggest problem for me is the fact that I wanted to connect my main computer in one room with the TV in my bedroom using the Chromecast. But because the two are more than 20 feet apart, the Chromcast doesn't work.<br /><br />It should be noted that there are several Apps for the smartphone, like \\"Twonkybeam\\" that you are able to play \\"Youtube\\" Streaming devices, like Roku. The KindeFire 1st generation has an app \\"Playto\\" that you can play from tablet to Roku app.<br /><br />I may change my rating in the coming weeks.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Love it. Basinga!!! Each episode is so funny I watch them over and over again and so do my daughters
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book had a huge message for me, and that was that it's OK to love myself, and do things for me, and to stop putting myself on the back burner all the time while I make everyone else's needs more important than my own. My own personal reminder is this: We're supposed to love others As ourselves, Not INSTEAD OF ourselves!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Beautiful sets. 1920's beautiful sets. Oh, I know photo shop, but still such elegance. The acting and cardboard characters (yes, I own the Fitzgerald's books) are lacking. This movie is mostly eye candy, but it works for me.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use.  Good screen quality.  Lighter than dedicated readers.  And most importantly, I'm not bogged down with multiple electronic gadgets
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Cute, well written. Maybe too adult for highschool. All the usual &#34;suspects&#34;, but with a new twist. All in good taste. Well acted. One of my favorites.
0061478784|5.0|I love this book.  I sold it off for money a couple years ago and have regretted it ever since.  Recently I started looking to purchase this book again.  THANK YOU FOR RE-UNITING US AMAZON&#60;3  This is one of my favorite books of all time.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|It is the same old story, but the action is great. Only a couple of flaws. I love action, and it is here in spades. Worth the watch!
1781162646|5.0|I have been delighted by Stephen King for years and Joyland  was no exception. Good story line and likeable characters.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love this series! I was so glad when season 4 came to prime. This series never fails to bring great acting and writing to the table.<br />I love the thinking in this story. Winning and class all in the same story.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Great video, brand new as described and my grandson loves it.  That is about all there is to say about a DVD.
B00821OX98|4.0|I love Scifi. Not enough good stuff to my taste. This is good. Well written, well acted. No too predictable. That is hard when you<br />have been watching and love this stuff for over 40 years.
B00DOQK2OG|5.0|I am a long time Blackmore fan and used to have a decent bootleg collection back in the vinyl days, so I have heard a lot of Ritchie live and seen him quite a few times over the years (including in Kansas City on this tour).  This is a great concert with everyone in the band \\"on\\" and Ritchie in a very good mood.  Some of my favorite live Blackmore solos are from this concert.  Glad I can put away my bootleg cassette for an official version with better sound - this CD will get lots of use.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Leave it to the Brits to produce a series so depressing but addictive at the same time!<br />The acting was great too!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Be prepared to loose much of your time to this one! I wish it were easier to gain coins
B0094K1K8I|2.0|I have not seen any of this trilogy. However, I do not believe it lived up to the hype, it was simply boring and stupid.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Daniel Pink clearly has his finger on the pulse of what needs to change in today's organizations.  Managers are so terribly out of step with what workers want and Daniel does an excellent job of spelling out exactly what it is workers want.  A must read!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|The Big Bang writers are in a league by themselves.  I do not know how the characters can even get through their lines without laughing all the way through.
B00F5FEZTC|4.0|It is wonderful to hear Elton doing Bernie songs again.  Takes me back to the first time I heard the Elton John album for the first times.
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|i have the wii game and love it. the tablet was better because there were more items and gameplay just was better. get this game.
B001AXME2S|5.0|This is one of the best collections of their music ever!  Great quality!  I've been listening to it every day since I downloaded!
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|If you care about the history of rock and classic soul, this is a must watch - but even if that isn't a particular interest for you, it's very entertaining.  There is a character study here that goes well beyond what I expected.
B001NTUDVI|5.0|Best album of 2005 & it still sounds fresh 8 years later... It's Mimi at her best. Often imitated but never duplicated
B008AU7F3C|4.0|Saw this group at a Depeche Mode concert recently and really loved them.  Their songs are meant to be played large and loud, as they make really good use of percussion.  Lead singer has a great voice and lots of range.  I've heard comparisons to Kate Bush, and that wouldn't be too far off base.  Anyway, great CD. Love &#34;All My Gold&#34; and &#34;Rest Your Head&#34; a lot.  Although I prefer songs with a bit of a faster beat, I've come around to really liking the first song, &#34;Lilies,&#34; as well as &#34;Laura.&#34;  I would have given it five stars, except I do prefer a little more upbeat song for general listening.  However, all the songs are quality and even ethereal.  Would definitely go and see them again in concert.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining was never one of my favorite King books, but nonetheless I was excited to begin the sequel. I was hooked right from the beginning. The terror was very real, but you had the sense that Danny's experiences would provide the necessary strength for \\"good\\" to prevail over \\"evil\\".....kind of a hold your breath, white knuckled ride to vindication.
B004LROUNG|4.0|It was a good. It was a typical john Grisham with a nice twist in it. I would recommend it
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Good book--little slow to get started, but very fast-paced and interesting after the first few chapters.  I really enjoy Baldacci's books!!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Dream theater's biggest adversary is himself...<br /><br />Is this DT's best album? No...<br /><br />But having listened the album maybe 20 times I came to the conclusion that Dream theater's biggest adversary is himself because I know they will still be criticized by the fans even after releasing such a good album..the standards they have set is really high...<br /><br />The album opens with the majestic instrumental &#34;False awakening suite&#34; which is followed by &#34;the Enemy Inside&#34; which IMO is a  solid 10...the perfect blend of commercial and progressive...<br /><br />the following song Rushlike &#34;looking glass&#34; is not only a 10 but also one of the best songs ever written by DT. It also resembles the When Dream and Day Unite Era...<br /><br />The instrumental enigma machine is not the Ytse Jam or the dance of infinity but still is a very solid one...<br /><br />The following song  &#34;bigger picture&#34; is verry strong  and Labrie's exquisite vocals take over...<br /><br />&#34;behind the veil&#34; and &#34;surrender to reason&#34; are good songs but are not the best of DT IMO. I did not understand the 1,5 minute keyboard intro in behind the veil.<br /><br />The following &#34;along for the ride&#34; is a very strong effort.<br /><br />The album is concluded by the 22 minute epic &#34;illumination theory&#34;. Again not as good as metropolis but a very good song, Would a 15 Minute version be better? I believe so...<br /><br />Overall I would give the music a good 9..It is a verrry good album...I did not like much in the first few listens but the album grew on me as I listened more...<br /><br />Now... I wonder who engineered this album... Mangini's overtriggered snare sounds very amateur. The cymbals sounds very weak...after the &#34;awake&#34; album, drum sounds in DT albums generally did not satisfy but this to me is one of the worst there is...this drum sound is not fair to a drumming master like Mangini
B00F35BV64|3.0|An enjoyable evening, good movie but not up to the standard of previous episodes. Helps to know the early movies.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What a lovely book. It makes you smile. It makes you cry. It is eminently enjoyable and should be enjoyed by everyone with a live of reading. What a memorable story. Thank you for writing it.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Easy read, story comes together with a flow and keeps you guessing as to who the characters really are  The movie should be just as good
B00EHMG358|5.0|Preston & Child, as usual, grab me by the throat and don't let go!  I love their characters! And I can't wait to buy the whole book!  Great teaser!
B00F35BV64|5.0|The plot was engaging and the main characters very endearing.  I chose to simply overlook a glaring plot discrepancy with events in the original Star Trek TV series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is like a soap opera but not the same.  It makes you want to know what happens to the characters next.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|First let me say I am big fan of Mahjong...I've played it with tiles...played it on the computer and now on the Kindle.  This one works well and graphics are good and it is easy to play.  Enjoy!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very comfortable, perfect reading app.<br />Thank you Amazon for this excellent app.<br />Will recommend it to all my friends and family.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a favorite pastime on my computer and this is just as well done for my Kindle.  Now I can waste twice as much time...but it's fun.
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|3D was very good but this was a short documentary only.  I will not purchase this type of DVD again.
B00867HDTA|3.0|The music is too loud and although there is  a &#34;button&#34; to tone it down it is not highlighted and won't work.  Game is so-so but I haven't made it very far before the music drives me bonkers and I shut it down.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book! I was hooked from the first installment and couldn't wait to order Bresking Dawn. The booked arrived super fast and was in perfect condition. Thank you

B0097EWK3A|5.0|I am new at this kind of game and I found myself riveted to my Kindle. I will be looking for the next addition.  The game played well and was really great as a free game.  A Definite five star.
B0012GMVQC|5.0|Can't believe how inexpensive it is and the art on the cover is sweet.  Won a Grammy back in the day as well.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Ok.. it is at your finger tips.. easy to read and use.. what more could you want. The ability to change the weather.. not happening..
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a great novel about how many lives are intertwined and affected by decisions and mistakes of others.  The book was very well written and tied everything up nicely in the end.  I thought the epilogue was great.  It shows how everything can turn out so differently by one action.  I definitely recommend it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Keeps the watcher interested and although it is not a suspense type program, it keeps you interested in what is coming next!! Inlove with the cast and the content!
B00F5F0208|5.0|drake never puts out a bad album.  this album is fabulous.  it really shows his growth as a man and as an aside.
B004I654WQ|5.0|Cars is a great animated film and one which doesn't have all of the stuff they stick in the R and PG-13 rated films.  I enjoy watching it and Cars 2 over and over.  I love Carsland at California Adventure Park.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I can't even log into my account. Every time I try it says something like this, &quot;it shouldn't take this long to log in please try again&quot;
B007MHVVCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have read the Alex Rider books and enjoyed them. This book is totally different. It has great detail and just enough suspense to keep you reading. I preread it before my son and now can't wait for him to read it. I will definitely be buying the next in the series.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved it can't wait to read the next book Travis is amazing now that's how you fight for love I so glad that pigeon gave up and got back with him awesome story
B00ESY77LO|2.0|The movie was hardly watchable because of how much the streaming froze or pixelated. It took twice as long and the movie wasn't amazing
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read!! Chris Colfer is a genius! Hope there will be many more books!
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Kia may not be able to convince me to buy a car with dancing hip hampsters but Lady Gaga gets major props for knocking out yet another awesome song!  It's the right amount of techo, pop and all-around feel-like-you-wanna-dance!  Awesome! ^^
1400032717|5.0|This book has all the ingredients I like in a &#34;light&#34; read: refreshingly original writing, engrossing character development, informative (as concerns asperger's syndrome).
B006JRY2QG|5.0|From the looks of it I didn't think it was my style of a show at all, but after the first one I couldn't stop watching! Love it!
B00594XOZU|2.0|If you are about to get kik don't it doesn't allow you to get an account and it takes forever to load it is a waste of time and data if your going with a texting ap go with text plus or text now it will load faster and it will let you create an account it will save you time
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I think this is just good clean television, my family and I like to watch it together. Looking forward to season 4.
B00F91H666|5.0|New item on my bucket list - be a zombie extra!  What a hoot - Brad Pitt is at an all time great with his classic handsome yet confused dumb look that pays off in the end doing something really daring.  Great techno sceneZ!
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a great product when you are constantly on the move. I also love the easy to use buttons.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|Fun but ended too soon, nice graphics, needs to be more challenging and longer. Solved the game in just a few hours.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great application. It keeps me informed without having to turn on the bulky desktop. Great application. Thanks.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|not too hard.  yet challenging enough to stay interested. great way to pass some time with critical thinking.  I just wish the game didn't force you to write a review before continuing.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I did not care for this version. I was all over the place. The various buttons made it a bit confusing.

0307742539|5.0|This is the final volume of the Millennium trilogy, and this one is just as exciting and entertaining as the two previous ones.<br /><br />The unique protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, has been admitted to hospital in Goeteborg in critical condition, with a bullet in her head. Following surgery she has a long stay in hospital before her, and two doors down from her lies her dangerous father Zalachenko who is also recovering from his wounds, but is still hoping to finish her off (and the feeling is mutual). Salander is kept under surveillance since she has been charged with attempted murder.<br /><br />There is a conspiracy against Salander, but she has an unlikely ally and protector in the surgeon Jonasson.<br /><br />The journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, who saved her life, is still working on her behalf, while his lawyer sister Giovanni will later defend Salander in her trial.<br /><br />Salander eats a basic unhealthy diet of bread, milk, cheese and pizza but she also eats kefir. I was pleasantly surprised to see that in Stockholm or wherever it is she lives one can apparently buy kefir in the sort of shops Salander frequents, whereas in Denmark, where I live, you can only get it, if you are lucky, from a health food shop.<br /><br />The author delves deeply into the political side of things and the deep corruption within the secret police. (I don't know if this reflects the true state of affairs in Sweden, hopefully not, but probably.)<br /><br />The amiable Blomkvist fights for justice, and has as his goal to reveal the truth of things to the Swedish public, in this case the whole Salander affair including  the reason for the hetz against this young woman. Blomkvist is apparently irresistible to most females, since they keep throwing themselves at him, and even the sullen Salander is not immune to his charms.<br /><br />There is a sub-plot involving Erica Berger, the main love of Blomkvist's  life, who runs into a tricky problem, which Salander with her unassailable hacking skills tackles from her hospital bed.<br /><br />The characters are well-rounded, and I like the way the \\"goodies\\" are not exactly paragons of virtue. Well, who is?<br /><br />I did have a slight problem with two of the names: there was a \\"goodie\\" called Edklinth and a \\"baddie\\" called Erlander, and it was difficult to distinguish between the two names.<br /><br />To sum up, this is a well-written, absorbing, unputdownable story that will keep you up all night. All the loose ends are satisfactorily tied up by the end. I strongly recommend that you read this volume, too.cking skills tackles from her hospital bed.<br /><br />The characters are well-rounded, and I like the way the \\"goodies\\" are not exactly paragons of virtue.

B000H4TX9I|5.0|This is my favorite show and I still can't understand the thinking behind its tragically short run. Definitely the best asian western sci-fi show ever made.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Every episode is an instant classic. Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic, and the ending makes you want to watch series 3 immediately!

B009BJAPLK|4.0|I'm only rating this 4 stars because it's not letting me do 4.5, truly a terrific series, but a 4.5 because the last episode is superior to the other two.
B00ESNE696|5.0|i have bee following it since the first season and have loved it since. i can't describe how much i admire the main character.
B0050UEVNM|5.0|I love this movie. How could you not with all the players in it. Connery and Rowlens is enough for me.
