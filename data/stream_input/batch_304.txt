0452281881|5.0|I didn't mean to read this whole book.  I get books to sell on Amazon & often just read a few pages, like a gourmand sneaking a bite of one eclair and then another -- looking for the well-filled book I just HAVE to read.  But I was drawn in immediately & then I couldn't put it down.<br />While I've never had any interest in working in advertising and really stink at playing corporate power games, this book was a great giggle!  No matter where you've worked, you know these people -- the temperamental ones, the backstabbing ones, the just-trying- to-get-laid ones.  And the fun part is that there is justice in this book.  (In real life, you hope there will be, but  you're often not around to see it.)<br />Are you bewildered in a workplace where backbiting and treachery seem to have taken the place of an actual day's work for most people?  This book won't change your situation, but it will give you the chuckles you need to make it through another week.

B000085RTZ|4.0|Not for fans of Kid Rock. But yes for those looking for an escape from the mundane.<br /><br /> This is a very pleasurable listen with an amazing level of maturity being displayed by such young musicians.  Four stars only because the music didn't jump out of the speakers and made me go Whoa!<br /><br /> The ambitious title is not lost on the classically oriented content of the album, the old battle between good and evil featuring Mephisto and Ariel, ie. the traditional duel between dark and light with the price being the soul of the one being tempted.<br /><br /> Although it is familiar ground, this is a highly ambitious project from a very young, talented, and precocious band, who show a great deal of gumption by sticking to their guns and continuing to release highly theatrical music featuring long songs, ethereal themes, and highly intricate orchestration and arrangements at a time when rhythm machines and bump and grind rap music dominates MTV while the survivors of grunge still rule the FM airwaves not held captive by classic rock and the increasingly sterile smooth jazz.<br /><br /> There are some nice nods given here to the fathers of the genre, the long lived and recently resurrected Queensryche, especially on the beautiful and understated \\"On the coldest winter night.\\"  There are also some hints of Iron Maiden and Led Zeppelin peppered throughout with some riffs reminiscent of Kashmer.  But there is nothing here that takes away from the band's originality.  And for those who like it fast, there is plenty of double lead harmonic guitar and double bass drum to satisfy the metal instinct.<br /><br /> Perhaps what is most surprising in these days when death metal gets all the press is that there is nothing but melody on this album, a nice respite from the usual metal fare these days.<br /><br /> The only question that remains to be answered is whether the American markets, where the real big money is made,  can embrace this increasingly important emerging new wave of metal championed by Kamelot, Stratovarius, Nightwish and the other Northern Europeans.<br /><br /> This is an evolving story worthy of keeping an eye on.metal championed by Kamelot, Stratovarius, Nightwish and the other Northern Europeans.<br /><BR> This is an evolving story worthy of keeping an eye on.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I thought that this film was pretty loyal to the harry potter book although in some cases I think it really missed out on some important parts.  The special effects were pretty good overall, except for the quiddich match which was, in my opinion, a big disappointment.  Daniel Radcliffe didn't do too badly for his role at potter but i'm sure he will get better as the movies progress.  You might think that with these comments that I disliked the movie, but you couldn't be more wrong.  There are definitely more good points than bad.  The whole castle layout was perfect in my eye; from the great hall with its floating candles and pumpkins at halloween, to the Griffindor common room.  Watching the movie made me love the books all the more as I was able to see the characters come to life in exactly the way I imagined them (all except for Dumbledore who I felt was a bit boring compared to the Rowling character, and the Weasly twins could do with a bit of liveing up).  Overall, a brilliant film and one that I would watch over and over again.
B00006GA48|5.0|What really [ticks] me off is that I have had this album on  cassette, 8-track, 2 copies on vinyl, and CD.  Now that it is remastered with extra tracks, how can I say no?  This album has been playing in my house since 1970, and I've never grown tired of it.
B000002513|5.0|This album tends to get overlooked, but in my opinion it is Bruce's best album.  He fuses jazz and rock perfectly to produce &quot;Kitty's Back&quot; and &quot;Rosalita&quot; - both of which could be considered his best songs (although neither appears on Greatest Hits for some weird reason).  <BR>The lyrics are great, and the music is just awesome.  Bruce would never make music better than this.
B000001FAQ|5.0|The Allman Brothers's same-titeled debut album is nothing short of pure brilliance. Though it was unknown in time of it's release, and the ABB was completely unknown band at the time (1969), this album is witnessing the birth of one of the rock's finest and most enduring live acts. While later (1971) &quot;The Allman Brothers Band at Fillmore East&quot; builds monument to their peerless live performance, this album sets solid base for their musical work and famous (and tragical) career. <br />To this day the ABB are hittin' the road and today are, as mentioned above, one of the rock's most famous and enduring, almoust unparelleld live acts. But it wasn't just 'live' that put their name in the stars; series of (commercialy successful) studio albums was released that witnessed their music abilities.<br />And this album, though was not comercialy succerssful, was equal to their later releasements. It sound fresh, pure and honest; it can be described as clean sounding blues-rock, with certain dose of psychedelia (album is released in 1969!). Playing is brilliant throghout the album. Duane Allman and Dickey Betts guitars are in perfect cohesion, and here they set standards for their own trademark dual lead-guitars. You can notice that right on the first track, brilliant cover &quot;Don't want you no more&quot;, so on &quot;Black hearted woman&quot; or outstanding twin solo on &quot;Every hungry woman&quot;. Greg Allman's strong and soulful singing is presented in every song; you can check &quot;It's not my cross to bear&quot;, (hard) blues from the heavens - hearing that is 100% enjoyment. Many of these tracks became standards in ABB concert repertoire, notable &quot;Trouble no more&quot; which appears in 'ABB At Fillmore East&quot;, and may sound more fluently there, but here is fresh and of sound more laid-down. Two classic tracks on this record which goes on every 'greatest hits' collection are hypnotic/psychedelic &quot;Dreams&quot; (another Greg's shining performance, along with his organ and classic Duane slide guitar), and heavy &quot;Whiping Post&quot;, which you have to hear to believe it. Oh yeah, that's  THE fire.<br />This album also may be first southern rock album, as the Allamns are fathers of all southern bands that are to come in the seventies.<br />If you heard of Allmans, you don't want to miss this album, and if you want to know how perfect blues-rock sounds, just get this album and enjoy!
B00005Y1TL|5.0|This album was an awakening.  It made me discover beautiful music.  Xtal is so blissful.  This is the best Aphex you can get.  Richard James made this in his bedroom with modified samplers and synths.  Each time you listen to it you can hear more suprises.  Just put it in the cd player and turn the lights out.  Leave the world for a while.
B00008973A|2.0|First, the good news: A CHORUS LINE finally arrives on DVD.<br />Now, the bad news: A CHORUS LINE on DVD is still the inferior movie version of the quintessential 1970s stage musical.<br />Since that was a mistake made 18 years ago, there's not much anyone can do about it, so let's not dwell on what a bad stage-to-screen adaptation the film is. Let's take a closer look at why you may want to own this title on DVD.<br />1. When compared to the previous panned-and-scanned VHS/laserdisc versions of this film, this anamorphic widescreen version preserves the 2.35:1 aspect ratio the film was shot in. The group dance sequences look better, and the continuity errors of the background people (arms shifting position from folded to outstretched on change of camera angle) are not as noticeable since they're much smaller.<br />2. The color and sound have never been better.<br />3. In addition to the theatrical trailer, there's a nice 20 minute featurette where Marvin Hamlisch talks about his experiences writing the music for A Chorus Line for the stage and for the screen. What's annoying is that this featurette was clearly edited by someone unfamiliar with the show. When Hamlisch says original lyricist Edward Kleban came out of some sort of retirement to compose two songs for the film version... the documentary cuts to an excerpt from the wrong song! The clips featured are from \\"Who Am I Anyway?\\" and \\"Surprise\\", when the new songs written for the movie were actually \\"Surprise\\" and \\"Let Me Dance For You\\". This lack of even basic research shows a total lack of respect for the material, and such a mistake shouldn't have been made.<br />4. Many of the excellent songs from the Broadway version did make it, anyway... despite those two lousy replacement songs filling in for some fan favorites.<br />If you never saw the stage version of this musical, then maybe you can enjoy this DVD. But if you did and are expecting to relive the show's magic by purchasing this disc... then you're infor a huge disappointment.

Who is this Viewer and just how big is the axe s/he has to grind?  I would be fascinated to know what movie this Viewer from NY, NY thinks is worthy of praise, but fear that said movie would  be forever tainted in MY mind by this nearly inhuman reViewer.  Get over yourself, Viewer, so you're no critic--and try ... you might--you're no \\"insider\\" either.  This movie is fun and beautiful and charming--I'm just gonna guess that these three adjectives have never been used to describe \\"Viewer.\\"  Watch this film again and again and again. . .
B000000I0I|4.0|I really enjoyed Tubular Bells, with its constantly changing textures and moods.  Ommadawn seems a bit warmer, but at the same time more somber.  The happier moments are indeed happier than Tubular Bells, but it never quite reaches the atmosphere of the latter.  I would give this five stars, but it isn't quite Tubular Bells.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Dr. Strangelove is at the top of of the (very short) list of political parodies in the world of cinema.  With the help of some fine performances from Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, and Slim Pickens, among others, Kubrick skewers a wide range of targets - the absurdity of the nuclear world, with its Mutually Assured Destruction and Missile Gaps, the irony of the contribution of German scientists to America's military might, the paranoia that surrounded the Red Scare - they're all here.  It is Sellers' wonderfully understated Mandrake (the embodiment of the &quot;special relationship&quot; between America and Britain - see Christopher Hitchens, among others) who carries the day, and the film.  Kubrick seems to have a way with soft-spoken English chaps who take their time getting to where they are going (think of the bartender in the Shining, and much of the early bits of 2001), but who speak volumes nonetheless.  A little dated, perhaps, but the humor (and the underlying politics) still rings true.

B00005LANG|5.0|Many reviewers (myself included) use the word \\"classic\\" probably more often than they should when examining great albums, but Bob Marley's thunderous \\"Exodus\\" rightfully earns the title. Its influence is incomparable, and its brilliance makes it second to none. You wanna talk about a record that has the word \\"genius\\" written all over it? This is it. And even after all these years since I first listened to it as a child, it has lost none of its urgency. Marley croons with pain and longing in the popular \\"Waiting in Vain;\\" delivers a strong message of empowerment in the title song, and another favorite of mine is the suave \\"Jamming.\\" And while Lauryn Hill's version of \\"Turn Your Lights Down Low\\" is fine, it can't measure up to the smokin' original that appears here. The remastering on \\"Exodus\\" is superb, making the recording even more crisp and tight than what we've heard on previous editions. In a way, \\"Exodus\\" is to Marley what \\"Kind of Blue\\" is to Miles Davis: a great beginner's album. If you own none of his stuff, this is a pretty good place to start, as it contains many of his more popular songs. And even those who are already familiar with this album should get this reissue for the remastering. Across the board, \\"Exodus\\" is indispensable.
0151008116|3.0|I found Life of Pi to be well-written, imaginative and fairly engaging, but... Booker prize? I don't know. The book is a very long build up to one philosophical opinion that is ultimately a bit of a let down. Although he writes well, Martel is clearly out of his depth tackling philosophical subjects like truth, belief and reality.  <br />Martel's opinion is: we can choose to believe that there is no God, and endure a Godless world (which he simply assumes would be less desirable than a world where there is a God), or to believe that there is a God, and enjoy a \\"better story.\\" A tool he uses, although in only a very minor way, to support this view is to borrow from a pragmatic philosophical viewpoint similar to that found in such philosophers as Richard Rorty (see Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature), now of Stanford University. <br />I've heard complaints that Martel, after introducing the boy Piscine who, raised a Hindu, comes to embrace Catholicism and Islam while continuing to practice Hinduism, later abandons this \\"many roads to heaven\\" theme when the story moves to the open ocean and to Piscine's ordeal as a castaway. This view is mistaken. It is true that Piscine, while drifting on the open seas for weeks, and then months, fails to be motivated by this experience to come closer to God (he only \\"turns to God\\" in chapter 93, just before his ordeal ends - too late!), or to encounter feelings of anger toward God, or to reject his religious convictions, but this is good. Experimenting with how hardships affect one's religious convictions is a worn out theme and would have been far too predictable. <br />Martel does not use Piscine's attraction to the three religions in order to prove that one can worship all three consistently, or to explore the close relationship between these faiths. At the end of the book we see that his motivation with Piscine's religious triad is to say that we believe things not because they're true, but because they will make our lives morerewarding. In the case of the three faiths, since their truth or falsehood cannot be proven (so he says), why not believe in and enjoy them all? <br />At the end of the book, when Piscine is encouraged to tell \\"what really happened\\" and we come to the version of the castaway story that does without the animals, Piscine says <br />\\"Isn't telling about something already something of an invention? Isn't just looking upon this world already something of an invention? The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no?\\" <br />After presenting this rather Kantian idea of sensory experience, Piscine continues <br />\\"You want words that reflect reality? Words that do not contradict reality? I know what you want. You want a story that won't surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won't make you see higher or further or differently. You want dry, yeastless factuality.\\"<br />With these later comments, Martel seems to betray his earlier claim that \\"the world isn't just the way it is.\\" He can't have it both ways, that there is something called reality and that reality is reflected by things called facts, and also claim that there is no way the world is. Perhaps we can assume that he really meant it when he said that there is no way the world is, but it would have been clearer if he had used single quotes in the above sentence to call the notion of an objective reality into question, for example: \\"You want words that reflect `reality'?\\" or even \\"You want words that reflect a so-called `reality'?\\".<br />The problem with Martel's thesis is that people do not, and can not, simply choose their beliefs, so for him to encourage us to believe in God to \\"see further\\" or whatever is pointless. We believe what we believe because we can not do otherwise. Try believing that you don't really like your favorite food, or that you crave cigarettes when you don't, or that you don't love your children, or that you're a hundred feet tall. Hey, try believing in God if you don't, and vice versa. You can't! Martel does make the very poor analogy that being an agnostic is like \\"choosing immobility as a means of transportation\\" so perhaps he is simply encouraging those whom he imagines as being nothing more than undecided - as if they could just lean one way or the other at will - to lean towards God.<br />Another problem with Martel's thesis is that while we see that we can't just choose to believe something, we also see that believing something doesn't make it true. Martel makes the debatable claim that one can't prove or disprove God's existence. This, he says, means that it shouldn't make any \\"factual difference\\" to people whether they believe or disbelieve in God, but since (he assumes) it will make their lives somehow more meaningful, we might as well just believe in God. Well, it should strike most of us as rather bizarre that someone would suggest that it doesn't make any difference to any of us whether or not our beliefs are true, and that all we should care about is feeling good. Whatever happened to the notion of truth? The pragmatism that Martel seems to draw from deals with issues of truth in great detail, but Martel never faces issues such as this one squarely. Granted, tackling philosophical issues in novels is difficult to do in a way that covers all the bases while remaining entertaining.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The Chamber of Secrets is such fun for us true Harry Potter fans.  A great book comes to the screen without the movie makers changing the story into something else entirely.  The cast is coming together as if renewing old friendships.  And happily, the younger cast members are picking up the excellent craftsmanship of their stellar elders (Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, etal).  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) is so much more relaxed and natural this time out and both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson remain absolutely wonderful as Ron and Hermione. Most of the rest of the cast is back in force, giving the movie a feel of continuity, just like any other (more ordinary) school. <br />I think that a successful project is often realized in the details.  And beautiful care has been taken in making Harry's world perfect, right down to the smallest details.  I know this DVD is going to be viewed frequently, and I'm sure I'll see something new each time.<br />Kenneth Branagh has taken complete control of Gilderoy Lockhart.  He is just so perfectly &quot;over the top&quot;.  (There is a very funny little bit after all the credits are over that you will want to be sure to see)<br />And FINALLY, Warner Video was listening when Harry Potter fans told them they fumbled the ball making the first HP DVD.  This time, I can find few faults with the special features offered on the second disk.  There are lots of really cute extra scene clips and the tour of Dumbledore's office was sharp, clear and far superior to those on the Sorcerer's Stone features disk.  I still have some things to explore.  Like the DVD-ROM features but even without any of those I still give 5 stars and a big thumbs up to Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets.
076790592X|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read! I read it in one day. Morrie Schwarz, a dying professor, teaches Mitch, his student and friend, so much about life, love, family, and the things that are really important. I laughed out loud in some places, broke down and cried in others, and I know I will remember many of Morrie's lessons for a long time. Mitch Ablom has given both Morrie and the reader a wonderful gift. Morrie would be proud!
B000063S6Z|5.0|Wow, what can't I say about this album?!  Everything from the melodies, lyrics, the way you can relate to what he or guest singer is saying...it's overwhelming, really. I can play it all the way through without skipping tracks, but here's a few that stand out among the rest:  \\"In My Heart\\"...the gospel/dance beat, a perfect match.  \\"Signs of Love\\", \\"One Of These Mornings\\", \\"Extreme Ways\\"...the second verse, that's me!  \\"HARBOUR\\"...Whooo! I don't know how they (he and Sinead) did it, but that's an awesome song!  Sinead's voice is powerful, yet comes across very softly. You can tell she feels what she sings.  I hope this is released as a single or a \\"B\\" Side remix to another single. \\"I'm Not Worried At All\\"...I call this one of my \\"theme songs\\".  I love this one.  The song has an old gospel feel from beginning to end.  The Shining Light Gospel Choir takes this song and runs with it.  Just as \\"Harbour\\", you feel what he sings.  The choir and their ad-libs throughout the song, the strings, piano, everything...spectacular.  Oh I forgot about \\"18\\"...another track, I can put on repeat and blast.  If you never heard of Moby, or never bought anything he's come out with, this is the time.  You won't be dissapointed with this.  ($0.02, right there)
B00008DDXC|4.0|This is better than the first, I think, but I kind of miss the cute little kid voices from the first. Oh well. Can't be changed.<BR>The movie seemed a little short too, though it's really not. And some scenes that are supposed to be shockingly scary are not: like when Harry, Ron and Hermione turn the corner and see the red warning words on the wall, Hermione starts reading it aloud as calmly as a bedtime story.<BR>And when Harry and Ron meet Aragog, the big spider, Harry starts chatting with Aragog as if they were old friends, when he should of been acting like Ron, who looked like he was about to barf from fright.<BR>Otherwise, great acting and good computer animation, too. Not for little kids, because some scenes are scary or violently gross. Wonderful movie!

This was done live in Paris in support of &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; and &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;.  However, when the band returned to the UK to mix the album, Steve Hackett gets sick of being a fifth wheel and leaves prior to album release in fall 1977.

B000002JOH|5.0|This album is excellent, it is simply fast, haunting and angry. This album may help you through times as well and i find it helps me when im stressed, it helps me let my anger out, and my main interest in the album is the guitar riffs, their just so fabulous, this is one of my favourite guitar albums. Heres a run down on each track.<br />1.MOUTH FOR WAR: A great song with excellent guitar riffs. This song is also without a doubt panteras best song, its a classic. I love the bit close to the end where the songs tempo goes faster and faster. 10/10<br />2.A NEW LEVEL: Well excellent guitar riffs, i love the bit where the singer screams &quot;a new level of confidence and power&quot;, but still nothing beats the classic mouth for war. 8/10<br />3.WALK: A very reconigsable song by pantera fans. I love the guitar riffs in the intro, it really shows the guitarists talent. This song is like an anthem. 9/10<br />4.F**KING HOSTILE: Whooa, this is a hell fast song, propbably the fastest song on the album, nice guitar riffs, as usual, and i think this song is talking about being controlled and un free to do what you want, well something like that. 8/10<br />5.THIS LOVE: An excellent intro with haunting guitar riffs in the beginning of the intro. This song is propbably my favourite power ballad ever, i love the chorus where he goes angry. A very haunting song, you know how i said nothing beats mouth of war, well maybe im wrong, this song does in my opinion. 10/10<br />6.RISE: Whoaa another fast song, nice intro, good guitar riffs. I love the bit where he screams &quot;whats wrong with your mind&quot;. Not quite as fast as f**king hostile, though better in my opinion. 9/10<br />7.NO GOOD(attak the radical): Nice intro it really shows the guitarists talent. I like this song, it has great guitar riffs, i like the bit where the singer says &quot;live in the past we make it last&quot;. Overall great song. 8/10<br />8.LIVE IN A HOLE: A nice intro, the guitar riffs sound cool. Thats what i like about pantera, each song has totaly different guitar riffs, and unlike heeps of other metal bands they depend on one sort of guitar riff. Any way great song. 9/10<br />9.REGULAR PEOPLE(conceit): A nice long intro, showing off the guitarists talent, and then the singer pops and starts yelling and stuff. Sorry, this is propbably the only forgettable song on the album. 7/10<br />10.BY DEMONS, BE DRIVEN: Great song attaking religions, nice guitar riffs. I especially love the guitar riffs on the chorus, when the singer screams &quot;by demons, be driven&quot;. I also love the bit after the chorus, where you hear this really haunting voice sayin &quot;back in the call&quot; or something, sorry its sometimes hard to understand what the singer is saying. 10/10<br />11.HOLLOW: A nice intro with guitar riffs that easily warn you that this is going to be a sad song. Slower than usual, though its not a power ballad like this love, still great song, that gets me curious to know the song meaning to this song. This song the gets harder as it gets closer to the end though, but not a power a ballad. 9/10<br />Overall great album, take it from me, you won't be disapointed, and yes this is one of my favourite albums, and this album helped me through some times, and pantera is just a very original band, so if you like metal, go get it. THANK YOU FOR READING-peace
B00008973A|1.0|I was fortunate enough to perform in the stage production of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; back in the day, and we were all really excited when the Movie was finally coming out...until we saw it.<BR>This film misses on virtually every count, not capturing anything that made the musical special and unique. Has-been choreographer of the moment Hornaday practically destroyed any style this film could've had, and the casting of talentless &quot;names&quot; like Judy the Bimbo from &quot;Dallas&quot; only made things even more hideous.<BR>Michael Bennett, the original creator of &quot;Chorus Line&quot; felt that there was no way it could adequately be made into a film...it looks like he was right.

B00005JLXC|2.0|Daredevil is yet another dissapointing comicbook come to life. While this movie may have exciting action scenes it completely lacks in everything else. The script is so poor and redundant it may aswell not be there. You could watch this movie with ear muffs and know exactly whats happening, which i probably recommend anyway since you wont have to hear the teen metal ridden soundtrack either. So anyway, Ben Affleck is Matt murdoch, a blind man who gains super human senses as a kid when radioactive waste is splashed over his face (how original). Other than being a superhero, he is also a kind hearted lawyer, which is ridiculous as his daredevil persona is a ruthless killer, although he keeps reassuring himself that he is \\"not the bad guy\\". This brings up the moral dilemma of does revenge = justice? who cares? The story doesn't flow very well at all. Characters almost force thier way into the lack luster script. There is absolutely no development of King Pin who has about 3 scenes in the whole movie, even though he is responsible for nearly all the crime in the city and also murdochs fathers death. Elektra played by Jennifer Garner is Murdochs love interest, and also becomes a ninja fighting superhero to exact revenge for her fathers death. And then theres Collin Farrel who overacts as the crazy Irish assassin Bullseye, who throws projectiles with deadly precision, and doesn't seem very scarey at all. The movie only really gets going after Bullseye is hired by King Pin to kill Elektra's father. We see lots of over the top computer generated fight scenes between daredevil and bullseye and you could probably guess the rest of it. All the events in this movie are tied together in a shallow and haphazard manner and the storyline plays more like a backdrop to the fighting scenes. The movie ends up being a pointless, uninteresting waste of time.
630469797X|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is a superb film. More of a reworking of the original than a sequel, it is phenomenally well directed considering the obviously miniscule budget. At times it is hillarious, other times quite frightening, but most of the time it is just good fun. Dawn is kind of dated, but its dated in that way where you can just laugh at that embarassing 70s quasi hip that makes most of us cringe when looking photos of ourselves in that era. The performances are great, even when dealing with some extremely bad dialog (which actually adds to the film overall in a weird sort of way).<BR>The story is simple but inspired; locating most of the action in a mall allows the film to be simultaneously apocalyptic and utopian.<BR>The music is also great, beginning with the opening credits scene. The opening scene brilliantly establishes the mood of the film from the get go, without being obvious or giving away too much. Its refreshing that this film doesn't try to explain things, it just goes with the flow.<BR>The Makeup is at times incredible, but its not over done.<BR>I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates low budget film making at its best.
B000084T18|5.0|50 is definitely not bad, but sum o his rhymes r kind of...simple...he can be great with the help of EM and Dre, pluz a few more guest appearances would not hurt, DMX, Jadakiss, NAs...he kinda sings alot on the album, i was really expecting a 2Pac Hit Em Up style, but yeah, u can live with it...is not sum bad rap like Ja Rule, its juz at its beginning stage, i believe 50 will b great on his next work...
B00008H2LB|5.0|If you liked Hybrid Theory you will probably listen to this and think it's the same thing, but after awhile it really grows on you. Trust me.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Who designed the DVD case?  It is almost impossible to remove the DVD disk, even when you push in the tab, without putting undue stress on the disk or scratching it.  Warner Bros needs to come up with a better solution.  With all the stress, I wonder when the hub will begin to crack.  My 7 & 8 year olds cannot remove the disks without bending it or getting finger prints all over it.  We don't have a problem with standard DVD cases.  This case is not customer friendly.
1570425671|1.0|David Sedaris, author of Me Talk Pretty One Day, is normally one of my favorite authors. His essays and short stories are usually humorous and enjoyable. However, Holidays on Ice proved to be the exception. This was an audio edition of four of Sedaris' essays/stories about Christmas. While the first story about a department store elf was marginally funny, the rest were horrendous. Sedaris' normally charming narration was grating and whiney and while I did listen to the very end, I honestly wish I hadn't. Perhaps this one would be better if read, rather than listened to, but I think not. I'm not a fan of the Christmas holidays and, seemingly, neither is Sedaris, but his stories didn't prove amusing - they were just annoying.
B00003CXSM|4.0|A lot of times when an artist decides to make the jump to movies, the quality of his/her albums falter. Sometimes it seems like Jennifer Lopez has the opposite problem -- either that, or the movies don't make a lot of sense. Fortunately that problem doesn't apply here.<br />Jennifer plays Mary Fiore, a single wedding planner who her father, Salvatore (Alex Rocco), desperately tries to set up with Massimo Lenzetti (Justin Chambers), a childhood friend of sorts. After a while Massimo even gives everyone else the idea that he and Mary are engaged. If things aren't hectic enough as it is, Mary's latest wedding involves Steven \\"Eddie\\" Edison (Matthew McConaughey), a man she met at the park that appeared to be single and coming on to her.<br />I enjoyed everything about this movie, although I couldn't understand why it took Mary so long to tell Eddie that she and Massimo weren't really engaged. Regardless of that, The Wedding Planner should stay in your DVD player for a long time.
B000089RVX|5.0|It's about time Evanescence got some exposure. 'Fallen' is amazing. Amy Lee's voice is phenomenal. This band is one of a kind. I have never heard anything like this before. I give this album 6/5 stars. Even if some of the songs deal with serious subject matter, (suicide, death, etc.) it is strangely uplifting. <br />If you love 'Fallen', I highly recommend their earlier albums: 'Evanescence EP', 'Whisper/Sound Asleep EP', and 'Origin'. Since these are extremely hard to find, I recommend downloading them. But it's okay, the band has nothing against people downloading their music. Except the song \\"You\\". Respect Amy's wishes and leave it alone. <br />Amazing music. Listen to it!...over...and over...and over...Believe me, you will!
B000089RVX|2.0|After all the great reviews I've been reading here, I decided to check this album out - how very disappointing it turned out to be. People are raving about this because they obviously haven't taken the initiative to discover better music on their own. As usual, they take the lazy route of letting a MOVIE SOUNDTRACK point them to a their latest \\"fave\\" artist, instead of taking the time to search out the much superior forms of this \\"gothic metal\\" genre - bands like the oft-mentioned LACUNA COIL! People - stop letting the marketing geeks run your life. You love this band because you don't know the alternatives. If you think Evanscence is so great, then you'll absolutely [love] Lacuna's latest album \\"Comalies\\"! But, of course, most of you won't hear it, because it's not on MTV or a on a Big Movie Soundtrack!! Your loss.
B00008DDXC|3.0|This movie will certainly be snatched up by all HP fans that thronged the theaters when it was released.  The special effects and creations of mythical creatures enhance the film.  However, as always, the movie cannot stand as a replacement for the book.  What the movie obviously lacks is the development of the characters and their relationships.  The book's popularity largely is owed to the insight and dialogues of the students of Hogwarts.  It is their growth and development that keep the reader riveted as they encounter new and unusual challenges.  The movie simply focuses on the challenges. Much of the talented writing found in the book is ignored in the production, perhaps to fit a certain movie time frame.  But if you have read the book, it is worth seeing some of the scenes come to life on the screen.
0698119347|5.0|14-year-old Alex Rider is an orphan. His parents were killed in an accident and he now lives with his uncle, the very boring Ian Rider, who works at a bank and values safety above all else. It is because of this last fact that Alex is baffled when he is visited by the police and learn his uncle was killed in a car accident. After meeting up with Ian's boss - and getting some very weird vibes from him - Alex determines to find out what really happened to his uncle. To start with, Alex goes to the wrecking yard where his uncle's car was taken. Expecting to find nothing but a mass of mangled metal, Alex is astonished to find his uncle's care in pristine condition - except for the bullet holes riddling the side. Before he can investigate further, Alex is captured and knocked out. When he awakens, he finds his uncle's boss waiting for him, and the truth comes out: Ian Rider was a secret agent for British Intelligence. Using blackmail, Ian's boss convinces Alex to take over his uncle's investigation and discover the reason Ian Rider was murdered. Equipped with a false identity and some super cool toys (among them: a yo-yo that has nylon thread that can hold up to 200 pounds and clips to a belt, a tube of zit cream that will eat through metal, and a game boy that doubles as a fax machine, listening device, and camera), Alex begins his new assignment as a secret agent.<br />That was what happened in the first 70 pages of Stormbreaker. The rest of the book was just as fast paced and exciting! A cross between James Bond, Agent Cody Banks and Alias, Stormbreaker sets your heart racing in the very first chapter. Alex Rider already has a series going for him - Stormbreaker is only the first in the series; the second came out last year and the third is being released soon. I wouldn't be surprised if this one shows up on the big screen, but don't wait until then - go get the book now and buckle up for a wild ride.
B00007JVBI|5.0|i've only heard snippets of cat power's work over the years such as their covers like \\"wonderwall\\" and the occasional great song that plays on the college radio station here in my local town so i can't honestly say that i'm completely familiar with cat power's discography but i do love the you are free album. i recently was talking with a friend and he mentioned that chan marshall was the only female singer/ songwriter he listened which actually surprised me and made me want to purchase one of the cat power albums. i wasn't sure exactly where to start but this was as good a place as any i suppose. chanmarshall isindeed a great singer/songwriter and i'm actually kicking myself because i didn't see their recent show in my local area. i don't know how to describe the sound of cat power to someone who has never heard ms. marshall's work but i can say that i love the array of instruments used here. the music itself reminds me at times of a cross between beth orton and leonard cohen although a little less electronic than ms.orton's great work. the lyrics here are not near as dark as leonard cohen per se but nevertheless display a great deal of courage and often wit not found in most albums recorded in our time. unlike most cds that you will buy over a given period of time, every song on this cd is a good song and you won't find yourself skipping through songs when listening to you are free. my only complaint with this cd (if you can call at that) is a small one indeed. i couldn't get enough of this album and was honestly dying for more at the end. the only other complaint i have with the account is the cardboard cover. this has to be one of the cheapest and flimsiest cases i've ever seen as i've worn mine to death in just a matter of days. i prefer the standard jewel case with inserts so this is somewhat of a disappointment to me. other than that, this is one of the best albums i've bought this year and i'd highly recommend this to anyone with a devout interest in great music.usic.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I bought this the day it came out. It lived up to my expectations--and then some. It still hasn't left my CD player. (It switches back and forth from Evanescence's 'Fallen') 'Meteora' has a different edge than 'Hybrid Theory', but it packs the same punch! The boys of Linkin Park are geniuses. Both lyrical and with the sound of the music. The only complaint from me is that the album is only 37 minutes. Tisk, tisk, tisk. But when I listen to 'Meteora', that 37 minutes quickly turns into about 100. Highly Recommended.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Whats the point in owning another CD? I mean seriously..trapped on a desert island, besides food, water and a cell phone, all you would seriously need to survive; lots of batteries, a cd player and this awesome as friggin anything CD. Rage's Finest, right next to 'Rage Against The Machine', 'Evil Empire'..you get the point. All the songs are wondeful..Calm Like A Bomb being my favorite..except after Testify, and Born of a Broken Man and Sleep now in the Fire...again you see where this is going. Anyways..buy it or forever be left in the dust; \\"The Greatest CDs of the Century...\\"
B000002UJQ|5.0|I was in a musical rut in 2001. I hadn't been into mainstream music for years, but I was getting bored with the stuff I was listening to. I happened across a magazine article about Radiohead. The article called them the best band alive and showered them with plenty of other superlatives. I asked myself, &quot;the band that did Creep is one of the best bands alive?&quot; I just had to check out their supposed masterpeice, OK Computer, to see what all the fuss was about. I have to admit, it took me a few listens to get into the album, but each time I listened to it, I discovered new things about it. My favorite song on the album jumped from the lazy, psychedelic Subterranean Homesick Alien to the dark, disturbing Climbing Up the Walls, to the over the top sadness of Exit Music (For A Film). I still can't say what the best song on this album is, but after dozens of listens I like The Tourist a lot, though most people would name Paranoid Android or Lucky. See, it takes a truly amazing album to have (almost) every song on it be so good that any song on the album could be your favorite. I can even appreciate the strangeness of Fitter Happier these days. In my collection of over 400 albums, this one is my second favorite (behind Maaya Sakamoto's Hotchpotch, which you can't get here). Read some more reviews if you aren't convinced yet. So many critics have named this one of the best albums of all time, can they all be wrong?
B00000IJPU|4.0|I am a fan of the earlier Iron Maiden stuff when they had Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith and although this CD has some great songs like Number of the Beast, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Can I Play With Madness, Trooper, Hallowed By Thy Name, Wasted Years, and Run to the Hills, and some awful songs like Virus, Man on the Edge (with singer Blaze Bayley on vocals) and Be Quick or Be Dead, the boys still had talent in the 1990's but the new singer Blaze Bayley is such an awful singer.<br />The songs I wish were on this CD are Flight of Icarus, Die With Your Boots On, Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Heaven Can Wait, Stranger in a Strange Land and Infinite Dreams and omit Virus, Man on the Edge and Be Quick or Be Dead. <br />If you're new to Iron Maiden, then this is where you should start and this was actually my first Iron Maiden purchase, even though I have never heard of there songs.
B00000DFRS|5.0|When a cd wins several awards or sells millions of copies doesn't mean that it's the best work of a singer.<BR>&quot;My love is your love&quot; is one of Whitney's latest albums and for me it's her best. This production didn't have the impact of &quot;The bodyguard&quot; or her 1987 hit release &quot;Whitney&quot; but it also had a good experience on the charts. It was a Top 15 album, sold 5 million copies worldwide and its singles; &quot;It's not right but it's ok&quot;, &quot;My love is your love&quot;, &quot;I learned from the past&quot; and the biggest one, &quot;Heartbrake hotel&quot; next to Faith Evans and Kelly Price were hits.<BR>There's also a duet with Mariah Carey. The song is the theme from &quot;The Prince of Egipt&quot; that was nominated for an Oscar in the Best song for a movie category, back in 2000.<BR>This album was considered as Whitney's comeback (it was actually her first new studio album after her 1990 &quot;I'm your baby tonight&quot;) and it had a different direction. Whitney adds more hip-hop sounds.
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is definetly one of my favorites. Very good handling of sound and in a featherweight package. These were a lot better than my old headphones. Best of all, they're only ten dollars. Easily affordable by anyone.
B000002ADT|5.0|I don't listen to much jazz, except on the radio. Anyone out there who forces themselves to listen to pop/rock radio stations should give the jazz stations a try some time. Less commercials, you won't hear the same songs every half hour, it's just such a more pleasurable experience. Anyways, this album is one of the first pieces of music I ever heard (my father is a huge jazz aficionado) and it has remained one of my personal favorite albums for many years. It's incredible, the emotions that this album can bring out in you. Starting out with So What, one of the best hum-along songs ever, it moves through track after track of perfect music, and incredible solos. I consider the high point of the album to be the opening of All Blues, which has got to be the most catchy song ever written. As the album closes with Flamenco Sketches, the tempo slows to a near crawl, and I always feel completely mellow by the end of that song. People will say it's the best album to relax to, the best album to have sex to, and so on, but really it is just one of the best albums to listen to, period. I couldn't have picked a better cd to be introduced to at such a young age, and I hope all of you expose this album to your children so they can hear what music is supposed to sound like.
B000059XUT|5.0|An amazingly clever animated story that keeps my 2 yr old, interested from start to finish.   You're child will love the animation and you will love seeing the creative ways your old childhood toys are used to create a great story.    The sequel is equally good, get them both, you'll enjoy something new everytime you watch them.
B00008PW2D|5.0|This four girls are simply fantastic and I can't really understand how can this year they're going to film the last season. I heard the reason is because Sarah Jessica Parker wants to have another baby and she wants to spend more time with her children. I'm happy for her but she could do both things as other artists do. HBO should make at least a Sex and the city movie.<br />The fifth season has a different direction because the girls had grown and they live different experiences like Miranda that now  has a son, Charlotte is getting divorce from Tray, Samantha felt in love for the second time in the series and she forgives her parter after that she discovers that he had cheated on her and finnaly Carrie, Carrie now is alone and she gets the change to write a book about her column.<BR>The fifth season has only 8 episodes but they're are fuuny and intresting as always.
B00008973A|1.0|Anyone who has seen any live production of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; will know what a disaster this film is.  Richard Attenborough was a terrible choice as director and whoever butchered the story should never work again. What was once a truly remarkable piece about 'gypsy' dancers has been turned into a soap opera about Zack &amp; Cassie.  It's too bad that the only filmed record we have of the remarkable show is this waste of time. No wonder it flopped at the box-office.  Better to buy the Original Cast album and close your eyes.
B000002KET|5.0|Black Sabbath made quite many good albums (no wonder if you consider they have been making music for well over thirty years now), but IMHO only two deserving five stars.<BR>One of them being Paranoid I reviewed a few weeks ago, while another one is SBS.<BR>They are much different; while the first kicks with brutal, dark force, the second is much more polished, well produced, and varied - it combines metal with pop, boogie, electronics and fine acoustic guitars. These elements appeared also before and after, but here they are unified on a masterful, expert level. Compared to previous albums, SBS is not too heavy. The only really heavy songs here are title song, A National Acrobat and Killing Yourself To Live. All of them are very good, but also lighter tracks are top-notch. This is Sabbath at the height of experimentation, and with good results, even better than their fellow Brits Led Zep achieved on, also experimental, Led Zeppelin III or Houses Of The Holy. The riffs of Master Iommi are maybe the best in their career, notwithstanding even Paranoid. Let us review track after track:<br />Sabbath Bloody Sabbath - one of the highlights here. Killer opening riff, very heavy but very melodic tune soon turning into beautiful acoustic part and again into heavy. The contrast between them and masterful performance are really thrilling here. Very memorable track. Pure genius 10/10<BR>A National Acrobat - just superb. Very dark, with gothic overtones, very mystic one (could somebody tell me what is the story about?), complex tune with fine, fine rhythm section and excellent guitarwork. Another 10/10<BR>Fluff - quiet instrumental, only guitar and Rick Wakeman's piano here. Some complain it is too simple; true, no fireworks here, but it is really pleasant and the piano is well mixed in. 7/10<BR>Sabbra Cadabra - a love song. Starts as a fast boogie with fantastic riff. Ozzy sounds almost like Robert Plant here with a very high, well crafted voice. Slower, second part with funky rhythm and piano is also very good. Ends with a demonic, electronically processed laugh, really scary...Induces goosebumps ;-) 10/10<BR>Killing Yourself To Live - a heavy song consisting of many different parts. Good, memorable riff, the story full of anger and disappointment (some say it recalls Ozzy's early hard-working days in a slaughterhouse, I do not know if it's true). The only complaint could be that the song is a little bit inconsistent, with its many different parts not fitting each other very well, so sounds a bit forced at places. Still very good one 9/10<BR>Who Are You - I am not a great fan of this. It's a synthesiser-dominated song, and not extraordinary one. But deserves 7/10 for its very sinister mood - it's the darkest song of the set.<BR>Looking For Today - a pop song (almost). The most lightweight here, but still pleasant. Good melody, good refrain, nice flute solo in the middle, good mixture of acoustic/electric, but not as memorable as title track. An OK. song, but not as excellent as others. 8/10<BR>Spiral Architect - another atmospheric, mystical ditty (again, what is it about?). Very, very light, but also very joyful, completely untypical for Sabbath, but this time very good. A glorious album ending. 10/10<br />So, that's it. 4 killer songs, one very good and 3 good songs. But, as for many other classic albums, the whole thing is bigger than sum of its parts. This is an artful and coherent collection of songs, good deal of experimentation and brilliant riffage.- a must own for every rock lover.<br />Igor Kurowski
B00005JLSE|5.0|This was an outstanding film with lots of pizazz and great performances by great actors. It truly was a worth-while experience to see this film as it was well-directed and I think of it as the best movie I've ever seen! I loved Chicago and I thought that the music was the best from any musical. I congratulate Rob Marshall for making a classic film.
B00008RH3L|1.0|This time the Coens decide to knockoff Dashiell Hammett's The Glass Key.  They do bring a lot of style to the project, but forget anything about substance.  The film is a tiresome bore, overproduced and over-acted.  Flashy and convinced of it's own significance, the film suffers from a severe case of obviousness.  Once you see (and you'll see it pretty quick) that each character is going to double cross every other character, the film has nowhere to go, and it goes there in a hurry.
B00005CCA9|5.0|Okay, maybe it does sound a bit grandiose or over-the-top but the fact is the sheer virtuosity of this piece kind of warrants it, doesn't it? The energy of the live performance is here, it's like hearing an actual concert over and over again. I think so anyway.
B000084T18|4.0|Ive got to say that this album was quite good.However some of it is let down there are some songs that are wasted and could of been made better.But majority of it is great,in da club,back down,wanksta,21questions and waiting paitantly are amazing.There are some more but thats the songs that i liked the most.
0140386335|4.0|This book is chock full of imagination! It starts out with a timid boy named Bastian stealing a book from a bookstore and hiding away in the school attic to read it- \\"The Neverending Story\\". He is swept away into an enchanting world called Fantastica (Yes, it was Fantasia in the movie) following Atreyu to try save Fantastica from The Nothing. Bastian soon finds out this mysterious book includes him in the story! If you are familiar with the movie, this book starts out like it, but has so much more detail included, and the story goes on much longer where the movie ended. In the book, Bastian does not go back home to make wishes in his own world, instead he stays in Fantastica and makes wishes there. I could not get over how original each little idea the author had to include in the story. This book is a good fantasy for children and adults alike.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This second installment in the Harry Potter franchise follows Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) as they enter their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Dark forces are at work as the mysterious Chamber of Secrets is opened, releasing something that threatens the schools students.  Harry, despite being a suspect, investigates the dangerous happenings along with the help of his friends, giant spiders, a house elf named Dobby and a magical diary.  <BR>The Chamber of Secrets is more sinister than the first film, targeted towards older children and adults.  The length of the movie, clocking in at a total of 161 minutes, might be another deterrent for younger viewers.  However, the magic of flying cars and wizard duels and another amazing Quidditch match may help to make a great deal of that time vanish.  New cast members such as the vain Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) and menacing Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) only serve to underscore the incredible casting of this loyal adaptation.<BR>Sadly, this second Harry Potter film was the last appearance of Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore.  Harris passed away due to Hogkins Disease on October 25, 2002, less than three weeks before the films theatrical release.<BR>The DVD of this release will contain a number of bonuses aimed at providing more Hogwarts information and entertainment to older children.  Beyond the now familiar deleted scenes and interviews we expect on all DVD releases, this disc also provides some fascinating features on the DVD-ROM.  The most exciting is the fact that the various components of the DVD-ROM may be activated and controlled using voice-only commands. <BR>Overall, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets provides enough mystery, adventure and wonder to make any movie viewer believe in magic.
1558216847|4.0|I began reading this book with a keen sense of cynicism from the observations of skeptics who had critiqued The Long Walk.  The story grabbed me after a few pages and I couldn't put it down.  It didn't matter if it was true or not, even if he we lying it would be a classic fiction adventure novel.  So dont worry about the truth, enjoy reading a captivating struggle for freedom and the triumph of the human will.
B00006AW2L|5.0|I will review this album later, im hungry right now
6304082428|3.0|I cannot comment on this film without comparing it with the [[ASIN:B000244FDW Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)]]. If I hadn't seen the 1980 BBC's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", I would probably adore this 1995 film like many people here. However, I must say that except the lavish decoration, this film is far inferior to the 1980 BBC's P&P in every respect: screenplay, performance, music, etc.     It's a pity that quite a few people are mistaken Jane Austen's spirited novel with a simple romantic story; one reviewer even praised the film as an epic. In her book, Austen writes about a serious topic with subtle humor, which is exactly what A&E version fails to capture. Both movies have added some lines or scenes based on the original novel, however, the Garvie/Rintoul is more true to the novel. Some people like A&E version because of the \\"extras\\" it offers, while some of these are described on the book such as Mr. Dancy's preventing his sister eloping with Wickham and later his searching for Lydia and Wickham in London, others are merely screenwriter's add-ons, three examples here, the first is Colin Firth came out of his bath and saw Jennifer Ehle playing with a dog, the second is the wet Colin Firth encountered Jennifer Ehle unexpectedly in Pemberly, and the third is Colin Firth practices fencing to show his determination of winning back Jennifer Ehle's affection. These are ridiculous and unnecessary. At the same time, the A&E version has missed or changed some important scenes that are essential to the book. For instance, Lizzy's first piano performance at Lucas' ball (instead, she went off to teach Lydia how to behave). Most of the interesting dialogues between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley are completely gone. Two in particular, one is after Mr. Darcy tells how he admires Elizabeth's beautiful eyes, the other is Miss Bingley's compliments about Mr. Darcy's writing. One dialogue is badly rewritten: in the book Mr. Darcy gives two reasons why he doesn't want to join Elizabeth and Miss Bingley in their walking about the room, here in the A&E film, he's only shown half intelligent and sharp by omitting one reason. Also the part where Elizabeth observes and analyzes his father's attitude towards his wife is replaced by \\"daily proof\\". The last part where she analyzes how Mr. Darcy falls in love with her at the first place should have been kept.    Regarding the acting, old BBC's version is more close to the period. Characters are more lady and gentlemen like. Characters in the A&E version, on the contrary, do not behave as courtly as they should. Upon seeing Ehle crossing her arms when listening to her father's comments on her refusal to Mr. Collins' proposal, I dislike this Elizabeth considering her very rude.    The A&E version is entirely miscast with the exception of Charlotte or maybe Mr. Bennet. Jennifer Ehle misinterprets Lizzy totally. She's not even physically up to the description in the novel. She always reads her lines in a hurry and even needs to catch her breath in order to finish the sentence. She doesn't show any wit and appears proud and rude like the two Miss Bingley (when she went to visit her sick sister and came across with Colin Firth [another \\"extra\\"], he appeared much more polite than she). Elizabeth Garvie's Lizzy is adorable, witty and beautiful. She IS Elizabeth, no doubt. Colin Firth is not a proud Darcy but rather a miserable one with gloomy eyes. David Rintoul may lack Firth's sensuality, but he IS the proud and satirical Mr. Darcy. A&E's Jane is not as sweet and beautiful as Sabina Franklyn's Jane. Bingley is OK but could be more candid. His sisters are hateful. Miss Bingley doesn't show any interest in pursuing Darcy (in the early BBC's version, Miss Bingley is perfectly portrayed by Marsha Fitzalan). Mr. Wickham is not as handsome and attractive as described in the book. Alison Steadman's Mrs. Benetts is nothing but noisy, Priscilla Morgan's Mrs. Bennet is a simple-minded mother whose entire interest is to have her 5 daughters well married. A&E's Mary is abominable while Tessa Peake-Jones's Mary is a young lovely bookworm with lot of comments. I particularly dislike David Bamber's Mr. Collins. He is not funny at all and appears despicable, Malcolm Rennie's Collins, instead is much more comical with his distinct long figure, awkward movements and some details such as the non-stop apology. Lady Catherine de Bourgh is OK but lack the bossiness as Judy Parfitt's portrayal of her.     The music in 1980's version is a perfect match to the film.    The A&E version is a fine productin and a great entertainment, but definitely not Austen.
0440416027|4.0|Michael's family moved across town into an old house with a cluttered garden. Then his baby sister becomes sick and is carried off to hospital. His parents are busy with the baby and renovating the house, so Michael is left on his own to find some friends in the neighbourhood. He meets Mina, a home-schooled girl, who shows him some owls she found in an old attic. After this, Michael feels that he has to show her something aswell, so he leads her into the ancient garage in his garden. There, Michael introduces Mina to Skellig. The garage pledges to slowly collapse, so Michael and Mina have to carry Skellig into a shattered house a few streets away. Here, he regains his strength by eating `27 and 53' from the Chinese takeaway and the food Mina's owls bring him. Mina and Michael soon discover that Skellig has wings and is a strange kind of creature. He spends a lot of time with the owls in the attic, eats and leaves owl pellets behind like they do. Michael has a feeling that Skellig's appearance has something to do with his sister's illness, and so pleads him to think of her. When Michael and Mina visit him a while later, Skellig is gone. Michael takes this as a sign that his little sister died. But miraculously she survives a difficult operation. \\"... And in the end we simply called her Joy.\\"
B00005JM93|1.0|I rated this film *1* out of *5* because I had to abandon my viewing. The violence was graphic beyond what is tolerable for a person with sensibilities within what might be considered normal. I am no prude; this is the first film I ever abandoned due to violence. I am male and if I ever _do_ abandon a film, I will abandon it out of boredom -- not violence. Stay away.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Where to go and what to say. Another album of rock,talk and poetry. No wonder people are noticing the babies from Detroit. Just listen to there music. The first two albums were bluesy/rock masterpieces followed by a jolt of imagery and allegories in White Blood Cells. Here we are at a turing point in evolution. This album will be looked back upon as a corner stone of this decade. The stripes have taken all they have learned, threw it back and reinvented a coal burning steel driving machine from the parts. It seems that everyone mentions &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; . This is a great track but look at the first three on the album (see above for track names) The music alone is better than anything out there and I found myself thinking&quot; this is as revolutionary and experimental as the beatles from 67-69. this album: a milestone. Also &quot;little acorns&quot;, great touch with the intro, then a great song. Four albums, and numerous 7&quot; and singles, and all they do is get  better. *eight track reel to reel, nice treat.
B00008J4P5|1.0|This is typical pretentious poser rock at its worst. It would be nice if american kids would get a clue to the REAL underground garage scene that this country has been putting out for the last 10 years. Ever been to Sleazefest or Garage Shock or The Heavy Rebel Weekender orany of the other countless garagerock festivals that this country has every year? These guys have probably never played at any of em. This band is too garagerock what the backstreet boys were to punkrock.
B00005UKE0|5.0|Such power really hid itself below the surface and occasionally showed itself in such Beatles songs as I,me,Mine and Its all too much.  Still, George was kept in check by John and Paul.  And finally, they went their separate ways and George was finally free to let out and explore his creativity.  And thankfully, that explosion created one of THE great records of the early '70s and in many ways is as much a Beatles record, but still a solo record, as the later Beatles record.  It's rock, but still very well produced and innovative all in one stroke.
B00007KQA3|1.0|I must say, first of all, that I simply adore this film. Filmed at the same time as Orwell placed his warning cry of a novel, and cast with the wonderfully talented John Hurt as Winston Smith, this movie is a lovely adaptation of a book which many would be wary to approach in film. <br />However--this DVD is absolute garbage. I was thrilled to see that 1984 was finally being rereleased on this format, and picked it up immediately, not aware that MGM would absolutely mangle it. First of all, this DVD is one of those ones released so simplisticly that you nearly suspect it's bootleg--no inner booklet, etc. That wouldn't be much protest, however, and if only that were the issue, I'd not be commenting. However, MGM decided to strip the film of the Eurythmics' score. Maybe someone up top thought that the Eurythmics were \\"too dated\\" or something--I don't know. But the film's REAL score suited the mood of a haunting future. And the score they imposed, while decent, was occasionally absent, leaving long stretches of silent time I hadn't noticed before. <br />If you haven't seen the movie before and can't get the previous VHS tape--go ahead and buy this one. Otherwise? Don't give MGM money for ripping up something beautiful.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I am an 18 year old totally blind boy and I absolutely adore Johnny Cash very much. He has always been my favorite country artist and I think this new album, The Man Comes Around is absolutely superb. I had tears in my eyes as I listened to his version of \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\". Johnny as you know is not doing well at all these days, but thank goodness he is still making great music. I only have one Bear Family box set of his called \\"The Man In Black 1954-1958\\" which features all his Sun recordings and early Columbia recordings. It is so difficult to get some of these box sets and I am dying to have his other Man In Black sets. ...
B000068OSK|1.0|This CD was OK but an obvious rip off of the flat duo jets. I recommend getting the real mcCoy. If you like this then Go buy Dexter Romweber`s latest CD, \\"Chased By Martians\\". He was the guitarist/singer from The Flat Duo Jets.
0312305060|5.0|Michael Cunningham did a great job researching and writing about Virginia Woolf and of course, some imagination went in there as to how Woolf was feeling at the time of writing her great novel, Mrs. Dalloway, and dying.<br /><br />Here, we get three different stories of true emotions, each heartfelt in its own way, combined into a cohesive novel that will have you in tears a couple of times before the end.<br />The link here is Viginia Woolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\". Virginia Woolf, an author troubled by by own insanity in Richmond (early 1920s) is in the midst of writing her book, Mrs Dalloway. Choosing between living in Richmond and death, Virginia Woolf will finally succumb to the voices in her head by drowning herself.  As she questioned her existence, life and love for her husband, Virginia put part of herself in the book she was writing.<br />Almost 30 years later, a lonely housewife, Laura Brown in Los Angeles (195o's) picks up the book for a read and questions her own life and feelings. It looked as if her life was perfect, a loving husband, a son and an unborn coming their way. It was her husband's birthday and she wa going to make a cake. She made one and another. Her best friend, Kathy, came for a visit with bad news and both parted with a kiss, a kiss that transcended time, gender and emotions. Laura chose to leave her family while the impact on her son, Richard, was so devastating in years to come.<br />In modern day 90's New York City, a gay woman, Clarissa Vaughn being nicknamed \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by her dying AIDS friend, Richard (Laura's grown-up son), questioned her own existence and priorities when Richard re-ascertained his love for her before leaping to his death.<br />In this well-executed novel, feeling is operative here. In a complex web of life, love and relationships, one day in the life of three women in different times was to be so life-altering.<br />Absolutely smashing.

I bought this CD a few weeks ago and I can't even begin to tell you how delighted I am to know that a lot of youngsters out there are starting to discover Elvis's music!

B000000WHH|5.0|what could i possibly say about the perfect record \\"Colour By Numbers\\"... Boy George vocals are splendid along with the intense voice of one Helen Terry... her voice compliments Boy's voice wonderfully... the entire album is worth a listen from the beginning groove of \\"Karma Chameleon\\" to the very sad \\"Victims\\"... the bluesy \\"Black Money\\" is by far one of my favorite songs which proves this Boy has soul...
0385335482|5.0|This book was so good, I started reading the first one, two hours after I bought it, and didn't put it down until the next morning. It was so funny, and the ending was a perfect spin to what one would think would end in a little bit more trouble. <BR>     Becky Bloomwood is such a funny character, at some points in time, I would shout out &quot;Becky, I can't believe you just did that!&quot; or &quot;Oh, no, not again!&quot;<BR>     Basically, Becky Bloomwood is one of the most interesting characters in any of the books I have read, and believe me I've read my fair share. Rebecca is pretty much a shopaholic, in denial, funny, and interesting woman. That's all I really want to write, but I'll leave you with this: If you want some laughs, read &quot;CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC&quot;.
B000002H97|5.0|Okay, let's face the facts here, and although many people will not agree with me on this, I just have to state this the same:  This is by far, without a doubt, Metallica's best album.  There are many who say Master of Puppets is their peak of talent, but I disagree with that, knowing that although that album was indeed great, the riffs kind of got boring and sometimes it was hard to listen to the CD in general because of the tediousnes of it all.  <BR>     However, the 'Black 'Album' or the 'Self Titled' or whatever it is you want to call it, promises a lot;  the riffs are loud and very rarely boring, the vocals from James Hetfield are once again growling and sometimes rasping with fierceness that only he could achieve, although this is also the album that his voice lost its edge;  instead of sounding like an angst driven teen, he kind of developed into an adult with a deeper and more controlled voice that took on its own vocal cords, and if you look at their newer albums, you wouldn't even know its James Hetfield in the first place, but that's a different story.<BR>     The black Album suggested no-Thrash, which is what they kind of followed in general.  The speed metal Slayer determined kill-everyone-in-sight was picked up and thrown away, leaving the band to kind of talk about more mature subjects;  the Unforgiven is probably one of my favorite Metallica songs, and guess what?  This isn't the only ballad on the CD!  There's actually about three!  The unforgiven is a story about a boy growing up, being misused in a deep way, and finally growing up and kind of getting revenge;  the story is complicated, but it is also one of those abstracted songs, something that you can make of your own, and not worry about what other people think about it.  This is Metallica's peak, without a doubt.  <BR>     This was the third Metallica CD I got, and it has deeply changed my life.  It showed me that bands do have originality, music can be good if you give it a shot, and even metal can be a great way to find inspiration if you're into creativity of some form, some artisticness that you are trying to develop;  This band in general changed my life.  If you like metal, or just great hard rock with some melodicly driven riffs, the Black Album will not dissapoint.  While it did let down many of the older Metallica fans, they just need to learn this:  Bands can't play like they did when they were eighteen.  That's a proven fact.  Get over it, live with it, and enjoy the newer Metallica.

B00008J4P5|3.0|No one, not even your great-grandmother can resist singing along to songs as catchy as &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; and &quot;Well, it's true that we love one another.&quot;  But aside from a few catchy tunes, I keep failing to see what the White Stripes do that is so dang brilliant.  I'm confused and concerned that these days albums are saluted for sounding like they were recorded in a Taco Bell bathroom and I'm not even really sure that their lyrics are as ingenius as they're cracked up to be.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed parts of &quot;Elephant&quot; and it holds together as an album really well, but it's certainly NOT a masterwork.  I feel like &quot;Elephant&quot; is about as good as the White Stripes last two albums were.  I guess they just do what they do and either I don't get it, or maybe, just possibly they're a little overrated.
0441172717|5.0|By far the best book written since &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; Herbert was talented beyond belief. The series as a whole is in my opinion the best ever. An Epic comparable to that of any epic ever created.
B00007KQA3|4.0|This was the holy grail of DVDs for me. I loved the book and was blown away by the film. I am very disappointed by the soundtrack revisionism and have decided not to buy the DVD in protest (I rented it to check it out).

B00005ASIL|1.0|Re:<br />1) \\"...rock's only flute-playing frontman, Ian Anderson...\\"<br />The term \\"frontman\\" is meaningless, but, as it happens, there were several late-sixties/early-seventies popular rock groups that featured a flautist, including Focus, the Moody Blues, and King Crimson. (This list is not exhaustive.)<br />2) \\"...the '70s were a time of excess, but few could top a single song filling two sides of a studio album--and this on the follow-up to a hit album)...\\"<br />Actually \\"Thick as a Brick\\" (1972) did BETTER than \\"Aqualung\\". \\"Thick as a Brick\\" was Jethro Tull's first (and only) #1 album in the U.S. (It was not excessive.)<br />\\"The band was in retreat by the late '70s, but has soldiered bravely on through the decades.\\"<br />Actually the band was in retreat by the summer of 1973. (One critic's \\"bravely\\" is another's \\"cowardly\\", I suppose.)<br />In any case, this disc includes: <br />a) at least four of Jethro Tull's very WORST songs (\\"The Whistler\\", \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\", \\"Too Old to Rock and Roll, Too Young to Die\\", and \\"Heavy Horses\\"), <br />b) various songs butchered (\\"Thick as a Brick\\", \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\", etc.), <br />c) four out-takes that didn't make the studio-album grade (\\"Living in the Past\\", \\"Sweet Dream\\", Witch's Promise\\", and \\"Life is a Long Song\\"),<br />d) the very worst cut from \\"This Was\\" (\\"Song for Jeffrey\\") and no cuts at all from \\"Benefit\\",<br />e) assorted sludge from the period of retreat (\\"Broadsword\\", etc.),<br />f) and only four songs that might reasonably be considered among Jethro Tull's best (\\"Aqualung\\", \\"Locomotive Breath\\", \\"Bouree\\", and \\"New Day Yesterday\\")--although pretty much anything from \\"Stand Up\\", \\"Benefit\\", and \\"Aqualung\\" is just as good.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Firstly I would like to say that the CD was catchy and fairly well written. I'm not terribly sure who is responsible for the lyrics/music though it has a nice Europop feel to it. I caught someone saying that the lyrics were deep and meaningful, don't be misguided by that, there's nothing deep about the songs. Meaningful perhaps, but I just listened to two and a half minutes of the line 'They're not gonna get us...' and while it is true that 'they' aren't going to get them, whoever they are there's nothing deep about it.
B00006JKOM|1.0|Ian Anderson often complains in interviews that the name &quot;Jethro Tull&quot; hangs like an albatross around his neck. He particularly dislikes being mistaken for Jethro Tull, the historical figure--or something. This is understandable, I suppose, but the solution is rather obvious, isn't it?<br />We can reasonably assume this disc's title song, or just plain title, for that matter, is not intentionally autobiographical, and certainly I would be the last to say that thirty is too old to rock and roll, or, for that matter, forty or fifty or sixty. By the time of this record's release, however, SOMEthing HAD gone wrong with Jethro Tull (the rock group, not the historical figure), and if you don't believe it, just listen to how excruciatingly awful the title track is.
B0000714BP|4.0|Well, what can I say!  I loved everyone in this film, and am SO glad to see that you can now add it to your DVD collection.  It'll be a great present for a birthday coming up soon.  The only flaw I can see in is that the story ended so quickly!  Getting to know Miss Vida Bohemme, Miss Noxema, and young princess Chi Chi was such a joy!  I always thought there should have been a second film to this story, but maybe we see to many sequels for such materpieces that seem to stand along oh so well!
B00008G9JO|1.0|I have the impression this record's lyrics were written before its music. They fit rather uneasily, and quite a bit of the &quot;melody&quot; is just reiteration of a single pitch (especially on &quot;Journeyman&quot;, but to a significant extent also on &quot;Mouse Police&quot;, &quot;No Lullaby&quot;, and &quot;Rover&quot; as well as on the middle sections of several of the other songs). Where there are some slight wisps of actual melody, or, rather, intimations of melody, the music is particularly trite. (I'm thinking here especially of &quot;Acres Wild&quot;, &quot;Rover&quot;, and &quot;Weathercock&quot;.) <br />The lyrics seem to present a particular problem for their musical settings because they tend not to be very lyrical. They are prosaic rather, and in a clumsy, overwrought, and often insipid and smarmy manner (e.g., &quot;Good morning, weathercock/Make this day bright/Point the way to better days we can share with you&quot;). <br />Here is a typical bit of lyric chosen more or less at random:<BR>&quot;I'll make love to you in all good places/under black mountains in open spaces/by deep brown rivers that slither darkly/through far marches where the blue hare races.&quot; <br />That sounds vaguely literary, or pseudo-literary, such that it may impress those with puerile taste, but it is unlikely to have any genuine emotional or sensual effect on anyone. If you've ever taken an elementary English composition course, you can probably see why immediately. We have seven flabby adjectives (each noun is modified by at least one) and a flabby adverb, but only three verbs--only three words denoting something happening. Of these verbs only one is strong. Even so a river can slither only figuratively, if it can slither at all, and a DEEP river is unlikely to slither even figuratively. &quot;Darkly&quot; only dilutes &quot;slither&quot;. <br />Here is a contrasting example by Paul Simon that makes a strong verb tell: &quot;I know the reason I feel so blessed/My heartstill splashes inside my chest.&quot; Notice how Paul Simon clears the brush from &quot;splashes&quot;. His heart doesn't splash wildly or &quot;darkly&quot;; it isn't black, brown, or blue or even good, open, deep, or far.
B000002BFZ|5.0|After expressing their highly liberal political views with Vs. and going all out artistic with Vitalogy, Pearl Jam had established themselves an unpredictable musical group... not just a 'rock band'. But what was ahead... was beyond unpredictable.<br />1. Sometimes - The mood setter... the softest, mellowest Pearl Jam track to date. Not brilliant as an individual song, but as an opener, it's key.<br />2. Hail Hail - Right after a mellow track... BOOM! A loud, fast rocker... Pearl Jam style. Relationship problems... in a slightly pop fashion, though still suitable for a hard rocker audience. It's awkward that it never took off as a big hit.<br />3. Who You Are - New drummer Jack Irons' jungle beats are incredible... when this was released to radio, it obviously received a big \\"Huh?\\" in response from the listeners. It's impossible to truly understand the history of the band without listening to this track.<br />4. In My Tree - Somewhat like a second, low key part of Who You Are, but stands on its own just as well. \\"Up here in my tree... newspapers matter not to me...\\"... it might have a political edge (ignoring the media), but that could be stretching it. Jack's drumming shines again.<br />5. Smile - No explanation; just lyrics. \\"Don't it make you smile? When the sun don't shine... it don't shine at all. Don't it make you smile?\\" ... \\"I miss you already... I miss you always...\\"... wow.<br />6. Off He Goes - An acoustic gem. The loss of a great friend... who returns... then leaves again. Longer than the usual Pearl Jam track, but that just adds to the quality. Eddie's soft and soothing vocals are simply amazing.<br />7. Habit - Probably an anti-drug song. Remember Spin the Black Circle? Similar, but slightly less faster and aggressive.<br />8. Red Mosquito - It's difficult to define its style, but it sounds out of this world... it's also a favorite of many fans. Parasitic... regrets... wow. It simply sucks you in.<br />9. Lukin - Matt Lukin. Short. Fast. Angry. ... Yetkinda funny.<br />10. Present Tense - Unlike Red Mosquito, in that it preaches NOT to regret the past... to keep on moving forward, no matter the consequence. \\"You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets or... you can come to terms and realize you're the only one who cannot forgive yourself... or...\\".<br />11. Mankind - Stone Gossard shocks us all, and steps up the microphone for a track. Seems desperate... but not in an aggressive way. Anti-assimilation... about thinking for oneself, and wondering why more don't.<br />12. I'm Open - Who knows? Remember Pry, To or Aye Davanita? It's somewhat like that, but it's very chilling...<br />13. Around the Bend - Often described as a lullaby... just as slow and soft as most of the album. \\"There's a sun around the bend...\\"... one must wonder if he's singing about the band's future (yes, that's stretching out a little), judging by how they've continued to shine on, despite their twists and turns.<br />Vitalogy sold 5 million units U.S... No Code sold 1. Why? A lot of Pearl Jam's original fans were into their angrier, catchier side... songs like Even Flow, Go, and even Spin the Black Circle. Of course, none of us are wrong... some of us prefer early Pearl Jam, others love their latter albums, and there're those of us who enjoy them all. Having made no videos since Ten, their record sales continued to decline... and this proved to be a 4 million unit drop, in just the U.S. alone. But how would they respond to this? A long hiatus? A return to Ten-style \\"grunge\\"? Or would they continue evolving? We would find out in just 2 years...
6305609705|2.0|This tiresome (153 minutes) film is loosely based upon one of the great long short short stories of all time, Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" Except for the fact that the protagonist in each is named Kurtz and mutters \\"The Horror, the Horror,\\" at the time of his death, there is otherwise little resemblance. The novel is a masterpiece of concise prose; this film is a wretched example of overindulgence.<br /><br />Those who share in Hollywood's professed hatred of war will probably find this film meaningful. Others, especially those with actual military experience should spend their time and money elsewhere.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Imagine this: it's the year 1994. Kurt Cobain shockingly (despite some hints in his music, it certainly wasn't enough) kills himself, and the \\"grunge\\" era is coming to a screeching halt... meanwhile, young music fans seem to be moving away from organized aggression and questioning political things, and are beginning to turn to (some would argue that the answer is Weezer and the Presidents of the United States of America, however) self-loathing and loud, sometimes random, violent angst... the rise of Korn being one sign of such. What's a band like Pearl Jam to do? Already taking a hit for being too liberal in their music, they took yet another step away from ultra-commercialism... they release their first artsy album... the first one of theirs that questions the realms of rock, and brings forth innovation. But the poppier hits do save it from being forgotten by the public...<br />1. Last Exit - Not too soft or loud, short or long, slow or fast... it's a slightly mellow mood-setter, though Pearl Jam would later become more so (mellower). Seems to be about a rebirth... or is it death? ... Both, in a way?<br />2. Spin The Black Circle - Remember Blood? It's a rocker, most likely about heroin use. Was it a reaction to Kurt Cobain's death? It's not proven either way.<br />3. Not For You - Quite philosophical... and perhaps egotistical (or maybe a reaction towards not being given basic needs?). It's vague, but that's its charm. Slow, with the classic Eddie growl. And as a whole... it is, indeed, classic.<br />4. Tremor Christ - This proved to be a sudden curveball for the Ten/Vs. fan... a listener who is used to fast ones, right down the center of the plate. The beginning sounds demand the listener to relax and listen to the lyrics, while paying close attention to an unfolding story. What the story truly is... depends on the individual.<br />5. Nothingman - Wow... this is beautiful. Like a rock ballad... lost love. Letting go... losing 'the one'. From the best of times...to the worst of times. The lyrics are as soft as bird feathers but cut like a knife through butter. A... beautiful Pearl Jam song? The listener is stunned.<br />6. Whipping - Hey, a fun, short, poppy tune! Going forward... ignoring pain... or wallowing in it? It's up to oneself to figure that out.<br />7. Pry, To - Pretty much just simple filler, though it keeps the slow, bittersweet emotion going. The Ten/Vs. fan either is intrigued or wants to put the album away and sell it the next day.<br />8. Corduroy - Somewhat like Whipping, in its entertaining pop style... but still has a message behind it. Almost opposite of a previous work Eddie was involved with... Temple of the Dog's Hunger Strike. But instead of stealing it... it's \\"I would rather starve than eat your bread\\". A popular hit.<br />9. Bugs - This is it! The traditional Pearl Jam fan turns the album off and shakes his head in sadness and maybe even depression, wondering what happened to what was one of his favorite bands. \\"I've got bugs/bugs in...\\" over and over again, accompanied by accordian. Then again... some of us like it. We're into the album so far, despite its differences.<br />10. Satan's Bed - Sarcastic humor, directed at... who knows? Saying much more would probably be a great way to get censored. Slightly louder, but not in a \\"grunge\\" anthem way. Angsty, yet kinda funny.<br />11. Better Man - One of Pearl Jam's several pop masterpieces, Better Man is all about staying in a relationship because the other partner is \\"the only one\\". A fun and friendly song, mixed in with a sing-along chorus... it was (and is) a radio smash. Somewhat odd that it's found on this album, eh?<br />12. Aye Davanita - More random but entertaining filler. Aye Davanita... Aye Davanita... Aye Davinita...<br />13. Immortality - \\"There's a trapdoor in the sun\\"... the words stick like helpless prey in a spiderweb. Some argue that this is the best closer (they refuse to acknowledge the existence of the next track, in claiming that this is the way the album ends) Pearl Jam has ever done, and maybe on ANY album... ever. Bitter, slow, with brilliantly-supporting guitarwork... but is it morbid? Up to the individual.<br />14. Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me - Minutes upon minutes of a child talking about how she likes to be spanked. ... No, I am NOT joking... plus it ends with some talk about suicide, ending an album that (might) begin with birth and end with death. ... Or maybe this is reading into it too deeply.<br />Vitalogy's brilliant song construction is one reason why a lot of Pearl Jam die-hards love it, but the mellow and strangly soothing atmosphere (plus the so-called \\"filler\\") is another. But for those in 1994, and 1995... they didn't know what to think. A lot of them sold off the album, bitterly disappointed that \\"one of their favorite bands betrayed them\\"... others respected their musical evolution but decided it simply wasn't for them. And yet others... stayed along for the ride, pledging their fellowship to the band, never letting go, as long as they existed. And this... brings us to No Code...
B00006J3WH|4.0|I am fortunate to be a fan of both Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and musical theater.  As such, I am rather impressed with \\"Once More with Feeling.\\"  OK, so it isn't going to get the West End or Broadway scampering for new jobs, but overall it is a fun CD listen to.<br />It is no surprise that Anthony Head delivers the best songs, and has the most capable voice of the Buffy cast.  He is a veteran of musical theater, and has sung on a few episodes of Buffy.  Amber Benson also does good duty, and those two sing quite a capable duet.<br />While there is a good job done fitting various song styles to the characters,  I found Spike's solo number to be a disappointment, as I have always seen him as a \\"70's British Punk\\" type of guy and not so much an \\"80's New Wave/Metal\\" vampire.  Perhaps the composer could not create an authentic punk song.<br />As a CD, it is probably not going to win any fans, but for people who are familiar with the episode it does a good job recreating the scenes and atmosphere of the series.
B00004T8RK|5.0|After the release of Yield, Pearl Jam most likely realized that they had a special fan group... one that would just about follow them to the end of the world, if that's what it meant to hear their music. The band apparently felt free to further evolve and express their deepest emotions musically... and, this time, they weren't happy, optimistic ones. The upcoming album was to be as mellow as the past few releases... but a lot more subtle. Also, replacing Jack Irons at drums was yet another genius of the kit, in ex-Soundgarden player Matt Cameron (a friend from the era). <br />1) Breakerfall - Take away Sometimes and perhaps Last Exit, and every Pearl Jam opener up until this point has been a \\"grunge\\"-esque rocker. ... This one is no exception. Like Why Go and Daughter, the topic is the abuse of female children. And \\"only love... will breakerfall\\".<br />2) Gods' Dice - The second track is also a rocker. All about fate, and taking chances... simple structure, but still not typical.<br />3) Evacuation - One of the least favorite tracks of a lot of die-hard fans, Evacuation has trouble making itself clear... it, like the two songs before it, is also more of a heavy-style rock track. It's one of those tunes that depends on personal interpretation.<br />4) Light Years - Perhaps the most beautiful track of PJ's since Nothingman, Light Years covers the same topic... lost love. \\"We were but stones... your light made us stars\\". Constant reminders of the loss of her... soft and subtle.<br />5) Nothing As It Seems - The first single off of Binaural, Nothing As It Seems continued the band's history of unpredictability. Like yelling from a mountain-top, but only hearing one's own echo... sound-wise, that is. About the dependance on and negative effects of drugs, but not in a Spin the Black Circle or Blood style way... it's soft, slow, and energetic... yet mellow.<br />6) Thin Air - Similar to Light Years, but happier... about successful, relationship love. But do the instrumentssuggest something not revealed by the lyrics?<br />7) Insignificance - What would a Pearl Jam album be without politics? Against widely-disastrous warfare, and questioning how so many feel free to drop bombs upon innocent people. What makes it different than Do the Evolution or a track on Vs. is that it has extremely desperate and angry feelings to it... it smacks war mongerers in the face, and refuses to back off.<br />8) Of the Girl - As the Amazon review said, it truly is Eastern sounding... also about relationship love, and also similar to Light Years... except with, as previously mentioned, the Eastern sound. A common favorite amongst fans, and it's easy to see why; the lyrics and vocals join together to dominate the soul.<br />9) Grievance - Back to politics! Questions blind allegiance to a country or way of life brought upon by politicians... as a lot of Pearl Jam's other songs do, it begs people to think for themselves, and not be told what to do. It even won a Grammy.<br />10) Rival - And MORE politics! About the Littleton, Colorado school shooting... it's extremely chilling, and smothers the listener with honesty. \\"How's our father supposed to be told?\\". So painful that it's tough to listen to.<br />11) Sleight of Hand - Questioning... questioning. Soul searching... soul searching. Why do we exist... and is there special reasoning for each and every one of us? Soft, slow, all the good things that Binaural's said to be... another fan favorite, and rightfully so.<br />12) Soon Forget - Ukelele! Would be comic relief, if the lyrics didn't have to deal with a rich man dying, and his money being worth nothing in the long run. Good stuff.<br />13) Parting Ways - Could be a relationship song... might just mean the title... Parting Ways. The lyrics, although perfectly supportive, aren't the biggest factor of the song; it's the way the extra instruments close the album like the end of a great symphony. Drifting away... drifting away......<br />The most complex andemotional Pearl Jam release to that point, the band continued its evolution with Binaural, taking their musicianship to the next level by putting their hearts into their instruments, lyrics, and vocals even more-so than they had ever done before... continuing Yield's accomplishments in a way, but going in another direction at the same time. They had nothing left to prove... but did they have anything left to give? In two more years...
B00005NP04|5.0|hey i can tell u concrete angel is the best song ever.I had a friend that died from being abused and it really hit hard to me, I hope it will u too!

B000002BYD|5.0|No Code, in many ways, was a \\"Yield\\" for Pearl Jam. They stopped being the commercial giants that they were used to being... and, finally, the lack of video creation caught up with them, and their faces slipped into history. However, judging by their follow-up record, Yield, it seems like they saw it coming... the peaceful, accepting nature of the majority of it is smooth and fascinating. With this, it seemed like Pearl Jam's reply to those who claimed they were no longer \\"grunge\\" Gods: they knew it, they wanted it, and they felt stronger than ever as musicians.<br />1. Brain of J. - A \\"grunge\\"-esque opener, in the fashion of Once and Go... proving to many doubters that Pearl Jam still could rock out with the best of them.<br />2. Faithfull - Perhaps sarcastically questioning blind faith, Faithfull follows the Vs.-style opener with something that could ALMOST fit onto Vitalogy or No Code... but the angst isn't there... it's soothing, somehow.<br />3. No Way - Much like Faithfull, in its mellow, sarcastic style... \\"I just need someone to be there for... me.\\"... \\"I'll stop trying to make a difference... no way\\". Brilliance in just a couple lines.<br />4. Given to Fly - Still soft, but with forceful vocals... Eddie narrates the lyrics in an old-fashioned Native American tale sort of way. Sounds like a folk legend... and once again proves Pearl Jam's unpredictability. Stunning.<br />5. Wishlist - A flat-out pop song... but still creative. \\"I wish I was...\\" again and again, softly describing love for another with undescribable sincerity, when the vocals and instruments are added to the lyrics. Also succeeded on the radio.<br />6. Pilate - \\"Like Pilate, I have a dog\\"... does anyone have ANY idea what it's about? Similar to Faithfull, it may be against blind loyalty or faith in something. What that something is, though... depends on the individual.<br />7. Do the Evolution - A huge hit, and the first video by Pearl Jam since Ten (Like Jeremy, dramatic and devastating but... as horrible as it is to say this... a little bit comical). Like a rawer version of Vs.'s rockers... political, and against racism and feeling superior to others. It received the success it deserve(s,d).<br />8. The Colour Red - What would a recent Pearl Jam album be without a short, crazy track? Here we go... thanks, Jack!<br />9. MFC - Like many other songs on the album... has a pleasant, pop feel to it. The lyrics float, one at a time... but they come together and form brilliance. Supposedly often coupled with a song called Untitled during Pearl Jam concerts.<br />10. Low Light - It's mellow, but you probably knew that before reading this. Could be another motivation tune... about continuing to push forward, even with the weight of the world on one's shoulders. Not performed very often by the band in concert, but it's beautiful.<br />11. In Hiding - Guess what? ... Yeah, you know: it's mellow! Soul searching... philosophy... sweet, sweet guitars. It's a shame that so many have missed out on this track.<br />12. Push Me Pull Me - Seems to be about evolution, and life and death. A slight amount of angst, but it's most likely more about personal revelation then that.<br />13. All Those Yesterdays - Haha! The PERFECT way to close the album (excluding the secret track); a soothing sing-along... it sounds like the guys from Pearl Jam sitting together drunk singing along (even if it's only Eddie's vocals, that feeling's there). More motivation... going forward... no wallowing in personal misery. If there ever was a Pearl Jam song that said \\"We're not just a 'grunge' band\\", this is it.<br />A soft, slow, peaceful work, with some brilliant rockers... Yield was (and is) about stopping personal violence and depression, and continuing to move forward... making the best of one's life, despite knowing limits and what's already happened in the past. Pearl Jam managed to conserve (... Not a smart word to describe the band, though... haha) their remaining audience with this one,while seeing the light of human existence and the world outside of angst. It would've been an appropriate way to end their time as a band... but they continued to push on, as many of the album's lyrics state we should all do. Art is not just entertainment... it's soul nourishment.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is best described as a beautiful blend of rap-metal and heartfelt sorrow; Amy Lee's vocals are an incredible asset to their overall sound, and their guitarists, Ben Moody and John LeCompt, help create that harsh, jagged sound that meshes well with Amy's otherworldly voice. Definitely worth the money.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Wow. That about sums this up. I enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets so much! I've watched it three times today. The best parts are the ones with Rupert. I love his expressions and reactions to the spiders, it made for a laugh out loud experience. However, as entertaining as this movie was, I found myself becoming extremely peeved at the fact that there was a lot left out. The Deathday Party for one. Secondly, there were so many discrepancies from the book that it wasn't funny. The wrong characters were saying the lines sometimes, pieces didn't fit at others, and some scenes were so backwards that I yelled at the screen. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but perhaps next time, paying more attention to the books might be in order? All in all, not a bad way to spend your money!! *grins*
B000077VPU|5.0|sorry, but i don't care that they edited G'n'R, metallica, and def leppard.  i bought this dvd because i'm a queen fan - that's who i want to see.  i don't want to sit through sets by those other bands because, well, they are kinda lame.  <br />as always, brian, roger, and john do a wonderful job with a bunch of singers who really illustrate how talented freddie was.  almost none of them even come close to Queen Mercury.  it's still a great show though.  <br />if you love queen, get this disc.  you'll be very happy that you did.
0684847817|5.0|I love this book so much i trasure it like it is gold. The art in it is trully magickal and enchanting. I love reading about the faeries and looking at the wonderful pictures, along with the '_faeires' oracle_' by Brian Froud and Jessica Macbeth. I remember spreading the oracle cards on my bed, and flipping the pages of the '_Good faeries, Bad Faeries_' and reading about them, before I sleep. <br />Inspiring and clever work. Must have.
0449227545|1.0|not follett at his best.  the idea is good but the book didn't develop well-would've liked a slower buildup to let me get into the characters and that would've helped me accept where the story was going - very creative; but got there too fast.
B00008CLOA|4.0|Sorry but forgot to mention something earlier. It seems like everyone keeps on saying how Dark Side is one big concept album that almost sounds like one long song with no breaks in between, and while I do admit the songs do tend to go together with seemingly no breaks in between them, I personally do not believe this is a concept album, not even close to being one. The Wall is most definitely one though because all of those songs do indeed come together to form the story from beginning to end, but Dark Side has no concept that I can see. It's just a collection of some really cool songs that don't really go together I think. Maybe because the heartbeat begins and ends the album people think it's a concept album, but concept albums tell a story, and what story does Dark Side tell? None that I can think of. It's a very good album with some cool songs in it, for sure, but please do not call it a concept album because it definitely is not. The Wall is the ultimate concept album and the only one of it's kind I have ever heard, but Dark Side is not!!!
0451163516|4.0|another follett win!  what a great story.  i highly recommend the book.  if you haven't read follett before, this is a good place to start and one of his better books.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Just wanted to say that in case it wasn't clear from my other two reviews that I truly do enjoy this album with just about all of the songs being great with very memorable lines and beats to them. From the words in Breathe to the great guitar and drums in Time to the funky beat of Money to the beautiful and then explosive parts of Us and Them to the wonderful Brain Damage and Eclipse that closes out this album, this is just a wonderful listening experience to enjoy. Buy this one immediately if you have not already, because though I still believe it is a tad overrated, I am now beginning to see more and more why it's been so popular all these decades. This is just one seriously catchy record!!! lol. I guess the only complaint I would have is that the remastering job just doesn't sound as good as some other newly remastered cd's I own. In my opinion the Elton John remasters of 1995 are far superior sound-wise, and even last years hybrid SACD disc of The Rolling Stones' Let It Bleed sounds far superior to this one, which frankly I don't understand since both of them are in the same format. But apparently the guys at Abkco knew how to remaster their discs the proper way in that specific format and that James Guthrie didn't. It still sounds good, don't get me wrong, and you can definitely tell that it was remastered since it's so much louder than non-remastered albums I own, but just don't expect to be blown away by the quality of the remaster, okay? Well in closing, I would definitely recommend you picking up this new 30th anniversary edition because Dark Side of the Moon is a really good album with cool sometimes thought-provoking lyrics and very catchy melodies with some great artwork and pictures in the packaging to boot. Thanks for bearing with me through all 3 parts to those who chose to do so. Goodbye.
0312954468|4.0|great book, have been reading the series - <BR>lent it out already a few times to friends and they all liked it.<BR>a great read worth the time.
B00005MP58|5.0|You will not be disappointed in this captivating film! This story is about Elizabeth Bennet, a sophisticated yet somewhat sassy character and Mark Darcy, a proud man that struggles with his love for Elizabeth and his social standing in society.You easily become wrapped up in this tale of love that stands the test of time.
0380733358|4.0|a good read, typical follet. some of the other books are better though (i highly suggest them.)
0800141660|4.0|This is another great film that has been adapted from the Jane Austen novel. All of the actors in this film do a wonderful job of recreating the characters on the screen. It is obvious that a lot of thought was given to the details in the book and how they are protrayed on the film.
0451207521|2.0|yawn, for me this book never took off...i kept waiting for the sparks to fly with the male lead and the female lead....not..i really like ken follet but his last few books were letdowns.  its like the story is there, and you are waiting to get to that next level with the character but it never comes.  flat.  its too bad because the story had a lot of potential, a great female lead and a good setting but he does nothing with it.  sorry ken!
0316666343|2.0|I found this book started out well, I was interested in the premise, plot and characters.  But about halfway through, I started to lose interest in the story.  It seemed to turn into a disjoint collection of observations on grief and death.  The story fell apart at the end with a very unbelievable plot element.  I am surprised that this book has been on the bestseller list as long as it has.
0449458628|3.0|again, this great creative idea for a story but the depth is lacking!!!!  enjoyable but light - nice for the plane, beach, but sorry, its not as good as some others: man from st. peters; key to rebecca etc.
B00000K19E|4.0|What people say about this movie is really misleading.  There is hardley any action in it untill the last half hour.  But.....<BR>the last half hour is GREAT.  I could watch it over and over and over again.  I would of gave this movie 3 stars, but I realized this movie was just an intoduction to great franchise.  I've seen the new trailor that came out around 4/11, and it was awsome.  The next two Matrix's may be some of the best movies of the decade.
0451204530|3.0|1 star for mr. follett and his creative juices coming up with the story<BR>another star for a fast paced novel that makes a good read on the plane<BR>and the last star for keeping me entertained<br />i withhold the last two stars: good but not great, and the other follet books are GREAT.  also, i felt it was flat, i really like the idea of the story, but never felt it.

630438551X|5.0|Beautiful.  This film makes Shakespeare accessible to the younger generation and features really exciting actors like John Leguizamo as Tybalt.  I love the way the roles have been interpreted, especially by the actors playing Mercutio and Tybalt.  Claire Danes is a fantastic, likeable Juliet who gains sympathy very well, and the direction from Baz Luhrmann makes it, in my view, a wonderful interpretation.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Brave New World, Maiden's 12th studio album is definetly one of their better albums, though not in the top three.Personally, I think Seventh Son, Piece of Mind, and Somewhere In Time are all better, just to name a few.Anyway, on to the album itself.I'll rate each song on a scale of 1 to 5.<br /> The Wicker Man- What a great song! An instant classic of theirs,my favorite one here. 5/5<BR> Ghost of the Navigator- Starts off pretty calmly,then explodes into another great, driving song. 5/5<BR> Brave New World- A much softer, very melodic song. Great vocals here! 4/5<BR> Blood Brothers- Like the aforementioned song, very melodic with great orchestration which makes the song more memorable. 4/5<BR> The Mercenary- A good change of pace with a much harder, faster song. Not one of the best, but good for a listen once in a while. 3/5<BR> Dream of Mirrors- This song has grown on me a lot in my past few listens. I don't really like the beginning, but it develops into a nice epic, though still not as great as ones they've done in the past such as Rime of The Ancient Mariner. Too repetitive,  many other songs here. 3.5/5<BR> Fallen Angel- Much like Mercenary, this is a short, hard song. Nothing that stands out. Again very repetitive. 3/5<BR> The Nomad- It puzzles me why so many other people think so highly of this song. I enjoy the beginning very much, but I think Bruce's vocal delivery isn't right for this song. Great Desert-like feel to it. 3.5/5<BR> Out of the Silent Planet- Great song. I really like the guitar playing here, as well as the chorus. 4.5/5<BR> The Thin Line Between Love and Hate- Very good song, but they could have made it a lot shorter, thus making it more listenable.After the final chorus, the song goes on too long. Great chorus! 4/5<BR> As you can see this album dosen't have many weak spots. There are few outstanding songs, but many are solid overall. Highly Recommended!
0060926317|5.0|I don't know what other reviewers expected from this book, but I found it fascinating.  It never occurred to me to question its veracity, because that seems to me to be beside the point.  What is does is simply underscore how deeply divided our Western culture is from that of indigenous peoples.  And it does so in a rather primitive fashion, both as a piece of literature and as an actual account.  What insights come from this story, whether fiction or nonfiction, are incredibly touching to those of us who see our culture as devoid of respect for nature, for spirituality, and for the worth of the individual.  In this sense, I believe it is a little diamond of a book, a chance discovery of adventure and perhaps a myth in the making about how we appear to those who came before us.
B000063COX|4.0|Though this was their first release and had a more raw, punkish feel to it, it can still hold its own against their later masterpieces. The high point on this album was Paul Dianno's voice. His vocal range on this album was tremendous, going from low growls in Iron Maiden to his soulful singing in Strange World. I liked him more on this album than in their follow-up Killers. Now I will review the actual songs.<br /> Prowler- A great opener! Very hard and very fast, with some pretty funny lyrics as well. The guitar part in the beginning is pretty cool. 5/5<BR> Sanctuary- My least favorite song, I found it kind of boring. Not bad, but there's better stuff here. 3/5<BR> Remember Tomorrow- Very melodic with great vocals. After each verse, ther's a heavy guitar part, which really makes this a balanced song, with both melody and Maiden's signature hardcore sound. Great song. 4.5/5<BR> Running Free- A cool, fun song to listen to. Vintage early Maiden. 4/5<BR> Phantom of the Opera- Their first real epic is a great one. I love the instrumental part in the middle, shows signs of things to come. This albums best offering. 5/5<BR> Translyvania- A really cool instrumental. I'm not a big fan of instrumentals, but this one and Metallica's Orion are real masterpieces. 4/5<BR> Strange World- This is where Paul's vocals really shine. A beautiful ballad with some nice solos thrown in. 4.5/5<BR> Charlotte the Harlot- Really cool guitar playing on this one, definetly the most punk influenced song here. 4/5<BR> Iron Maiden- Pretty cool song, pretty simplistic though. The best chorus ever! 3.5/5<br /> This is probably not Maiden's best offering, but it is one of the best debut albums of all-time and will be playing in my CD player for a long,long time. Highly Recommended.
B00005JKED|3.0|I saw this movie in theaters, it wasn't that great. i still don't say that i liked it even after the awards it won. The best scene is when denzel gets shot by the russian mafia. that scene is worth 3 stars.
B000002VBY|4.0|Krokus is, surprisingly, a pretty obscure band that never really got the recognition it deserved. There are many classic metal songs on here such as Headhunter, Screaming in the Night, and Eat the Rich. This album should be known by all people who think they know metal.
B00008H2LB|5.0|To tell you the truth I'm not a total rock fan but, when I heard linkin parks In The End I loved it,but never heard the whole album.So I thought I give their album meteora a try. I heard the first couple of songs and liked them. Soon I chould not stop listening to the album. I never heard the hybrid theroy, so I can't compare it to this one. One thing for sure that I'm a fan of linkin park now. I recommend you get this album if your new to the band or a fan. It's worth it and not disappointing.

6302859204|3.0|The Travis Walton case remains one of he most popular in the folklore of alien abduction stories. I think the mere fact a movie was actually produced about it proves it's resonance. But, alas, the movie almost works if not for two main problems: It has too much of a vague, quick pace and it is not even accurate as according to Walton's description of the abduction experience in the book. The movie as a movie isn't too bad, there's some good acting, and some story elements which might seem clich don't seem too out of place here. The best scenes involve the encounter with the UFO and the frightening experience within. These are, one must admit, some of the most realistic scenes of supposed alien abduction ever made. They are indeed intense and scary, making one wish he/she never gets abducted by aliens (even if you don't believe in them). However, the fault for someone who already is familiar with the Walton case is that these scenes both disappoint and effect. They affect because they are realistic, but they disappoint because they never resemble for a second what Walton describes in his book. In it he writes about the aliens looking like humans and giving him a tour of the ship etc. etc., pretty nice and hospitable extraterrestrials, but in the film they are small, hairless beings who treat Walton like helpless cattle and force him to go through a horrible exeprience involving medical experiments. What's the deal? Does the movie want to entertain us or make us believe? The movie as a whole successes in keeping the viewer wondering, especially in the scenes where Walton is still missing and everyone theorizes where he has gone. The ending is too quick and answers nothing, a few more minutes and we might have at least gotten information on Walton writing the book and going back to a normal workday. But alas, this is all we get, it works, but deserves a little more.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Every Grammy Norah Jones recieved for this album was won hands down. Never have I enjoyed a collection of songs on one CD as I have with this.The writing, music, and lyrics put one into  another dimension. It is a rare thing when an artist can produce a collection such as this. Any of my friends who have heard this CD when driving in my car goes out to purchace it the same day or next day after hearing it. Norah Jones is just plain magnificant in each and every piece.There is not one cut for which I do not care for.Hopefully her next work will be as wonderful.
0783226063|4.0|The TV version which Lynch disowned was LONGER, not shorter than the theatrical release, with much footage from the original five hour rough cut. For instance, instead of Irulan's opening prologue we get a much longer intro from an old man (don't know who). There are also scenes involving Gurney playing music, and scenes with Gurney and the Duke, plus the (disgusting)scene which details the distillation of the water of life. The footage was often badly acted and added nothing to the film, reportedly, and hence Lynch disowned it with the classic 'Alan Smithee' pseudonym.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Sometimes called their greatest record ever, 'Let It Bleed' was recorded during Brian Jones' final months as a Rolling Stone, although he only plays on two tracks. It is also marks the debut of Jones' replacement, Mick Taylor, who, ironically, also plays on two tracks. The recording sessions for the album took place over a year. Here is the complete session data for the album :<br />March to June 1968, Olympic Studios :<br />..................Midnight Rambler<br />..................You Got The Silver<br />..................You Can't Always Get What You Want<br />June to July 1969, Olympic Studios :<br />..................Let It Bleed<br />..................Love In Vain<br />..................Monkey Man<br />October to November 1969, Electra Studios :<br />..................Gimme Shelter<br />..................Live With Me<br />..................Country Honk<br />This album yielded several of the band's most popular classics, including 'Gimme Shelter', 'Midnight Rambler', and of course, its bittersweet closer, 'You Can't Always Get What You Want', a song whose effect and message were sealed when it was used in the funeral scene in 'The Big Chill'. Brian Jones makes two cameo appearances on the album. First, he contributes percussion to 'Midnight Rambler'. Then he plays some lovely autoharp on Keith's touching 'You Got The Silver'. 'Country Honk' is an interesting countrified version of 'Honky Tonk Women'. Byron Berline overdubbed his fiddle part in a parking lot, so that's why you hear the sounds of a car horn.<br />'Let It Bleed is a really great album. It deserves recognition as one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Director Kevin Smith (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) made a new movie in 1999 after CA and before JASBSB. It was a religious drama, WITH JAY AND SILENT BOB!!?? You ask yourslef, how can it be a drama with 2 stoners with nothing better to do than hang out by the Quickstop in Leonardo, NJ? It was a dramedy, I guess. With stars like Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and many more, Dogma is an all-star movie with an all-star cast. In a small town in Illinios, Bethany Sloan (Fiorentino) is given a task by an angel (Alan Rickman) to stop Bartleby (Affleck) and Loki (Damon) from entering the doors of a church in Asbury Park, NJ. If they do, God (Alanis Morrisette) will be proven wrong and the end of existance (The Apocolypse) will come. To help Bethany, two profits, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), and an apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock) are sent. But in her way stands Azrael (Jason Lee), a former muse, and three of his henchmen. Also in the gang to stop evil is a muse (Selma Hayek) who they find at a strip club. If you haven't already seen Dogma, see it. I also recommend any of the other NJ Series movies. A warning though, if you haven't seen Clerks, Mallrats, or Chasing Amy yet, then wait to see the last installment, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Good day, and see you at the movies.
0767805712|5.0|Having been told by several friends of the great handling of the theme purported by this film, I finally got to watch it in its entirety on the tele just this evening. I must say that the praises lavished were truly deserved & I would no doubt be getting the DVD as well.<br />I think on first viewing, the film actually hit me more on an emotional level than intellectual, especially at the very end when the protagonist Vincent finally achieves what he had set out to do, despite pre-determinations to the contrary. It does inspire and also makes you think about the possible alternate future that we may have in the 'segmentation' of humans or the self-created rationale for further discrimination (as if we haven't already got enough of that in our time).<br />The descent of Jude Law's character was supposedly meant to show that no matter how talented a person is (genetically determined or otherwise) it doesn't matter so long as the heart & mind are not there; that it's coupled with a sense of destiny or vision that drives the person toward his desired goal.<br />A great film that deserves repeated viewing, especially for the superb acting by all involved.

B00005CDNK|4.0|The Visitors was Abba's final and yet most reflective album.By then all four members had come full circle with their personal and professional lives, and were ready to call it a day.The songs somehow had more depth and emotion than ever before.Starting off with the title cut which features a helpless Frida dealing with paranoia and alienation from society sums up the basic theme of the album.A heavy synthpop beat(very '80s),makes this a most unusual Abba dance track.It's actually very sinister too.Head Over Heels and When All Is Said And Done were both singles,but only marginal hits(an indication that Abba had passed their time).Both songs featured a triumphant performance by it's two female singers,again dealing with regret and envy.One Of Us was the only major single release that became a sizeable hit in most countries with an equally  interesting video, featuring Agnetha living by herself and fixing up her flat, indicating that she wanted out.I Let The Music Speak is beautifully theatrical,while Slipping Through My Fingers deals with family life and responsibilities.The album closer Like An Angel Passing Through My Room is sweet but haunting featuring  one of Frida's best vocal performances .After a first listen the songs will not be as memorable as past hits.But give it a few listens and this album will grow on you, as how different and mature it sounds.A gem for sure!
B00005YW4H|5.0|...as he excitedly came in the house with this fabulous CD!  My hubby couldn't believe, when he heard the lyrics of N. Jones, that I hadn't written them!  &quot;Reminds me so much of your writing style&quot;...he's still grinning!  Beautifully done, sweet, rich voice and mellow background music...hauntingly beautiful and simple songs of life...
B000068QY7|1.0|If the Gallagher brothers are going to punch anybody these days, it ought to be themselves.  Good and hard.  Right in their upturned noses.  &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; is yet another low for this band of Beatles bandits, which is pretty shocking considering how far they've already fallen.  For a very, very brief time, Oasis was fresh and exciting.  But you'd never know it from these half-baked songs.  Even &quot;Hindu Times,&quot; which the hardcore fans are clinging to as a sign of life, is just a shadow of the band in its prime, which, even then, was but a shadow of much, much better groups -- the music came from the Beatles, the swagger from the Stones.  Most surprisingly, the ballads -- which, for the blink of an eye, made Oasis stars in the States -- are pale and without personality.  Without a doubt, this is the one of the weakest &quot;comeback&quot; albums ever made.
B00006L83N|5.0|If you read the title of my review I think its enough to know what this album is all about, perfection by all means....
0671027387|4.0|This has all the ingredients of a techno-thriller: Exotic locations, credible advanced-technology, and an intriguing premise. However, as you get into the story, you find yourself immersed in debunking a modern legend (albeit, a very hi-tech and intriguing legend).<br />The NASA PODS satellite has detected an anomally on the Arctic ice pack. A top SECRET NASA team goes north to investigate and they discover something extraordinary (it would be a spoiler to tell you what). Oddly enough, a 3 man special forces team is keeping what over the NASA nerds and things aren't quite right.<br />Overlaying this story is a cut-throat political drama played out between an embattled president and a power hungry Senator who wants to be the next president. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep you guessing. Occaisionally, I found myself stopping to consider whether the plot twists made sense. Upon reflection, I could accept them.<br />The writing is tight and compelling. There is an interesting underlying debate as to the privatization of space exploration and the balance between security and information dissemination vis-a-vis NASA and the intelligence community.<br />Like all whodunits, the plot drives the action rather than the characters. Most of these character types you've seen before in other tales. There aren't many people in this book to cheer for. Most of them have something to hide or are maddeningly 1 dimensional.<br />A quick read, interesting premise and lots of good research.<br />Douglas De Bono<br />Author of ROGUE STATE
B000053GTK|5.0|In a Glass House is a superb work of progressive rock recorded in 1973 that is complex in the traditional Gentle Giant way, yet is neither overbearing nor irritating.  They achieve this through the use of subdued and warm tones, e.g. mini-moog, acoustic instruments, clean guitar etc, and yes space.  Specifically, whereas the pieces on Octopus (also 1973) seemed to have notes crammed in every crack, In a Glass House allows for room in each composition through a simple process of subtraction.  In addition to this, space is also intimated by including very quiet and compositionally simple passages in amongst the more complicated, and shall we say, spasmodic segments.  In addition to the trademark Gentle Giant complexity, the references to medieval music are here (Experience), in addition to some nice songs (An Inmates Lullaby and A Reunion).  The bonus live versions of The Runaway/Experience and In a Glass House are excellent and the recording quality is superb.  The playing on In a Glass House is of course brilliant, and the skill with which the songs are arranged is without peer.  Highly recommended in addition to Acquiring the Taste (1971), the Power and the Glory (1974), and Free Hand (1975).
B00005JLD2|3.0|This 98 minute film seems to be over in less than 60.  Phillip Noyce does a wonderful job of capturing <BR>the Australian desert country and gets superb performances from his three young  'stars'.  It is not solely for the 'bleeding heart club' who of course will dote on it but seems to me to be an honest attempt at portraying cultural misunderstanding and the determination of the individual to choose what is meaningful for themselves.  The aboriginal girls win this round in Noyce's account & the footage of the actual protagonists to end the film  leave the impression that I believe Noyce wants to achieve. <BR>        <BR>       Before one scorns what appears to be the abyssmal ignorance of the white interlopers into Australian culture, the almost successful genocide perpertrated in the Americas should be thoroughly considered and digested.  Tne mistakes made in <BR>Australia were not based on greed and hatred but on an arrogance that is universal.<BR>           This is an honest film which hopefully will linger and enlighten.

0060012218|3.0|Brent Hartinger's 'Geography Club' is an affectionately wrought novel about a boy named Russel and some of his friends who are all trying to cope with their sexuality. The book is told well with Russel as the main character in first person point of view, and it is easy to sympathize with him as his character develops throughout the story. As a gay teen myself, I can appreciate Russel's feelings and thoughts and can tell that Hartinger is heartfelt in his writing. However, the book left something to be desired.<br />Throughout the story we share all of Russel's thoughts as he responds to the words and actions of his friends and peer group. But I found myself really wondering how Russel felt at certain points, when the action seemed to overtake and overshadow what I felt were important developments in Russel's mindset. In all the 240 pages, it was only a few times that I felt I understood exactly what he was going through emotionally. I also felt that some of his reactions to different events, and some of the actions that he took, were unrealistic, as were some of the basic elements of high school and high school friendships. I am a modern day gay teen who lives through the modern day drama that is high school, and if this novel was supposed to remind me of my own experiences then it missed its mark completely.<br />I gave it a three star rating because even though it has its faults and I couldn't really connect with it all that much, I found the overall story still held my attention and kept me turning the pages. This novel might be better suited for those among us who don't really know what it means to be a gay high-schooler, and those who would prefer a shorter read over a little more depth and character development.
B00006GFAB|1.0|First of all, i LOVE this CD. I LOVE Kiss. I mean all of the songs on here simply RULE! But why ONE star? Because of the marketing ... Gene Simmons. No longer is he the demonic and charismatic i once looked up too, now he is just a greedy double chinned loser. Ace Frehley is an example of a musician with a heart. That dude man, he wails on his guitar because he LIKES to. He does what he loves, and thats music. I am getting the feeling that Gene Simmons does what he loves, money. He doesnt do it for the fans or \\"by to people for the people\\". this CD was all intentional a corprate CD, sold ONLY for money, and had nothing to do with them having a good time in the studio doing what they love. KISS is a great band, i own every CD - they are my FAVORITE. all the memebers are swell guys, except gene. Man why cant an old school rock and roll fan get some decent deals around here?.....
B00008I8IF|4.0|The post Olson Jayhawks continue in their fine musical wxploration by creating a fine folk/pop record. Lyrically, it is not as indepth as Sound of Lies, but better than the substandard Smile. Sonically, the music is mellow with hooks that come out and grab you at just the right and sometimes unexpected time. TRy to find the limited edition version with the EP disc of six additional songs/outtakes/live versions. Not just for the collector only, but also for the casual fan. And, even though the Olson led Jayhawks made great cd's, I think it is the other way around, the Jayhawks have continued on and Olson has gotten stuck in a rut (a good rut, but a rut nonetheless!) Get the disc.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Yes, that's right. DO NOT buy any other movie in the Superman Saga besides this one.<br />Why?<br />Because it's the only one that actually takes full advantage of DVD's higher image quality. <br />For those of you who still haven't seen this film even 25 years after its original theatrical run, it's a very simple story. Superman (or Kal-El) is the last survivor of the planet Krypton, sent to Earth to help us with our problems--renegade nuclear missiles, evil geniuses and muggers.<br />If you have owned any copy of the film previous to this release, you will be amazed. Completely remastered for a theatrical release that never took place, it sounds and looks even better than it did in 1978.<br />Even more interesting is the audio commentary featuring director Richard Donner and Creative Consultant (a Salkind euphemism for screenwriter) Tom Mankiewicz, as well as two making-of featurettes which finally reveal more about the tensions between Donner and the Salkinds which resulted in his firing from \\"Superman II\\"--which took Mankiewicz, Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman and composer John Williams with him, and almost scuttled the project when Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder threatened to quit as well.<br />In short, don't waste your money on the other three DVDs in the saga; this is the only one worth owning.<br />BTW, in \\"Superman II,\\" most of Donner's footage was reshot, but all of his work with Gene Hackman (shot from the front; all back shots were done by Richard Lester with a double) remains.
0385504209|4.0|This is a truly intriguing book.  Hard to put down.  But...it gets a little bogged down in Disney (?).  I have always believed the Church was hiding a great deal when it came to women.  Now I know they have.
B00006YXE4|5.0|If you even like one Clapton song, get this DVD.  The CD is great too, but the DVD is fantastic.  If you have ever picked up a guitar and found out what it is to play even the simple cords, this DVD will blow your mind.  Clapton, must have a gift direct from God to be able to make the sounds he does with the guitar.<br />But wait, that isn't all Nathan East, Billy Preston and Dave Sancious are all out there, every one of the musicians are front cabin and will thrill you.  Billy Preston was &quot;Seargeant Pepper&quot; with the Beatles and he does a fantastic version of &quot;Will it Go Round in Circles&quot; and it does.<br />You will love it.
B000002L7Y|4.0|This and the follow-up,Scoundrel Days,are as close to perfect pop as is humanly possible.Although Scoundrel Days edges it for me,this is still a tremendous LP and if you have one then you must have the other - they go hand in hand.Stay on these Roads,the third album is also a necessity.After that,the goalposts moved and the band took-on a totally different sound.You may like it but it's not to be confused with the first three LP's - BUY THEM!!!

0345448898|2.0|These look like children's books, but I'd burn it before I'd let a child read it.  Well told ...but where Harry Potter teachs about loyalty and bravery, here the message is that your mother may be a murderer, and you'd better not trust anyone.... Sad.
B00006LPER|1.0|Despite the praise heaped on this movie, it is awful. The acting that is so ballyhooed involves lots of tense, pursed lip movements, shot in long stills with a piano playing in the background. The piano playing is really irrelevant to the plot (though of course the movie pretends otherwise). There is a lot of sick violence towards the viewer, in the form of unnecessary and crass depications of supposedly shocking and or titillating sick violence. It's a poorly conceived story bolstered by unconvincing and cheaply theatrical psychology.<br />This is the sort of movie that shows rather than reveals. In one of the most pretentious scenes, the main character assaults her mother, with whom she shares a bed, in an almost sexual way, and this is supposed to symbolize some emotional cataclysm that is otherwise undeveloped in the movie. The central love story is thrown at the viewer, and the sources of the central character's depraved violence against self and others are suggested only in an incoherent way. <br />This movie exemplifies what happens when a weak director tackles a complicated subject. This is not a character study, as some claim, as the main character is nothing more interesting than a fastidious and vicious psychopath. The male lead is a handsome but unexpressive face, who does an alright job of playing an obnoxious violent man hiding beneath a veneer of culture (this role might have had some interest, had it been developed). <br />It's depressing that so many people liked this pathetic movie. `Natural Born Killers' was a better movie.
B00006LLOG|1.0|This record stinks to high-heaven. <br />First of all, it's not very good. There's a little bit of guitar on the first cut. Mick Ronson must have died somewhere later.  Promising, but never fulfilled ... and yeah, I realy like Lou Reed. <br />The only redeeming feature is his reference to the colored girls in the chorous of \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\". <br />This record goes in my trash bin.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a truely amazing book, by a truly amazing author. This book is fast paced, entertaining, and fascinating. Ender is perhaps one of the most likable characters in all of science fiction, and he is very well rounded and believable. All of the supporting characters in the cast are also believable enough that, by the end of book, you feel as if you know them all. Card's very believable (and completely original) look at training for space warfare, and fighting an enemy you don't understand, make this book stand out far above most of the sci-fi universe.
B00004Z459|1.0|back in 2002 i got this and for the last 3 years it has been my favorite cd. lincoln parks best single on this one is somewhere i  belong. the cool thing about this one is that you get the 3 bonus tracks, \\"crawling\\" and \\"at the end\\". even though this one is good, it doesnt compare to their 1999 classic, metora. another great single on this one is paperclip, it is cool in the part where mike goes, i want to heal, i want to feel like im close to somthing real. this is the best cd iv gotten after my brain surgery, and i think that linkin park is just a cheap rip off of lincoln park, even their name sounds the same!
0441172717|4.0|It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest feats in science fiction. Frank Herbert created one of the most detailed, most fascinating worlds in the history of SF. He didn't only create of single world, but an entire intergalactic empire, of which the world of Arakis (Dune) is the lynchpin.<br />The characters are well rounded, with even minor characters having believable motives and some with histories that are obviously well thought out and full understood by the author even if he only hints at them within the book. <br />Dune is a massive tome, but it takes that many pages to tell the epic tale that Herbert has set out upon. Definitely not to be missed. The only reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of five were (1) The books that follow are actually better than the first and (2) Herbert's foreshadowing is a little heavy handed...at times he tells us EXACTLY what will dozens of pages before it does.
B00006F7S4|5.0|The first time you listen to this album it comes as a suprise...  Unusual for beck to be playing such downtrodden music.  Each time you listen to the album, it gets better and better!  I must have listened to the entire album at least 45 times now, it's his best since Mutations.  Congratulations, Beck, you never fail to amaze me!  I'm looking forward to the next 'odelay,' produced with Beck's further developed musical maturity.
B000009QOC|5.0|in my opinion this is the best album that glenn released since he went solo. there are a good number of slow songs, but are made up by the faster paced tracks. the guitar work is great with john christ,but don't pick up his solo album, the lyrics are pretty stupid or atleast i think they are...guess i'm just an old fashion horror punk
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie rocked!!! Absolutely the best movie of the year! Don't be surprised if you come out of the theater singing and dancing!<br />...
B000084T18|5.0|This cd is off the hook. i love many men wish death and dont push me. all the songs on here will get you wanting more from 50 cent. In my oppinion 50 cent has done better, how can that be, check out, \\"Power of the Dollar\\" that cd is bomb as hell. this cd is a must and a true classic for any rap fan, and eminem once again does some appearances and makes his presence noticed
B0000399WI|5.0|Let me make this clear: The Shawshank Redemption is not one of my favorite movies. It is purely the very best I've ever seen-though I've never seen THE GODFATHER. I may have been only five in 1994, but now being a movie critic, I can say that some of the very best films have been in 1994-Little Women, Legends of the Fall(one of my favorites), Forrest Gump, and of course, The Shawshank Redemption. I got this movie only because my dad was recovering from hernia surgery, and because it was on his girlfriend's &quot;Must-See Movie List&quot;. I watched it only because the other two I got I'd already seen and because my dad was busy watching Schindler's List. So I watched The Shawshank Redemption, and I was blown away. Every inch of this film is pure magic. Many critics complained about it that it was too long, but I honestly didn't think that it was long enough. It got seven nominations at the Oscars but failed to win any-it mainly lost out to Forrest Gump. I honestly thought that the Shawshank Redemption was the very best of all the nominated best picture films in '94-but I haven't seen PULP FICTION yet. Although Morgan Freeman was teriffic, Tom Hanks absoloutly shined in the title role in Forrest Gump. The cinematography was also wonderful, but I can definatly see why the Academy picked LEGENDS OF THE FALL. But what about Tim Robbins? He was the core of the whole movie, and not even a Golden Globe? For me, this film is a role model to other film makers. It is also my favorite Frank Darabont film, before THE MAJESTIC and THE GREEN MILE. Just take my advise, or anyone else's advise-see this film, because I can guarantee that you will not regret it.
B00008H2LE|5.0|ok linkin park can never top hybrid theory but they came pretty dang close on this. I like how they tried some new things on this cd, but yet still keep the same LP sound. easier to run and numb kind of represent in the end, a lot of their songs on here kind of remind me on Hybrid theory songs. this is a must for any rock fan, get this with the special DVD and it gets even better
B00005QZ7U|5.0|...I watched. And I LOVED IT! By the end I was crying my eyes out. And NO, it's not a sex movie. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor both deliver raw, spectacular performances as two lovers caught in bohemian part of Paris in the turn of the century. It's your basic love triangle that's sort of like Romeo+Juliet-She's a courtesan who loves a poor poet, and she's been promised to a very jealous Duke. Come to think of it, it's exactly like Shakespeare In Love. But the writing is purely wild and imaginative. This film got 8 Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Nicole Kidman, being in Hollywood for almost a decade now, got her very first and well-recieved nomination for Best Actress. But what about Baz? No one else could have done this film better than him. And the spell-binding script? Okay, so maybe it borrowed from other movies, but still. And DON'T GET ME WRONG, A BEAUTIFUL MIND was a beautiful movie, especially Russel and Jennifer, but MOULIN ROUGE was so much more wild and imaginative. Plus, it kicked the door down for CHICAGO...And remember to take anybody's advise-just when you think that it's about to get boring, just wait! The second half gets better. Just sit down, pop this movie in your DVD player or VCR, and be prepared to be blown away with music, poetry and love.
0385720920|3.0|I had high expectations for this book after reading and seeing Fight Club.  It has a great twist in the end, but between the pages the story seemed drawn out and I eventually became bored of the stories on masturbation and sex.  It wasn't a waste of time, but I probably won't read it again.
B000006045|5.0|Year after year of the same music, artists copying of one another, some artists try changing their taste for music. But there's one group that outstands them all. The group is called &quot;Massive Attack&quot;. Massive Attack is a Trip Hop group that has been around for years. The Mezzanine era ranges from deep Trip Hop &quot;Risingson&quot;, to classical, jazzy, trip hop &quot;Teardrop&quot;.<BR>The album contains 11 tracks, one bonus on the Japanese Edition. The top hit singles were &quot;Risingson&quot;, &quot;Teardrop&quot; &quot;Inertia Creeps&quot;, and &quot;Angel&quot;. This tpe of music is good for strolling in your car driving, or in a dim sun room with your shades on drinking and talking with friends. <br />Introducing this album in 1998, it seems that the 90s were only for pop artists such as &quot;Madonna&quot;, &quot;Janet Jackson&quot; and &quot;Britney Spears&quot;. Massive Attack broke the ring of the pop, making Trip Hop the best, outstanding from every other genre there is.<BR>That's why I believe why Massive Attack, and Trip Hop is so popular today. So from reading this review, I HIGHLY suggest you purchase the Mezzanine album. If you are a TRUE fan of Massive Attack, buy the Japanese Edition. It's worth the extra money.
B00008GKEG|5.0|A Beatle fans dream come true. I'd give it a box of stars if I could. The reissue is fantastic, the extra disc splendid, but my favorite Anthology moment will never change - I'm Down at Shea Stadium. That, my friends, is what The Beatles were all about. I dare you to find such footage of any other band. So many other complete performances that are also wonderful - I Saw Her in Washington 1964 - I Am The Walrus from MMT - The Long and Winding Road - the list goes on. If you love the Beatles - treat yourself - if you know someone who loves them - don't let them go on without owning this fantastic gift from Apple. Don't wait for a birthday or Christmas. In this world - you'd better get it for them right away. They deserve it. We all do.
0064471837|5.0|This book rocks, it's a great fantasy novel with a good amount of action, fantasy, romance, I loved it, I couldn't stop reading it, it has believable characters and a great storyline plus there are 2 more books in this trilogy though the next two mostly follow Sabriel's children which is kind of dissapointing but they are good books, Lirael and the third book Abhorsen.
B000067CPX|3.0|I respect the chili peppers attempting to change their sound, and after 20 years of existence, it's about time.  But this album, while very appealing to me at first, is just too watered down for my tastes.  The top three tracks are \\"Tear,\\" \\"Can't Stop,\\" and \\"By the Way.\\"
B0000844MP|5.0|Everyone else is reviewing the movie itself, so I'll review the Superbit DVD.  In the past, whenever I had a collecter's version (with plenty of extras) versus say a DTS version (without the extras) I would choose the extras.  In movies such as Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan I chose the collectors versions.  I found over  time that I stop watching the extras and just watch the movies over and over.  SO, Legends of the Fall offers a great collector's version at half the price of the superbit version.  So, why get the superbit?  WEll, this is a BIG movie.  The crispness of the picture and sound are stunning.  I have over 50 DVDs and this one is right at the top with sound quality and picture quality.  The separation of the surround sound in the dts is fantastic.  A door opening, a dog howling in the distance, the battle sequence, the wind, and James Horner's music will be as clean and true as you can imagine.  The quality of John Toll's amazing cinematography is a visual jewel.  From the definition in the color of the faces to the divine imagery of the natural setting,  you won't be disappointed.  This film is as beautifully photographed as any I have ever seen.  Now, is it worth double the cost of the loaded collector's edition?  I don't know, but I bought the Superbit version and I couldn't be more pleased.  The Superbit offers none of the extras that are in the collector's edition, just a breathtaking version of a gorgeous film.  I kept finding myself thinking.. wow that's beautiful.  This is a very emotional, moving film that the super-definition of sound and picture enhances into quite an experience.
B0000399WI|5.0|I don't rate many movies as 5 stars, maybe 3 or 4 total, so a 5 star rating from me means the movie is awesome.<br />This is the best movie adaptation of any of Stephen King's books.  The story is awesome, timeless, and will definitely touch anyone's heart. <br />If you want a movie with a good story, get this one.  Don't expect lots of special effects and high tech wizardry, but do expect a wonderful story that you will remeber.
0195145925|5.0|Does time really exist?  What if time were actually an illusion?  If time did not really exist them quantum physics and classical physics could be united into a unified theory.  On the other hand, if time does not exist then what are we to make of theories such as a space-time continuum?  In this text Julian Barbour clearly analyses the concept of time and puts forth the current evidence for its non-existence.  The arguments are compelling, the logic strong, and the results convincing - or at least it is convincing enough to consider it as a real possibility.  Julian Barbour is a theoretical physicist who takes this complex and counter-intuitive concept and puts it forth in layman's terms.  This is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in theoretical physics and how it is changing our view of our world.  &quot;The End of Time&quot; is sure to become an authoritative reference for any discussion on the existence of time.
B00006M183|5.0|Although not as experimental as classics like Vitalogy and NO CODE  this record is not as straight forward as Yield or as commercial as Ten and Vs.  This cd has some of my favourite Pearl Jam songs ever, like      \\" You Are\\", were Mr. Vedder sings \\"Loves is a Tower and you are the KEY\\".  It is a very sexy, dark and futurisc sounding song, it is without a doubt one of the sexiest songs ever.  The album opens with a beautiful accoustic ballad called \\" Cant Keep\\" which to me is about keeping yourself away from the world and is corruptive ways \\"Like an ocean in disguise\\".  \\"Ghost\\" and \\"Get right\\" are more straight ahead rock songs that would surprise those who like classic rock n' roll, Mike Mcready's guitar work through this songs and the rest of the album is better than ever, solo's galore!  The band sound tighter and heavier than ever thanks to drummer Matt cameron (soundgarden), what a difference a drummer makes right.  Eddie Vedder's voice is deeper (and also higher) than ever and the meaning to his lyrics are now a bit more obvious than the more metaphorically  and hard to decipher lyrics from no code and binaural.  The album ends with a beautiful delicious almost waltzy song called \\"All or None\\".   My advice is this: If you have a commercial taste than avoid this one, however if you like classic rock and have a bit more of an underground taste you will love this cd.  It is raw, beautiful, honest, smart, there's integrity all over, there is soft and hard and everything in between. I am a very happy costumer/fan.  ; )
B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down<br />Based on Mark Bowden's 1999 best selling nonfiction book, Black Hawk Down is a gritty, sometimes harrowing account of the bloody firefight between 150 Army Rangers and Delta Force commandos against literally thousands of Somali militia members in the streets of Mogadishu.<br />Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (The Rock, Top Gun) and director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator), working from an adapted screenplay Ken Nolan, vividly recreate the confusion and violence of modern urban warfare in stark, often very graphic detail rivaled perhaps only by Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. It is, after all, a depiction of what was, until the current conflict in Iraq, the most sustained and bloody firefight in U.S. Army history since the Vietnam War.<br />Like Bowden's book of the same name, Black Hawk Down focuses on the events of October 3, 1993, when a combined force of Army Rangers and Delta Force operatives were sent into a hostile section of Mogadishu, Somalia. Their mission, to capture two of warlord Mohammad Farah Aidid's top lieutenants in an attempt to weaken Aidid's grip on the war-torn capital.<br />Whereas the book gives a great deal of information about Somalia's post-1991 civil war, the famine that resulted from the strife between rival clans (of which Aidid's was the most dominant), and the (first) Bush Administration's intervention in the form of Operation Restore Hope, the film does this in graphic shorthand with a series of \\"cards\\" summarizing what led to the events of October 3, 1993 and with several fictionalized events which serve to introduce some of the main characters which the movie will follow throughout its 144 minutes of running time.<br />Obviously, a movie that is based on the experiences of 150 or so soldiers on one side and thousands of Somalis on the other can't tell the entire story in two hours and 24 minutes. Scott and Nolan were forced to use composite characters (Ewan McGregor's \\"Staff Sergeant Grimes\\" is one such composite, based in part on Johnny Stebbins, described in Bowden's book as \\"the [Ranger] company's chief coffee maker.\\") and several fictional incidents (a horrible depiction of Aidid's militia stealing food from a Red Cross distribution center and the arrest of a \\"Mr. Atto,\\" whose cinematic purpose is to explain Aidid's motivations to viewers, most of whom have no idea why we were in Somalia in the first place: \\"This is civil war. This is our war,\\" says Atto to Major General William Garrison, played by Sam Shepard).<br />The heart of the movie, though, depicts the combined air-ground \\"take down\\" of Aidid's two lieutenants and the chain of mishaps that led to the loss of two Black Hawk transport helicopters, the capture of pilot Mike Durant (Ron Eldard of ER fame) and the grueling, often gruesome firefight that killed 1,000 Somalis and 18 U.S. soldiers.<br />The scope of the movie precludes any real character development. Unlike Spielberg's fictional but intimate war drama, Black Hawk Down basically lays out its characters in broad strokes: Josh Harnett (Pearl Harbor, 40 Days and 40 Nights) is the idealistic Sgt. Eversmann; McGregor (Moulin Rouge, the Star Wars prequels) is the Ranger who has missed combat throughout most of his service and wants to fight; Orlando Bloom's (The Lord of the Rings) eager newcomer who, as in the real fight, becomes the first casualty (he falls from the UH-60 Black Hawk while fast-roping to the street); these are all staples of men-at-war films, even if they are based on real soldiers.<br />Nevertheless, whether the characters are thinly drawn or not, this film is extremely well done and very respectful of the soldiers who fought, suffered and died during those horrific 18 hours in Mogadishu. Not only does Scott capture the heart of Bowden's excellent book, but - and this is a plus - by getting the assistance and active participation of the actual units involved (those ARE real Army Rangers doing the fast-ropes in the assault sequence, and with the exception of CGI choppers in the two shoot-down scenes, those ARE real Army Black Hawks and Little Birds)the authenticity is therefore assured.<br />Though the movie (and book) never made this clear, there is circumstantial evidence that Aidid (never seen in the movie, not even in archival footage) was supported by Al-Qaeda advisers. If so, Black Hawk Down documents America's first showdown with Osama Bin-Laden and his followers.ith the exception of CGI choppers in the two shoot-down scenes, those ARE real Army Black Hawks and Little Birds)the authenticity is therefore assured.<br />Though the movie (and book) never made this clear, there is circumstantial evidence that Aidid (never seen in the movie, not even in archival footage) was supported by Al-Qaeda advisers.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora isn't better than Hybrid Theory, but Meteora is still a great album. better than most of the cd's out now, it's better than reanimation of course. Not many people liked Reanimation, but i liked it because i'm more of a hip-hop fan than a rock fan.<BR>They should have put the song &quot;Step Up&quot; on the album though. I recommend that everyone supports them by buying this album. since the &quot;hip-hop rock&quot; bands are going away, and I don't want Linkin Park to go away with them. One last thing, Hybrid Theory was a phenomenal album. So it must have been very hard trying to live up to the album.
B00000AFWW|1.0|i really liked live through this, but when i bought this cd, i decided courtney love may not be as original or talented as i had thought. i'm a little suspicious that the band does not seem to have a consistent &quot;sound&quot;. this album sounds like a watered-down version of smashing pumpkins, much like live through this sounds heavily influenced by kurt cobain/nirvana. i would not have as much complaint with that if the album were actually good, but it is bland and disappointing pop-rock.
B00000EF8E|3.0|This is just a collection of singles, not really an album.  It doesn't have the great flow of Abbey Road or Sgt Pepper, but if all you want is a few really good songs then this is for you.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of anime, and i have to say that I wasn't exactly thrilled when I was dragged with a few friends to go see this in the theater.  <BR>  30 minutes into the film I found myself lost in the story.  It really envelops you and lose track of reality to a degree.  The animation is silky smooth and some of the effects (moving images reflecting off car windows) really impressed me.  But this movie isn't about uber computer generated effects, it's about the characters which all have such a believable personality, and the twisted Alice-in-Wonderland like plot.  Don't think this is a happy feel-good Disney flick though.  Some of the scenes may not be appropriate for young children. <BR>This truly is a masterpiece, and has given me a respect for jap-anime.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilara has an amazing voice that can only be compared to the likes of Mariah Carey. But what really makes this album is that every song is so different from the next. As much as I love Britney Spears, her songs are very repetative. But Christina's all have different sounds, and are also just REALLY good songs. I was surpised when I purchased this album because I was thinking that &quot;DIRRTY&quot; was going to set the tone for the rest of it. But it actually seems out of place on the CD. The album is full of well-written lyrics and expressive beats. I like every song on the CD, but my favorites are &quot;FIGHTER&quot; and &quot;CAN'T HOLD US DOWN&quot;. Those songs are really empowering and make you feel great, as cheesy as that may sound!
B000003TA9|1.0|This album is really lame, predictable and boring compared to most of their stuff. It's hard to listen to the whole way through, it's just too boring. You should probably check out some of their older stuff before thinking of buying this. Then, listen to some samples or download some songs before making any big decisions.
B00008DDXL|5.0|I love all of the Harry Potter books and the first movie disappionted me just slightly because they didnt follow the book as closely as I thought they needed to. I think that this movie followed the book in almost every aspect and they did a very nice job with it. Anyone who enjoyed the first movie will love this and anyone who enjoyed the books will enjoy this movie as well.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I thought Hybrid Theory was a fantastic first album...I hated how good it was because I really dislike any rap I have ever heard.  But I think Meteora is 10 times better.  The sound is more mature, the instrumentation is more complex, and the vocals are more ambitious.  New favorites are &quot;Don't Stay&quot;, &quot;Easier to Run&quot;, and &quot;Numb&quot; (although that last one is way too short, it ends just as you really start grooving).  It is funny the editorial review mentions Trent Reznor, when I listen to Chester's vocals all I think of is Trent's angst meets N Sync's singing style (if N Sync broke into outbursts of rage once in awhile.)  The result is very catchy lyrics and melodies and a very emotional album that demands to be played at the maximum volume allowed.  If you liked Hybrid Theory, you will love Meteora, and if you aren't into Linkin Park yet, Meteora is just as good a starting point.  So quit reading these reviews and get your copy now!
B000002GQG|5.0|IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD (1968) was the second album by The Moody Blues with Hayward and Lodge, and is still thought to be their best by many.  I won't make that claim here; I am such a fan of this beguiling group that I find it exceedingly difficult to single out just one \\"best\\" from such a string of great albums.  I will admit this has always been one of my favorites.  It is a masterpiece that followed a masterpiece (DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED--one of the few rock albums to extensively and successfully employ an orchestra without being the least bit haughty).<br /><br />IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD is filled with the group's euphoric music, which both explores the cosmos and comforts us with their emblematic, tuneful bliss.  There is a remarkable, youthful enthusiasm in both the music and the lyrics, and the album is loaded with songs of unique, psychedelic charm.  \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" has a mesmerizing groove, but it's intelligently energetic.  \\"Voices In The Sky,\\" \\"Visions Of Paradise\\" and \\"The Actor\\" are pure ecstasy, with such heavenly mixes of instrumental textures and heartfelt vocals.  I don't find \\"Dr. Livingstone, I Presume\\" inferior in any way; in fact it's delightful (pay no attention to the detractors if you prefer inventiveness over trendiness).  \\"Legend Of A Mind\\" is as haunting as you could ask for, and the instrumental break from 2:42 to 4:59 still takes me to OMville.  \\"House Of Four Doors\\" is mysteriously enchanting, beautiful...captivating.  This and \\"Part 2\\" frame \\"Legend Of A Mind\\" perfectly.  And, how can any psychedelia-loving soul not delight in \\"The Best Way To Travel\\"?  The meditative \\"OM\\" completes this musical treasure piece in splendid fashion.<br /><br />The 60s was more than protests and flower power (the media has its way of warping and commercializing everything, including history!).  It was a very revolutionary time for music.  The music on this glorious album was highly original back then--still is!  Nothing sounded like this before the late 60s.  I have a tendency to harp on this: the changes--truly creative changes--that took place in the short span of eight years from 1965 to 1973 were extraordinary.  That was an amazing time period that produced some amazing works of art.  This album is one of them, and I cannot recommend it enough to those who love the stuff.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Murrayave a tendency to harp on this: the changes--truly creative changes--that took place in the short span of eight years from 1965 to 1973 were extraordinary.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|About a Boy was the best comedy of 2002 if you want to call such a thoughtful movie a comedy.  Hugh Grant is very winning playing this less than winning character developing character contrary to his best instincts.  Grant has no life and yet the perfect life doing what ever he pleases at any moment of the day.  He dates whomever and wastes time watching game shows.  Living on an inheritance, Grant doesn't much care for anything but spending money and being a bum.  Through circumstances that were supposed to get him eager women with no strings attached, he becomes attached to a 12 year-old kid who needs his help.  At first, Grant ignores the kid, but the kid persists and Grant becomes more involved than he ever intended to.  Eventually his real devotion of the kid makes him the human being he was trying not to become.<br />It's a great movie because it is both funny and it has an important lesson.  The characters are stereotypes.  They do things that you wouldn't predict.  Where the movie is supposed to be warm and fuzzy it is actually realistic and not so neat.<br />The DVD has the usual making of documentary and no commentary much to my dismay.  The movie is good enough alone that I would recommend buying it.
0374266425|4.0|Jostein Gaardner have come up with an original novel which makes a rundown of history's facets on philosophical thoughts through a story about a girl who recieves mysterious letters from an anonymous correspondent. Each philosophical thoughts are presented in a very clear and concise manner, while at the same time intruiging the reader about the mystery that envelops the main character. This book have got to be read to be believed. It's Alice in Wonderland for the 20th century's final decade, with a twist that is equivalent to the proportions of the Twilight Zone and so much more. <br />However, in my little opinion- Gaardner seems to wane out a bit by the ending parts; and have indeed succumb to the traditional norm of beliefs about Philosophy, which is pardonable as it is an educational book after all.<br />Rate: on the level scale of 9 notches out of 10 (4 1/2 out of 5).
B00008G9JM|4.0|On the one hand \\"A Passion Play\\" is clearly attempt by Jethro Tull's eccentric leader Ian Anderson to recapture the heights the group reached with their \\"Thick as a Brick\\" album. While the final judgment would have to be close but no cigar, this is 1973 effort is still one of the better Tull albums. I have always found the parallels between the \\"story\\" and the Passion of Christ to be somewhat forced at best, but Anderson always liked to be pretentious and enigmatic whenever possible when it comes to his lyrics. The album was conceived for live performance, which included a short film of the album cover ballerina in action and the strange little interlude of \\"The Hair Who Lost His Spectacles.\\" As always, there is the hodge-podge of musical influences with flamenco thrown in with the classical, blues, jazz, folk and rock we came to expect from Tull.<br />For those of us who always wondered if there were titles for the various songs that are woven together into this seemless oratorio, here are the answers (enjoy the irony that now that you know all these titles the album is treated as one long track on the CD):<br /> 1. Lifebeats - 1:14<br /> 2. Prelude - 2:14<br /> 3. The Silver Cord - 4:29<br /> 4. Re-Assuring Tune - 1:11<br /> 5. Memory Bank - 4:20<br /> 6. Best Friends - 1:58<br /> 7. Critique Oblique - 4:38<br /> 8. Forest Dance - 1:35<br /> 9. The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles - 4:18<br /> 10. Forest Dance - 4:18<br /> 11. The Foot of Our Stairs - 4:18<br /> 12. Overseer Overture - 4:00<br /> 13. Flight from Lucifer - 3:58<br /> 14. 10.08 to Paddington - 1:04<br /> 15. Magus Perd&eacute; - 3:55<br /> 16. Epilogue - :43<br />This is certainly the most pretentious album from Anderson's fertile mind--his character is either a man who has just died being questioned at the portal of heaven and/or a fallen angel--which is why it ends up being less of a success than \\"Thick as a Brick.\\" The less you listen to the lyrics and try to work out the message, the more you will enjoy the music and the album. The problem, of course, is that Anderson does not really want you tuning out the lyrics and the \\"plot\\" of the album. However, \\"Passion Play\\" is one of those albums that really sounds a lot better on CD than it did on vinyl or tape.he music and the album.

B000002L9J|5.0|I'm suppose to write a review telling you why &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;  by The Smiths is a great album. Well it comes down to this there's something about Johnny Marr's guitar playing, Andy Rourke's bass playing, Mike Joyce's drumming and Morrisey's vocals. The combination of those four things created truly wonderful music. This is their career peak. There are no fillers here. It's an album you can listen to fron beginning to end. It's the second best album of the 80's (right behind &quot;The Stone Roses&quot;) and my pick for 4th greatest album of all time. (list to be posted on this website later). I'm not asking you people to buy this album. I'm telling you. Don't let Morrisey's hair distract you. Pick this one up today.<br />The Masterpieces: &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot; &quot;The Boy With The Thorn In His Side&quot; &quot;There Is A Light That Never Goes Out&quot;<br />Great: &quot;Cemetary Gates&quot; &quot;Frankly Mr. Shankly&quot; &quot;Vicar In A Tutu&quot;<br />Good: &quot;I Know It's Over&quot; &quot;Never Had No One Ever&quot; &quot;Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others&quot;
0553582445|5.0|I believe that this series will go down as the greatest fantasy epic in this era.  I started reading the Farseer trilogy and I fell in love with the characters, the story-line, and the plot.  Robin Hobb has a clear and consise writing style, and it is not convoluted like several other fantasy series that I can think of.  It has become popular to have multiple plots and storylines in fantasy novels lately, and what I've found is that those stories are not cohesive.  They have no solid foundation, and nothing really happens.  You don't get to know the characters.  In this series you come to know the characters.  There were times where my eyes watered with joy as I read, and this was a story that drew me out of this world and juxtaposed me into the world of FitzChivilry.  It took me out of this mundane extistence and brought me somewhere new and exciting, to a place of joy and sorrow.  I have not read very many series or books in recent years that have had so great an impact on me.  This is a compelling series that offers a great deal to any who wishes to read it.  I reccommend it.  It is a breath of fresh air in a time where fantasy seems to be growing stagnant.  Authors like Robin Hobb and Elizabeth Haydon are what makes fantasy great.
B00008QSA5|5.0|This is probably the finest recorded document of Bloomfield's guitar work and of the communal spirit among musicians of the era...a session of friends jamming together in the studio with a top class engineer to capture it all on tape- That, and Alan Tucker's excellent remastering make this the best sounding album Bloomfield ever made...which is'nt to say it's a sonic blockbuster, but it sounds very good for '68 and better than electric flag or Butterfield..you can really hear what Bloomfield is doing on guitar. Of course it doesn't hurt that his playing is amazing (as is Steven Stills'). Kooper produced and provides some fine keyboard work and competent vocals. They don't make records like this anymore...this album focused on the musical caliber of the artists and turned out to be a big seller in it's day. It's also nice to be able to hear some of these tunes as they were- without the horn overdubs. The bonus tracks more than make up for a couple of the weaker tunes from the original Lp... the live tune is a treat. Bloomfield was among the elite few, a \\"top five\\" guitarist if ever I heard one...this is clearly established within the first few notes of a solo. The spontaneous and inspired playing make this among the best albums of 1968. For more great Bloomfield check out \\"My Labors\\" and \\"Lost Fillmore tapes\\".
B00005JLK1|4.0|The title gives away the whole movie! Spoils! \\"Ghost Ship\\" is about a salvage crew who is looking for The Italian luxury liner called Antonia Graza, which has been missing for nearly half a century. A silly man gets spooked by a clock and almost soils his pants. A smart man gets chilled by a sexy woman's voice. And the rest of the crew gets offed one-by-one with the routine horror cliches. Enough said. What was once a heavenly cruise ship, is now the ship of hell. Yes, I said it. Cable wires were very perilous. A double-faced (literally) lounge singer was extremely insidious. So don't eat canned food that's old, it's pure rot. This is not a scary movie, but a fun one.
B00006LSM3|4.0|There's no denying that this album is thoughtful and touching; Harrison knew he was going to die, and his songs on this final album are reflective, though often upbeat. Jeff Lynne's trademark production techniques are for the most part used very tastefully here, and it seems fair to assume that this album, tidied up postumously, came out more or less how Harrison would have wanted it. (\\"Don't make it too posh,\\" Harrison had warned.) \\"Any Road\\" is a breezy opening rocker, and we hear right away that Harrison's skill as a lead guitarist is magnificent - sinewy, gorgeous, sometimes understated. (George's voice is also as distinctive as it always was here, with a certain mature verve.) \\"Vatican Blues,\\" a rant about the hypocrisy of some church-goers (which George also discussed in the Beatles Anthology book) is a passably catchy song. \\"Pisces Fish\\" is unusual for George in its directness of self-examination. \\"Looking For My Life\\" proves once again that George was a master of rock melody when he wanted to be (one thinks of \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\" from 1971 or \\"Blow Away\\" from the late seventies - great hooks), though in this case he is dealing with the serious matter of mortality. (\\"Rising Sun\\" and \\"Run So Far\\" are good although less memorable stabs in a similar direction.) \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" is another catchy mortality song, at once poignantly sad and joyful. \\"Never Get Over You\\" and \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii\\" are slightly weak, insinuating romantic ballads, and neither rises to the sheer fun of the ukelele cover song \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.\\" \\"Marwa Blues\\" is an interesting twangy instrumental that goes on a bit too long. The album's final cut is a real jewel. \\"Brainwashed\\" (the song) is an all-out dismissal of the money-grabbing media culture that we live in, with no holds barred. (This may seem an obvious target, yet I feel that the point must be made again and again, lest we forget.) As an alternative to the nonsense we daily imbibe, Harrison offers the same message he has offered since 1966 - God, the ultimate truth. His sheer conviction is admirable, even to those who might not share his spiritual leanings. At the same time, Harrison has the good sense to lighten the song with some humor (\\"they brainwashed my grandma while she was working for the mob\\"). We end with the sounds of George and his son chanting a hindu prayer, and cannot help but feel blessed by all the man has tried to show us about the fallacy of fame and the need for real spiritual connection.
0385504209|5.0|This book captivated me within the first three pages and I didn't put it down until I read it from cover to cover.  A friend loaned it to me along with an art book of Da Vinci's sketches and paintings that were mentioned in the novel.  I was very impressed with Mr. Brown's research regarding the Priory of the Sion, Grail Lore, sacred geometry, Mary Magdalene, LdV's artwork, and the research on Rosslyn.  What he has written is not new to individuals who are interested in this aspect of religious history.  There are a myriad of books out there discussing the Grail Lore.  I am just so impressed with his ability to take these facts and weave them into a modern murder mystery, starting out at the Louvre, winding around Paris and its outskirts, until the reader is flown to England and zipping around London.  I could *not* put this down.  Bravo!
0553573403|5.0|I have to say that this book and the whole series that follows it are is amazing.  I used to start new series while waiting for the next Robert Jordan book.  Now I'll be reading new series while waiting for the next Martin book.  This series is what epic fantasies are all about and a its a lot less predictable then some other series.(Wheel of Time, Sword of Truth etc.)  Martin weaves a web story lines.  He builds up on one thread of the web and then suddenly cuts it off while creating new threads all the time.  Your never sure whats going to happen next in these books at that is why they are better then WOT.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is superb. I just picked it up at a store just over 3 hours ago and I've listened to it over, and over again. This is the kind of album you want your album to be. A fantastic follow up to the ever popular &quot;Parachutes&quot; which is excellent, but not as excellent as &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot;. Even though &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot; are my favorite Coldplay tracks ever, &quot;In My Place&quot; and &quot;Clocks&quot; surely make a place in your heart, just to name a few. Coldplay's classic charisma, and intellegent lyrics create a new type of music no other can match. They might not have the most excellent voices, but surely it sounds great to everyone. Coldplay is what music in our bubblegum pop world needs.  A little of everything. And surely you will enjoy this album as much as I have.
B00007M58G|5.0|For hardcore Wilco fans that need a fix until their next release, the bonus CD offers just what the junkie ordered.  There are some experimental sounding tracks on here, which, like some on YHF, take a few listens to really start to appreciate.  Alternatively, the best two tracks, A Magazine Called Sunset and Bob Dylan's 49th Beard, are instantly likable.  Especially the former (Magazine), its lyrics and melody along with its Beatle-esque mellotron sound represent what is fast becoming Wilco's signature sound.  BOTTOM LINE:  If you love Wilco, this is a must have...especially if they're not planning on releasing it in the States.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is the greatest rap/metal/hardrock blend of music you will pick up. If you have never heard of this album, you must if you want some really good music to rock to.  This is their best album in my opinion and too bad they broke up.  Audioslave's a great band though, with former band members of RATM, and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell.

B00000DWHH|5.0|Although the Deluxe Edition hypes that the original version uses the original master tapes for the first time, this is not true.  In 1984, Steve Hoffman remastered this disc in the 1980s (a copy of the digital master he made from the original master tape was used on this Canadian budget import version available at hmv.com, absound.ca, cdplus.com and other Canadian music stores).  The master tape was found in a file cabinet in The Mastering Lab in LA back in the 1980s and used it for the CD.  The Hoffman CD has an EQ that favors the vocals.  For his CD, Hoffman essentially played the tapes back \\"straight\\", without fading the hiss out between tracks. [side note: the Canadian version has the hiss \\"blacked\\" between some tracks. The original US and Japanese pressings don't.]
0446604844|2.0|This kind of stuff is great for travelling. You plunks down your bucks at the airport lounge; you gets your 700 pages of tough cops, beautiful and spunky women, and not-so-very well hidden goony bad guys. I liked the Lee Sawyer character, and the general premise was okay, but it was far less fun when the book was less about investigation and more about \\"...now see Sydney run.\\"<br />Although there are a couple of good twists concerning connections between various plot threads, one would have to be comatose to not see the final endgame. Baldacci makes only a couple of half-hearted attempts to distract us from the blaring neon lights that are our villains.<br />The Sydney Archer character became increasingly ridiculous as the story went on. Trying to picture her single-handedly taking on a crew of ex-CIA psychopaths only resulted in cringing. The writing of the final shootout battle was basically nonexistent; instead we felt like we were being rushed to the finale.<br />All-in-all, with reasonably low expectations, one won't be overly disappointed to have this book for layover reading.
B00008LOS1|5.0|As most people know, one of the main selling points of Who's Next: Deluxe Edition is that the original album comes from the original stereo master tapes \\"for the first time on CD\\". The story is that only copy tapes have been used all of these years. On the other hand, Steve Hoffman, former MCA engineer, has claimed for a long time that he found the master tapes in a file cabinet at the Mastering Lab in LA in the mid-80s and used them for his CD version, one variation of which is still available in Canada today.<br />Well, between listening to the two side by side and running the tape box pictures past Steve, it would indeed seem the Deluxe Edition is the *second* time (at the very least) the true masters have been used for CD. There's little doubt in my mind that Hoffman's version also used the tapes. Both forms of the album sound quite good, although there are some differences between the two.<br />The Hoffman CD has an EQ that favors the vocals, with the side effect of causing the cymbals to sound a bit \\"midrangy\\". The Deluxe Edition, on the other hand, goes for a slightly more \\"smooth\\" cymbal sound, at the expense of the vocals, causing them to be submerged slightly, if you will. The DE is a bit less \\"open\\", IMO.<br />There are also some minor differences beyond EQ. For his CD, Hoffman essentially played the tapes back \\"straight\\", without fading the hiss out between tracks. [side note: the Canadian version has the hiss \\"blacked\\" between some tracks. The original US and Japanese pressings don't.] The Deluxe Edition takes a different approach. As the songs come to a close, the entire track is faded out, causing the hiss to fade as well. The side effect of this is that in some cases the very last moments of some songs are lost.<br />Interesting note: the between song gaps for most of the album seem to be just about identical between the Hoffman CD and the DE. However, while some previous versions of the original mix (including the Hoffman) have essentially no pausebetween Behind Blue Eyes and Won't Get Fooled Again, the Deluxe Edition has a few seconds of silence between the two. Very strange. On the other hand, the old US MCA CD (a version not mastered by Hoffman) does have a small gap as well.<br />A big question on many peoples minds has been noise reduction (NR). Jon Astley (who mastered the Deluxe Edition) is notorious for using NR on just about everything. This has the effect of sucking the life out of the music and causing nasty digital artifacts. Kind of a \\"swirling\\" sound if you will. Just listen to some of Live At Leeds: Deluxe Edition for a good (or bad, I guess) example of this. Well, I've got good and bad news. The good news is that *most* of the album is NR-free. Hiss levels are usually about the same as the Hoffman CD, and in a few cases they actually seem to be every so slightly higher. That said, several intros, quiet sections, and fade-outs do have noise reduction. One key place is Won't Get Fooled Again - the intro, synth break, and fade-out all have NR. There's very little hiss during the break, and then as soon as the drums come in, the hiss level goes *way* up. Fortunately the NR isn't quite as intrusive as it was on some other Astley-mastered CDs, but it is still annoying, and there's simply no reason for it.<br />As far as the rest of the (bonus) cuts go, I haven't really gotten that far yet. I would note that while Baby Don't You Do It is longer than on the 1995 CD, it is still edited in a few places. What's the point?<br />On the other hand, some (but not all) of the backing vocals mixed out of Pure & Easy on the 1995 CD are present here. The song also comes to a formal close, rather than a fade-out.<br />Behind Blue Eyes still only has a single guitar solo, unlike the dual solos on the bootleg mix.<br />I briefly skimmed through disc 2. Rich \\"White Fang\\" Weiner has said he thought the mastering was significantly worse on this disc, but honestly, I don't hear (m)any negative effects of noise reduction. It's certainly better than I was expecting. That said, I haven't heard the mixes prior to mastering, and I believe he has. Whatever the case, the sound is *far* better than some of Jon Astley's prior work.<br />How would I rate this set? Well, it was certainly better than expected. A key selling point is use of the \\"original tape\\" for the original album. While I'd say it does sound *very* good, bits of noise reduction aside, I'm hesitant to say it sounds \\"better\\" than the Hoffman CD. Both versions have their own strengths and weaknesses. Casual fans will probably do fine with the DE, although I'd still suggest the Hoffman CD to those who really care about sound quality. You might still prefer the DE, but then again, you might not.<br />Even ignoring the original album, I'd say the set is well worth picking up. The mixes of the Record Plant material are interesting, and the Young Vic show is great from both a performance and sound standpoint.<br />Despite its flaws, in my opinion this is the best Who reissue to come out in a long time.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Instead of speculating on the sincerity of [Pink's]music or personality, I would instead urge those here to take a good listen to what she's saying. She isn't going to be Britney- no. Her music is solid, individual, personal. While she IS a popstar- must all popstars be Britney Spears? [Pink} set forth a new style of mainstream pop late in 2001, a style that unleashed the new trend in music (like it or not, this album spawned punk-pop music going mainstream), and while many will say she sold out or is killing true rock/punk music.. [Pink}fans don't really care. It's what's in the lyrics and deliverance that matter to her real fans.<br />The album is full of misfit anthems, from \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" to the absolute best song she's done so far, \\"Lonely Girl.\\" Her vocals are scratchy and solid, incorporating an old-school jazz sound with the lively, modern beats. The sound is unique, fresh, angsty and yet fun. Each song is very much it's own sound, though they all find a way to flow together in this album.<br />Her dance tracks are impressive as well. The throbbing \\"Get This Party Started,\\" jumpy \\"18-Wheeler,\\" and downright techno-heavy \\"My Vietnam\\" surpass the expectations for poppy dance tracks with lyrics like \\"everywhere that I go/ there's someone trying to chain me/ everything that I say/ there's someone trying to short-change me/ I am only this way/ Because of what have made me/ And I'm not gonna break.\\" And though they continue with the self-hating lyrics, they also employ a way to laugh at yourself and your shortcomings- for me, anyway.<br />The album holds a lot of memories for me, good and bad, but more than anything, the music comes through. It speaks in a way few other pop albums can touch me. And for that, Ms. Moore gets all the props possible from me.
0887306101|4.0|EXCELLENT READ. I was going to reinvest after the DEVESTATING CRASH of the markets from 2000 to 2003. I bought these books to get some insight and have they provided me with powerful facts, direction and laws to live by trading wise.<BR>  A must have for anyone wanting to invest and to make money and avooid getting wiped out. Learn to preserve what U have. I read all 400+ pages in under a 5 days it was that great of a read. So interesting, insighful and entertaining. I am currently reading the New market wizards. Mostly more of the same. Yet this one takes place from late 1998 to 1992. I wish There was a new one from the year 2000 -2003. More stock related as opposed to futures, commodities. But non the less the facts are riviting and the lessons irregardless of what was traded is what is most insighful and enduring. I will never trade again w/o the facts I learned here. If I had used the lessons I learned from reading this book I would have come out of the tech boom a wise man. But alas one of the lessons I learbned the hard way and then read in the book is that the 1st time out you MUST LOOSE and usually do loose as those are the TIMES you learn your system from your failures and what NOT to do going forward. All the wizards lost at 1st and then made their systems work from there!
B00007E8V4|5.0|I think with the war in Iraq going on it was a perfect time to release System of a Down's new album.  The song Boom! reflects on what going on right now and it should be a wake up call for everybody.
B0000026DJ|5.0|Before i bought it i only knew \\"Beds are burning\\", one of their biggest hits.I liked it, but it didn't make me to listen to oil's other tracks.After some time when i saw \\"Diesel and dust\\" in my friends cd collection i've borrow it.It was laying some days close to my hi-fi, but when i started to listen to it it didn't came out of cd player for a few weeks....DIESEL AND DUST is a perfect album. No weak tracks. Great musicians, Good singer and all sounds very fresh and clear.<BR>MIDNIGHT OIL is a band with their own style.I would not compare it to other australian groups like Crowded House. Oil's music is much more darker,lyrics are about social and world problems (examples: \\"Dead heart\\", \\"Sell my soul\\" or \\"dreamworld\\") but everything is really catchy....those songs just won't come out of your head.My forever favourites from \\"DIESEl..\\" are \\"Put down that weapon\\" and \\"Sell my souL\\" - Both with dark groove,some great guitar works (Solo on Dobro guitar in \\"Sell my soul\\" is just marvelous) and good lyrics.<BR>I strongly recomend this to everyone - if you are a fan of good rock music or just if you want to discover something diffrent you will be really positively twisted about it....
B000002N2N|5.0|Why is this not considered one of the best bloody live albums ever? You got me. This is the Ramones at their youngest, leanest, meanest, hungriest, and most energetic. This concert in London '77 educated the UK, and the rest of the world, on how punk was done.<br />It's Alive must set some sort of speed record. In the middle of the bloated, progressive 70's, leave it to the Ramones to play 28 songs in a blinding 53 minutes. The band barely stops to catch their breath before Dee-Dee launches into another count of \\"1-2-3-4!\\" and blast off into another song. Nobody (including themselves) would match a performance like this again.<br />Highlights...oh screw it. It's the Ramones. Figure it out.<br />What's not to like about this one? Fast, funny, raw, catchy, rockin', and LIVE. It's Alive is caffiene pressed to wax. Highest recommendation.
0553210246|5.0|One of my favorites works of English literature. The opening \\"wife selling\\" chapter is one of the best in all literate, setting the major tone and themes for the entire book. The ironic twits of fate provide a wild, entertaining ride that shows off Hardy's themes of the balance between fate and individual choice in a non-didactic way. The Mayor must be ranked as a tragic character in line with Shakespeare's best work.  A work that makes profound psychological and philosophical statement while remaining engrossing on every level.
B00008DDXC|4.0|This is a good movie. It's wonderfully acted and the effects are terrific.  That said, the book is SO MUCH better.  The movie leaves so many scenes and details out that in order to enjoy the movie, read the book first.  Also, if your child is 3 or younger this movie might be a little scarey for them.

B000008J3I|4.0|This is a good introduction to the music of Mike Oldfield, and it includes one great song, a few other good ones, and some disappointments.  It also includes several excerpts from long instrumental works that are pleasant, sometimes even beautiful to listen to, but that can't possibly convey the impact of the entire compositions.  Finally, there are a couple of execrable tracks that should have been left on the cutting room floor.  The album is incoherent as a \\"listen\\", but considering Mike's divergent musical explorations, what else could it be?<br />The great song is &quot;To France&quot;.  Sung by silver-throated Maggie Reilly, it is beautiful and thrilling, with quiet mandolins, soaring guitars and well-textured electronics forming a transcendent song of regret and hope.  The song is a perfect \\"10\\", and led me to the album \\"Discovery\\", which I believe is Mike's best album of songs and short selections.<br />The other good songs are \\"Family Man\\", \\"Moonlight Shadow\\" and \\"Heaven's Open\\".  I picked up this CD to accompany me on a long drive, only being familiar with Mike's phenomenal &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, and hoping for similarly entertaining soundscape odysseys.  Imagine my surprise when all of a sudden... \\"hey, this is Hall and Oates!\\"  Sure enough, the blue-eyed soul of \\"Family Man\\" originated with Mike Oldfield, and includes a wicked high-register guitar solo.  Then comes &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;, a delightful song, sweet and melodic with a strong drum track.  &quot;Heaven's Open&quot; is another uplifting winner.  I'm not sure if Mike is the singer, but he sounds sort of like a drunken Sting (and I don't mean that as an insult, the vocal is actually quite good).  &quot;Foreign Affair&quot; and &quot;Islands&quot; (featuring Bonnie Tyler) are no better than OK, and &quot;Five Miles Out&quot; and &quot;Shadow on the Wall&quot; are more irritating than entertaining.<br />The instrumental excerpts from the long works form a signficant part of this album, and all are entertaining, especially \\"Incantations\\" and &quot;Ommadawn&quot;, but they are mere fragments, and whatever the quality of the entire compositions, the excerpts cannot possibly do them justice.<br />Overall, \\"Elements\\" is a good display of what this interesting and sometimes experimental musician has produced over the years, but not a real \\"album\\" in itself.  I give it 3 stars for the CD as a musical collection, and an extra star for its value in pointing you to those aspects of Mike Oldfield's music you might want to pursue in more depth.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Nature was always very present in Tull's music - with Ian Anderson's rich fluteplaying evoking images of wide open spaces, joyous rides across green fields, and perhaps slightly ironic but nonetheless real inclinations to go &quot;living in the past&quot;.<br />On &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; Ian Anderson - inspired by recently moving into the countryside - seems to transform himself into the Green Man of British folklore, roaming through mythical forests, high on Nature's juices and testosterone.<br />The resulting album hardly needs any recommendation - it is an acknowledged and flawless masterpiece, as fresh, magical and intoxicatingly original today as when it was recorded some 25 years ago.<br />The original cd-version was awful - the new, remastered version brings back memories of being blown away for the first time by this timeless masterpiece. The two bonus tracks are fine, the sinister &quot;Beltane&quot; (a pity, though, that the track isn't faded away when enough is enough...) and a fine, airy live-version of &quot;Velvet Green&quot;.
B000000WG4|5.0|Nothing quite like this has ever been recorded, before or since.  It came entirely out of the head of a fantastically talented and skilled 19-year-old.  It is played and arranged brilliantly and sensitively.  The soundscapes are fascinating, original, compelling and at times stunningly, strangely beautiful.<br />Although Part I is more dynamic and thrilling, I consider Part II more delectable and sublime.  Part II, however, is marred by the album's three flaws: 1) The overly long section of droning bagpipes, 2)The amusing but out-of-place rock ditty sung by a &quot;Piltdown Man&quot; (a distant human ancestor, but more likely a werewolf, judging by the screeching howls), and 3) The finale of the sailor's hornpipe, which comes across as a bad joke.  Mike should have contained his whimsy and been content with a 15-minute Part II, which would have made Tubular Bells a perfectly realized work of art.  As it is, it comes very close.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Being an avid Harry Potter fan I looked forward to the DVD and the special features on Disc Two. I was pleased to see the producers went above and beyond the features in the Sorcerer's Stone DVD.<br />Viewing the additional/deleted scenes reminded me just how much Chris Columbus had to cut out of the movie to keep it viewable at 161 minutes. There were quite a few scenes that were true to the book that were (unfortunately) edited out of the final film. Having read the books I feel some of the edited scenes might have helped clarify parts of the storyline somewhat (such as the scene where Harry accidentally arrives in Knockturn Alley...the dialogue between Lucius Malfoy and the shopowner regarding selling Voldemort's belongings were filmed but cut out of the final version...it would have helped explain why Lucius had Tom Riddle's diary with him when he runs into the Weasley's in the bookstore in Diagon Alley...).<br />As an ADULT fan of the Harry Potter books/films, I would like the DVD producers to try to keep us older fans in mind when producing their next DVD features! I really enjoyed the interviews with the actors but wanted  more! I would like to have heard about more topics, as well as hearing from more of the actors. (I did appreciate the option to pick and choose the interviews by actor and topic rather than having to endure one long piece). The interview with JK Rowling and Kloves (the screenwriter) was interesting as well. But again, I'd like to hear more from Rowling and Kloves about their collaborative process.<br />The interactive features, especially those of Dumbledore's Office and the tour of Diagon Alley, are absolutely awesome! The computer graphics are better quality than the graphics used in the features part of Sorcerer's Stone and the interactivity of the games (such as the Forest Chase game!!) is improved as well. By the way, if anyone knows how to get out of the Chamber Challenge alive, please post in your review!! However, I thought the Gilderoy Lockhart feature was a waste of valuable space. Again, more interviews or interactive activities would have been better than going through this rehash of Lockhart's vain character.<br />I would like more than anything to see an UNEDITED DIRECTOR'S CUT version of this movie on the DVD. It would be much more palatable to sit through 4 hours in the comfort of my own home than in the theater, and the unedited version would be a delight to see. Also, a feature I really enjoy on DVD's is watching the movie with running commentary from the director, et al. That would be a real treat to learn more about the filming of the Harry Potter movies, but, alas, it is not a feature on this disc (again, that's something that is more adult-oriented...).<br />Finally, my one HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT is in the &quot;Extra Credit&quot; feature. Once again, we Mac users are out on a limb when it comes to DVD-ROM features. I put the second disc in and only got the same special features I got on my television (they looked great on computer though!!). Apparently, the games, screensavers, and activities that are so tantalizingly previewed on the disc are nowhere to be found when the disc is inserted into a Mac computer.
0767817710|1.0|The real premise of this movie is: only women have any remorse over murder (but they can get over it), and only good dental hygiene stands a chance of keeping you from violent death. A thoughtless, gratuitously violent movie that unsuccessfully recycles Hackman's great turn in Unforgiven and leaves DiCaprio's undeniable charm and brightness flapping in the void of Sharon Stone's vapid presence. Fans of this film: raise your standards!
B000003337|4.0|I thought this recording was pretty good.  You can hear where Randy took some of the earlier ideas in his playing and improved them with Ozzy.  \\"Laughing Gas\\" was the highlight of the cd because of Randy's solo. I thought it was a really good thing to have put together Quiet Riot's archive material to give us another chance to hear Randy Rhoads play once again.
B00006F83Y|5.0|I don't do this written review thing, but I can't let this album have a 4/5 star rating without throwing my five stars into the pot. <br />Amazing album that I could never do justice, so I won't even attempt. Just buy it
B000002H97|5.0|The grestest thing about this band is their substance and flexibility. They could play ultra-fast and aggressive metal, but also be passionately true in their hearts. Heart, substance, sense - what most metal bands lack. <BR>This cd will forever remain in the group of classics that came out in the early to mid-nineties.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I'll keep this review short.  I just want to say that this an excellent documentary that features everything you need to know about the Beatles.  It covers everything from the days of Hamburg to Beatlemania to Abbey Road and the breakup.  If you haven't seen it, you should expect the following:<br />1) In depth interviews about making the albums, realationships, songs, places, etc.<BR>2) Interviews about stuff rarely talked about and new to most Beatle fans<BR>3) Great concert footage from the Cavern, TV, Shea Stadium, tours, etc.<BR>4) So much more!  Buy this DVD!
0060512806|2.0|The book was terribly long and boring. The author obviously is paid by the word. I regularly skipped 2-4 pages out of 10. So, roughly 500 of 1100 pages were useless description and digressions that did nothing to further the plot or characterization.<br />I'm sorry I spent 8 bucks.
B000089A07|4.0|\\"Red Dragon\\" is a movie I liked better the second time I saw it. The first time I thought it was made merely to capitalize on our fascination with brilliant arch villain, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. There is some validity to this opinion since the book by Thomas Harris, the first of three in which Lecter is featured, was filmed in 1986 under the title of `Manhunter\\". [The first version, by the way, is a very good movie.] The second viewing, however, convinced me that, for whatever reason it was made, \\"Red Dragon' stands on its own as a first-rate thriller. <br />The movie opens with a chilling encounter between FBI agent Will Graham [Edward Norton] and Lecter [Anthony Hopkins]. Just as Graham realizes that Lecter is the serial killer he has been looking for, Lecter attacks and nearly kills him. Graham survives, and Lecter is captured and incarcerated for life in a mental institution. Traumatized by the ordeal, Graham retires to Florida with his wife and young son. A few years later his old boss [Harvey Keitel] lures him back to help find another killer dubbed The Tooth Fairy. Finding himself in a dead end with the case, Graham reluctantly seeks the assistance of his old nemesis, Dr. Lecter, whose help turns out to be Graham's worst nightmare come to life. <br />Part of the success of \\"Red Dragon\\" is due to its `dream' cast. Besides Norton and Hopkins, it has Ralph Fiennes as the killer in question and Emily Watson as a blind woman the Tooth Fairy falls for. Other assets include the astute screenplay by Ted Tally, who penned the one for \\"Silence of the Lambs', and the chilling musical score by Danny Elfman. Perhaps the biggest surprise is the assured direction by Brett Ratner, heretofore known as the director of fun but forgettable comedies such as \\"Rush Hour\\" and \\"Family Man\\".  <br />If you are expecting this movie to top the classic \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", you may be disappointed. If you view it on its own terms, you may see it as very good - not extraordinary, perhaps, but way above ordinary.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|This is one of those few cases when I think the vast majority of reviews thus far are mistaken. I don't think this movie is nearly as good as these &quot;ravers&quot; say it is.<br />For starters, when you're watching a movie and you're continuously aware that your listening to a script, something's not right. The dialogue is mediocre at best, unfortunately preventing any characters from establish themselves as believable. Also, this &quot;political commentary&quot; that supposedly makes this an intelligent film consists only of fleeting references to 80's politics and culture. These additions do not culminate in a deep, philosophical statement, as one expects of films which utilize this element, and they certainly don't add to the plot. <br />Fortunately this movie is not entirely a lost cause. Several things make it just slightly more than bearable. First, the soundtrack is interesting. I like most of the 80's tunes throughout the film, and the ambient dronings contribute to the varying, though predominantly dark, atmosphere of the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal makes Donnie one of the few (almost) believable characters in the movie. Its a shame he didn't have a better script to further develop his character. Also, the concept of the plot is actually quite good. I can see how one could develop a very good story around it. Lastly, the scant attempts at humor are generally successful, and make the film roll by a bit faster.<br />Unfortunately, the movie's shortcomings ultimately lead to its failure as a legitimate competitor among other recent releases. The ideas are too scattered and unorganized, the script is terrible, and the characters are cartoonish. It's obvious this is a debut film. Nevertheless, it is worth seeing Donnie Darko for its thought-provoking plot ideas and entertainment value.
B00008H2LE|1.0|I already reviewed the regular version of this cd, but I just thought I would share some more thoughts on this album. I'm so tired of all of these 12 year olds saying that Linkin Park &quot;speaks to them&quot; and understands what they are going through. As with a lot of bands today, this is just stupid, pre-packaged self-loathing. And there is nothing orignial about this whatsoever. Oh my god, they're creating rap/metal! Well in case you people don't realize it, there are other bands that did this back when you were all little kids. Let's take a look at the band who brought this style into mainstream...Rage Against the Machine. Not only did they not need a DJ to &quot;add&quot; to the songs, the actually spoke about things that had a meaning, hence their political views that were brought out through Zach's lyrics. This album is just Hybrid Theory all over again. And to the guy that had Linkin Park inspire him to play guitar...try to mimic a talented guitarist such as Tom Morello from Rage/Audioslave or Adam Jones from Tool. They do things with their instruments that you couldn't ever even imagine hearing Linkin Park do. Rolling Stone gave this cd 3 stars, which disappointed me. They usually have better taste than that. You want a couple of good cd's that just came out in the last couple weeks? Go pick up &quot;Elephant&quot; by the White Stripes and &quot;Faceless&quot; by Godsmack. And at least Sully has a good voice. I hope Linkin Park disappear from the music scene. It's too bad that fans didn't forget about them after Reanimation.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a must watch for anyone who wants to know a more personal story of the experiences of WWII.  While this is a retelling of  the experiences of Easy Company of the newly invented Airborne Infantry, one should not disregard it because it came from Hollywood heavyweights Spielberg and Hanks.  Quite the opposite, it is because of them and the book by renowned World War II historian Stephen Ambrose that this movie is so un-Hollywood.  I cannot do the series justice by recounting the reasons why you should watch it.  The other reviewers have mentioned `propaganda' and `indiscriminate killings' as reasons not to believe the story.  I hate to break it to them, but that happens during wars.  I've seen a lot of things and if you want to see the closest facsimile to the real thing, see this.
B000066F6H|5.0|The Hives make great straight ahead rock and roll or 'punk' if you prefer. <BR>I first saw them on MTV and thought how retro. It reminded me of mid 60s Rolling Stones and Kinks footage.  Nothing original here...but who is nowadays???  <BR>I loved the song Hate To Say I Told You So...so I bought the cd. Every song rocks hard except Find Another Girl...still, it's an amusing version of an old soul song.<BR>My personal favorites are Die Alright! Main Offender, Hate To Say I Told You So and Supply and Demand.<BR>The band plays tight and they look cool to boot. Can you believe it? A rock band that actually dresses with style! Something I haven't seen too much of since before the grunge era.<br />If you like high energy rock and roll get this cd. There's not a bad song on here.
B00005JLK1|2.0|I didn't think I was expecting all that much from \\"Ghost Ship.\\"  I LIVE for scary movies, and, after a fellow Blockbuster denizen made the recommendation, I and two friends decided to rent this dvd just to get a good scare.  <br />Unfortunately, the thrills and chills in this movie were neither thrilling nor chilling.  I don't know how Juliana Margulies or Gabriel Byrne were convinced to do this flick, but it is just the most campy movie I've seen in a long time.  The special effects are pure cheese...severed limbs, fake blood, horrible demises for each of the characters...the filmmakers made the gore the central scare tactic, and it makes the whole thing rather boring.  <br />I think the best role is played by the little ghost girl who tries to guide Juliana Margulies away from the evil that eventually takes all of her crew.  She is sufficiently creepy and lends some genuity to the story....but that hardly makes up for the rest of the movie.  <br />If you are thinking of even seeing this movie, much less buying it, get ready for a dumbed-down, aquatic version of \\"The Shining\\" featuring a bad guy who steals souls.  The story is just not compelling at all, the characters are not well-developed (most are killed off before there's even a chance), and the visual effects are pretty blah.<br />To sum it up: only see this if you're really really really bored and if you only feel like getting \\"pseudo-scared.\\"
B000002HAJ|5.0|One of the few totally guitar-driven Cure albums, Wish is an incredible album, with a strong, driving, forceful core and a set of 12 astounding songs. While its not as eclectic as some Cure albums (due to the fact that its all guitar-driven) it explores a huge range of moods nevertheless.<br />The album begins with 'Open', where Smith chronicles his drinking problems to a forceful, dark backing of reverbing guitars and driving bass, reminiscent of sections of previous album 'Disintegration'. The second song 'High' is totally different, a relatively breezy pop song, however for me its one of the album's least good songs, not because its poppy, but because it lacks the killer tune that the other poppy songs have. 'Apart' is a slow, intimate and desolate number reminiscent of some of the earlier Cure recordings. Next comes the album's centrepiece, the epic 'From The Edge Of The Deep Green Sea', a gothic rock track which builds and sways around turbulently. <br />The next three songs return to a poppier style, beginning with 'Wendy Time' with its funk-style, wah-wah guitar line. It still has a note of menace due to the threatening bass and Smith's voice. 'Doing The Unstuck' is a total catharsis, with its very un-Cure cry of 'let's get happy!'. Fortunately most of the lyrics are better than this slightly cringeworthy line. Again, however, despite very optimistic lyrics and tune, we have a threatening bassline that perhaps was influenced by Nirvana and specificially Come As You Are (which came out the year before). At one point, despite being totally different in mood, the song mimicks 'Fascination Street' from 'Disintegration', presenting its line 'Oh just burn down the house! Burn down the street' in almost the exact same fashion as Fascination Street's 'Just pull on your face! Pull on your feet!'. Its an amazing song, and a travesty it wasn't a single.<br />'Friday I'm In Love', perhaps the Cure's most straightforward, pop song ever - even 'Love Song' has a touch of darkness to it - goes all Green-era REM with its catchy, jangling guitar, poppy melodies and distant harmonies. Its as cheesy and catchy as ... 80s pop, and its incredible to think this came from the same band who made Pornography, but its strangely touching and really a lovely song. <br />'Trust' could hardly be any more different in mood. Beginning with a weeping piano line, it is lyrically simple yet enormously accomplished. Its a desolate, beautiful song that sits nicely with 'Apart', truly heartbreaking and a must for unrequited lovers everywhere. 'A Letter To Elise' seems a little too close to 'Pictures of You' for comfort, almost exactly the same in arrangement, mood and even to some extent melody. As I always thought 'Pictures of You' was a little overrated its not my idea of the greatest Cure track, but of course its still touching and its saved by another excellent lyric.<br />Next comes the most gothic song on the album, the vicious 'Cut'. Paced extremely quickly, its driven by one of the greatest basslines ever, stunning drums and layers of spooky guitar and keyboard effects, with Smith's anguished vocal layered on top. Its certainly an album highlight, sounding how 'A Forest' might have sounded if it had been arranged in a more complex way and given a 90s-style production. 'It's all gone! It's aaaaaallll....oww' wails Smiths over the cacophony, his voice escalating into an incredible, falsetto scream.<br />'To Wish Impossible Things' is another heartbroken track yearning for things past. If you're a Placebo fan, its impossible not to notice how much tracks like this one must have influenced them. Beautiful viola is layered onto it, and its absolutely devastating. <br />The final track, 'End' is built around a memorable guitar ostinato. It's musically similar to the opener, excellent slightly more angular and less fluid. There's excellent production on the vocal, which wavers and echoes from speaker to speaker throughout, and the central call of 'Please stop loving me! I am none of these things!' is incredibly powerful. This, along with tracks like 'From The Edge of the Deep Green Sea', appears to have formed the template for the later 'Bloodflowers' album. <br />Overall, this is an incredible album, frequently emotionally devastating, but occasionally with a true ray of sunshine. It sits among The Cure's absolute best as a total classic, dark and powerful, majestic and beautiful, touching, affirming music.
B00003CXXR|4.0|Ready for some forget-about-the-real-world-for-awhile fun?  This film may have been the third release in the J-Park trilogy, but it is clearly the 2nd best of the series.  No sequel will ever outdo the novelty of the original, but this episode injects enough &quot;oomph&quot; into the storyline to keep you on the edge of your seat.  For starters:<br />1. Sam Neill returns in the lead role...<BR>2. Introduction of a predator bigger and badder than T-Rex (who knew?!)...<BR>3. Intro of a flying dinosaur species (In the minds of even casual dinosaur enthusiasts, the dino-bird is a &quot;must have&quot; element which was grossly absent from the earlier movies)...<BR>4. Continued character development of Velociraptors is extremely well done.  The complexity of the raptor's personality is human-like by the end of the show...<BR>5. The movie didn't try to outdo itself as was done in the Lost World by bringing dinosaurs to the mainland.  (Jurassic Park will never be Godzilla.)  Generally speaking, the plot lived within its means.<br />So why only 4 stars?  Of all things, HUMAN character development and motivation is a little hard to keep up with.  You just kind of get the sense that the writers couldn't come up with a really good idea to get everyone on the island in the first place, so they had to pick something kind of outlandish.  As a result, they had to spend the rest of the movie scrambling to explain and resolve that outlandishness into something believable.  Close, but no cigar.<br />That said, it's a good fantasy/action movie, defintely one that is worth popping corn for.  You'll be better off seeing the first two J-Park videos first, so that you can understand the historical references in this film.  Enjoy!
6305633177|5.0|I saw Cliff Burton live twice. What an amazing talent. Such a shame he died so young. Unlike most rockers who die before they reach the age of thirty, it wasn't Cliff's fault. He was asleep on his tour bus when it crashed in Europe. That said, this DVD shows the REAL Metallica. Not that watered down, Poplica that we have been putting up with since the god-awful Black album.<br />I remember the old days. Those of us who wore our Metal up your ... T-shirts to high school were a special group indeed. No one knew who Metallica were except for a select few. They were underground, dangerous, and played the most kick butt rock n roll ever heard.<br />This DVD captures Metallica in all their glory with Cliff Burton, \\"The major rager on the four string mother ....\\" as introduced by Jaymz. Bass solos that will blister your ears, the greatest versions of 'Seek and Destroy' and 'For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" you'll ever hear, and Cliff footage showing Cliff at his humorous best. Did you know ZZ Top was a big influence of his?<br />A lot of people complain that this DVD is no good because it's mostly bootleg footage shot from the crowd. I disagree, the poor quality footage and 'not so happening' sound only enhances the Cliff legend. Back in the days when you didn't know who Metallica was unless you bought an album or went to a show. They were against the establishment, against polished up MTV videos, and against everything that metal was that made itself a joke. Metallica was real and this was real, unmixed, raw footage. It's the Metallica we remember and love, and will never see again.<br />This is the only Metallica DVD worth buying in my opinion. It brings me back to high school parties when we were the bad dudes who dug Metallica.<br />I was a junior in high school when Cliff died and we were all shocked and in disbelief. When reality hit, it was a sad time for us. Gone was metal's most original bass player. Metallica wanted him so bad in the begining that they packed up and moved from LA to San Fran just to have him.<br />Metallica was at it's greatest when they had a bass player that wore bluejean bell-bottoms and a Misfits T-shirt. There are some who still remember Cliff and will never forget his impact on music. Like Randy Rhodes, we can only wonder and wish what might have happened if he was still here. For all the new fans who started listening to Metallica when \\"Enter Sandman' was on MTV every 15 minutes, buy this DVD and get a true introduction to 'old school'.<br />R.I.P. Cliff, the true fans will never forget.d from LA to San Fran just to have him.<br />Metallica was at it's greatest when they had a bass player that wore bluejean bell-bottoms and a Misfits T-shirt.

B00008DDXC|5.0|Everyone knows that when you wait anxiously for a movie for a long time your expectations grow higher by the minute and you often go to the theater and become disilusioned due to your exagerated expectaions. Not so for the second movie in the Harry Potter series. This movie exceeded my expectations inmensely. I could barely contain my excitement. The movie, chronicles Harry's second year at Hogwarts and his new adventure. It also does justice to the book. This movie ia absolutely worth it. A must see movie.
B000005J56|4.0|You don't need to speak Spanish to understand or appreciate this album.  It truly is so beautiful.
0062511408|1.0|I really don't know how this book could have won so many awards. It is not a valuable literary book. It it's merely an inspirational book. The book has not tangile plot and seems silly at times. It was a big waste of time.
B00004RF83|5.0|This movie is dated, and anyone who didn't live through some part of the Cold War may not feel the full effect, but it is filled with suspense and drama. The casting for this movie was perfect, with Fredrick March as the frail looking President Lymon, who manages to show the great strength contained within; Burt Lancaster as General Scott, who gives off an commanding aura of strength and purpose; and Kurt Douglas as Colonel Jiggs Casey, who is torn between duty and loyalty. Great supporting cast as well. This movie also makes you think, and at the end you'll be wondering, could something like this really happen?
B000002VMD|5.0|This is a really good and well made sountrack. \\"I will always love you\\"  is a great song, a true classic. The sountrack also includes \\"I'm every woman\\", \\"Queen of the Night\\".<br /><br />If I remember correctly, the insert does not contain the lyrics of the songs. Just the credits.
6300183971|5.0|This movie made me go out and buy the books back in '84 when I saw it in the theater. I've recently become appreciative of the often underrepresented MacLachlan, whose intense vocal inflections and screen presence magnify the special effects and intricate storyline. It's one of those flicks I can deal with repeatedly and easily resist boredom. You get caught up in the interplanetary conspiracy and political intrigue, even amongst the psychic Bene Gesserit witches. This movie goes beyond escape from reality, into a spiraling journey through timespace--without moving. No spice required.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Robert Bolt, the screenwriter of The Mission, wrote his greatest work in A Man for All Seasons ( watch it! IT's THE BEST!) but this is a very close second. Excellent acting by the entire cast and moving scenes about the changes one goes though in life and how goodness and evil work in the world. It stikes home threw all times because of the fact that everyone seems to go through the same things as the charactors of this movie.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The acting VASTLY improved in this second of the series. The special effects were astounding, again. Dobby was fantastic! Can't wait for Book 5 and Movie 3!
B00008J4P5|3.0|Maybe it's just the anticipation of the album and stunning reviews that came before it's release date but I'd have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Is this a good album? It's not bad. Is it great enough to make Jack and Meg White the new King and Queen of rock and roll? <br />No.<br />There's some great songs on this album; &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, &quot;I Don't Know What To Do With Myself&quot;, &quot;I Want To Be The Boy&quot; and &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot; but a lot of the songs just sound forced and uninspired. It sounds like Jack White has decided he needs to show off his soloing abilities which really isn't necessary; his strength lies in beautiful understated guitar work. While most songs just seem to be mediocre, there are two that really stand-out in my mind as flat out horrible: the over-produced &quot;There's No Home For You Here&quot; and the horribly annoying and stupid &quot;It's True That We Love Each Other&quot;. I love the White Stripes and hope that this is nothing more than just a weak point in their musical career and not a permanent change. If you're just getting into the Stripes, pick up De Stijl first because it is, quite simply, a masterpiece. This would be the last album I'd pick up.
0345457684|3.0|There are some interesting concepts in this book, as other reviewers have stated, but that wasn't enough to make me enjoy this one. I tend to judge books by how much I want to get back to them when I have to put them down to, say, feed the dogs or go to work. 'Altered Carbon' just wasn't a big enough draw for me to finish it.<br />While I liked the protagonist, i really didn't care at all about the mystery he was hired to solve. I thought the interaction between him and the veteran female cop was clumsy. Morgan's writing style is good, but i was jarred one too many times by being thrust into a scene that took 2 or 3 pages to understand.<br />Morgan shows promise so I will definitely check out his next offering. I'm just totally indifferent to this one.
B000083E79|5.0|Wow, Another Cher CD! With all my favorites, this CD is a must have for Cher Fans &amp; collectors alike. The Music is fantastic , Cher is real and is absolutely awesome! I recommend this CD to everyone. Once you put it in your CD player you will play it over &amp; over Again.
B00000064G|5.0|From start to finish it doesn't get much better then this CD.<br />It's the kind of dark dreariness that sucks you in wanting more and more.  The CD is very short, so it always leaves you wanting just that.
B00005JLK1|4.0|Ghost Ship is one gigantic cliche.  The group of people I watched it with had everybody pegged for their fates long before anything happened, but yet, we all still enjoyed it.  In a superficial, let's eat popcorn and have a non-cerebral evening type of way, this movie was A LOT of fun.<br />My advice?  Don't think too much and just go with it.  Ghost Ship will take you for a predicatable thriller ride.  It's about a group of people that specialize in recovering shipwrecks and pirating their contents.  They learn of a mysterious ship that disappeared back in the 60's and they go seek it out at the recommendation of the newest crewmen.  Needless to say, they find it.  From there, the story spins out of control - people die, people live, people drown.  <br />A couple of interesting points . . . <br />*The first few minutes of the movie get you interested right away.  In a macabre, gross, OH MY GAWD THAT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN sort of way, the opening scene sets the whole mood.<br />*There are quite a few scenes reminiscent of Kubrick's The Shining (my friends and I kept screaming, \\"Don't do it Jack!\\")  I'm not sure if it's a style thing or a plot thing or both, but Gabriel Byrne's character was a throwback to Jack Torrance.  One way or another, the script writer and director had some inspiration.  <br />*Ghost Ship has one of the BEST action/horror sequences I've seen in years.  The little girl onboard is helping Julianna Margulies' character, and she 'shows' her what made the ship go all spooky-like.  It's a solid few minutes of gore, but it's intense and the soundtrack is perfectly played in time to the actions.  We squealed, we laughed, we winced.  It was great - the highlight of the entire movie.<br />So all in all, I liked this.  Yes, I know I shouldn't have, but I did.  It's not the highest quality thing you've ever seen - not even close - but for a no-brainer, this fits the bill perfectly.  Happy Viewing!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Great story, great picture. It may be difficult for children, but, I would strongly recommend it.<BR>Also, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; and &quot;Nausicaa of valley of wind&quot; are wonderful movie which are produced by Hayao Miyazaki. Miyazaki always says how we can live in nature in his movie.
B00005YU1O|2.0|Waking Life contains plenty of beautiful artwork, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.  But what has the potential to be an intellectually stimulating movie turns out to be a pseudo-intellectual bore.  All of the ideas brought up and examined throughout this piece are unoriginal pop-culture ravings, probably written by a film student who has never read a philosophy book in his life but believes himself to be enlightened due to all the pot he smokes.  At least that's the impression I got. I see the writer of this film as an intellectual equivalent of the character Luzhin, from Dostoevsky's &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, a fool who attempts to impress people by memorizing supposedly intelligent, long quotes, and then repeating those quotes to others.  Waking life examines modern science, but doesn't question its premises.  It brings up the issue of religion, but rather than questioning religion, the film attempts to combine what is popularly believed in religion with what is popularly believed in science without justification.  Perhaps if you're in junior high and have brain damage, this film might get you thinking.
0064471837|5.0|This book is a combination of adventure and fantasy mixed into a perfect mix. I read this book and continued reading the sequal Lireal: Daughter of the Clayr. Garth Nix puts the book into a interesting read and interesting book. Read this book and you will re-read it because of the goodness of it.
0385335482|5.0|Confessions Of A Shopoholic is a very funny book. It starts out with \\"OK...DON\\"T PANIC it's only a Visa bill I know exactly how much I spent this month aroud 300 pounds or 400 acctually come to think of it that posh rug was 250.\\" The book goes on like that, it is vry fun any funny how this girl who is ironicly a financial jurnalist gets out of her debt situations and manages to look professional. The first book is probably the best in my opinion, there is also \\"Shopoholic Takes MAnhatten\\" where she moves to New York with her boyfriend and \\"Shopoholic Ties the knot\\" which I am reading right now ( not literaly of course) where she gets married and plans this huge expensive wedding. Even if you don't live in England with english money(Pounds) or know any of those English desinger shops, you will still get it and soon you will be saying \\"Hey can you lend me 20 quid?\\" (slang for pounds like bucks is for dollars) The book also isn't all about shopping the girl also has a personal life ans A best friend who she shares an appartment or flat with. It is also hilarious how she does absolutly no work but still manages to try to look professional and say financial things that make sense when really she knows  just as much about finance as you and me.. unless you are a financial journalist and well then...you've screwed up my point. the main character, Becky is very hilarious and careless and clumsy (like me) and she is really fun to read about. Every girl should read this, not guys really...
B00008973A|1.0|If you've never seen A Chorus Line do yourself a favor and try to catch it when it invariably tours around the country. What you'll see is an innovative, (particularly for the time when it was conceived) edgy show. Unfortunately little to none of that &quot;edge&quot; or energy translates to this lackluster, useless film. Michael Douglas' role, which in the stage version could arguably be reduced to nothing more than a voice on the theater's sound system, is here nonsensically heightened, tragically altering the major thrust of the stage show.  What is supposed to be a peek into the motivations, loves and fears of otherwise &quot;faceless&quot; Broadway talent is turned into a star vehicle for a woefully miscast star.<br />Bottom line: find a touring company of the stage show to experience this story. What's featured in the film is a travesty.
B000003AEB|5.0|This is Snoop's 1st and his best CD.Back in the time when he was signed on Death Row Records.ya better buy this one cause it's a must have CD,Ya Heard me ?! 5 times platinum .My favourites are What's My Name,Lodo Dodi,Pump Pump,Murder Was The Case,Tha Shiznit,and also the G-Funk Intro. Go & BuY it !!! also buy Da Game Is To Be Sold,Not To Be Told from Snoop Dogg
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is an excellent translation of a loved book into a good movie.  Perhaps I am too old (being 50 this year) but I think the reviews posted miss the point.  I have read the books.  The movie does an amazingly good job of translating a complex story to movie form.  I have seen too many book to screen translations that did not work.   The screenwriter has an unusual sympathy for characters and with the director/editor does a great job of communicating the story as well at setting the stage for future stories.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Chicago: loud, brassy, poignant, fast-paced, innovative -- and I want to see it again and again. I reluctantly saw Chicago.Yes, I heard the great 'buzz' and love musicals but many movie musicals are'stagey,' talkie and cursed with big name miscasts (just think: Hello Dolly). They struggle to transform stage musicals to the screen in different (often flawed) ways...and wind up bloated and boring. I knew Bob Fosse's original play was a monster hit on Broadway nearly 30 years ago, but assumed the musical score would not be as great as Kander & Ebb's greatest hit score, Cabaret -- mainly, because I had never heard it.<br /> I was wrong, wrong WRONG.<br /> Chicago is anything but NOT boring or dumb. Generation X will enjoy it as much as old fogies (like me). It roars through its roughly two hours running time like the Chicago L, from opening seconds to climatic show stopper. This adult musical about how two women get literally get away with murder while tirelessly pursuing fame translates a 20th century musical package into a highly entertaining, compelling and solid form, as a realistic 21st century movie. It boasts wonderful, tuneful period-influenced musical numbers. Above all, Chicago is NOT a film that screeches 'THIS A STAGE MUSICAL FILMED ON A SOUND STAGE' .<br /> Rather than have main characters breaking into song (which I LIKE in most cases by the way), songs here are either musical numbers done on a stage in a theater or fantasies of musical numbers. The result: this movie that could stand alone as an admittedly short dramatic piece if all the musical numbers were cut out. Cabaret did this quite successfully too but then the concept disappeared.<br /> Although I fully understand the reaction of purists who want to see a filmed version of stage play, Chicago succeeds on so many levels I find very little to criticize here. A partial<br />list of superlatives would include such things as:<br />--EDITING: There are countless cuts to reality and fantasy, quickly changing from fantasy sight and sound to reality sight and sound, cuts from scene to scene, from angle to angle Just imagine NYPD Blue's film editors on too much caffeine. The result: a more gripping film.<br />--MUSIC ORCHESTRATIONS: Most are done by the 'theater's' jazz orchestra, giving it a period sound, a musical flamboyance that honors (and I think helps popularize) that era's zippy musical style.<br />--CASTING: Hey, not one role miscast. A FIRST for a movie musical!!!<br />--QUALITY OF ACTING; All acting superb. Standout performance: Queen Latifah, in her role as the prison matron, Mama. Her natural, multi-layered acting and her charismatic song performance are highly satisfying. Second standout performance (and most recognized) John C. Reilly, as the throw-away husband. Richard Geer is topnotch in vaudeville fantasy songs and acting segments, as the sleazy lawyer. Catherine Zeta-Jones oozes sexuality and pizzazz as Renee, nearly walking away with the flick. She's supremely paired with Renee Zellweger, who displays incredibly versatile acting depth.<br /> The city of Chicago is known as the Second City but the movie Chicago will increasingly be considered among the top musicals ever filmed. It's stature -- and influence -- will increase as time goes on.ing from fantasy sight and sound to reality sight and sound, cuts from scene to scene, from angle to angle Just imagine NYPD Blue's film editors on too much caffeine.

0517548232|5.0|Economics in One Lesson elucidates the basic principles of Economics in a simple, understandable language. If you are just starting out on economics, I would recommend this as your first book. College Textbooks will bore you and treatise like Human Action by L.W. Mises are pretty hard for a beginner. <br />Also, be sure to give this book to your children. Schools don't teach economics, a most important of subjects. <br />With that said, I would like to comment on many 1 star reviews. Notice how they don't comment on the content of the book. Economics is a Science, and it is better to put away your Political Glasses when studying it.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I love this cd and own it.BARBRA STREISAND sounds like LINDA EDER.SINCE most of you own this cd.Now you can buy BROADWAY MY<BR>WAY BY LINDA EDER.
B000060MMI|5.0|Often times a band's sophmore album is their kiss of death.  Not so with Flogging Molly and their album Drunken Lullabies.  It is as brilliant and catchy and fun as Swagger.  The title track and track 6, \\"Rebels of the Sacred Heart\\" are classic FM.  Track 8, \\"Cruel Mistress\\" is a great pirate song.  \\"Death Valley Queen\\" is a ballad, Flogging Molly style.  My favorite track may be \\"Another Bag of Bricks\\" with its easter flair.  Flogging Molly have proved themselves once again!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I must say Nora Jones not just her music is brilliant, so relaxing she is too a real beauty!!!I fell inlove to her and her music!!!Magnificent!!!
B00008J2DQ|3.0|After hearing \\"Straight Out Of Line\\", I thought this whole album was gonna be [bad]. When I bought the album I was surprised.  The album only has 4 [bad] songs and the rest are decent.  THey are different.  They are more optomistic, they are no longer angry at the world.  That is good.  Even though there first two albums were better, I still like this album.  I think the [poorest] songs on here are Straight Out Of Lne and I F*cking Hate You(kinda reminds me of She Hates Me). THe have lightened up on there sound a little bit.  LIke I said this album [isn't] totally [bad] but it could have been better.  Here are a list of my opinions on favorite's and least favorites.<br />Favorites:<BR>1. I Am-the best song on here and possibly my favorite Godsmasck song. This is a song about drugs.  Sourta sounds like a faster paced Forgive Me. The vocals on here are awesome.  Trowards the end  Tony starts a Metallica-like galloping guitar riff.<BR>2. Serenity-My second favorite song on here. It features Sully's vocals accomponied by acoustic guitars, conga drums, and a string arrangement.  THis is a pretty big step for Godsmack. It is very good.  Very Eastern sounding.<BR>3. Dead and Broken- a good song that sourta sounds like Mistakes. I think it is about Layne Staley.. I could be wrong.<BR>4. Faceless- starts off with a guitar through a wah pedal. Pretty fast paced.<BR>5. Releasing the Demons-not a lot to say but a very good track<br />Least Favorites:<BR>1-Straight out of Line-The guitar is good but it siounds like it was written in 5 minutes.  The lyrics are boring.  Wortst song on here<BR>2. I F*cking Hate you- starts off like Mistakes then goes to something like Keep Away.  The lyrics are [poor].<br />The other songs on here are o.k.  All in all this is an ok album.
B00008URYM|5.0|I respect Madonna for the fact that she has the balls to release something you dont hear from any other mainstream artist. Only Madonna can bring to the forefront such a brilliant piece of art. The song is excellent. Excellent electro-clashy beats!! Thank you again Madonna!! The Die Another Day remix is a very very hot thumping club track which hasnt been released till now. The best remix of the song finally sees the light!!
B00006AW2G|5.0|There is no contest here. No need to mention any other albums like I do in other reviews. Sure, Exile on Main Street is a classic, in addition to Sticky Fingers and Beggar's Banquet, and all are very consistent. Yet nothing rivals Let It Bleed. It is up there with The White Album, Dark Side of the Moon, and Who's Next? as the greatest albums of all-time. It is no doubt the Stones at their finest. How many classics are on this album?<BR>       Gimme Shelter is a hard-rocking tune (one of my favorites) about striving towards peace and love, written at the time of the Vietnam War in 1968. Love In Vain is blues-Stones at their finest, and rivals most of the blues songs ever written by any artist. The title track, Let It Bleed, is a catchy, typical Stones song, but obviously rises above most of them. Let's not forget Midnight Rambler, which is a true 7 minute epic, complete with a tempo change and a sweeeet drumbeat change that I just can't get enough of. Of course, You Can't Always Get What You Want finishes off the album on an AMAZING note, and remains one of the Stones most well-known, gospel-influenced, epics (clocking in at near 8-minutes).  <BR>           When it comes to classics, this is about as classic as they get. Everyone knows it is widely regarded as a masterpiece, and it is easy to see why. Let It Bleed remains a milestone in rock history, and is one of the greatest albums ever made.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|This is of course the only animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture in the Academy Awards (aka Oscars).  At the time, it was rather exciting.  Now most people agree that the movie isn't worthy of such an honor.  Many Disney (and other studios) have issued movies that work better on many different levels.  Is this classic Disney?  Not by a long shot.<br />Part of the reason I was displeased with the DVD is how junked up it is with \\"Special Features\\".  Regular readers of my reviews (Thank you, Ladies!) will note that I am opposed to the inclusion of such supplementary material.  If the movie can't stand on it's own, then what good is it?  I mean, please, a 'work in progress' version of the movie??  How many times is someone going to watch that?<br />The songs in this movie will never be regarded as standards the way many older Disney film songs have.  And I have always had a problem with the subject matter, which involves human and beast falling in non-platonic love.  It is a bit of a weird situation, even in a cartoon, to force upon children who are just learning about \\"how things work\\" (if you know what I mean).  On a positive note, I happen to love Angela Lansbury, so her exquisite vocal talents are much appreciated.  I hope to age as gracefully as her.
B00000AOUD|5.0|This is not only the greatest Jethro Tull album ever made, but it is quite possibly my favorite album of all time. It followed the trend of long, extended tracks that was occurring around that period, and this album shows that J-Tull truly masters the elongated formula. Not only is it exquisitely progressive, it is perhaps their most progressive album next to Songs From the Wood, or possibly Heavy Horses. The band never sounded tighter than it did here. The stalls they execute about 5 minutes in to the first track are simply amazing. Martin Barre has an excellent guitar solo on the first track and John Evan certainly shines on the keys as well. <BR>      On first listen, one might not be able to recognize how many different parts of the suite recur at different times on the album. And, at some times, they alter the music just a little bit so it is the same line, only in a different time, or a minor instead of a major key. <BR>       Though it may not be a concept album, as it is cracked up to be, it nevertheless has exceptional lyrics. If one would take the time to read the liner notes, the words are about as good as they get. <BR>     With such a wonderful album, it truly is disappointing that the radio version is cut down to a mere three minutes out of a total of just about 50 minutes. If Tull fands don't have this already - hell, if any rock fan doesnt have it - it is a definite, won't-steer-you-wrong buy. Make sure you can experience one of the greatest albums in history.
B00008J4P5|5.0|It's so great that if I could I'd give it more then 5 stars! Meg and Jack White are fabulous on this album made in London in one week using equipment all predating 1963. It gives hope to everyone out there tired of the same old-same old. It shows that their is hope in new music and that it can be just as exciting as it was back in the 60s.    I love all the tracks and have no specific favorites (though they're many standouts) so I've decided to say a little about each one  1. Seven Nation Army- This is the one song from the CD that I've heard on the radio. With a great drone of a drum beat and singing about \\"Bleeding in front of the lord\\" and \\"Making the sweat drip out of every pore\\" it's great. Plus Jack White says the title came from him mis-pronouncing Salvation Army as a kid.  2. Black Math- This song is one of the fastest and most catchy on the album. You an hardly here it without starting to dance  3. There's No Home For You Here- It's hard not to love this song about a guy who's getting tired of his girls antics and is \\"only wating for the right time tell you that it's impossible to get along with you.\\" One of the times the chourus even sounds like something out of the Yellow Submarine movie.  4. I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself- This cover of the Burt Bacharach song starts out slow nd melodious and then becomes hard rocking and quck.   5. In The Cold, Cold Night- Meg's solo debut. Jack said that when he was making the CD he decided he would have to write a song for Meg to sing. It's very seductive nd sounds very suitable for Meg's low key singing. Excellant strumming from Jack.    6. I Want To Be The Boy...- \\"What kind of cart wheels do I have to pull? What kind of jokes should I lay out loud?\\" asks Jack and odviously he's trying to get the attention from some young girl, but she's ignoring him by \\"ripping out his page in the telephone book\\".         7. You've Got Her In Your Pocket- This song is very soft, but very subtely tells the story of a boy who's got a girl caged up in his pocket. Odviously he desn't want this girl to leave him.         8. Ball And Biscuit- On this, the most bluesy and maybe the most fun song on the CD. Jack brags tha he's the \\"seventh son\\". He claims that he actually he is the seventh son. The guitar work on this song is amazing. He rips through these compex sounding guitar chords in a way that would almost rival the late Jimi endrix. It's fast paced and great.  9. The Hardest Button To Button-  The song starts out sounding ike a throwaway track, but turns out to be one of the best on the CD. Jack White raps about how his mother had a baby in 1981 who they gave a ray gun and how he had opinions that didn't matter and a brain that felt like pancake batter. It's classic.        10. Little Acorns- This song starts out with a news cast that could have been on NPR (was it?) about a woman with many problems who watched a squirrel gathering acorns and decided that if the squirrel could she could too. The song goes on with a hard rock beat and Jack talks about how you should \\"take all your problems and rip them apart. Oww. Oww. Oww.\\"  11. Hypnotise- \\"I want to hypnotise you, baby, on the telephone,\\" sings Jack and he sounds earnest.          12. The Air Near My Fingers- Great song. Jack says: \\"Life is so boring. It's really got me snorng. Wearing out the floor at a cheap hotel.\\" Great lyrics.       13. Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine- Sounds like a Hives song in the bginning with the \\"WooHoos\\" and almost could be. It's ripping ad roaring and has great lyrics to boot.        14. It's True That We Love One Another- This song incorporated British star Holly Golighty in the pretend circumstances that Jack and Holly are in love and arguing and Meg is breaking up their argument. Ends with Holly saying: \\"Jolly good then Bruce. Let's celebrate.\\" Can't hide that British pride!
B00005JKDQ|4.0|this was one of the best animated films I have seen in a long time.  The animation is excellent and the voices by John Goodman and Billy Crystal are hilarious.  The general story is as follows: the monsters scare children in order to collect their screams which they use to power their world (pretty much like electricity) but then a little girl gets loose in the monster world and all hell breaks loose with very amusing results.  One of my favourite parts of the movie would be the monster play at the end of the movie entitled &quot;Put that thing back where it came from or so help me&quot;. Its a musical. In conclusion, top notch stuff.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I love this DVD.  It is very wonderful and has a lot of special features and is a wonderful movie.
B00005QZWI|5.0|it's awesome! we played the symphonic suite in orchestra and i fell in love w/the music and i just had to buy the cd. if you haven't seen the movie, you need to! after you've seen the movie and heard the music, you see how all of the emotions tie in. i'm a fan of odd mesures and a knife in the dark is in 5/4. it seems as if shore was a character in the movie and writing the score while he acted. definently better than pearl harbor and that was awesome.
B000002H97|4.0|This CD is around the time when Metallica evolved into a more regular, standard metal band from their previous thrash days. This CD has many good songs . . . actually, Kirk Hammet's guitar solos are just as good as ever, James Hetfield appears to have picked up a more involved singing voice, etc. One thing I didn't really like too much was how the fast, lightning guitar riffs and drum lines have essentially disappeared. Lars on this album tends to go with more slow, heavy beats. Jason does a good job however with bass lines in place of the late Cliff Burton (R.I.P.) Overall, this CD isn't bad, and I reccomend it, but for some true Metallica, go with either Kill 'Em All or Master of Puppets.<br />Best of this album: Wherever I May Roam, The God That Failed, Sad But True, and Of Wolf and Man.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Chen Kaige's \\"The King of Masks\\"? I hate to say this, but compare to \\"The Road Home,\\" \\"The King of Masks\\" is more like a collaboration of film students. And it's not by Chen Kaige neither.<br />I would like to say that I have been very disappointed by Mr. Zhang's works in the past 10 years or so, and that includes his latest work,\\"Hero.\\" \\"The Road Home,\\" however, is absolutely one of the best examples of today's Chinese Cinema. Even though the film is an adaptation of the short story \\"My Father, My Mother,\\" it is totally cinematic. Check out the composition and camera movements in EVERY single shot, and you'll see what Zhang's art is really about. Compare to Chen Kaige (\\"Life on A String,\\" \\"Farewell My Concubine\\"), Zhang's view towards Chinese society is limited, his political position immature. But when dealing with little people in their daily lives, Zhang is indeed the best. Five stars for making me weep five times while watching this film.
B00005NWM3|3.0|Yes, indeed ! The first of many ! I'm not talking about records here, but bands that sound the same. Yes, Nickelback has managed to sell a lot of records so good ol' Chad decided to start his own label or something. To this day, he managed to sign 2 (that I know of) bands that sound exactly like his band. To think it all started with Silver Side Up. I'm not saying Nickelback is bad, I'm just saying I don't need 20 bands sounding like this. Sure, the songs all have the same formula. Creed got away with it, with can't Nickelback ?<br />You've got to take Silver Side Up for what it is, a good rocking CD. Not a great one, not a bad one. In between. Never Again is a good rocking song, it only lacks some passion. The guy is talking about domestic violence, he should scream his anger out. Woke Up This Morning may not have the best lyrics, but it rocks. Just For is another song that talks about some kind of violence, I think... You may not care about the lyrics (like me) but it rocks. Same with Money Bought... Ok, I have to admit that you may get tired of some songs here. I'm not going to name any because it could be any one of them.<br />Don't buy this thinking you'll get all How You Remind Me tracks. It's the slowest song on the album, after Good Times Gone. Don't buy this thinking you'll get all Too Bad tracks either. It's one of the best rocking tracks, meaning you'll probably like it better than the others. Buy this if you want good rocking music. Not great rocking music, not bad rocking music. Good. And don't buy the clones.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Back in January 2000, I reviewed this box set here (see \\"If You Liked the TV Special, You'll Love This!\\"). 3 years later, many Beatles fans' prayers (including my own) have been answered with the release of this video library in DVD form. Rather than resay what I said back then, I just thought I'd write with a different perspective. The opening statement is from the liner notes of Derek Taylor, who served as the Beatles' press agent.<br />To answer a recent review, here's what's on it: performances of the Beatles live in concert and television performances (not complete concerts), some original videos, narrated by Sir Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, the late George Harrison (who was still around during the making of this documentary) and the late John Lennon (his comments are culled by old interviews), excerpts from early recordings, studio outtakes, press conferences and all 5 of their movies and finally, over 30 complete Beatles tracks (By the way, \\"Real Love\\" is included in this edition).<br />The sound quality is superior here than the original VHS (and you have the option of LPCM Stereo, Dolby Digital surround sound and DTS 5.1 surround sound). You also have the option of subtitles in English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese (Brazilian and European). Just don't expect your Linguistics teachers to be impressed with how many French or Spanish words you learned while watching this!<br />It is a bit of a shame that individual tracks weren't assembled for complete songs. Oh well, a minour disappointment! Keep in mind that the 8 video VHS box set was actually pricier than the 5 DVD box set back when it was released in 1996 (I remember paying over [money] for mine!).<br />Then of course, there's the Special Features DVD. In addition to the \\"Real Love\\" video (which wasn't included on the original VHS edition), there's a segment in which Paul, George and Ringo all gather together in 1994 to discuss the old days and jam out on old songs. The 3 are also featured here in 1995 discussing with George Martin, their producer, the choosing of different outtakes on the 3 Anthology CD's and studio techniques they used during the original recording sessions. Paul, George and Ringo also discuss with Jeff Lynne how a Beatles mini-\\"reunion\\" took place with 2 John Lennon demos (\\"Free As a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\"). Also, there's a section on how many hours of interviews and classic footage came together for this documentary and a feature on how the \\"Free as a Bird\\" video was made.<br />Give yourself at least 2 weeks to enjoy as Derek Taylor once put it these \\"10 hours of unchallengable evidence\\" of the Beatles' legacy, which continues even to this day.
B000089RVX|5.0|Okay, we all know the routine....a decent new song plays on the radio, gets our attention and we are suckered into spending our cash on the CD just to get junk.  This is NOT the case with the Fallen album from Evanescence. Their music, a combination of rock/goth/alternative styles really hits the mark and is quite fresh.  From the crunchy guitar riffs, ballads, piano, violins, and Amy Lee's beautiful voice, their music brings a sound that is all their own, not a copy of the latest top 10 wannabe band. Not since Janes Addiction released Nothings Shocking have I enjoyed an album so much.  Highly recommended.  I hope their next release is just as exciting.
B000089A07|2.0|RALPH FIENNES shines as the doomed \\"Dee\\" - a child twisted by adult perversions now exacting his own brand of retribution on society ~ possibly one of the finest realizations an actor can give of a soul truly in Hell. EMILY WATSON is another pleasant whiff of originality as the hadicapped woman hopelessly in love with our doomed hero [villian?] ~ she never disappoints. EDWARD NORTON - exquisitely sensitive as the retired semi-psychic [?] FBI-Agent, Harvey Keitel? Crusty and perfect as the his ex-boss. Philip Seymor Hoffman - quite creepy - creepier than Fiennes as the bottom feeding scandal reporter who is justly makes final hot news.<br />So, what's the problem? Dated, so dated script ..... almost a retread of Robert Bloch's 'PSYCHO' give or take a modern tune here or there and a few startling sexual moments between Ms. Warson and Mr. Fiennes ~ mildly unnecessary for her prim character. The original \\"Manhunter\\" moves to a better pace - so EXCEPT for Hannibals \\"Titus-Like\\" opening dinner very hum-drum and rather predictable.<br />Recommended though for Mr. Feinne's fine performance!!
B0000797IO|3.0|A crew of good actors is lost in the often swampy scenario of The Good Girl. The basic principle--that people can be moved to dumb acts by boredom/dissatisfaction--is good enough. But the film tries too hard to be too many things. At moments it's a comedy; at other moments, it's dark. The humor is brought along by Zooey Deschanel's terrifically irreverent performance--applying Kabuki-like makeup to hapless customers and delivering nutty, unheard PA announcements to store customers. John C. Reilly is sweetly unpredictable as Aniston's good-natured, ...smoking, clunkhead husband. The camera loves Aniston and she's intriguing to watch; it's just not entirely clear who she's supposed to be--she doesn't quite manage to inhabit the character of Justine to the extent that she's believably almost as much of a clunkhead as her husband. And unlike his astonishing performance in Donnie Darko, Gyllenhaal just doesn't pull it off this time. He's not at all sympathetic. Again, he plays off the surface of Holden, without burrowing in deep to bring enough to the character to make us care. See this film for Zooey; she's hilarious and delivers the only completely three-dimensional character.
B00005B6C9|5.0|i've been waiting 25 years for the bee gees to again find the genius that infused their first few albums. this is it! excellent songwriting, excellent harmonizing, excellent everything. if this is their swan song, they went out in the best of style.
B00004VWAF|5.0|The deeper I dig into Miles Davis' material, the more I realize that &quot;Kind of Blue,&quot; though a popular favorite, only scratched the surface of brighter, better, and bolder things to come.  Of all the albums released during his incredible &quot;electric&quot; era, 1972's &quot;On the Corner&quot; remains a personal favorite among many listeners, including myself.  The album basically throws everything but the kitchen sink into the mix, coming up with a simmering brew of jazz, soul, and a few flashes of rock that clearly helped serve as a blueprint for hip hop and electronica.  If 1969's &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; forewarned that Miles Davis was venturing in a new musical direction, then &quot;On the Corner&quot; makes good on that promise.  The disc's free-flowing spirit and spontaneity may (and already have) put off some, but if you can open your mind as wide as can be, then you'll appreciate &quot;On the Corner&quot; as a step ahead for the talented trumpeter.  Miles Davis never pandered to his audience by delivering more of the same.  This album, like much else in his extensive catalogue, is a testament to his genius.
B000089RVX|5.0|Everyone has heard &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and it's an incredible song.  I am glad to report that the entire album is great.  The two songs on the Daredevil soundtrack (which is also a great album) are standouts, but the album is solid from beginning to end.  I think it's refreshing to hear a rock band fronted by a women, especially when it's a person like Amy Lee who has such an incredible voice.  My favorites include Tourniquet, Haunted, Taking Over Me, and My Last Breath.  <br />Next to Linkin Park's Meteora, this is the best rock album of the year.  A great debut for the band from Arkansas--who knew?
B00005V3Z4|5.0|this film has to be one of the greatest films of all time. it has a clever story and characters you can relate to in real life, except frank the giant bunny which is a clever thing in its own way. If you don't own this film buy it NOW. it's a must see and a must own all round for everyone. The basic storyline is a boy who sleep walks and sees a giant bunny called frank telling him the world is going to end. It has a lot to do with time travel....
0316666343|4.0|Having heard of the basis of the book, I bought it to have my cage rattled a little.   And it did just that.  As a new mom, I cried like a baby by the time I got to page 31.  Then I set it down.  I finally mustered the courage to continue on with the heartbreaking scenario, and didn't put it down until I finished.<BR>Again, as a new mom, it may have touched me more profoundly than it would have before I had a child, but still, I was touched nonetheless.<br />I felt the book moved along rapidly and the most memorable part of it, for me, was the character of the victims father.  His pain and frustration could be felt.  And I think Daddy's and their little girls have something special that no one can comprehend and that rang through on this novel.  <br />I don't mind the fantasy part of it all, the \\"ghost\\" theme as I have read in criticisms, as it is, in its essence, fantasy.  My only disappointment was the fate of Mr. Harvey.  It seemed rushed and a bit like an after thought.  It was as if the author got tired and impatient with writing that it just had to end.  I wished his fate had as much dimension around it as the rest of the book had.<br />I felt \\"heavy\\" while reading the book, and I like any book that can make me FEEL something. <br />All in all, I enjoyed the book.  Though disappointed a bit by the aforementioned, I still walked away from it with a whole new thinking about \\"life after death\\".  It is not a book I'll forget anytime soon, I'm glad I read it, and I'll pass it around my circle of reading freinds without shame.
0743244249|5.0|There are a lot of people who say that DeLillo doesn't create characters, but rather automatons that spit out obscure theses.  These are the same people that think that Platonic dialogues are about what Plato thought rather than what Athens was.  DeLillo's characters are not mouthpieces; the ideas these characters voice are indications of the ordering -- or disordering -- of their souls.  Like Plato, DeLillo is probing the emotional life of ideas.<br />Eric Packer, the protagonist, is the epitome of the class of get-rich-quick internet tycoons that came about in the 90s.  What marks him as a member of this class is his faith in the power of information technology to predict the future and thus make the future bend to the will of the present.  His lusts and manias are a diagnosis of a certain overreaching mindset from which we have not entirely freed ourselves.<br />However, what distinguishes Eric from his class is that his faith in information technology amounts to being a real religious devotion.  Eric is a continuation of DeLillo's investigation into modern manifestations of the desire for religious trascendence.  To paraphrase DeLillo, when the old God leaves the world, what happens to all the leftover faith?  Eric clings to computer screens the way people once clung to holy texts.  In his delusion, he experiences information as a communion with the whole of reality as such: reading a computer screen, he thinks, &quot;Here was the heave of the biosphere.  Our bodies and oceans were here, knowable and whole.&quot;<br />But he is also a sort of Oedipus.  He does not know who he is.  His turn towards technology is a way of escaping something in himself, a past that haunts him.  In the end, the book is a story about a man losing his faith and rediscovering, for better and for worse, all the things from which his faith was an escape.<br />To be sure, this novel is not for everyone.  For one thing, DeLillo never really decides whether he wants his fiction to be placedin a realistic or theoretical landscape -- is this our world or some imagined, symbolic world?  Perhaps in 50 years we will thank him for refusing to make such a distinction, but for now, the book strains one's ability and willingness to become attuned to it.  At the same time, he is moving away from the Joycean lushness of his earlier style towards a Beckettian starkness that many readers will find taxing.  <br />Nevertheless, the book is special for refusing to be what a book is supposed to be.  Like the later experimental work of John Coltrane, Cosmopolis is at once exhausting and invigorating.
B00005RIKD|5.0|The last Sting concert I saw was his opening weekend in Vegas of the BND tour.  It was before I bought the album.  When I did, I remember thinking that the concert versions were better than the album versions.  This attitude was reflected in this live concert recording.  These songs are almost completely reworked and most sound better than the original album versions.<BR>  The musician in me greatly appreciates that Sting doesn't let his music stagnate.  Each of the songs sounds fresh.  &quot;All This Time&quot; sounds better than ever, I love the new beat.  &quot;Roxanne&quot; is great in this setting.  I also loved &quot;The Hounds of Winter&quot;, the only song from Mercury Falling represented.  It was perfectly stark and cold.  Also &quot;Mad About You&quot; has always been one of my favorites and is one of the standouts on the album, but you can only hear it on the imports.  Please buy the import version.  The domestic release isn't near as good with three of the best songs missing!  (Why does that happen anyway?) Finally &quot;Fragile&quot; gets the single status it should have had all along.  It is one of Sting's best songs and perfectly reflected the somber mood of the day.  The version of &quot;Brand New Day&quot; here is better than the album version and much closer to the concert version I remember. There isn't a single song that I don't love here, each one is fantastic.<BR>  All in all, I really appreciate that Sting surrounds himself with talented people and continues to release thoughtful music.  His ability to adapt and rework and improve proves he is a true musician and not just a pop/rock star.  This album certainly won't take the place of Sting's earlier albums in my collection, but it is a wonderful addition.
B00005614N|5.0|Wow! Was this recorded yesterday? It sounds just like that. Now, this is what I call listening to the Duke playing in your own living room. This has all the felling of an after hours jam session, five musicians, relaxing, and enjoying every note they play. When you have the greatest improviser of jazz performing with the greatest composer in jazz, well, you know its a sure bet. I only wish I had known of this album before. Very underrated by the way, since you wont find it in anyone's top list of best jazz albums ever, but it is more than just a casual encounter, these guys knew this meeting was a once in a lifetime shot. Thank you Blue Note!
0375703764|3.0|I made it halfway through Chapter 9 before bailing on this pretentious literary artefact.  Every time the story seems to be going somewhere exciting, we're dumped into a maze (yeah, we *get* it already) of digressions and intrusions.  At some point, the narrator's intrusions begin to read like Letters to Penthouse.  It isn't offensive (that might have actually held my interest); it's just terribly banal.  Every woman this guy meets is some kind of boring two-dimensional bang-doll.  When something outwardly intriguing finally began happening with the main story, and I realized I didn't care, it was time for me to give up.  It's not that there weren't some pay-offs along the way.  The dusty discourse on echoes eventually ties into the story in a clever way.  Maybe everything is in that vein and I'm giving up to soon.  But giving up I am.  May your exploration take you further than mine did.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|Like many other bands Godsmack had a big hit with &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; and made many songs of Faceless sound very much alike.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing because all the songs are listenable.  Great drumming and some awesome guitar solos, not much bass.  But I would definatly recomend this cd to anyone.
B000083E79|5.0|THE CD IS GREAT.BUT IT LACKS A FEW SONGS WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN MENTIONED,AND I'M SUPRISED THEY WEREN'T ON THIS COMPILATION...THE WAY OF LOVE, LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING,WHEN YOU SAY LOVE,ALL I EVER NEED IS YOU,WE ALL SLEEP ALONE,BEAT GOES ON...AND MANY OTHERS...THEY ALL CHARTED...OH WELL,ANYWAY,SOON WE WILL GET A BOX SET SOON ALONG WITH ALL THE RARE GEMS THAT WERE NEVER REALEASED LIKE  'LOVE IN  IN THE AIR'...AND 'DON'T LEAVE ME THIS WAY'...AND SO MANY OTHERS.......5 STARS INDEED!
B00005O5CM|3.0|This is not a fantastic film however it is much better than I predicted, only the elaboration of a very basic plot makes the film work.  <br />It begins with Elle, (Reese Witherspoon) a college student who anticipates receiving a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis). Unfortunately Warner has bigger plans and wishes to study law at Harvard University and only has plans to break up their relationship.  In order to prove that she is not just a stereotypical blonde bimbo with no brains, Elle successfully applies to Harvard whereby she attempts to charm over her ex-boyfriend by proving that she has the brains as well as the body. <br />Apart from annoying girls obsessed with shopping and beauty parlours (hence my connection with Clueless) and the part of Elle being overwhelmingly irritating the film does have some comical parts.  During the film you can also play a game of spot the instantly recognisable B-list actor. You will find yourself shouting aloud: - \\"oh that's the guy from `Titanic'\\" (Victor Garber) and \\"oh he's from hmm can't remember\\" (Luke Wilson)...and \\"oh wasn't he in `Bring it on'\\" (Richard Hillman). \\"Oh, oh and she was in Final Destination\\" (Ali Larter).<br />Many have congratulated Reese Witherspoon on a splendid performance in this film, but I'm not quite entirely sure she was not just playing herself.  I have seen her similar style of acting in American Psycho and one does have to wonder.<br />Nevertheless it is better than your average teen flick film but is not cracked up to be one to remember.
B00001IVOF|5.0|Mobb Deep's style is very distinctive, laden with brooding rhymes and a variety of haunting background noises.  Apocalyptic beats and ominous melodies are poured over crackly, static-production.  Just the right amount to add that urban, dark-street vibe to all the songs.  Though ever track here is decent, &quot;G.O.D. Pt III&quot; and &quot;Hell On Earth&quot; epitomize Mobb Deep's talents for crafting some of the most gut-wrenching, atmospheric songs in the genre.  I'm not a big fan of rap, but I must admit, this is an extremely good album.
0316666343|3.0|This is a novel about a 14 yr. old girl who is the narrator and she does a good job of talking about her life before and after her murder.  Her descriptions of what was going on while in her heaven was supposed to be the most interesting part which is the bulk of the story.  Her \\"heaven\\" was not expanded enough to what it could have been.  Ms. Sebold could have presented a much greater expansion of \\"heaven\\" along with th story of the family.  Mr. Harvey was the bad guy and I believe his \\"end\\" was not really interesting.  His part and his discovery should have been more complete.  This is enjoyable where I read all pages, but not as good as I hoped.
B00006ZXST|3.0|Is this the single-disc or double-disc edition of the DVD movie?
B000000OQF|5.0|I was a wild teenager, always getting involved in violence and adolescent alcohol & drug abuse and I have GNR to thank for this.  Totally manipulated and brainwashed by Axl's voice and Slash's raging guitar riffs I felt dangerous, but yet respected. <BR>This punkish and tearaway attitude eventually calmed down and I stopped listening to GNR and moved on to enjoy other types of music.  <BR>In general, music you liked as a child becomes irritating and embarrassing music (well if you're anything like me).  Though a few days ago I decided to put this album on in my car, driving alone at night, and the music gave me such a buzz, this was definitely not reminiscing, this was solely fantastic Rock music blasting out of my car speakers.  <br />`Welcome to the Jungle' is just every musician's dream of an opener for an album, and really does describe life as it is, has been and always will be. <BR>`It's so easy' demonstrates the very frustration of individuals who find them selves looking after pathetic nonsensical people who just find everything in life arduous.<BR>`Nightrain' is a song which is advisable you don't listen to in a car unless you want to be caught by local authorities for speeding!   <BR>`Mr Brownstone' is just fantastic music, definitely music to aspire to if you're an upcoming wannabe guitarist.  `Paradise City' need I say more?  `Sweet child o'mine' enough said!  `Anything goes' is the perfect metal song that will have your feet tapping and head banging in no time at all.  `Rocket Queen' is ultimately the perfect closure.<BR>  <BR>`Appetite for destruction' is an absolute dream of an album and a copy should be in every soul's home that enjoys music in general.  You don't need to be a musician to appreciate the music, which is awe-inspiring, sleazy and powerfully corrupted! Don't miss out. Buy a little. Live a lot!
B00008BXJF|5.0|Gaining some grasp of the latest work by King Crimson has always been demanding. The earlier iterations of the group took the listener to generally recognizable destinations, moving from classical- and jazz- influenced structures and instrumentation to the seeming perfection of these techniques in the LTA period.  Throughout these evolutionary steps there remained a sense of expressing a consistent aesthetic within a variety of musical ideas. Gregory Karl called this &quot;convergent evolution&quot; in his excellent  essay on Lark's Tongues in Aspic.<br />The version of Crimson that followed this was clearly interested in applying phase music techniques -- another branch of classical, art  or &quot;new&quot; music. The &quot;Discipline&quot; period offered a wide range of ideas, from phase to noise to bringing a more complex level of composition and musicality to shorter, pop forms, successfully balancing the longer, more abstract compositions. Still, you knew what was going on.<br />The recent period -- with the exception of &quot;THRAK&quot;, which is another matter all together -- has been harder to grasp. &quot;Power to Believe&quot;, however, manages to make several things quite clear.<br />First, Crimson has not abandoned theme and development as some seem to think. This music, which continues to incorporate phase techniques, is much more than a wall of sound. The difference here is that &quot;theme and development&quot; are intensely compressed not only within the phase technique,  where things change second by second, but in every other level of the compositions as well. In listening to &quot;Level Five&quot; for example, you'll note that as similar as each module of this piece may seem, virtually nothing is ever repeated in exactly the same way twice. What, in 1972,  took some 9 or 10 minutes to develop is now stated, modified and restated within the space of a few seconds while at the same time being sliced and diced into discrete segments whose interaction provide yet another layer of theme and restatement . While &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; may have made its mark first on the emotions, &quot;Level Five&quot; leaves its mark first on the intellect. Like much of the work on PTB, it is overwhelming in both complexity and restraint -- creating an all-new reconciliation of opposites that stretches to incorporate every element of the music, resulting in a display of profoundly complex and original compositional technique<br />Second, the band is once again playing with sound as well as with music. This is evidenced throughout the record and extends to experimentation with all the instruments, including percussion. At one point the treatments become so pervasive that you' d have to assume the guitars are paying tribute to a pair of Mellotrons. The effect of all this processing and signal treatment is one of adding further dimension to the music, creating a more spacious and detailed soundstage. The music sounds far, far beyond the capabilities of any typical four-piece outfit.<br />Finally, it is time to leave the past behind. There is always the temptation to compare what is here with what once was, but there's really no point. This is a different band. While some of the preoccupations are still familiar -- the music still expresses a kind of despair, and a striving for a kind of redemption -- the tools and techniques are very, very different. Too many times, for too many years,  I've tried to think of this King Crimson in the same way I tend to think of the earlier incarnations. My mistake. When I saw the PTB concert in Seattle a month ago I was greatly relieved that the set included nothing pre-THRAK. As a result, everything made more sense. The more recent music was freer and more powerful when it stood on its own, related but separate. And it gave me the chance to understand some very new ideas about a 34 year old relationship.n provide yet another layer of theme and restatement .

B00008I8IF|4.0|A couple of things are obvious when listening to &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot;.  First of all, the songs are taut and well focused.  There is no excess content or meandering within these songs and this was possibly the intention of the band and or Ethan Johns, as the longest song clocks in at 4:25.  The second thing that strikes me is that the Jayhawks are still very much relevant and this is a very good record.  The record starts out with the Matthew Sweet co-written &quot;Stumbling Through The Dark&quot; and ends with the reprise.  The content inbetween is very solid with &quot;Save It For A Rainy Day&quot;, &quot;Eyes of Sarahjane&quot; &amp; &quot;Tailspin&quot; being early favorites.  If you've been on hiatus from the Jayhawks waiting for the next &quot;Hollywood Town Hall&quot;, now might be a good time to jump back on the bandwagon.
B00005JKZT|5.0|In 1994, when Houghton Mifflin Company published a single copy of The Lord of The Rings, Douglas A. Anderson wrote a `revised note to the text' making it clear that J. R. R. Tolkien's famous epic novel was \\"often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three volumes\\".  The three volumes Anderson referred to, The Fellowship of The Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of The King, were initially developed by the original publishers for purposes of cutting down on the cost of printing (David Colbert, The Magical Worlds of The Lord of The Rings).  According to Colbert it was the publishers who first came up with the title The Two Towers for the second volume.  Given his fascination with and penchant for referring to dozens of important towers within the novel, Tolkien himself wasn't sure which two towers were in fact denoted by the title and was therefore initially unconvinced by the title itself.  However Tolkien eventually conceded and thus the myth of the trilogy of The Lord of The Rings was born.<br />All of this background is not for wont when reviewing Peter Jackson's film version of The Lord of The Rings:  The Two Towers. In spite of following the traditional lead of breaking the story up into three films, he has essentially remained faithful to the text, as faithful as any movie director can be expected to when trying to adapt such an epic to the big screen, by maintaining a continuous uninterrupted flow from the first film to the second.  The Two Towers immediately picks up right where the Fellowship of The Ring leaves off and we are again treated to a movie masterpiece so entrancing and perfectly paced.  The Two Towers is filled with rich three-dimensional characters and plotlines, beautiful performances, and numerous battle scenes amidst breathtaking landscapes.  Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue in their quest to bring the one ring to Mordor and destroy it in the very fires from which it was forged while the rest of the fellowship is split up into several factions in an effort to find their lost friends and take up the fight against the armies of the Dark Lord Sauron and the traitorous Saruman.  New characters are introduced, notably the Ents, Grima Wormtongue, King Theodon and the creature Gollum.<br />The film is undoubtedly mythical, just as Tolkien had intended, but it also more than adequately explores many of the difficult problems and questions Tolkien had examined during his lifetime; the inevitable encroachment of industrialization, and its impact on modern human society; the quest by some for unfettered power over all races; the onslaught of war in order to both provoke and quell that quest; the longing by others for peace and pastoral tranquility; and the endless forging and breaking up of alliances between the different races to achieve or defeat these varying quests.  In many ways Gollum's character is a microcosm of these competing interests, providing much of the film's most vivid and provocative moments and leaving the audience with much to ponder.<br />It is perhaps to their considerable credit and understanding of today's moviegoers that Jackson and his collaborators did not make one nine hour film but don't be surprised when the movie ends and the credits roll if instead you don't find yourself wishing they had.
6304936362|4.0|I have loved this movie since I was about 9 years old. I saw it back in 1991 right after it came out on video. I have been an avide WWII aviation buff and had a grandfather who was a waist-gunner in B-24s, for the 98th bomb group in the North Africa and then the Italy campaign during WWII. I want to make it clear that this movie was not meant to be a remake of the original WWII documentary but simply a story of what it was like to fly on those dangerous missions almost 60 years ago. The film-makers chose to use the name Memphis Belle as an homage to the documentary and because the name had a familiarity to it. This was not meant to be a re-telling of the REAL Memphis Belle's last flight but a fictional tale that simply used that bomber's name! All in all this is an excellent WWII aviation film and an even better Action/adventure film. I recomend it to anyone looking for excitment in a historical context.
B00008A7QK|3.0|I bought this due to an insane desire to hear 'Jeepster' and 'Bang a Gong', so I knew I wasn't in for an all out rock record, but I do feel a bit cheated by the album cover. This record is like 'Ziggy Stardust' with half the zip and almost none of the drama.<BR>On the other hand, the songs do have a certain charm. And yes, I know that David Bowie and producer Tony Visconti pretty much lifted the sound of this record for 'Stardust'. And the filler here generally much better than the filler in Ziggy.
B00008J4P5|5.0|\\"Elephant\\" is an eclectic mix of songs ranging from the auntingly<br />wistful \\"In the Cold Cold Night\\" to the dirty Zeppelinesque blues-<br />rock of the punishing \\"Ball and Biscuit\\".   This Album represents a quantum<br />leap for Jack and Meg White as artists.  White Blood Cells, a fine album<br />in its own right, does not stand up in comparison to this masterpiece<br />of distorted fury.  Where \\"White Blood Cells\\" at its most aggressive<br />caused the blood to boil, \\"Elephant\\" turns the blood to lava.  On<br />this record Jack White uses his extensive study of Hendrixian<br />fury and Zeppelin heavyness to amazing effect. On the third track \\"Theres No Room for You Here\\" White forces<br />you to feel,taste,and breathe his anger towards a former lover<br />whose no longer a physical part of his life but still haunts his<br />thoughts.  He accomplishes this feat with a sudden blast of<br />loud, ear-splitting, raging wave of steroid-ridden blues guita<br />followed by an amazing Queen-inspired wall of heavenly chanting<br />of the songs title with a literally ear splitting laser of feed back<br />screaming hysterically beside it.  By the time the song is over<br />you feel like you've just been placed in the most ravaging of<br />torture chambers and beg to come back for more.  However, the<br />hands-down masterpiece of this album is the opening track<br />\\"Seven Nation Army\\".  Wow.  Heavy bass-sounding intro gives it<br />menacingly heavyness that builds into a cloud of content<br />until it is burst into a thunderstorm of release by a drum rash<br />from the Gods spilling into a rain fall of lightning sharp blues-rock<br />guitar.  The greatest compliment I can give this album besides<br />its impressive versatility, is that it never becomes predictable.<br />Jack White does an amazing job of never allowing the listener<br />to fall into a complacent stupor which in turn makes the album<br />fresher with every listen.  \\"Elephant\\" is Jack White's baby (he wrote13 of the 14 songs, played guitar on all as well as piano on some,also he<br />produces and arranges the music himself) and by the sound<br />of things he's one hell of a father.  With this album (the Stripes' fourth<br />major-label release) the White Stripes separate themselves form<br />their garage-rock contemporaries (The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines etc.) <br />raising the bar for the genre while transcending it at the same<br />time.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Me and my buddie Micheal Jackson cauhght this flick in the cinemas and thought \\"WOW this is the greatest action flick ever!\\" Daniel Radcliffe brings a macho smoldering [handsomeness] to his portrail of Harry Potter the simple minded satanist with his bad bee-yatch sidekick Hermione and gangstar peeps like Ron and Hagrid. Watch him battle evil and score more chicks than Dolemite and Shaft put together!<br />Dis movie is DA BOM!
B00006690G|1.0|\\"Must follow rules. Must stick to content\\" (said in robotic voice). <br />OK, here's the high/lowlights of \\"The Eminem Show\\":<br />\\"White America\\"--Probably the most perceptive and aware track on the CD. Much like the comedy of Chris Rock: Vulgar but intelligent. Which is more than I could say for any other track.<br />\\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\"--I should be paid for having to listen to this therapy session. Better to keep the closet door shut.<br />\\"Drips\\"--I'm sure young, immature junior high kids get a big kick out of this one. If there's anything nastier on the market than this track, I haven't heard it.<br />\\"Without Me\\"--Funny, I didn't think it felt so empty...<br />\\"Sing For the Moment\\"--Highlight of the CD. The Aerosmith backing track, that is, not the rap.<br />\\"Hallie's Song\\"--This is so tender and sensitive. But can't we do without the f-bombs on even this song?<br />\\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\"--Mock scolding from Em's daughter. It goes past crazy to disgusting when explicit sexual references are used by \\"dad\\" in a rap featuring a daughter too young to be exposed to such vulgarity.<br />In total, an overly vulgar effort with not enough socially redeeming value to rate above one star. Has \\"poetry\\" come to this?
B00006CXXU|5.0|After hearing the song &quot;Fighter&quot; and actually seeing the awesome video on MTV I bought the album. What a positive surprise! I did not expect the album to be so deep with so many different songs, each representing a different musical direction. Great job Christina! The album is fantastic and I can recommend it to anyone who enjoys a wide variety with powerful songs and wonderful ballads.
B000002MJR|5.0|This is just a great live recording.  Especially love &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; - much more sensual and evocative than the studio recording, especially with the piano riffs throughout.  Live recording of &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; is classic DS - a must hear.  So worth the money that you invest in this CD.
0140067477|5.0|This book is a wonderfully written treatise on Taoism expressed in a manner that we can all easily understand. You don't need to be a Pooh fan or a Taoist expert to appreciate the book, but you'll probably become more interested in both after you read the book. I've read a lot around Taoism and it's easy to see that Hoff's summary in this book is not the most academic I've ever read. It's not necessarily the most practical either, but it does allow you to visualise certain of the more esoteric notions in a manner familiar to us all. Like most of the books that I really love, this one has been a popular gift item in my friends' stockings over the past few years. I hope you enjoy it.
0679805273|2.0|Like his posthumous 'Daisy', 'Places' lacks the zing, the excitement, the otherworldliness of his classics.<br />The strength in 'Places' is the message, which is OK - fairly new and simple, but eventually boring - not ennobling, like 'Lorax'.<br />The drawings are weak, comparatively empty and labored.  Compare to 'Sleep Book', which is a completely engrossing new world at every turn.
B00008AWOD|4.0|Placebo's style has remained pretty much the same throughout their entire career with only a few minor changes put in every album. Like others said, Sleeping With Ghosts is an improvement upon the mediocre Black Market Music but it is still far from outshining Placebo's best album which is Without You I'm Nothing. It is also far from being a classic album but Placebo fans, as well as fans of Britpop or contemporary quality alternative rock should easily enjoy this new collection of songs which deal with Placebo's favourite themes: love, lust, desire &amp; hope. Brian Molko truly shines on this album as he goes through these themes with affectionate lyrics &amp; his normal powerful vocals &amp; even manages to surprise us with some more subdued renditions (&quot;English Summer Rain&quot;, &quot;Something Rotten&quot;). Drummer Steve Hewitt also shines, adding a new mid-tempo element to some of the songs &amp; it's great. My favourite songs are the title track &amp; &quot;I'll Be Yours&quot; for their touching/solacing lyrics about true friendship &amp; love. Other good songs include &quot;English Summer Rain&quot;, &quot;This Picture&quot;, &quot;The Bitter End&quot;, &quot;Second Sight&quot; &amp; &quot;Protect Me From What I Want&quot; (named after a Jenny Holzer piece).
B000068TPN|5.0|I don't recall seeing a war movie besides Saving Private Ryan that captures the true horror of war.  But having never been to war myself makes that statement an opinion. Despite that, I was captivated by this movie's realism and its intensity. Mel Gibson gave an awesome performance as Lt. Hal Moore (the author of the book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once...and Young&quot;) as did the rest of the supporting cast.  The movie was great, and I would definitely recommend buying a copy, but read the book if you want the un-Hollywood version of what really happened.
B00006C79E|5.0|If you're a Saint Etienne fan then you should know what you're in for, catchy melodies and vocals as smooth as a babies backside.  Saint Etienne make it very difficult to do anything else other than sit in a zombified state while their music absorbs and completely comsumes you.  Instrumental 'Language Lab' will have you fighting the back the tears whilst next track 'Soft Like Me' will convince you you're listening to a different album.  This only proves that Etienne aren't afraid to experiment and write an album with such contrasting sounds and styles.  This album never disappoints and your music collection will be forever be incomplete without it sitting pride of place on your shelf.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|This album has two very good songs which is \\"straight out of line\\" and \\"I stand Alone\\" but, other then that the rest of the songs sound alike with brutal guitar riffs and Sully's overpowering voice. There really isnt anytype of diversified range in this album or in other words, this isnt the type of album that will make you want to listen to every song. <BR>Unlike the first two albums which had a variety of different musical approaches, with songs that were as hard edge as Vampires and melodic as voodoo, this album just goes in one general direction which is hard and fast. Don't get me wrong thats great given the circumstances however, the songs here do not equal the quality present in their first two albums.
B000069HK2|5.0|the used is the most powerful melodic hardcore band. their sound is so perfect, burt's lovely voice, awesome quitar, bassist with style, drumming that fits so well. i love this cd. i sing to it in my car and i never get sick of it. i recommend this cd to everyone. thank you.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I love it but, as I said, I'm a geek.<BR>My wife .... she thinks the movie is silly.<br />The extra stuff that comes with the movie is &quot;so-so&quot; but, it's cool to see.
0064471837|5.0|I really thought that this was a great book and have really enjoyed it.  I liked it so much that I had to go get the second one so that I could be happy.  I almost didn't like the idea that Sabriel went into Death but it was okay.  I really enjoyed this book though he could have left a few of the sex parts out.
B000000OQF|5.0|This an extradionary album, this was the album that changed music forever, songs are amazing, Axl and the crew did a great job and another part that this band outsell nirvana for good, This was the last truly great before nirvana (aka the most overrated band of time) and the last of their ilk came and sent the rock world down the toliet, While kurt is rotting to the grave, W. Axl rose is about to make a comeback.
B00006CXSS|5.0|i must say that i enjoyed band of brothers as much, or even more, than stephen ambrose's book.  each episode was very true to the written and oral accounts depicted in ambrose's book, and added the theatrical element that one really needs to visualize the events encompassing 101st/506th PIR during wwii.  i highly recommend the series to anyone interested in wwii history, but more to those who are interested in the personal stories of war (as seen in ambrose's other books: d-day, citizen soldiers, band of brothers, and others).<br />in response to the others that labeled this masterpiece as &quot;american propoganda&quot;, this is probably more of a blacklash against the current state of affairs in world politics, and one thing these people forget is that this series as based entirely on primary sources-- actual soldiers giving written and oral accounts of the war from their perspective. OF COURSE this account will have the point of view from the american GI... thats a given.  but to blatantly disregard this miniseries as hollywood hand-waving and propoganda ignores the fact that this series isn't about giving a history lesson to children.  it's about sharing the stories from individual soldiers concerning their experiences of warfare, and providing that in a way that individuals from around the globe can understand.  disregarding their stories would be like ignoring the tremendous sacrifices the american GIs gave to liberating much of europe during the 40s.
B00004RF9B|2.0|I bought this film because it has always been one of my favorite classic Sci-Fi moves.  It has everything from monsters to sexy women. But it was a real disappointment for me to have to watch this poor quality reproduction. I will hope that someday another production company will remake this with the quality it deserves. If I wanted this junk, I could have stuck with my old VHS.
1400034779|5.0|I love this book. It is simple story telling about a sagacious African woman with a wonderful heart and spirit. Great summer reading.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack's Faceless is reminiscent  and true to form of their past two releases.  Although not as angry as their debut the band is playing better/tighter as a group and their musicianship is improving with time.<BR>Highlights include Changes, Releasing the Demons, I Stand Alone, and Dead and Broken.  Serenity grows on you with time as does the entire release.  Probably deeper in terms of entire quality than Awake, but lacks that one killer tune that just kicks your a** after each take.  Also, the album is only 47 minutes long although very little can be considered \\"filler\\".  If you are a Godsmack fan this release will fit in well with your tastes, if you are a ... bubble gummer keep on looking somewhere else.
0380817683|4.0|Marian Keyes was born in Dublin, France and lived in London for several years. Once Keyes received her degree in law and had studied accounting, she began her career in short stories.  Since then she has produced three other novel besides Rachel's Wedding- Watermelon, Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married, and The Last Chance Saloon. All of Keyes' works have become best sellers around the world. The common style carried throughout Keyes' work is defiantly humor, which in the end presents some comical flaw, issue, or message about society. Rachel's Wedding is the second novel that I have read of Keyes', and I find it just as, if not more, enjoyable then the other.  Her light and enjoyable approach often makes for a very enjoyable read, and this was no exception in Rachel's Wedding. Keyes' humor, which could be taken as satiric, presents dark subjects, like drug abuse and eating disorders, in a decent, light approach. Rachel Walsh, the protagonist of the novel, suffers from both drug abuse and an eating disorder. Rachel describes herself as unsexy, large, broke, and just often misunderstood. She also repeatedly denies her drug problem, but is forced to face it when her farther, along with roommate, Brigit, and boyfriend, Luke, send her to a rehabilitation center in Ireland. Much to her dismay, Rachel finds the rehabilitation center quit authentic. She can't grasp the idea of working or helping others. While there, Rachel cannot wait for the opportunity to socialize with actors and famous people, but instead finds herself with middle- aged men, suffering from similar problems as she does. Keyes' realistic approach brings the reader both humor and amiable characters, allowing them to connect with characters and instances. I really enjoyed reading this book. As always, Keyes' made it fun and fast!
B00008H2LB|1.0|I am a huge fan of the real Linkin Park that was displayed on Hybrid Theory.  I was not expecting this album to be as good, as sequels never are in the hard rock world, but Linkin Park has abandoned everything that got them here in the first place: catchy guitar riffs, a driving beat, and the originality of their album.  I was expecting the originality not to be there, but i wasn't expecting guitar riffs and especially the driving beat to be lost.  Linkin Park has tried to mellow their music but still stick to their hard rock roots, and the results are disastrous.  There is not one song that I would listen to again on this album.  I can only hope that Linkin Park finds its mojo soon.
B000002G7E|4.0|This is my first exposure to the Velvet Underground. I can see how influential they were. I actually have Volume 3 of the \\"Peel Slowly and See\\" series, which gives me some insight into their songwriting process. Lyrically, this group is supremely unafraid to deal with ANYTHING. They can do touching pop and chilling stories of murder and isolation with the same amount of style and passion. The standout track for me on \\"White Light/White Heat\\" is \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\", which is utter, unparalleled genius. What was Lou Reed smoking when he recorded the lead guitar part? Was he on acid? It is just unbelievable. The other tracks are great, too, except for \\"Sister Ray\\", which I absolutely can't stand. Both Side 2 Tracks illustrate this. Tremendously influential.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Not to be mean, but I am not the least bit interested in trying to convince people who are still \\"on-the-fence\\" about the Beatles' greatness to buy this DVD package. If they don't comprehend that the Beatles were and still are the greatest musical entity ever (they're much more than just a band), than no one can help them. No, I call upon everyone who, like myself, just plain get it. The Beatles are the greatest and so is this DVD compilation. I've read all these reviews and some have said the picture is grainy and not as good as it can be.  Totally untrue. If you see a grainy picture when watching this anthology, you need either a new TV or a new DVD player.  My images were beautiful across the board, old and new.  The sound is also fantastic. Trust me, I know every note of every Beatles recording and the sound reproduction is brilliant. The editing, production and content of this set is mind-blowing. Another complaint I heard was there was too much material!  Too much??  The more the merrier. Whatever you don't like, skip over. I loved it all. I'm a late night person and I watched two episodes a night and the time flew by.  I hated to turn it off to go to bed! Please don't believe the negative reviews (not that there are very many). This anthology has no negatives. If you don't have it, get it immediately, period.
6300216039|5.0|Romeo and Juliet Directed by Franco Zeffirelli is an unforgettable movie of love written by Shakespeare, where teenagers like Leonard Whiting (Romeo), and Olivia Hussey (Juliet) made a huge production, to be able to express as the days of Shakespeare were. It is considered as a romantic tragedy movie, where our eyes, and imagination travels as you are watching the 1968's version. This movie is a play with a really high range of value for me as a reader of the book, because when you read the book first you would figure a 1968 version.<br />In my opinion the actors John McEnery (Mercutio), and Michael York (Tybalt) made a really good fight scene, where both ended up death, because Tybalt killed Mercutio, then Romeo got mad, fought, and killed Tybalt. That's how the big tragedy really started, because by that way Romeo got banished. Then after that, Friar Laurence (Milo O'shae) planned to fix everything, because he knew that he was going to get in trouble if he let Juliet to get marry twice, being Juliet already married to Romeo without the consent of Capulet (Salvatore Billa), and Lady Capulet (Natasha Parry). The Friar gave Juliet a poison, which made her pretend she was death, so that Romeo could go and pick her up, and they could leave Verona together. But Balthazar (Keith Skinner) who saw Juliet death, messed up the Friar's plan by telling Romeo that Juliet was death, but he didn't know that Juliet was just pretending she were death, while Romeo was expecting to get a letter from the Friar. Then Romeo went to see Juliet carrying a poison with him, and he said: \\"Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!\\" Then Romeo drinks the poison and die. Then a minute after that, Juliet woke up and saw Romeo death in the floor, and then she killed herself with Romeo's stake.<br />I love this version of the movie; it was so dramatic and ironic. But I think that is not very mature to kill itself by love. Knowing that out there are too many people. But there is always a saying that I say, \\"Every person is a different world\\", which I found out is true, because everyone thinks different. I'd like to say that this is a metaphorical experience, where I think that Shakespeare maybe thought that love is over all situations, where everyone gets confused, and lost control of the situation by taking or trying to fix everything in a very fast way, which is even worse.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Ever since this Cd came out I have heard so many complaints of how short this album is.. &quot;37 minutes?! It's too short!&quot; So what? No one said that a band has to fill every second of CD space. Linkin Park comes out strong in their sophomore effort with head-banging anthems like &quot;Don't Stay&quot; and &quot;Lying From You&quot;, and &quot;Crawling&quot;-type songs such as &quot;Easier to Run&quot; and &quot;From the Inside.&quot; The Special Edition disc also comes with a Making Of documentary DVD with a lot of footage that was aired on LPTV. All in all, a great Linkin Park experience...I can't wait to hear what kind of remixes they think of for Reanimation 2. (optimistic thought)

It did, however, left a few points unclear such as how the gold was recovered at the end, what exactly was that scavenger guy, who was the boss, what was the relation between the minions and the scavenger guy...<br />Perhaps, watching a couple more times may clear up some of those, but the only thing that really bothered me was the inconsistancy of the body choppings on deck at the begining...  how does the old perve, who was dancing with Emily Browning, get part of his head chopped off while everyone else got chopped off at approximately 4 feet...  Emily should have been about 5 feet tall with shoes.  The old perve's head got chopped at around 6 feetish.  HELLO!!  2 feet differential is a little too obvious.  Anyway, good thing they did that, because of it were truely convincingly logical, I would not have been able to finish my lunch.  First I was horrified, then I laughed (at the technical flaw)... And the rope appeared to be a little too large in diameter to result in a cutting effect such as that presented even with the velocity they tried to convey.<br />Oh well, whatever.  To any other horror movie producers, get a physics degree holder for consulting before doing something like that.<br />...
0743244249|3.0|After a year passed since I read The Body Artist, I started anticipating what Don DeLillo would write next.  While I found The Body Artist to be somewhat of a disappointment, this is still the writer who thrilled me with White Noise and The Names.  This is the man who wrote the incredibly beautiful prologue to Underworld.  DeLillo can flat out Write.<br />The basic plot of Cosmopolis follows Eric Packer, a 28 year old billionaire, as he crosses New York City (pre 9/11) in his limo to get a haircut.  Such a simple trip takes all day since the President is in town and there is marches, riots and a funeral.  At the same time, Packer is told that someone is out to kill him.  Confused?  Don't worry, DeLillo uses plot as a device to enable him to riff on aspects of society and while the characters do not sound like real people, it is the characters the provide the interest and pacing of the narrative.  In Cosmopolis, DeLillo takes on high finance and the lives of the ultra-rich.  DeLillo's view is very comic and deeply scathing as he reveals how shallow these lives really are.<br />As talented as Don DeLillo is as a writer, this was not a very engaging novel.  While plot and character are merely devices for DeLillo (instead of being the point), in a better novel this is not a problem and would barely be noticeable.  The fact is that all of the characters sound the same and given a different name would be identical to the other characters.  There is very little distinction between characters.  This is not unusual for DeLillo, but again, in a better novel I wouldn't be thinking about that.<br />Cosmopolis is a step back in the right direction for DeLillo (after the awful novel The Body Artist), but would still only fall in the middle of his body of work.  This is a middle tier novel from a top tier talent.
B00008CLOA|5.0|At last! This is the moment that us audiophiles who have followed SACD's growth since the beginning have been waiting for. And boy it was well worth the wait!<br />Indeed this is one of those rare times when the label takes serious times to \\"remaster\\" an album instead of make a quick money grab to rip people off. For the first time since the needle on my grandpa's record player broke off and my vinyl was played to death, I can hear Rick Wright's crisp, clean, haunting, keyboard, synth, organ, and piano playing again right smack dab in the middle of the action. (As opposed to tucked away deep in the corner of the left speaker.) And at last I can hear Nick Mason's devastating drum playing, most notably on Brain Damage, where that powerfully symbol/bass drum crashing has never come through with such clarity and resounding force.<br />Also, the instruments have been spread out more, allowed more room to breathe so that you can hear each one coming rhrough in equal clarity. (Most important on such freak out jams in Money and Time where all the instruments are practically soloing at the same time.) You can hear David Gilmour's voice sending shivers up and down your spine again, in his laid back and soothing fashion. And remember when you could hear choirs on Dark Side of the Moon? They're back again, and Clare Torrey's high notes are back too. This is the new Dark Side of the Moon, and it's great for those of us not old enough to remember the days of vinyl. For every Pink Floyd diehard or audiophile!<br />(Note: I'd make a comment about how wonderful the album actually is, but most who are buying this have already bought this three or four times anyway, and there are so many reviewers who have written so much anyway, what's the point?<br />Also, to Capitol, let's see some work done on the other classics. I don't want to wait for a 30 year edition. Let's see them all and soon.)

B0000242BH|5.0|Jordi Savall is a player of rare sensitivity and virtuosity.  This CD of solo works for the viola da gamba is an encylopedia of gamba styles and a treasure chest of baroque compositions. From start to finish this CD is riveting, the beauty of his playing and the compositions is awe inspiring.  The recording is excellent and the liner notes are informative.  Savall's playing of Maris is heartrending, and his interpretation of movements from the Bach cello suites is revelatory.  This CD is a great introduction to the viola da gamba as well as a treasure trove for any gamba fan.
0451169514|5.0|I am a fan of Stephen King, I simply love horror books.  That is why King's book \\"It\\" is one of my favorite books.  The book builds a strong plot pitting good against evil. Every charcter in the book plays a vital role, they are all powerful and realistic.  King demonstrates a grat understanding of young people and thier relationships throughout the book. Although the book is a very long (1000+ pages), it is very interesting.  I believe that \\"It\\" is one of King's scarier creations, it will capture your interest to the full extent.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|In Van Halen circles this is commonly known as the &quot;disco&quot; album as nearly half it's nine tracks are given over to funky dance experiments. Apparently lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen wanted to break from the hard rock formula of the band's first three albums and make the ultimate dance record. &quot;Dirty Movies&quot; has a great shuffling disco beat and is a good song to hustle to. &quot;Push Comes To Shove&quot; would not have sounded out of place on a Rick James or Barry White album and David Lee Roth holds his own against his funky soul contemporaries. &quot;Sunday Afternoon in the Park&quot; is the very first Eddie Van Halen synthesizer instrumental (foreshadowing his work on the 1984 album) and has a menacing vibe to it. The album's straightforward rock tracks include the flawless &quot;Unchained&quot;, the underrated classic &quot;Mean Streets&quot; and the Grand Funk Railroad homage &quot;So This Is Love&quot;. This is definately one of Van Halen's most eclectic efforts and a rewarding listen time and time again.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Why not have the Seinfeld Series on DVD?  This is by far one of the most entertaining shows and my favorite of all time.<BR>Please, Please consider putting all of the shows on DVD.  I am sure it would sell millions......<BR>DIANE J.
B00005RYLE|4.0|Okay. I'm going to have to admit it. I really only like this movie because of Bruce Campbell. I admit it's really interesting filmmaking on such a limited budget, and I laud the result. But I wouldn't come back for repeated viewing if it weren't for Bruce.<br />And that's what makes this DVD so great. There is a whole Bruce Campbell commentary track that is so much more amusing than the movie itself. I can watch that over and over again. (The Sam Raimi/Rob Tapert commentary is interesting, but it's also clear why they are behind the camera.) This DVD also features Bruce's short documentary, \\"Fanalysis\\" - also great if you are a Bruce fan. (I still think that Evil Dead 2 is better, both the movie and the dvd, but that doesn't mean this one doesn't rock.)<br />As for the Book of the Dead keepcase, it's creepy in that manufactured kind of way. It's spongy and textured. The pages inside are hilarious. I spent an evening on the sofa with two friends figuring them out and laughed til I hurt.<br />If you are an Evil Dead fan or a Bruce Campbell fan, get this. Get it for the spongy book so you can poke its nose and watch it spring back into place. Ew[...]
B000002UZ1|1.0|This looks more like a compromise than a compilation of greatest hits as each Beatle gets to put a sub-par tunes of their own on the release.  For example:<BR>John - The Ballad of John and Yoko<BR>Paul - ObLaDi, ObLaDa<BR>George - Old Brown Shoe<BR>Ringo - Octopuses Garden<br />These were supposed to be &quot;hits&quot;?? <br />Just buy the original albums, plus Beatles 1.  Then you won't even know that the likes of The Ballad of John &amp; Yoko or Old Brown Shoe even existed.
B00008DDXC|4.0|And knowing that most of the other reviews are going to have about two main quibbles with the movie, which is 1) This movie rocks!, and 2) This movie's not good because it's not like the book, I would like to offer another point of view that's sort of in the middle of that debate.<br />To answer the POV #1, yes, this movie is VERY, VERY good!  I ended up seeing the movie about nine times in the theater.  Something about Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets drew me to see it more often than the Sorcerer's Stone/Philosopher's Stone Movie.  The pace in the COS movie was faster and more linear than the first movie, the actors (especially Dan, Rupert, and Emma) were very much improved (as were the special effects), and it was just more exciting and fun to watch.<br />To answer the POV #2, by its nature the movie is NOT like the book at all.  Of course, certain editing decisions would have helped the move FEEL more like the book.  On Disc 2 of the COS set (thank the gods they took off the \\"game\\" to find the extra scenes!!), there were three deleted scenes that I personally felt would have helped the movie out in terms of character development and bringing some of the book's themes to life.  I won't give away what is said in those scenes, but you'll know them because the three I'm talking about fall just after the dueling scene (with a BEAUTIFUL long shot of the lake!), during Christmas, and just after Harry leaves the study hall.  When you see those scenes, you'll see why they should have been left in the movie.<br />I gave the movie 4 stars because of those deleted scenes, and some other minor characterization quibbles (referring to one other scene, \\"if you're dying, PLEASE act like it!!\\").  To summarize, this movie is definitely one for your collection because of the fun and adventure of it.  It's very enjoyable and just scary enough to have fun squealling.  Just let yourself let go of the idea that the movie HAS to be EXACTLY like the book and it will \\"go down\\" moreeasily.  After all, the longest movie in the world can't match the reader's imagination and interpretation of the original source material.  <br />Go ahead.  Get the movie.  Take a risk.  Have fun!!
B000002UAU|1.0|Newer Beatle fans just discovering the group should know that this 1967 release doesn't strike with the newness of She Loves You, the excitement of the opening chords of A Hard Day's Night, or the driving bass line and satirical wit of Taxman. While the Beatles led the direction of popular music from 1964-1966, this release was off the mark, as Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, also released in 1967, was actually the window to the future.<br />The Beatles began to get back on track in 1968 with some good tracks on the White Album and closed strong with Abbey Road.  <br />Inclusive of tunes like With A Little Help From My Friends, When I'm 64, Within You Without You, and Mr. Kite, this release hasn't exactly stood the test of time, and few unbiased listeners would rate this 5-stars for musical content.  Nevetheless, it isn't a total loss as the opening distorted chords of Sgt. Pepper, and the epic A Day in the Life are very good.<br />My advice to newer Beatle fans is to start with the first few albums, then buy Abbey Road and work your way back the middle if you haven't had enough.
B000002AH1|5.0|Abrasive, dissonant, incredibly loud, and funky as hell, Live-Evil is perhaps the definitive statement from the often in-flux Davis band of late 1970-1972. It consists of four spooky, floating studio tracks (Little Church, Gemini/Double Image, Nem Um Talvez, and Selim) interspersed with four long live pieces from a concert at the Cellar Door in Washington D.C. on December 19, 1970. And, man, do they cook! Miles is in wonderful form, playing incisive, razor-edged runs and shrieking high note blasts, often filtered through his wah pedal. Gary Bartz is less featured on soprano and alto saxes, but steps out for long, effective solos on \\"What I Say\\" and \\"Inamorata\\". John McLaughlin, sitting in on guitar, contributes some fine, bluesy playing. Keith Jarrett, on electric piano and organ, takes a stunning unaccompanied solo on \\"Funky Tonk\\" and plays superbly throughout. Bassist Michael Henderson, a relatively new addition to the band, does a fine job of holding down the groove, and Jack DeJohnette is his usual outstanding self, taking a thunderous drum solo during \\"What I Say\\". Here's the only caveat: the live pieces are all edited to the point of incoherence: for example, the opener \\"Sivad\\" consists of about three minutes from the middle of \\"Directions\\", followed by several snippets from different performances of \\"Honky Tonk\\". The only completely unedited live track is \\"What I Say\\" (by the way, the theme from \\"Sanctuary\\" pops up to end both \\"What I Say\\" and \\"Inamorata\\"), which may explain why it's also the most effective piece. Still, though, even with all its faults, this is a thrilling record of Miles and his band perched on the threshold between jazz, funk, rock, and God knows what else.
B000002HPV|5.0|This is an album that takes it's listener through different levels of conciousness. From the sleepily beautiful \\"Joga,\\" to the trance-like \\"All Neon Like,\\" to the painfully awake \\"Pluto,\\" along with the inaudible lyrics, pulsating techno-esque beats, and violins to drown out or induce sorrow, Homogenic is an album for the senses. <br />Even with ten tracks on this set, I felt as though my money was well spent and also that other albums with more than ten tracks tend to drop off after a while. <br />Best tracks (to me) are:<BR>2. Joga (a gorgeous track)<BR>3. Unreavel (a lot of hidden meaning in this one, it's not hard to decipher what the song is about)<BR>4. Bachelorette (effective storytelling)<BR>5. All Neon Like (my favorite track on the album)<BR>9. Pluto (this song shouldn't be on this album, but it works in a freakishly neat way)<BR>10. All Is Full Of Love (a skiddish rhythm tied in with haunting strings)<br />Basically, this album is a dark classic that shines.
0312305060|4.0|What a lovely curiosity of ladies, decades apart, yet connected by the concept of the hours of life.  Having read Wolfe's Mrs. Dalloway certainly helps stir one's interest in Cunningham's work.  But the triple story of three separate women in three separate time segments of the 20th century make for a bit of suspense as the chapters layer one another with individual revelations.  If you are planning on seeing the Oscar nominated actors in the film version, do yourself a favor and first read the book.  And once finished with Cunningham's book, go back and read Mrs. Dalloway.  There is genuine appreciation of writer conception and craft when one absorbs all three.  Well worth the hours spent!
B00005JKYI|4.0|Who was a teen in the 80s and did NOT feel an impact of this movie?  Whether you liked or hated this film, like Flashdance, this was one of the key examples of the unique mixture of music and movies that we saw in the 80s.<br />Why just 4 stars, then?  LACK OF EXTRAS!  If a studio is going to re-release a movie on DVD and charge over $...for it, there should be plenty of extras.  How about the original music videos, or even interviews with cast/crew on the making of the film and the hype after its release?  After all, it helped launch at least one major star's career and the cast was rich with very recognizable talent.  Something could have and should have been done.
0783225792|4.0|Only a veteran filmmaker like Martin Scorsese can make the same movie twice and get away with it. Because, after all, that's what \\"Casino\\" really is: a retelling of \\"Goodfellas\\". Not better, not worse, but definitely familiar to those of us who watched (and love) that story about sub-urban gangsters. This time, Scorsese even gathers up a lot of the same cast, including Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (who does brilliant work as always). But \\"Casino\\" only has one real star: Las Vegas. The city is portrayed in its old splendor, when it was a very exclusive empire of money, gambling and lust, and the mob ran the show. The movie tells us the rise and fall of such empire through the eyes of one man: Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein. Among the fellow cast members are excellent performances by James Woods and Sharon Stone, who received an Oscar Nomination for her role of Ginger, a former prostitute who becomes Sam's wife and eventually breaks down in a twister of sex, greed and drug abuse. The movie is really good, even though it touches familiar territory, and has the kind of storytelling that I really love in Martin Scorsese. Comparisons to \\"Goodfellas\\" are inevitable, but I assure you (if you haven't seen it) that you'll appreciate it this way.<br />Now, as for extras, this is a very domestic release, which means that it barely provides us with a theatrical trailer. Now that I think of it, a commentary track by the cast members would've been nice, especially since this was the film that gave a serious boost to Sharon Stone's career, not only giving her an Oscar Nomination, but also gaining her the respect of a lot of critics.<br />All I can say is: those who watch \\"Casino\\" looking for some new ground-breaking approaches in Scorsese's cinema will be disappointed. But, on the other hand, if you just kick back and watch him have fun with some familiar characters in a familiar story, then you're in for a treat.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I have been a fan of Spidey for nearly 30 years now and had high hopes for the movie.  It did NOT disappoint.  The acting, pace, action, and humor were all done to near perfection.  <br />Then it came time to get the DVD, and was I ever impressed!  Not only is the film presented well on the DVD, but the extras blew me away!  I love extras, but rarely find myself viewing the extras multiple times.  This DVD's extras are among my favorites.  I especially liked the montage of Spidey artists over time - great insights to one of the greatest super hero characters of all time.<br />Let's hope the same creative teams are in place for the sequel and especially the DVD extras!  <br />'Nuff said!

B000002U9W|5.0|Thats right, believe it or not, Dark side of the Moon was not Pink Floyd's first album to hit #1, but Atom heart Mother was in 1970. True, that maybe Dark Side does deserve a #1 status more then this, but there are some beutiful songs on this album which go unseen by most causual floyd fans. Summer '68, which i think is the best track on the album shows that Rick wright could write some damn good songs when given the chance, At first you might pass this track over but the up-beat tune, the trumpets in the middle and Ricks smooth vocals start to grow on you. Fat Old Sum written by Gilmour is an extremely laid back accoustic song untill the end where Gilmour breaks off into another excellent guitar solo. I would recomend trying to get a live version of this song, as it is much more powerfull live. If, maybe not one of Water's best known songs, but this songs shows a softer side of him which is usually not seen in Floyd work. Then comes the tracks which most people who review this album seem to bash, Alan's Psychedellic Breakfast. Now the having Alan talking in between each part of the song might be annoying, but just listen to it and yo'll see that musically its an excellent song, it contains an up-beat and louder begining and end with an exceelent accosutic middle where Gilmour duets with him self. And of course theres Atom Heart Mother, i dont know what to say about that except put on your cd and be prepared to be blown away for the next 23 minutes.

B000003TA4|3.0|It is a sad fact of life as well as the music industry that popularity of something is more determined by the hype surrounding it. For years I sincerely attempted to believe that Nirvana was a great band.<BR>What the hell?<BR>This band has created only two good songs (Teen spirit and Come as you are) in their entire career. The rest of the songs are average or just plain dull, and I forced myself to hear them time and again in the hope that I might somehow grow to like them. Sadly, the only reason you can find In Memory of Kurt T-shirts in campuses everywhere, even now is due to the coolness associated with the band and that was their selling point; not their musicianship or talent.<BR>The band had it not broken up when it did with the death of Kurt would have continued releasing medicore albums and faded away.<BR>Maybe you should start judging music by hearing it.
0792839749|1.0|I refuse to buy this DVD even though I LOVE the movie.  The grandeur and scope of this film is breathtaking, and too much is lost if viewed in pan and scan.  I still have my laserdisc player, and my widescreen version of CCBB is one reason.  If you are not a fan of widescreen, by all means get this DVD - the movie is a must-have for any collection.  I, for one, am still waiting for a widescreen version (and maybe extras, too?).
0812550706|5.0|I read this book when I was in 5th grade. It was the very first science fiction book I ever read--in fact, it was the first great book I ever read. I'm in 10th grade now, and I still think of this book as being one of the best I have ever read. When I read it back then, I couldn't believe what I was reading, it was so good! This was back when I read RL Stine and Bruce Colville, and this was just one big amazement that there was so much better literature out there.<br />Since that time I have read a lot of Stephen King, Jack Kerouac, Chuck Palahniuk, Irvine Welsh...Ender's Game was the one and only science fiction book I ever took the time to read, I don't really know why. I've read a little bit now of Philip K. Dick, and it made me think of this book, and now I think I am going to read it again, just to see if it is as good as it was back then. I think it will be.<br />I remember a tremendous ending that left me in awe, I can't remember details though. <br />Read this.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Does that work for you?<br />The people who say this movie isn't good all use the exact same reason.<br />They get offended because it didn't include their grandfather's regiment or whatever or they didn't cover the battles in Poland.<br />Well, the 101st couldn't be everywhere now could they?  THIS IS AN EXACT HISTORY OF THE 101ST AIRBORNE, 506 PIR.  End of story.<br />Get over yourself.<br />This is a great movie.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is the definitive metal album. Probably the greatest of all-time for this type of music. It's the perfect combination of slow, heavy riffage and lightning fast solos done by Kirk. The music flows so well its unbeliveable, for such fast paced music. While most of the songs are fast and more thrash based,some songs like Welcome Home and Thing That Should Not Be are more slow are pounding, with great rythym guitar pplaying by James. This is the real Metallica, and the real high point for thrash/heavy metal. Now a song by song review.<br /> Battery- A hard, more thrash based song. Very fast, with a cool spanish guitar intro, like the one on Fight Fire With Fire from Ride the Lightning. 5/5<BR> Master of Puppets- My favorite Metallica song of all-time! A long song with great solos and great melodic section in the middle. UNBELIVEABLE! 5/5<BR> The Thing That Should Not Be- A slow, grinder song. I love the riffs here, crazy good. 5/5<BR> Welcome Home(Sanitarium)- A slower more melodic song. Really cool and it adds a softer touch to a really heavy album. 5/5<BR> Disposable Heroes- Really fast song, unbeliveable soloing again. I love the lyrics, very war like feel to the song. 5/5<BR> Leper Messiah- Another slow, grinder like TTTSNB. Great riffage here as well. 4.5/5<BR> Orion- The best instrumental i've ever heard! Just listen to the bass. R.I.P Cliff Burton. 4.5/5<BR> Damage Inc.- Pure thrash, kind of boring. Nothing new here, I usually skip it. 3/5<br /> If you don't have this and you call your self a metal head, GET OUT!. Not just highly recommended, ESSENTIAL!!

B00000GAIW|2.0|Instrumentally, this album is killer.  Martin Barr, Glenn Cornick, & Clive Bunker are among the best rock musicians around.  Too bad the same can't be said for Ian Anderson's amateurish flute playing and the corny lyrics of the title track.  Want to hear Tull at their best?  Listen to Stand Up.
B000002UAI|5.0|Routinely named as the Beatles' worst album, this is in fact one of my favorites, and I believe one of their best. The Beatles put aside the sound of their first three albums and instead go for a sort of country-rock sound, a few years before Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, and Dylan do it. How can you go wrong with an album that includes \\"No Reply\\", \\"I'm A Loser\\", \\"Eight Days A Week\\", \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\"? The covers are more numerous and not as good as on other albums, perhaps, but hey, \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" and \\"Words Of Love\\" do it for me. Give this album a chance!
B00006LLNU|2.0|Not really, not this time around. Yes, Sigur Ros has an absolutley crucial sound but they no longer know what to do with it. I think the time will come when they are acknowledged to have been quickly overrated. And the lead singer just doesn't want to let go when he gets ahold of an irritating refrain...on and on and on.........

Cameron (drummer from soundgarden, duh.) brings a refreshing, new sound to the band, their energy feels more focused and the drums can hold water to the rocking and the swaying (listen to the drumline in &quot;Save You&quot; and then Iron's thrashing in &quot;Brain of J&quot;) and there's really not much more to say.  If you have the Pearl Jam point of view, this is a must own for you.

B000003TA4|3.0|With the release of Nevermind, Nirvana paved the way for many bands to come into the spotlight, many more talented bands.<BR>Nevermind in 2001 is a lot different from Nirvana in 1991, simply because just like Alice in Chains, the music they inspire is a shade or two better the music they actually produce.  (Compare this album to 93's Vs (Pearl Jam) No contest.) but it's impossible to dodge around the fact: Nirvana was one of Rock's most important bands. the formula seems to be to mumble through your depressing lyrics (good job dodging parental advisory) but at the same time yell them really loud.  My major gripe with NIrvana is Kurt has no real vocal muscle, he can mutter and he can screech fine, but it all seems to be to compensate for the fact that he can't sing.  However, the band did a good job hiding and for every song on the CD there is no singing required, just the afore mentioned mutters and screeches.  The instruments are great.  Despite his vocal lackings, Kurt is a zen master of his instrument, and Dave Grohl just can't play anything bad (which also raises the question why they didn't let him take up vocals every so often) and Novelisk never slows up the bass lines.<BR>Nevermind is by no means a bad album, It's really quite good, but since its orginal explosion, its' ripples have superceeded the splash.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|With a techno-pop sound, these controversial Russian hotties rock the U.S. With such songs as their US debut, &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; and a modern (and much better) version of the 1980's New Wave hit, &quot;How Soon is Now?&quot; on their English Language debut (with some songs still in Russian).  No collection is complete without this title!  A must have for any pop/rock lover!
B00004XPOZ|5.0|This three-pack is a must have. It includes all the REAL &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies (the ones that tell the story of how Luke Skywalker gets to be a Jedi Knight, like his father), and by Episode VI all the loose ends are answered. Truly great cinema, with great special effects.<BR>This three classics must not be missed!
B00008H2LB|5.0|i just purchased this cd two days ago, and i was not dissappointed.  Its quality, and tracks 2, 3, 7, and 13 are my top tracks on the album.  It wouldve been cheesy as hell if they failed to try something new, so i respect that.  They managed to fuse some forms of elctronic breaks as well as some techno with their hard edged alternative into a totally original sound (track 7 especially at 135 bpm).  Props to mike shinada and joe hahn for this masterpiece!  If u havent bought it, your totally missing out...<br />-eRic
B00004XPP0|5.0|I would like to say that surprisingly, each of the three films of the Star Wars Trilogy has been my favorite at one point, which is proof of their quality. For me, each Episode provides new elements to the story, and helps the plot to progress, ultimately leading to the great finale. To this day, no other sci-fi film or franchise has reached the level of these awesome movies; not even the new Star Wars films. This Trilogy remains the best entertainment you can get. <BR>I have only one question: when are they going to be released on DVD?!
B00008I8IF|5.0|I've been a huge fan of The Jayhawks since 1995's 'Tomorrow The Green Grass'. Then Mark Olsen went and left and everybody assumed it was the end for the band. How wrong. The band has produced some of its finest music since then (plus Olsen's voice was a bit grating, in my opinion). For me, it was always Gary Louris that was the cornerstone of the band, in terms of both songwriting and vocal talent. This album sees a blissful return to form following on from 2000's still-excellent-but-slightly-patchy 'Smile'. The writing is exemplary. Someone in another review on this site said the songs are American but with British melodies. I couldn't agree more. The hooks and harmonies are simply lush. They've even managed to recreate the modern Jayhawks sound without the aid of any female backing vocals, following the departure of Karen Grotberg. Quite remarkable.<br />The only downside to this joyous record is the production. The record is very under-produced on certain tracks, leaving Louris to sound like he's singing in a broom cupboard - sorry, closet! This is a great shame as the previous album 'Smile' sounded immaculate. Still, it's the songs that count and once the disappointment of the sound quality has subsided, the songs themselves are all that matter. Tracks like 'Stumbling Through The Dark', 'All The Right Reasons', 'Save It For A Rainy Day' and 'Eyes Of Sarah Jane' are among the finest the bad have recorded, although I still think 'Sound Of Lies' is still their greatest, most consistent album. My one wish now is to finally see the band perform live as they don't come to the UK very often. <br />One final thought - if you took the best tracks from The Jayhawks albums 'Hollywood Town Hall' right up to 'Rainy Day Music', it would simply be one of the finest pop records of all time. Time to start burning me a compilation...

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Basically everything about this film is great.  The movie is eerie, thoughtful, interesting and complimented with wonderful acting from Jake Gyllenhaal (along with the rest of the cast) and with music that seems to have been made for this story.  Every time i watch it, i find something new, a new angle, and am still pondering what i believe happened and what the story is all about.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|SPOILERS AHEAD<BR>This Episode ties all the loose ends left from &quot;A New Hope&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, with the best special effects of the Trilogy, and maybe of all Sci-Fi movies. Personally, I love the fact that Darth Vader, my favorite character in motion picture history, turns good, and that his spirit(as Anakin)can be seen at the victory celebration alonside the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda. The ending is just perfect.<BR>Also, the music is the best from the Trilogy, adding depth to the characters and underscoring their development. Arguably, John Williams did his best work here.<BR>Anyway, this should have been the last Star Wars movie, so that people could remember this series as the greatest achievement in cinema history, and the greatest story ever told.
B00005JLSC|5.0|CHICAGO IS THE BEST MOVIE AND ONE OF THE GREATEST MUSICALS OF ALL TIME. CATHERINE ZETA JONES DOES A GREAT JOB PLAYING VELMA KELLEY, AND QUEEN LATIFAH WAS GREAT AS MATRON MAMA MARTON. THIS MOVIE REALLY IS ALL THAT JAZZ.

B00008J2DQ|3.0|Usually, the songs that comprise a particular album can be distinguished from songs on other albums by the same band because of unique themes and/or styles used on each album.  Godsmack, whom I have enjoyed listening to since the release of their debut self-titled album in 1998, is an exception.  When released, their debut album was unique and engaging as compared to other bands due primarily to the voice of Sully Erna, as well as the dark nature of the songs.  Godsmack's second album, \\"Awake\\", which was released in 2000, was very similar both thematically and stylistically to the first, but demonstrated improved musicianship.  For the most part, Godsmack's third and latest album, \\"Faceless\\", is thematically and stylistically identical to the first two albums with the only exceptions being the album's final two tracks.  The best songs on the album are \\"Straight Out of Line\\" and \\"I Stand Alone\\".  Out of a possible 5 stars, I rate each of the songs on \\"Faceless\\" as follows:<br />1. \\"Straight Out of Line\\" (5).  Song begins silently, then quickly builds with percussion and base.  (The same technique was used on the first song on the second album.)  The song uses a mix of aggressive percussion, base and guitar with Sully's unique voice.  Good guitar solo.<BR>2. \\"Faceless\\" (4.5). Strong guitar beginning followed by aggressive vocals.<BR>3. \\"Changes\\" (3.5). Again, strong guitar begins this song followed by aggressive vocals. Stylistically too similar to the previous song.<BR>4. \\"Make Me Believe\\" (2).  A less aggressive song with very whiney vocals. By far, the worst song on the album.<BR>5. \\"I Stand Alone\\" (5+).  A very good song taken from the \\"Scorpion King\\" soundtrack.<BR>6. \\"Re-Align\\" (3).  Intense guitar and strong vocals, but not a particularly engaging song.<BR>7. \\"I F****** Hate You\\" (3.5).  Unusual changes in harmony highlight this song with aggressive guitar, base and percussion.<BR>8. \\"Release of the Demons\\" (3). Changes in pitch highlight this relatively aggressive song.<BR>9. \\"Dead and Broken\\" (3.5). Aggressive guitar and base accompany Sully's aggressive vocals.<BR>10. \\"I Am\\" (4.5).  Slow, but aggressive.  A better song than the previous two tracks.<BR>11. \\"The Awakening\\" (3).  A short tribal, African-sounding chant accompanied by conga drums.  Probably an introduction to the last song.<BR>12. \\"Serenity\\" (4.5).  Another unique song on the album, which is a ballad.  The conga drums are again used as in the previous track, but the inclusion of the other instruments creates a feeling of India, not Africa.  Had Indian string instruments been used, the song's depth would have been enhanced.  The song itself is somewhat monotonic like a chant.<br />Godsmack's third album \\"Faceless\\" will probably be a disappointment to many fans that hoped to hear something new and different from the band.   Being barely distinguishable from the previous two albums, I can only rate the album with 3 out of 5 stars overall.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This DVD is amazing. It's a must have for anyone!
B00005JKLZ|3.0|I'm a big fan of classic science fiction, be it H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, or their more modern contemporaries like Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury. Keeping that in mind, I was greatly disappointed to miss \\"The Time Machine\\" while it aired at the movie theater. Now that I've rented the film, I no longer regret missing it at the theater. In a nutshell, the film is a gorgeous piece of eye candy, but not too much more. Wooden acting and a slow plot kept this film from being a commercial success. Only serious \\"Time Machine\\" fans like me could find some value with the movie and even that was difficult.<br />PROs:<BR>- The film's special effects for the Morlocks were outstanding. I've never seen a visual representation of them that was so well done. They were truly creepy.<br />- The Eloi were also well done. I really got the impression of a Utopian society of naïve children. The special effects directors drew inspiration from Native American culture heavily in their representation of the Eloi.<br />- Parts of the film have a campy feel to them that I found appealing. The movie's explanation of the world's destruction (moon shattered by a nuclear accident), reminded me heavily of the old \\"Planet of the Ape's\\" movies or the Kurt Russell film \\"Escape From New York.\\"  <br />- Jeremy Iron's depiction of the evil Morlock mastermind was a masterful performance. If you can't get the creeps from his performance, it's likely you never will!<br />- Samantha Mumba, who plays Mara, the exotic Eloi beauty was very easy on the eyes. She's a beautiful woman.<br />CONs:<BR>- The story is very LOOSLEY based on the wonderful H.G. Well's science fiction book of the same name. It trades in H.G. Wells's social commentary for an action movie plot and then fails to deliver.<br />- The story is very hard to believe, even being science fiction. The Eloi of the future still speak English despite a world disaster and centuries if not millennia of change. Suspend your belief or you're in for a hard ride.<br />- Until the Morlocks appear in the film, the plot is EXTREMELY slow. My roommate and I almost fell asleep watching it (In fact I did, but he woke me up.). <br />- Orlando Jones, who plays Vox, a sort of holographic librarian, from the future puts a very weak display of acting forward. The role is a serious one, but Orlando still tries to inject too much of his comedy into it. The end result was that he appeared silly rather than humorous. <br />- Guy Pierce is uninspiring. He also looks like he could use a meal the whole film with sunken cheeks that make him look curiously primate like (anyone in the mood for \\"Planet of the Apes?\\"). My roommate was inspired to make monkey noises several times during the film thanks to Pierce's odd appearance and even odder acting. Guy Pierce was much better in \\"L.A. Confidential.\\"  <br />I recommend the movie for someone looking for great special effects, but not for a fan of the H.G. Wells novel, \\"The Time Machine.\\" In other words, the movie is great eye candy, but don't expect any intellectual stimulation.<br />I greatly prefer the 1960 film version of \\"The Time Machine\\" with Rod Taylor. It had much more primitive special effects, but kept a much better plot and stayed much more accurately to the plot line from the H.G. Wells book.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan
B00005JKZV|4.0|I truly enjoyed the movie, and saw it in the theatre more than once - a rarity for me.  However, my complaint remains the same as it was in the first film; where has the nobility and integrity gone?  The story was dark in the original Tolkien works, but there was always a feeling that there was still good and beauty in the world.  Now Aragon seems afraid and alternately wretchedly ashamed and proud of his ancestry,  Elrond is bitter, Gimli is a pathetic joke gone wrong, Eomer is nowhere to be seen and the Ents are dried up old twigs while Faramir is a grasping, greedy fool.  I think much of the point of the story was that even in the darkest times there are people of good heart that evil can't break and that together, even if only in small ways, they can stand against the tide and make things turn out for the better.  If Jackson had kept more of that tone - left a few good guys in the film other than Frodo and his companions it would have been a better film.<BR>All in all it was still a great movie - but this one strayed a little too far from Tolkien's work for my taste.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This is the only version of this movie I have seen, so I can't compare it to previous releases or discuss the comparative quality of the DVD, etc.  I can, however, share my impressions of the movie itself.  In fact, to even call this extraordinary work of art a movie is like calling the Mona Lisa a picture.<br />This was the first silent movie I had ever watched (certainly won't be the last), and I watched it after reading some very interesting reviews of the film's artistry and importance.  To say I was not disappointed is an understatement.<br />The &quot;feel&quot; of the movie is somewhat similar to that of Blade Runner, a dark, futuristic world.  However, I have seen Blade Runner twice, many years ago, and I can only remember a few vague things about it (unfortunately the plot is not one of them).  But there is no doubt in my mind that the story and the images of Metropolis are burned into my memory with almost eerie permanence.  It was very, very far ahead of its time, in both story and scope.  In fact, if someone had told me that it was a modern movie purporting to be a 1927 silent movie I would have believed it hook, line, and sinker.  But my response would have been - 1927?  Impossible!  It is no wonder that Metropolis is required viewing for film students.  There is no doubt in my mind that it has influenced or directly inspired every science fiction film ever made.<br />Plot: Fascinating, easy enough to follow even when it doesn't always make complete sense.  (But then with one quarter of the movie tragically lost forever, it's a wonder it makes sense at all.)<br />Acting: Truly a joy - the actors, since they had no dialogue to fall back on, had to convey the story and move along the plot through facial expressions and gestures, and they succeeded magnificently.  Acting has come a long way, but the over-the-top acting style of the era adds to the movie's incredible charm.<br />Score: Magnificent.  I have not seen the 80's version with the heavy metal score, so I apologize if I offend its fans, but I absolutely can't imagine this film with any other but the original score.  It is perfect.  To replace the score with anything else would be giving the viewers only half the experience.<br />Artistry: Simply unbelievable.  The details are immaculate.  Watching the workers on the M machine move in rhythm to the music like a choreographed dance was an impression I will never forget, and how the mob that approached the gothic church at the end was arranged in a perfectly symmetrical pyramid.  The extraordinary art deco beauty of the Machine Man, the towering city, the intricate machines, all of it was simply fantastic (in the literal sense).  I have never seen anything so utterly captivating to watch.<br />The DVD quality does seem extraordinary, but again I have nothing to compare it to.  The picture was as clear as if it had been filmed yesterday.  The only disappointment - and it is a grave and tragic one - is not being able to see the fourth that was lost.<br />Very, very highly recommended, especially for fans of science fiction, the arts, architecture, the art deco period, silent films, classic films, special effects, film history ... well, you get the idea.e, so I apologize if I offend its fans, but I absolutely can't imagine this film with any other but the original score.

B00008H2LB|3.0|linkin park is linkin park.  theres not a huge amount of talent oozing from ANY member of the band.  the music is catchy and sounds good.  if youre looking for deep songs, you wont find them.  if youre looking for innovative songs, you wont find them.<BR>its exactly the type of album i expected them to release.  not bad but nothing special.  sounds good in the car due to the bass.  chester has a great voice.  guitar riffs still consist of 4 to 6 chords, nothing more.  the rap is the same, the dj's the same.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Honestly, this is the best CD, along with Hybrid Theory, I have ever heard, and I don't even like this kind of music.   The lyrics are amazing and the lead singer guy has an unbelievable voice when he chooses to sing and not to yell.  If you have Hybrid Theory and you loved it, you have to get this CD, too!!
0688170528|5.0|This is most definately one of the greatest books of all time. No other book has ever kept me so involved like this one. I could never put it down. Now, I am going to read every other book this author has written, because if they are even half as good as this one, it's worth my time. BUY IT!
B000088E6D|5.0|This is good! And Bublé interprets each song with incredible feeling and his own spin. He makes a great example of how you can bring a unique sound and style to older tunes and make them seem new, as if you're listening to them for the very first time.<br />I originally saw him quite a while back on the evening news in regards to his SuperBowl appearance, and again recently on CBC's Play and then the other night on the Paul Anka special. Wanting to see what all the hype was about I took the time to really listen (and buy) and am I glad I did. I put the cd in my car player and just let his tones overwhelm my senses. I arrived at my destination before the cd was over, so just sat listening right till the last note - I don't think I've ever done that before.<BR>Two cds later, both my roomate and I finally agree on something (and that's a first!!)  -- he's just fantastic!
B00005JLSE|5.0|I came to see this movie with some doubt, It had very good reviews and lots of nominations for the Golden Globe, I had seen the trailer and thought, well, it will be either very good or very dull. And since it was Rob Marshall's first movie, it was all a mystery, but then the film started and wow did it rocked, or should I say, it jazzed. I had seen very few musicals, only 3 if you skip Disney's musical/animated films, one good(The Sound of Music), the other also good but also the most depressing film ever(Dancer in the Dark) and one that it had it's moments but just wasn's enough(Moulin Rouge). But Chicago, it blew me away, everything in it was amazing.<BR>First, the cast, all of them were magnificent, thank good they all got award-recognition in some award and in some capacity. I was shocked when Richard Gere was ignored completely by the Academy, it was one of the many, but many mistakes it made this year,and yeah sure, even though he would not have won, he should have at least gotten the nomination, I mean, he was great, and he was the one who had it the hardest, because he had 3 musical pieces that involved dancing and singing, and on top of that, a tap with virtually zero musical background, plus the acting in the rest of the film which was great.<BR>Rene was the best, at least to me, and she deserved the Oscar, not Nicole, because both were great, but what made Rene better was that she carried out every possible human reaction in Chicago, she cried, she laughed, she sang, she danced, she was angry, she was lusty, she did everything and did it all very good, while Nicole did the same thing all the way through The Hours, she was sad and depressed, that's it, so here is mistake number 2 in the Oscars.<BR>Catherine Zeta-Jones was also magnificent, and just as Rene, she looked both very sexy and acted wonderfully, thank God she did get the Oscar, I mean she even sang in the ceremony, pregnant and all, but she did it, and Queen Latifah, although she was surprisingly good, we all knew she had no chance, but anyway, in her case is really just an honor to be nominated, not because she was bad, but because she was against monsters(you know what I mean). And finaly, John C. Reilly, he was fantastic as Amos \\"Cellophane\\" Hart, and well, I can accept Chris Copper winning, but at least he got the nomination.<BR>Then we have the director, in this category I also think the Academy made a huge mistake, not only did the failed to give the award to Scorsese, who was first in line, and before the name got read, I said, it will go either to him, or to Rob Marshall, the ones that really deserved it, but Polanski, come on, I mean, I love his work, Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby, all great, and The Pianist was magnificent also, but come on, The Pianist was quite similar to Schindler's List, and that doesn't make The Pianist bad, but Chicago and Gangs of New York were movies we have not seen before, and those were the directors that deserved the gold, not a director mixed up in sex offences, but a director who managed to create a wonderful and fantastic world with lots of flash, dash, magnificent performances, dance numbers, and last but not least, all that jazz.<BR>Some have complained that Chicago is boring and dumb, well, for those people I can only say one thing, stick to dumb and mass pleasing films like Daredevil, Scream and Just Married, films made to bring joy to numb masses. <BR>Chicago is great and I think both people who know a lot about films can love it just as casual movie viewers, and that's good, isn't grand , isn't great, isn't swell. Anyway, I recomend this film a lot, personaly, it's not only good, it's very relaxing, you just sit back and enjoy good filmaking that has humour, sexy women in sexy dance numbers, plus a story with lot's of content and that is very enjoyable. Ofcourse, see it first before buying it, that's something you must do before buying any film, at least in an original release, why? To see if it's worthy of spending give or take [few] bucks on it, I think Chicago is very worthy, and most likely, after you see it, you will feel the same. Good night folks.
B00005U11Z|5.0|My Journey DVD just arrived today and I just finished listening to it!  Wow!  It was quite outstanding!  Excellent picture, excellent sound, awesome talent, and a fulfilling song list.  Whether you are an &quot;older&quot; Journey fan or a relatively new one, this DVD is a must.  I love live music videos and dvds, and this one is the now the best I own.  There is nothing more disappointing than seeing a live concert where the music does not represent the music on the actual releases.  That definitely is not the case here.  Journey performs the songs just like they did on the initial releases, from Neal Schon's guitar work to Steve Augieri hitting all the notes &quot;faithfully&quot;.  I was not convinced that ANYONE could fill in for Steve Perry, but Augieri is unbelievably good!  I'm convinced now!  And Deen Castronovo provides some seriously high energy on the drums.  This DVD is a rockin' good time with the Journey staple songs included, plus a few of the newer songs released on the Arrival album a couple years ago.  Great music, great production work on this DVD.  Go buy it now!
B00008J4P5|4.0|This is probably the most overrated album since the Strokes debut. Don't get me wrong. This is fantastic music. Call it what you want; garage, blues, etc. but this is very good rock music. Jack White as a producer is a genius. But De-Stijl is still their masterpiece and I never understood why that album did not get the acclaim that Elephant is receiving. It is better by far, but I like this album more than White Blood Cells. Of course you must get them all as every album is better than 80% of anything else out there now.
B00000K19E|3.0|Back in 1999, before the much hyped and anticipated Star Wars Episode 1 was to be released, a little talked about and hyped science fiction movie slipped in under the radar a few months later and dazzled audiences with it's incredible fight scenes and special effects.<br />The Matrix is about a hacker (Keanu Reeves) that discovers he is really part of a huge virtual reality where his body energy powers evil machines that have enslaved mankind. He is rescued by human rebels and told that he is \\"the one\\"; the man that will lead humanity out of slavery. Or something. Did I mention people free of the machines had incredible powers and were constantly pursued by some very nasty machines, inside and outside of the matrix?<br />The movie sports a plot that is much more nonsense than brain teaser, but neo-norish settings that make the computer generated backgrounds of The Phantom Menace look kiddy like in comparison. The action is wide and varied, from kung fu fights with machines to shootouts in helicopters to a particularly stunning shootout in a massive, pillar filled lobby. To get to the action, however, can somewhat test your patience, especially if you're not a fan of Keanu's deadpan style of acting. Watch the whole film once, and buy the DVD so you can skip to the action scenes.
1573226521|4.0|This is the perfect book for those of us constantly searching for a better place, a better life. In this novel, this utopia consists of a secluded beach off the beaten tourist path of Thailand. Backpackers from different parts of the world assemble here and form their own distinct society, away from the pressures of every-day modern society. Except that in Garland's novel, this perfect world soon comes crashing down and dissolves into a tale of madness, revenge and drug addiction.<br />Garland's use of first-person narrative is very engaging and he has a writing style that makes for fast and easy reading. The Beach is a great ride, especially for backpackers, travellers and free spirits.
B000002696|5.0|Everybody knows of Miles Davis playing the cool jazz, including So What, All Blues, and the rest.  But what not everybody knows is his musical attitude towards jazz.  Miles said that he didn't want to play his cool jazz anymore, that it was already recorded in history.  Miles wanted to move on.  This CD is an amazing example of his onward movement.  With recurring ostanotos (sp?), a pinch of electric instrumentation, and beautiful improvisation, Miles creates groundbreaking and lasting music.  This album will really open your eyes, your ears, and your mind.  With art and music, the sky's the limit, and Miles is high above the clouds, composing among the stars.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I get so tired of buying a CD and finding maybe three songs that are actually enjoyable.  For the most part, I download songs online and burn CDs that I know I will enjoy.  This was the first album that I have purchased in a long time, and I am so glad that I did.  Norah Jones is incredible.  I listened to every song expecing to be let down by the next track.  It didn't happen.  Each song was just as impressive, if not more so, than the one before it.  I will buy anything that this woman records.  Her music is amazing and beautiful.
B000006045|5.0|Great cd!  Great band!  Start with this one if your just getting into them....great from start to finish
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is one of the best Linkin Park Cd's yet. Most of the songs are worth listening too again and again. Any LP fans out there and anyone else who likes rock should buy this CD. All the songs on Meteora are great and I recomend listinig to them if you havent already.
B000002LCI|4.0|I was born in 1986...so I haven't been a long time follower of DM...the first song I heard from them was &quot;Dream On&quot; which encouraged me to buy Exciter...I wasn't disapointed<br />I later bought Ultra and Violator, both which I love<br />Music for the Masses...hmm...its ok...I don't like it as much as the other 3 I have....I like Never Let Me Dow Again, Strange Love, Nothing, Pleasure Little Treasure, Little 15, I Want You Now...but they don't hold their ground to tracks like Enjoy the Silence, Dream On, Shine, Home, Its No Good, Freestate, World Through My Eyes, and so on....I do like it tho
B00008H2LB|5.0|this is the best thing linkin park has ever contributed to the nu-metal world. this CD is much heavier than hybrid theory with less hip hop style...there is a much wider range of music ranging from angry heavy stuff like \\"hit the floor\\" to angsty melodic songs like \\"breaking the habit\\", \\"easier to run\\", and \\"numb\\". this is much better than hybrid theory (although that was an awesome CD too) and about a hojillion times better than...reanimation.  this CD's style is what linkin park should stick to in the future.
B000000WZ4|5.0|very overlooked album!<br />Hardcore fans may not like it...they lost one of their band members and it sounds somewhat commercial at times and different than their past stuff...but I love it!  It still has a DM feel to it.<br />Barrel of a Gun is perhaps the most experimental....you'll think &quot;wait..is this DM I'm listening to?&quot; Home is simply beautiful and breath taking...Its No Good is great and catchy...and from there, every track is fantastic...be sure and check out Freestate...another beauty...this may not be a sure fire classic like Violator....but its a great disc if your very familiar with the band.
B000084T18|5.0|This is a great album.  50 Cent has been around for a while but most of his stuff was underground.  After the controversial \\"How To Rob\\" he was shot and his record contract dropped.  Now he has come with \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\", which indeed lives up to all of the hype.  It's a classic and i recomend it to anybody and i think everybody should cop it.<br />BEST SONGS: \\"What Up Gangsta\\", \\"Patiently Waiting\\", \\"Many Men\\", \\"In Da Club\\"(overplayed though), \\"High All The Time\\", \\"Heat\\", \\"If I Can't\\", \\"Blood Hound\\", \\"Back Down\\", \\"PIMP\\", \\"Like My Style\\", \\"Poor Lil Rich\\", \\"21 Questions\\", \\"Don't Push Me\\", \\"Gotta Make It To Heaven\\" and all three bonus tracks, (i forget the title of the first one) and \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"Life's On The Line\\" are both great to.  Thats all of them so cop it now.
B000059MEK|5.0|I bought this soley for One More Time...and I got so much more!<br />Every track has the same feel, but is different in its own way.  There are only one or two tracks that fall short for me (SuperHeros and I think its track 14..can't remember).  But the rest of the album makes up for it.  Its catchy, dancy, and puts you in a good mood.  Sometimes its cheesy and retro, but its very fun.  You grow to love this.
B00005JLK1|3.0|There's enough reviews here that talk about the story in a lot of detail, so I won't go there. But the thing is, it's not really about the ship. The commercials, and some reviews make it sound like it's an evil haunted ship. Well, that's the half of it. Who's controlling what happens on the ship? Is it the ship itself, or the hanuted people on board, or maybe the devil?<br />Basically, a ship that was lost some 40+ years before is found abandoned and (somehow) still floating in the bearing straight. As soon as they get on the ship wierd things start happening. What's frustrating here is the lack of characters ability to notice that something isn't quite right. Even when they notice wierd things, they keep it to themselves for the most part, which isn't very realistic. <br />The movie wasn't what I thought it'd be about, which I think just about everybody who sees it will agree. It was more like a sea-dwelling \\"Event Horizon\\" then anything. ...). If you liked ghost ship, you may like Event Horizon, but yet I digress.<br />So, in the very end of the movie everything makes sense. I won't give it away, cause although I thought the movie wasn't so great, and that it dragged on, I really got a kick out of the very last 10-15 seconds of the movie. It's funny how one image can make it all make sense. Now, if they could have only made the rest of the movie that interesting.<br />There really isn't a lot of horror in this movie. The beginning 5 minutes is the grossest part, and from then on, it's pretty much PG-13 if I remember correctly, other than some [breasts]. <br />Now, for those who have actually seen this, this section of my review will make more sense then for those who haven't. I'm not sure the point of the beginning scene. I mean, if you wanted to kill a bunch of people all at once, and you actually had a bunch of guys with machine guns, wouldn't you just line them up and mow them down, what's the deal with the dramatic \\"death trap\\" device? Seems kind of far-fetched to me. Seems like an awful lot of trouble. Not that I'm an expert in killing mass amounts of people all at once. :)<br />So anyways, if it wasn't for that last 10-15 seconds, which are brilliant, I'd rate this a 2 star cause the movie is long, doesn't have a lot of action or horror, and doesn't really get to the point until the very last seconds.<br />I don't think they set this up for a sequal like some have speculated, but rather the final seconds explain really how everything works. <br />So, a good renter, but I would have been upset had I paid to see this in a theater.
0066214122|4.0|I have come away feeling that I read a good novel. Not great, just good. Prey is a high-tech novel, and though Crichton had much explaining to do, he did so in an entertaining fashion. You don't feel like you're at a college lecture here, he tells a simple story of technology gone wrong.<br />The nanotechnology is hard to understand at times, but as for story-telling content, the novel succeeds well. Crichton is not wordy. The story is simple and flows quite well. Although it has its tense parts, I was never really on the edge of my seat. The most entertaining parts were where the nanoswarms figured out how to take the shape of...well, read and find out. I finished it quickly and feel satisifed I bought the hard cover to add to my collection. I also woud not be surprised if his book found itself in a screen writers hands. It is a perfect story for a movie--short, few characters, cool special effect possibilities. <br />If you're a passing reader, I'd recommend picking it up and the library or waiting for the paper back. If you want GREAT Crichton, pick up Jurassic Park, Lots World, or Airframe.<br />All in all, good book. He uses the idea of nanotechnology well, though this story could have been more grand.
B00005JL96|1.0|Disney's \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" was directed by Chris Sanders & Dean DeBlois.  It is about a little Hawaiian girl named Lilo and her sister, Nani, and how a destructive alien named Stitch brings them together.  That's enough summary.  You want plot, read the other reviews.<br />There are good things in this movie.  Some parts are purely delightful.  Stitch and Lilo can both be cute at times, and it was nice to hear some traditional Elvis.  Cobra Bubbles, the social worker, is a funny guy.  And some of the parts are funny, too.  That's about it.<br />I'm an animation major, so I realize that I'm very critical when it comes to Disney.  But truthfully, I was SHOCKED when I found out that people actually like this movie.  For one thing, it's badly written.  It needs a decent script.  It's boring.  The plot is choppy.  Everything is twisted (not gracefully) to be about families, and worst of all, the characters are incredibly cruel to each other (for laughs, I felt) and never really turn around until the last two minutes.  I thought these were flaws that were so blatant everyone would notice them.  The little movie critic that lives in my head was screaming bloody murder.<br />Just a few things to warn parents about--Lilo is a brat, Nani is abusive, and Stitch just is there to tear things down.  I'm surprised that this movie wasn't rated PG-13...I believe it was going to be, but then they took out the part with Pudgy (Lilo's pet fish) getting pecked to death by seagulls.  Yeah, and you thought this was a kids' movie.  One of the most disturbing parts is when Stitch & Lilo shove a little girl off her tricycle and take off with it, leaving the little girl sobbing in the dirt.  If you think that's funny, you have some serious mental problems.<br />There's a lot of screaming, it's not very funny, and to me, very unconvincing.  The moral this one left me with was, hey, it's okay to treat others like ....because Ohana means family.  I won't buy that.  I'd strongly suggest parents read some proffessional reviews on this movie, there's a reason this movie hasn't made much money in comparison to the Disneys of the past.  \\"Hunchback\\" and even \\"Pocahantas\\" grossed over $100 million more than this one.  I hope that says something.  Methinks parents HAVE been doing their jobs and reading the reviews on this one.  (In gentle reprimand to someone below who called parents \\"stupid\\").<br />As for me- if I ever work for the Disney animation studio, I'll do everything in my power to make clever, sweet, funny movies like \\"Aladdin\\" and \\"Monster's Inc.\\" and keep painfully hideous movies like \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" from ever gracing the storyboards of Burbank.  What the HECK were they thinking?
B000084T18|1.0|This pop album not lyrical skills whatsoever, just the fact that he's under EMINEM makes him \\"good\\". This is ideal for High Skool kids who think this is real hip hop. Worse album, ever
0142002038|5.0|As most teenagers, I had my &quot;Bond movies phase&quot;, renting and watching every movie from Sean Connery through Lazenby, Moore, Dalton and now Brosnan. Even so, I had never read one of Ian Fleming's books, prejudicialy dismissing them as childish and poorly written. After ten years, I found &quot;Doctor No&quot; in a used-books store, and since I made the mistake of thinking this was, like in the movies, the first book of the series, I bought it.<br />In &quot;Doctor No&quot;, James Bond, after a bad mission and spending some time in a hospital, is given a kind of &quot;vacation mission&quot; in Jamaica. He has to discover what happened to the local stationed british secret agent, who is reported missing. When Bond gets there, he is driven towards Crab Key, a misterious island owned by Julius No, a tall, bald maniac for privacy and who is hiding things from jamaican administration.<br />To my surprise (and showing I was wrong in my prejudices), Fleming is a good writer who can hold the reader's attention at most times. It's just a pity that I didn't begin the series with the first book, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, to see how Fleming developed his writing style, characters and plots while writing the books.<br />Other surprise was to compare Bond in the books with Bond in the movies. Bond in the books was more human and credible, even to the point of throwing up after moments of extreme tension. Other characters are interesting as well, like nature girl Honey Rider and Bond's friend Quarrell. I also liked to meet again characters like M and Q. Doctor No, though, as everything related to Crab Key island, is a little too fantastic for my taste, but, from the information I gathered, &quot;Doctor No&quot; is Fleming's most &quot;exotic&quot; and implausible book.<br />The important considerations are that Fleming can create good thrilling scenes, and that James Bond is a better character than I expected. I will surely look for &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and start the series in proper order.<br />Grade 8.8/10e series in proper order. <br />Grade 8.8/10
B00006RU5B|3.0|Either this album doesn't work well, musically, or it's just too sophisticated for me.  Probably some of both.  Either way, I'm a bit disappointed.<br />Having forced myself to sit through it, a few times, I'm about to put on Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger and remind myself what I like about Chris Cornell's singing.<br />Oh, and someone should tell Cornell not to screech like that creepy AC/DC guy (especially as in track 1: Cochise).  It would save both his vocal chords and my ears.
B00008I8IF|5.0|YES AFTER JUST ONE LISTEN, I GIVE THIS CD 5 STARS. <BR>IT WAS AT ONCE INSTANTLY FAMILIAR AND WARM YET NEW AND CHARMING. THE SONGS ARE AS MANY REVIEWERS HAVE STATED ARE IN A BYRDS/PARSONS/CSNY VIEN, BUT IN AN ALL ORIGINAL JAYHAWKS WAY. IF YOUR A FAN OF THE &quot;NO DERESSION&quot; STYLE OF MUSIC OR OF ANY OF THE ARTISTS ABOVE, OR IF YOUR JUST A GOOD MUSIC FAN; YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT THE JAYHAWKS. I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY
B00006LPER|5.0|When I first heard about Michael Haneke's \\"The Piano Teacher\\", about a sexually repressed instructor at the Vienna Conservatory, I thought it was exactly the kind of movie I didn't want to see.  In a world awash in pop music, South Park and Britney videos, how could a film about the stultifyingly uptight classical music world have *any* relevance for a post-modern, post-everything film buff (even if he is American?)  Didn't Bergman tread this ground 40 years ago?  Didn't Bunuel make savage fun of the hypocrisy of bourgeois sexual   respectability in \\"Belle de Jour\\" (1966)?  Wasn't Haneke a little behind the times? <br />Walking - or I should say staggering - out of the theater 2.5 hours later, I was humbled by the scope of Haneke's and Huppert's achievement.  Rarely have I seen a film both so clear-eyed about sexual psychosis and yet so compassionate as well.  Isabelle Huppert, who probably wasn't nominated for an Oscar only because the film can be so off-putting to some, gives what can only be described as an intense performance.  Her clenched face and the darting movements of her eyes reveal more about her character - her inner rage, her self-hatred - than most actors can achieve with sheets and sheets of dialouge.  That's the essence of the film, everything is very formally *controlled* - so that when violence, self-inflicted or otherwise, breaks out, it is startling because it emerges from such as civilized veneer.<br />If the point of the film were to demonstrate the High Culture spiritually deforms those who engage in it (and I don't think it does), the film would have minimal interest.  High culture has been on the defensive so long, it doesn't need to be blamed for driving Isabelle Huppert nuts as well.  Rather the film gains its strength from watching a seriously damaged human being - damaged in ways only suggested at - construct a protective cocoon around herself that fails to protect her from troublesome feelings and desires.  The film is somewhat similarto Neil Jordan's great film, \\"The Butcher Boy\\" whose protagonist uses an opposite strategy - relentless good cheer -to mask the absolute misery he's sinking into.  In these two films, as well as other recent films like Noe's \\"I Stand Alone\\", Nyutten's \\"L'Humanite\\", Haneke's other recent film \\"Code: Unknown\\" and Tim Roth's \\"The War Room\\", European filmmakers are portraying contemporary Europe as a society rife with cultural and psychological malaise - along with a great uncertainty as to ability of others to ameliorate the misery that man hands to his fellow man.<br />\\"The Piano Teacher\\" is important - essential even - not because Isabelle Huppert is asked to do things on camera few major actresses would willingly agree to.  The film gets right to the dark heart of our contemporary malaise - our declining faith in the ability of culture - or anything - to ease us out of our despair and mitigate the cruelty we often see around us.  The film is extremely distributing, enraging but not empty - it was the most provocative piece of cinema to be release in the US last year.
B00005QG9J|5.0|After listening to &quot;Morning View&quot;, a few things jump out at you.  First of all, not a bit of their old metal personas, which were started to be discarded with &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, remain with this album.  Instead, this album simply spans from alternative to trippy pop.  Second, the musical progression made from &quot;Make Yourself&quot; to &quot;Morning View&quot; is staggering.  The songs on this album are tight, ending just when you want to hear something different.  And finally, and most obviously, there is not a bad song in the bunch.  Each add a unique part to the album as a whole, and make &quot;Morning View&quot; a fantastic album.  If you don't already have it, go and buy Incubus' newest...you won't be disappointed.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I agree with all these reviews that this movie was amazing! If you have not seen it, BUY IT NOW! The movie has such an amazing heart and it pains me that more people didn't see it in the theaters. This movie ranks as one of my favorites.
B000002J09|5.0|What can I say about &quot;IV&quot; that hasn't already been said thousands of times?  From start to finish, there is not another single album that can compete with this CD.  Every song is fantastic, highlighted by &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, the greatest hard rock song on the greatest hard rock album by the greatest hard rock band of all time.
0385504209|5.0|Seldom in popular fiction do you find such intelligent writing as that produced by Dan Brown.  In addition to the superbly crafted mystery that we are privileged to enjoy it is as though you have attended a seminar on in this case art and religious iconology.<br />As Brown states at the start of his book, \\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate. When I am reading a book by Dan Brown I never feel that I am wasting my time. You might ask if all this information bogs down the story and the answer is a resounding \\"NO\\".  Brown has the ability to take dry facts and present them in a fascinating way.  He also brilliantly weaves together many diverse threads into a coherent and intriguing plot.<br />We first met Professor Robert Langdon in Brown's previous thriller 'Angels And. Demons'. This book continues our acquaintance with the compulsive and brilliant Langdon and introduces the equally clever Sophie Neveu.  She is the estranged granddaughter of the curator of the Louvre, who is the victim of a savage murder. As he lays dying he leaves a cryptic message for his granddaughter and Langdon to decipher. Thrown together by the events that have occurred they must combine their considerable skills to solve the complex mystery before it is too late.<br />This book is a must read for mystery buffs and anyone who enjoys intelligent literature!
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time I heard the song \\"Bring me to Life,\\" I was blown away by Amy Lee's vocals.  Evanescence brings a fresh, unique sound to the rock scene and I'm pretty sure that they'll be around for years to come.  There really isn't a weak song on the album.  If you love this album, then I would suggest listening to some of their early stuff as well (i.e. the album Origin, which is an out of print and very hard to find).
B00000099Y|5.0|one of my favorite rock albums, and one of my favorite rock bands. i actually didnt get this when it first came out, and had been sitting on the fence about it until about a year ago, and i still listen to it alot, if you like Tool, or want an intro into the band, this would be the best place to start.
B00005O5CM|4.0|This movie is not extremely deep but is very funny and enjoyable. Reece Witherspoon is, once again, very charming and funny in this light and funny comedy.<br />If you want to have a good time I absolutely recommend this film.
B000000W8C|5.0|Okay, hello fellow Verve listeners and amateurs alike. This is the best verve album, Urban Hymns cannot compare to this mastery. The first track is called A new Decade, and it shows that the verve can rock as well as show it's perfect ambient side. The seconbd track is the aptly titled \\"This Is Music\\", Which when I first heard it, I knew what music was. n your own is probably my least favorite track. The next track, so it goes, is half hard half not, and I enjoy it. A spotlight in the album is track five, A Northern Soul. This song not only rocks, but it's lyrical intensity gives me chills, when he [Richard Ashcroft] screams... I'M GONNA DIE ALONE IN BED, You'll understand pain and suffering of emotions.  The brainstorm Interlude is still proof that they can rock out. Drive you home shows the incredible beauties of what they have done. History is a string-laced piece of art, I only wish the strings wouldn't be so piercing. No Knock on my door is just a bluesy beauty. Life's an ocean is a true gem ... \\"Imagined the future, woke up with a scream, I was buying some feelings, from a vending machine\\" Thats the shi*. Stormy clouds is a great song, but not the best, and the final reprise is the most incredible guitar work and emotional song that is instrumental that I have ever heard. I own so many good CD's, and this one is definitely in my top five. Buy this after Urban Hymns, only if you like the song The Rolling people and Come on.
B00008QSA5|2.0|So do we really need to hear this? I guess if you are an Al Kooper fan, there is some merit, although, the Kooper kuts here were done better and more dramatically with BS&amp;T. Bloomfield never impressed me much, so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills, but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit. Stills? Please. What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort. Sure, played hard, not much to show for it. I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on.<BR>Give credit to the remastering crew, though. You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is. The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I've ever heard. Caveat emptor (that's let the buyer beware for all of you from LI).
0553381709|2.0|This whole series has been extremely long winded, ill edited, and an attempt at either soft porn or fantasy, and coming up short on at least the fantasy aspect.  The story line is good, however, it is lost in a deluge of side stories that does nothing but water down the story line.  A good editor could have pulled the same story together in 1/2 the pages.  Martin must of been getting paid the old IBM programming way- by the line.  Better then Tolkien?  I think not.
B000089RVX|3.0|Ok, I just wanted to let people know that this band sounds just like Lacuna Coil from Italy.  Lacuna Coil have been around since 96 and have 3 albums out.  I give Evanescence credit for what they've accomplished in such a short time, but give credit where credits due.  In short, Evanescence are nothing original. Check out Lacuna Coil!
B00008GKEG|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan for about 6 years now, I'm very familiar with their later stuff, somewhat familiar with the early stuff...<br />That having been said, this documentary is absolutely amazing.  I used it as 11 hours of background noise while doing spring cleaning, and i'm now going back to watch the good parts.  THE FULL ROOF-TOP CONCERT!! THREE FULL SONGS FROM SHEA STADIUM.  BOTH FULL SONGS FROM THE FIRST ED SULLIVAN APPEARANCE.  FULL MUSIC VIDEOS FOR PENNY LANE, DAY IN THE LIFE AND MANY OTHERS...<br />This is what sets this documentary apart...the Beatles were documented at the time like no one else, and this set takes full advantage of the existing material as well as multiple lenghty interviews with George, Paul, Ringo and George Martin to create an absolute anthology of the life of The Beatles.<br />And as far as the \\"Amazon.com\\" review goes.  The first episode alone is about the four guys growing up in Liverpool, getting their first instruments and such.  The beauty of DVD, you can skip it.  I think it's good background that enhances anyone's appreciation of the band, but I've been able to watch the Shea Stadium performance numerous times without slogging through Paul's baby pictures too much.  I suspect the Amazon.com reviewer didn't watch beyond the first half-hour of the series.

6305508550|4.0|Great movie, plenty of laughs, especially if you've been there.  Would love a version without the (c)rap soundtrack, talk about bringing a movie down...
B00005OAIE|4.0|I'm really amazed to find so many bad reviews for John Mayer here.  He's young, which means that this album is full of freshness, and he's only going to get better!<BR><br />Some of the songs seem not fully thought out, but his Stevie Ray Vaughn-esque guitar is really good, and he has a really nice voice.  &quot;3 x 5&quot; is a truly beautiful, mature song.  I look forward to hearing more form him!
B00008GKEG|5.0|I've enjoyed the Anthology series when it was broadcast and released on VHS but the DVD's are the ultimate. Yes the additional material is nice but what really impressed me were the songs. The Beatles music will always be the foundation of their legend and the music quality on these DVD's is outstanding! The clarity of their vocals and the nuances in their instrumentation makes them all sound brand new. It's as if they were recorded yesterday. I hope they remix all their music as well as they have done on these DVD's and re-release the entire catalog of Beatles recordings! Phenomenal sound! I feel like a kid again!
B00008J4P5|4.0|i want to give this **** and 1/2.<br />i have to admitt i a huge fan of the White Stripes.  I lovedWhite Blood Cells.  it would definately put it on my top 5 album of all time and i doubt if it would ever be bumped out.  i picked up Elephant on the first day when it came out.  i was so freaking excited and i listend to it at least 10 times straight.  At first it seems kinda flat and uncreative compare to the previous album.  it didn't have instant classic track like \\"Fall in Love with a Girl\\" or \\"Dead Leaves on the Dirty Ground.\\" although it still sound pretty good, i was pretty disappointed.  two weeks later, when i saw the music video on MTV (Seven Nation Army.  really cool) i was inspired to listen to it again.  then i realized how catchy and powerful the album is.  The amazing guitar solo was so juicy! Jack's voice is so haunting, and i have to say they haven't lost their sound at all.<br />anyway, to keep it short, this is an amazing follow up to White Blood Cell.  every song is great, but it just took me more time to absort it.  which is always a good thing. get this album or you will miss out and wonder what the hell they are playing on tv and radio these days. Linkin Park? ew[...]  Simple Plan? booooooo
B000001ELR|5.0|From the original album cover (thankfully brought back) to the last metallic note recorded, this album is one of THE BEST hard rock albums of all time!  KISS is my personal favorite band and I prefer the original lineup, but this album deserves praise for the songwriting and recording.  It is an incredibly heavy album for KISS.  I use &quot;metallic&quot; to describe it.  Other descriptive words that come to mind would be &quot;thunderous&quot; (Eric Carr's drum sound is one of the biggest in recorded hard rock), &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;in your face&quot;. There is NO filler on this disc.  It's not a long disc, so listen to it start to finish.  One of my favorite tracks is &quot;Danger&quot;.  &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; is an amazing track and kicks the album off properly.  That song sets the tone for the tracks to follow.  &quot;I Love It Loud&quot; is a terrible song live (IMHO), but here it is a masterpiece in it's simplicity.  &quot;Saint and Sinner&quot; is one of Gene's shining moments.  &quot;I Still Love You&quot; is an excellent power ballad.  The recording of this album is a critical part of it's magic.  If Eric Carr's drums sounded weaker, the album won't be nearly as bombastic.  Just a great, great album.  KISS didn't record many like this.  &quot;Lick It Up&quot; followed and has some of the same elements (&quot;Not For The Innocent&quot; and &quot;Young and Wasted&quot;), but misses the mark overall when compared to &quot;Creatures&quot;.  Forget your friends who tell you Revenge is heavy.  Not even close.  This is one of the best KISS albums. Period. It might even be the best overall.  I've been a fan for 25 years and have listened to more bootlegs than most average KISS fans own of their released albums.  You know how people talk about &quot;desert island&quot; albums?  Pack this one.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I first saw Yes live during the Yessongs tour and later for the Relayer and 90125 tours. Great stuff but this show with the awesome symphony backing made songs like &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; and &quot;Ritual&quot; so much more accessible to me anyway. Keyboards were mixed down too low and Steve Howe lacked a little fire, but Allen White's drumming and exaggerated accents worked well with the symphony backing. Chris Squire is great as usual in spite of tights(!) and Jon Anderson's vocals have never been better. Good viewing for any new Yes fans too.

B001NXBRJG|5.0|Hacker Neo (Keanu Reeves) wakes up one night to an online call as he is being followed by a group of cyber-agents including their leader Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). When a group of rebels such as Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie Ann-Ross), Cyprus (Joe Pantoliano), Tank (Marcus Chong), Mouse (Matt Doran), Switch (Belinda McClory) and more come to Neo's rescue they open his eyes to reality that what his own perception is reality isn't what it really is. It's a world controlled by A.I. as long ago machines took over nearly the planet and the only place for humanity is underground in a large city called Zion where Neo is foretold in a prophecy by the Oracle (Gloria Foster) that he is a future messiah to destroy those that have control of the system called The Matrix.<br /><br />One of the greatest Sci-fi and action movies of all time! The Wachowskis after doing \\"Bound\\" and \\"Assassins\\" wrote/produced/directed a genuine new classic of the genres. While the film maybe not very original as it borrows from Frank Herbert's Dune novels, anime (Ghost in The Shell for example), comic books, William Gibson's cyberpunk novels, Blade Runner, John Woo's movies, martial arts cinema and more in one unique and smart ride of a movie. In March of 1999, audiences made this one of the highest grossing movies of the sci-fi genre as both critics/audiences embraced this movie including me. As a fan of animation/anime/Sci-fi/action/cyberpunk at the age of 17 watching this in theaters 7 times it got better with each viewing, the performances are terrific including Keanu Reeves at times even if he's a bit on the wooden side. Some of the dialog is a bit silly but there's good philosophy with outstanding unforgettable sequences that echo anime and John Woo's Hong Kong motion pictures. It was followed by 2 sequels which are enjoyable but nothing beats the first one, it's still popular to this day and now imitated but never equaled.<br /><br />I own this in the Matrix Trilogy boxset but this Blu-Rays shows flawless picture despite a few grains in a couple of scenes, outstanding sound that rockets the sound system to high rolling. The extras are terrific as In-Movie Experience which as you watch the movie you see a small full film length experience of recollections of the cast and crew, written introduction, 4 audio commentaries, Full length documentary: \\"The Matrix Revisited\\", featurettes of many, The Music revisited where 41-track audio music selection where you hear the score with some of the songs for 3 hours, music video with Marylin Manson and finally TV Spots with Trailers/Teasers.ays shows flawless picture despite a few grains in a couple of scenes, outstanding sound that rockets the sound system to high rolling.

B00005JLSE|5.0|Definitely the best musical I've ever seen. Maybe even the best movie, let alone musical. It's definitely a must see. I must say I never thought I'd see Gere, Zelwegger, and Zeta-Jones in a musical, especially all of them together yet the casting was perfect. Queen Latifa was great for her part too. All around it's a great movie, if you haven't seen it I'd recomend you do.
B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein is a most intresting band. The lead singer is a deep tenor with a sharp edge on his voice. Since the band speaks German it sounds very strong, perfect for hard rock. <BR>  When most Americans hear the &quot;techno&quot; in Rammstein they dislike the band for only that reason, but the band doesn't really feature their keyboardist and mostly focuses on their guitars.<BR>  The sound of their guitars are very metalic. Very deep and very powerful. This, the bass, and the keyboardist all go well together in a get up and rock way.<BR>  There are other bands that are similar for instance Megaherz. You should hear them as well before buying this album, but I still think Rammstein's Herzeleid is one of the best albums in a long time.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Best movie I've ever seen, The casting was great, along with the music. They were all GREAT but the best songs would probably be:<BR>1.  We Both Reached For The Gun - Gere<BR>2.  When You're Good To Mama - Queen Latifa<BR>3.  Cell Block Tango - Catherine along with 5 others<BR>and<BR>4.  All That Jazz - Catherine<BR>If you haven't seen it I'd suggest you do, it's a movie with good music, grand, and a great story line.
0783225881|5.0|I first saw this film, in the theatre, before DVD's came out.  I ended up seeing it six times.  At the time I thought I was loosing touch with reality, but, no, it's just that good, that poignant.  I now live on a tropical island in the South Pacific, and have to special order DVD's.  Field of Dreams will be my next order.

B00008H2LB|4.0|The variety is lacking in many of the tracks; however, this rock CD rocks!  Meteora redeemed LP from their poor Reanimation cd but failed to top Hybrid Theory. They have quite a few good tracks, but many just sound the same. I enjoy Linkin Park, and they entertained me for 37 minutes. Good CD, but not the best.
B000089RVX|5.0|Not that Bring Me to Life is a bad song -- it's an awesome song. But if you like it, you're in for an amazing musical experience if you haven't heard the rest of this CD yet. Amy Lee's voice is absolutely amazing. She's probably one of the most talented female singers of the last 15 years. The hardness of the music alone is enough to hook you -- her voice just puts it all over the top. This band has the potential to take rock in a totally new direction all on their own and I think this album completely redefines the bar on which all other rock albums should be judged. Heck, they the best rock group (whether you want to consider them a christian/gospel rock, goth rock, nu-metal, hard rock, whatever) to come out in a LONG time. Every song on this album absolutely rocks - each has its own element that makes it so great - so it's hard to say that any of the songs on the album are better than any of the others. Ones to definitely take a listen to are Everybody's Fool, Going Under, Taking Over Me, and Tourniquet. It's hard to take it out of the CD player and put something else in, because every time I do I end up putting it back in within a few minutes. Go out and buy it!
B00000J6AG|5.0|I bought this CD for the song &quot;My Weakness&quot; which I first heard in an episode of the X-Files. After listening to &quot;My Weakness&quot; a few times I listened to the rest of the CD. I loved just about every song. My favorites are &quot;Porcelain&quot;, &quot;South Side&quot;, &quot;Natural Blues&quot;, &quot;Run On&quot; and of course &quot;My Weakness&quot;. Moby's music is different from most music I hear but it is definately better. The song &quot;The Sky Is broken&quot; is poetry set to music. I liked &quot;Run On&quot; for setting old singing to newer music. This one of my favorite CD's.
0316921173|4.0|First of all, this book is really long.  It also is very dense, which isn't necessarily bad, but it increases the time invested.  I estimate that this book consumed 5 books worth of reading time.  This isn't a book to approach lightly; it's like buying a house or adopting an infant.<br />So, tread carefully, fellow reader, for it's a long strange trip.  It's a trip with lots of big words scattered gratuitously about, sure to strain even the most prodigious of vocabularies.  <br />There are a series of loosely interweaving plots, involving a truly delightful crew.  Mr. Wallace send us on an extended amusement park ride with harrowing twists and turns, surprises and quick jerks, then essentially brings us back to where we started.  Along this ride, there are probably 100 pages that are among the best pages of prose I have ever read.<br />It's a long ride and I just got a little tired.  I wanted the ride to come to the end, but had to endure another 300 pages of his magic because it was so darn compelling.<br />My main concern is recommending the book to the right people, as it is so costly an endeavour.  Essentially, this is Trippy Literature.  If you like Trippy Literature, and want to endure 1000 pages of one of its finest incarnations, read on you crazy diamond.  If you don't like Trippy literature, or you are not sure what &quot;Trippy&quot; means, read Brother's Karamazov.
0790729628|4.0|(aka &quot;Do androids dream of electric sheep&quot;) Ok, the directors cut took out my favoite part, the voice over...I always considered it a tribute to Bogart and noir films, I want that version on DVD, I was smart enough to get it on vhs.  The way that some questions are considered, great acting and scene intensity make it unforgetable. Some of the questions: &quot;How long do I have to live?&quot; &quot;How do you know whats real (memories)?&quot;  &quot;Does anyone care about how I feel (why did you do this to us)?&quot;<br />  Playing god, as the company finds, does have its dangers. On the poisoned earth, those left behind live among the relics and try to find themselves.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie was tons of fun just to watch.  I really enjoyed every second of it.  I loved it so much, I ran to the store to buy the soundtrack.  It's a definite must see if you like great acting, great music, and great costumes.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
B000001F3C|4.0|I got into U2 back in high school at least partly because of a girl who hated me.  Her name was Jenny and the two of us mixed like oil and water.  Jenny was a good friend of several of my close female friends so I was always around her despite our mutual antipathy.  Part of the problem was that in ninth grade I had accidentally discovered that Jenny was responsible for a recent incident of vandalism in which the phrases \\"Nam Sucked\\" and \\"Free Nelson Mandela\\" had been spray painted in large white letters across the front of our beloved high school.  Jenny became paranoid that I would turn her in to school authorities and began to make my life miserable with threats of physical violence of a most unpleasant nature.<br />You might suspect that Jenny cut an imposing figure, but she was actually short, pale, and thin.  She did, however, have an alarming affinity for spending her free time cutting and burning herself, hobbies which allowed her to achieve a sinister aura despite her diminutive stature.  To avoid harassment from teachers at school, Jenny covered up the damage wrought by knife and flame by regularly donning a studded black leather jacket featuring the word \\"Siouxsie\\" etched on the back with what appeared to be white-out.  Three musical artists mattered to Jenny - one you can already guess, the other two were Kate Bush and U2.  Now, I had little interest Siouxsie and the Banshees or Kate Bush, but U2 seemed a little more compelling.  I'd heard \\"New Year's Day\\" on the radio and found it utterly entrancing.  As much as I disliked Jenny, I had to admit she might be onto something.  I discussed this hunch with my friend, Chris, and he seemed to be of like mind.  In fact, he went so far as to pick up U2's War and a few weeks later kindly leant it to me.  <br />From the first drumbeats of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", I was hooked.  After several years of happily listening to great songs without much lyrical substance from albums like Van Halen's Fair Warning and Boston's Boston, War was the first overtly political album I'd heard and I loved it.  Whereas Fair Warning made me want to chase girls and Boston made me want to learn to play guitar, War gave me the urge to change the world or at least be more informed about what was going on in it.  Even if you completely ignore the lyrics on War, the anthemic sound of many of these songs just makes them feel important.  In hindsight, although The Joshua Tree moved more units and Boy was a better overall album, no album represents what U2 were all about in the 1980s better than War.  Songs like \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", \\"Seconds\\", \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"Like A Song\\" and \\"The Refugee\\" touch both mind and heart.<br />After War, Jenny felt U2 began to lose the faith.  I'll never forget how betrayed she felt by The Joshua Tree, which was released at a time of even greater social upheaval than usual for Jenny.  Her torrid affair with a 25-year old Marine was coming to a close and she had begun looking forward to college at Columbia where she would come to embrace the love that dare not speak its name.  New York appeared to agree with Jenny and from what I've heard, she became far less angsty and self-destructive once she arrived there.  After a brief stint in grad school at Vanderbilt, Jenny dropped out to toil in the health food industry, met the love of her life, and got married in the Pacific Northwest.  Since we certainly don't keep in touch, your guess is as good as mine as to whether Jenny ever pulls out her early U2 albums or how she feels about All That You Can't Leave Behind which in some ways represents a return to U2s early sound.  Call me crazy, but I'm kind of curious to know.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I really enjoyed The Chambers of Secrets. The script was mostly good, but the actors and actresses were great! They really bring the books to life! I do have a couple of complaints however. One is about the scene in Knockturn Alley. The whole point of the scene in the book was Harry witnessing the Malfoys selling some of their illegal magical items, but since the Malfoys didn't appear in this scene, it didn't really make a lot of sense. My other complaint was I was really looking forward to the scene where Harry, Ron, Fred and George were degnoming the Weasley garden, but unfortunately that scene wasn't filmed. Other than these, I really enjoyed Chamber of Secrets, especially the scene where Ron attempts to curse Malfoy after he insults Hermoine, and because of his broken wand, his spell backfires!
B00005JKQZ|3.0|Beautiful Mind (2001), starring Russel Crowe and Jennifer Conneley, is a decent movie.  It's well acted and well directed by Ron Howard.  It's largely based on the biography of the same title by Sylvia Nassar (1998).  However, in order to &quot;Hollywood-ize&quot; the story, a great deal of detail and &quot;reality&quot; were dropped.<br />My main beef with the movie is that it's depiction of schizophrenia is ludicrous...basically, the entire disease is trivialized as visual hallucinations.  Even the movie's ending makes no sense where John Nash is depicted as still suffering from seeing imaginary people.  Anyone who knows the true story knows that Nash today, if not entirely cured, doesn't see imaginary people and never did!<br />For the true story, and all the messy details that come with real-life, read the book instead.
B000006XSD|3.0|This one gets a bad rap, and it's almost totally forgotten except by those who were big into Alice when this originally came out.  No, it's not his best, there are some misfires here, but in the end, Alice doesn't let you down.  This one may take a few listens to really get into coz it doesn't sound like the previous two albums,  Welcome To My Nightmare and Alice Cooper Goes To Hell.  Once you adjust for that you should be okay.  Alice was completely submerged in his alcoholism when he did this album, which would probably account for the disco love song contained herein.  This song is the target of alot of the criticisms, but we can forgive Alice for that considering his state of mind when he did it.  In retrospect, Alice is a bit embarassed by this song and never plays it live.  The song is actually quite fun in a guilty way considering these things.  Don't let Lace And Whiskey get away from your collection just coz it isn't so well known or highly praised.  You will find some gems here for sure.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is one of the greatest Films of all time. Not onlt is the movie great, but so is the quality, they made everything look much better than the VHS. The special features are great also they have hours and hours of special features. They also have a few deleted scenes, and I find those great!
B000059H98|2.0|The opening scenes, including the torturing of a defiant Tank Girl by evil Malcolm McDowell, were fantastic and great fun; then it all goes downhill FAST. It's almost as if they'd switched directors and writers after a half hour, when the film  crests creatively: then Tank Girl inexplicably starts performing onstage; and from this point on TANK GIRL's a loser. The film just plain limped home.The writers shot their creative wad on the opening scenes, then left town; whoever took over the helm played up the campy side in the lamest, most unimaginative way. It never recovered. A major disappointment. And I liked Lori Petty as TG too; it just went NOWHERE!
B00005JLH3|5.0|As a former member of one of the marching bands featured in this movie, and as a part of the movie, I am extremely proud of the movie and what is has to offer.  This is one of the few movies that positively and accurately captures black college life.  As a student at Clark Atlanta University (where the movie was filmed, portrayed as Atlanta A&amp;T), I can definitely appreciate all aspects of the movie, and I'm glad that Nick Cannon and other cast members were able to create such a masterful piece of work.
B00004RF9I|1.0|The film which introduced us to the now legendary quotation, \\"I'm as made as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore,\\" Sidney Lumet's \\"Network\\" is a scathingly brilliant and ominously accurate prediction of what network television circa 2004 (in particular the news division) has become.     When stalwart television news anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch) suffers an on air mental breakdown he is encouraged to continue ranting as \\"the angry prophet, denouncing the hypocrisies of our time\\" in order to boost the network's Nielson ratings. Shifting the focus from hard news to factoid entertainment, the new Howard Beale show is the brain child of Dianne Christensen (Faye Dunaway, marvelously on point as the neurotic programmer). Dianne is an oversexed cutthroat who will stop at nothing to exploit Beale for a thirty share. She usurps Max Schumacher's (William Holden) position as head of the news division and later destroys his life and marriage with the broken promise of a torrid affair.     The cast also includes Robert Duvall as maniacal Frank Hackett, a shrewd corporate executive whose sell out mentality is successful at turning the once prominent art of journalism into its lowest common denominator - sensationalism. In an all too brief though nevertheless poignant performance, the late and very great Beatrice Straight delivers a masterful turn as Max's betrayed wife, Louise. The film's eerie clairvoyance on contemporary television makes it one of the truly outstanding American films of the 1970s.    However, Warner Home Video's import of a previously released MGM DVD is one of the worst DVD transfers I have ever seen. The film is anamorphic widescreen but colors are horribly muted, dull and incredibly faded. Flesh tones are so inaccurate that there's really no point in suggesting any consistency.  Either they are a pasty pink or garish orange, but never natural looking. Contrast levels during night scenes are so low and marred by excessive film grain and digital grit that fine detail is not even an issue. Day scenes tend to suffer from over exposure and way too high contrast levels. Light browns, oranges, beiges and flesh tones all exhibit an undistinguished muddiness. There is also an incredible amount of film and digital grain throughout the transfer that makes for a completely unsatisfying viewing experience, no matter the size of your television screen. There is nothing, I repeat - NOTHING, to recommend this visual presentation. The audio is mono, strident and unnatural sounding. There is also background hiss in many of the more quiet scenes. The only extra is a theatrical trailer. This classic needs a complete and meticulous restoration.
B000089CJI|4.0|Death Cab for Cutie's Benjamin Gibbard has a voice like helium:  high, delicate, vanishing.  There's such a sense of impermanence to his vocals that it's often hard to hear the tough-minded tunes his band creates.  With The Postal Service's Give Up, an electroclash project featuring Jimmy Tamborello's synthetic settings and backup support by Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley, Gibbard's voice fits snugly amidst ten tales of difficult-not-impossible love.  Often a harsh lyrical miniaturist with Death Cab, the theme of love here allows him to traffic in grand romantic gestures.  On \\"Clark Gable\\", he sings of \\"waiting since birth for a love that would look and sound like a movie.\\"  In \\"We Will Become Silhouettes\\", he holes up in a fallout shelter waiting to reunite with his true love.  \\"Such Great Heights\\" references itself as a siren song played on the radio to guide home a touring lover.  \\"Will someone call a surgeon who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart?\\" he asks on \\"Nothing Better\\", but the question is rhetorical.  In the course of 45 minutes, he heals himself.
6305750750|2.0|If you're like me and thousands of others you bought this tape like a good little Star Wars geek and like me you were not happy with how long this widescreen release was in coming, but you were satisfied when it finally arrived. My advice to anyone looking to purchase this VHS tape is to wait until you have a DVD player and purchase the DVD.<BR>There are a ton more features to this relatively mediocre movie title. The (...) extra film cell hardly makes up for that. Also, Jar Jar is still annoying and the plot has some holes, but at least on the DVD suffering can be at a minimum with the skip feature. But let's be honest what we really want with this movie is a way to relive what we all really love in the original Star Wars trilogy. It is evident to me that after seeing this movie and Episode II that Lucas CAN NOT direct or motivate actors to save his life. Empire and Jedi were pulled off so beautifully because others directed them. If you look to the first of the series (A New Hope of which most of you simply call Star Wars) the same directing flops are present and bad acting reigns supreme. Maybe in years to come when these movies are remade we will have a director step up who can actually direct, but until then we'll have to deal with this blundering yet beloved fool called Lucas.
6305428220|4.0|\\"The Faculty\\" is one of those movies where you want to reduce it to simple cinematic equation history, such as \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" meets \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\\" But that is really too simplistic an approach. Not since \\"The Rock\\" have I seen a film that references as many other films as \\"The Faculty\\" (comedy homages in the tradition of \\"Airplane\\" do not count). When you watch this film see how many times you suddenly say to yourself, \\"Oh, yeah, just like in 'The Thing.'\\" Clearly, screenwriter Kevin Williamson (\\"Scream\\") is back to his old tricks, this time in the field of science fiction rather than teenage splatter flicks, aided and abetted by director Robert Rodriuez (\\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\").<br />The premise of the film is that the old school kid fantasy about teachers being alien monsters comes true at Herrington High in Ohio. The faculty are only first on the alien agenda for possession. Next are the police, the students, their parents, the folks in town, the visiting football team, and, by the end of the month, the entire world. All that stand in the way are the fellowship of the high school student stereotypes: there is Casey Connor (Elijah Wood), the Stephen King nerd; Delilah Profitt (Jordana Brewster), the campus queen; Stokely Mitchell (Clea DuVall), the goth girl with the encyclopedic knowledge of science fiction films whom everyone thinks is a lesbian; Stan Rosado (Shawn Hatosy), the sensitive jock who wants to be more than a quarterback; Marybeth Louise Hutchinson (Laura Harris), the new girl in school; and Zeke Wells (Josh Hartnett), the big man on campus when it comes to drugs.<br />Actually, \\"The Faculty\\" ends ups being one of the most subversive films in history because the big lesson here is that mind altering drugs can save the world (that can't be right). But it is hard to focus on a \\"message\\" in a film like this where the only real question is how are these kids going to save the world and which on the infected people is hosting the queen? That last one is where Williamson proves he was paying attention to story construction because there are plenty of clues that set up the big payoff, which is usually a sign of competency when considering a film like this. Otherwise the big joke in the film is that the adults are having a lot more fun being monsters than the kids are trying to save the earth. Robert Patrick plays Coach Willis with maniacal glee while Piper Laurie goes for underplayed creepiness. Famke Janssen goes from mouse to lioness, Bebe Neuwirth gets to work on her chilling smile, and even Jon Stewart has his eye-popping moment. Only Salma Hayek is really wasted, given nothing more to do than blow her nose.<br />The end result is a decent science fiction horror film, which is a pretty good deal. We are clearly in a world where a competent film in this genre qualifies as an above average effort. But \\"The Faculty\\" embraces both the history of the genre and the stereotypical characters running around in it trying to save the world. The idea of an unpretentious exploitation film just sounds strange. For me, the two scenes that capture the essence of this film are the suspenseful sequence where the gang tries to figure out who amongst them cannot be trusted and the bit where the new and improved football team gleefully beats up on their out of town opponents at the big game on Friday night. \\"The Faculty\\" plays well in both ballparks. The only serious complaint is that this film was apparently so well crafted by Williamson and Rodriguez that there are no deleted scenes; all this DVD offers in the way of extras is the trailer. That is a downer.<br />Bonus Question: Since this film is scripted by Kevin Williamson can it be read as an allegorical twist on \\"Dawson's Creek\\"? Sure, why not? It just gets a bit complicated, because if Casey is Dawson and Zeke is Pacey, then Stan has to be Jack (the football part, but not the gay part, unless you want to go back to the very beginning in which case he can be Cliff). That means Delilah is Joey (but with Abby's attitude), but then we have to decide if Marybeth the new girl in town or Stokely the girl with a bad reputation is Jen. Since that can work out either way your decision can be based on whether you are trying to work this out in terms of the high school years on \\"Dawson's Creek\\" with Andie or the college years with Audrey.case he can be Cliff).

B00008DDXL|4.0|This movie had a lot more action than the first. The characters seem to be a little bit more mature, but its still all good. The story plot was ok, although they left some stuff out from the book. Overall, I would recommend adding this dvd to your collection.
6300163601|2.0|If you have ever seen the movie \\"10\\" and not just watched the trailer with the infamous seen of Bo Derek running down the beach with her cornrows bobbing along, then you know that Dudley Moore's fantasy of the perfect woman pops pretty much about the time that Bo's character opens her mouth.  That fact pretty much serves as the model for Bo Derek's film career in the early days; she looked great but once she opened her mouth she started losing points.  This was amply proven in \\"Tarzan, the Ape Man,\\" but in case anybody missed the point we have the 1984 film, \\"Bolero.\\"  The film was subtitled \\"An Adventure in Ecstasy\\" in an effort to make everyone forget the other part of the title was a take off both on Derek's first name and the music by Ravel revitalized by \\"10\\" (fortunately the Olympic Ice Dancing champions Torvill and Dean gave us a much better association).<br />In \\"Bolero,\\" Bo plays Lida MacGillivery, a little rich girl graduating from an English boarding school.  Her graduation present is going to be the loss of her virginity, so she and her best friend, Catalina (Ana Obreg&oacute;n), go off to the deserts of Arabia, accompanied by her chauffer/bodyguard Cotton (George Kennedy).  On the desert sands she meets a sexy sheik (Greg Bensen), who has his chance, but blows it despite all the Valentino references.  When Lida has similar problems with a bullfighter in Spain named Angel (Andrea Occhipinti), we get the idea that this girl is going to have to go around the world, so to speak, to get her happy ending.  Consequently, \\"Bolero\\" is a soft porn flick without the sex.  Just think about that for a while and then it should be very clear to you why this is a bomb of major proportions that falls into the \\"so bad you have to see it to believe it\\" category instead of the \\"so bad it is good\\" column.  Maybe director John Derek did this as a way of telling the adolescent males of the world to stop fantazigng about his wife (actually, Olivia d'Abo as Paloma is the sexiest woman in the film).<br />Today Bo Derek appears on \\"Seventh Heaven\\" and she does a nice job of acting while fully dressed (plus I think she is, oh, let's say, 10 times better looking today at 44 than she was at the age of 28).

B00005JKZT|4.0|I am concerned that these great segments of Lord of the Rings are suffering due to the very long time elapsing between the showing of segments. People I know, who are not dyed in the wool Tolkien fans and saw the first segment, have lost their enthusiasm and don't care about seeing the other two segments, especially when there is a one year wait for the final segment.Six months would have been too long for any continuity and a year is turning out to be rediculous. If you are a Tolkien fan you may not agree with this, but talk to your friends who are not fans and see how little they care. These unfortunately are the people who by buying tickets will insure the success of this type of film. If the movie doesn't make a lot of money it will not be considered a success. I have heard that among the Lord of the Rings personnel there was considerable objection to waiting a year between the release of segments, but they were outvoted by the \\"Hollywood Money Men\\" This great movie, refered to as a \\"fairy story\\" by many of todays movie goers appeals to only a small audience, and to capitalize onthe initial enthusiasm, the following segments should have come no more than three months apart. I understand attendance for the second segment was appreciably below the first segment. Guess what it will be for the final segment.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is an amazing movie. The images are lush and brilliant and the story is intricate. It has all the charm and intrigue of an old legend or fairytale and can absorb people of all ages.

B000001FDK|5.0|What a up-beat film!  And a great soundtrack!  Many great songs sung by the endearing Olivia Newton-John and everyone's favorite John Travolta.  Stockard Channing does a great job on her tunes too!<br />A virtual who's who before tehy became who's!

B00005V3Z4|5.0|this movie is amazing. it is full of great imagery, crisp clean filmography that blends seamlessly into the special effects. Great acting and a great soundtrack, Donnie Darko takes you on a journey with its main character that you will never forget.<BR>there is talk of time travel, burning houses down, flooding a school, a joy division song, a giant bunny, and Donnie even takes his girlfriend to see THE EVIL DEAD.<BR>i don't want to give it away just know that this movie is riveting or eye opening and funny.

B00008H2LB|5.0|This album is amazing.  I know that style is different from that of Hybrid Theory but so what?  If they had kept on doing that all of you would be complaining &quot;Oh, there just mediocre artists, they always do the same thing, they can't expand or grow.&quot; I feel that the style change was a good one.  It has more of a hard rock edge to it.  My favorite tracks would &quot;Easier to run,&quot; &quot;Faint&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot; [which does remind me of Hybrid Theory]<BR>I also noticed that many of you are complaining about the running time [36 minutes] But again so what? I would rather have 36 minutes of a great CD than 80 minutes of a piece of garbage.  Anyway,  my point is this:  Meteora is excellent and that I'm not at all disappointed with it.  Please, give it a chance, don't let these negative reviews stop you from giving this album the chance it desevers
B00008J4P5|5.0|I initially dismissed this album as a harder, slightly better version of its predecessor. The album seemed to lose steam after a few songs (just like WBC) and Meg's drumming was a little bit too primitive for my taste. <br />Well, my opinion sure has changed. What was I thinking when it came to the songs losing steam? I'll get back to the songs in a little bit but now let me focus on the band itself. Jack White has grown as a frontman tremendously, from one a little unsure of himself and his limitations to a true original who bleeds charisma. Add in his impeccable guitar skills and he just might be the best frontman since Robert Plant in Led Zeppelin's glory days. And Meg's characteristic, and controversial, constant drum thump (no rolls, no nothin', just a constant beat on drums and cymbals) has clicked finally. Listen to the album and imagine it with a more talented (?) drummer, one who does rolls and that stuff. The album would lose its feel, seriously, with this overly-talented and finessed touch. Meg really is the backbeat of the band and you can't just take away her influence. Lastly there's the band's refusal to have a regular bassist, possibly their most alienating move. Yes, it seems like every good band has a great bassist, from Paul McCartney to John Paul Jones to Colin Greenwood. Two things to argue about this: 1. It would lower the chemistry and relationship between Jack and Meg in their music. 2. They actually do use a good deal of bass, or at least an octave guitar on Elephant. Check out the now classic bass thump on 'Seven Nation Army' and accentuating bass line on their new single 'The Hardest Button to Button.'<br />Now for the songs. The best way to describe them is to call them guitar work-outs, a lot harder then the relatively simple-sounding work on WBC. For evidence, look to the songs that really define the album, 'Black Math' and 'Ball and Biscuit.' The former is a great riff worthy of the great Jimmy Page and the latter is one of the best blues-rock riffs of all time with its tremendous improvisational solos between verses. This song is probably the best the album has to offer, as well as the equally wonderful 'Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine.\\" One thing that I think really proves The White Stripes rightful reverence in our sub-culture is Jack's lyrics. He can go from writing about a desire to be accepted by a girlfriend's mother to singing about acetaminophen. Another great thing about this band is their willingness to churn out just as tender love songs as 'Ball and Biscuit' is raucous. 'Cold Cold Night' is Meg's singing debut and a great lite-jazz ditty, 'I Want to be the Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart' is a nice Rod Stewart style ballad and 'You've Got Her in Your Pocket' is one of the best acoustic ballads in recent years. Plus, Jack and Meg aren't afraid to partake in a little self-mockery, as witnessed on the closer, 'Well It's True That We Love One Another,' a great little folk parody targeted on the two bandmates' debated past.<br />Altogether, this album can be looked at as a classic in my book. This twosome is destined to do even greater things in years to come, if that's possible. The future of rock depends upon this.
B000069HK2|4.0|I'm loving this CD, the flow is good from start to finish. They are comparable to Finch, who I've just started listening to and love aswell. The Used is refreshing and a good alternative from more of the main-stream bands like Blink 182, Gob, Sum 41. Buried Myself Alive is an awsome song, I also like The Taste Of Ink. Have you been sitting at home and complaining about how everything is starting to sound the same? The Used will change that!
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was the best book I have ever read. C.S. Lewis can use too many details at times, but still the book made a lot of sense. Some of the chapters of this book left me elated. The characters Edmund, Lucy, Peter and Susan were really cool. I especially liked Edmund because when he goes to Narnia he asks for Turkish Delight. I think this book is full of adventures. For example, Lucy enters a simple wardrobe and finds herself in the middle of Narnia, a whole other world. In this book there are also melancholy chapters, but go ahead and read this book. You have heard my opinions about this book, \\"It's awesome!\\"
B00008J4P5|5.0|I purchased this album, after having enjoyed the white stripes' previous recordings.  And I must say, worth every penny, nickel, and dime!  Theres so much raw energy that its hard to believe its coming from two people.  The song writing is catchy and clever.  The variety between tracks is really good.  The base in this ablum (guitar and drums) blew me away.  Jack Whites singing is rough or beautiful depending on what the lyrics demanded, but full of style and energy either way.  And the back up (feminine) vocals from meg and holly add a nice touch.<br />Perhaps my only compliant is the ablum starts out too strong, because the first three songs (seven nation army, black math, and theres no home for you here) are the three best tracks on the cd.  Theres no home for you here is an excellent take on dead leaves in the dirty ground, that while similar, is completely its own song, and in its own catchy way, superior to it predecesor.  Not to say that the other eleven songs aren't worthy of attention!  Not by a long shot.<br />In the cold cold night, we get to hear Meg white sing solo, which was a rare, and surprising pleasent, treat.  While the stripes are commonly know for 2 minute songs, Ball and Biscuit comes in at 7 minutes, but feels right in place. The hardest button, hypnotize and no faith in medicine are all venerable mentions.  The spoken intro to little acorns and the final tracks both but a grin upon my usually scowling face.<br />Speaking of Little Acorns, it seems to follow a little trend <BR>White Stripes - Little People<BR>De Stilj - Little Bird<BR>White Blood Cells - Little Room<BR>I don't know if this is purposeful or coinidence.<br />There are 14 tracks with lots of energy, variety in vocals, and in music.  The two show once again just how much can be done with a guitar, a drum, and some heartfelt singing.  And if i'm wasting my time, then nothing could be better.
0780624890|4.0|There has been a new push for movies adapted from comic books. As I am writing this, more than a handful of these stories are being prepped to hit the screen this summer. The Hulk, League of Extraordinary Gentleman and the sequel to X-Men are all going to be critic-proof blockbusters in the following months, and already there are sequels to SpiderMan and Daredevil underway. Another sequel that is being prepared is the third part in a trilogy of this Marvel character, Blade. In my opinion, this film was a quality product which set the stage for the comic book-movie revolution which is happening today.<br />I enjoyed Blade very much. It was pure escapism filmmaking, and i loved every minute of it. The story of the hero (the title character played by Wesley Snipes), a sword weilding vampire slayer who is half-vampire himself, introduces the character as a fringe-dwelling outsider. His only pal is Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who makes weapons for the vamp slayer. The movie's main plot reflects the two, with the help of a hemotologist (N'Bushe Wright) trying to foil the schemes of a vampire who wisher to unleash an apocalyptic force on the world. Okay, the plot sounds a tad hackneyed on here, but the film delivers with superb acting from the cast and decent special effects. High marks to Donal Logue as a lacky vampire especially, who plays each of his scenes with glee. But the best part of this movie is Stephen Dorff as the main villain Deacon Frost. The character comes off as a nihilistic punk who you truly feel has a reason for embarking on his nasty plan.<br />Of course it isnt a perfect film. N'Bushe Wright, one of the two main females in the movie, isn't given much to work with. She has talent, but unfortunately is stuck with the films lamest lines. People criticize the films 'Matrix-esque' effects and stunts. And I felt it ended far to abruptly. But overall, this flick is worth a buy. <br />This film was quite a success at the box-office, which gave the studios enough faith in comic-book adapted movies to warrant this one a sequel and the rest of the Marvel Comics properties. If you loved X-Men and SpiderMan, then Blade is the film to thank. Definately give it a chance!
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay are undoubtedly, at present, the biggest British rock band in the world. Their much-deserved success has not being without its criticism, however. Many people brand Coldplay's music as boring and uninspired. It makes me wonder how they can say such things. The music this band keep bringing out is amongst some of the best I have ever heard, and I'm sure many others will agree with me. The success of their debut album, \\"Parachutes,\\" made the expectations for Coldplay's second album extremely high. Perhaps the most anticipated record of 2002, it finally arrived in August. It was called \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" and was a critical and commercial triumph...<br /><br />Opening with \\"Politik,\\" it's clear that this second effort from Coldplay is one that doesn't want to be ignored. The guitar strumming is perfect, and the lyrics are excellent. Chris Martin's brilliant but overrated vocals are on top form on this track. The album continues with \\"In My Place,\\" the perfect comeback song for the boys. Released in August 2002 as the first single from the album, the song was a massive UK No.2 hit and gained the band many new fans. The song maybe a little too commercial in contrast with Coldplay's usual style, but it's an excellent song nonetheless. \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" is the most uptempo song on this album, and works fantastically well. The song opens with an excellent guitar and Martin's subdued vocals. The song then breaks out after 45 seconds with a wonderfully psychedelic beat that engages the listener effortlessly. The chorus is a blazing vocal attack, and by the time the first chorus finishes and the second verse begins with the psychedelic beat, you know you're onto something here.<br /><br />\\"The Scientist\\" is widely regarded by many to be Coldplay's greatest ever composition. I tend to disagree, but it's definitely up there as one of their best. One reviewer every called it the best song ever written. Again, I would go that far, but Martin's vocals on the song are a perfect example of the rich emotion expressed that have the power to make even grown men cry. \\"Clocks\\" was the third song taken from the album, and was a UK Top 10 hit for the band. This is by far one of my favourite Coldplay songs, with it's amazing lyrics and excellent piano that runs the length of the song. The way the piano arrangement is performed is just stunning. It's so simple, yet manages to make you feel so emotional and alive. \\"Daylight\\" is another one of my favourite songs from this album. Opening with a hazy and sleepy psychedelic beat that sounds very Sgt. Peppers-esque, the song is instantly one of the most recognisable. Martin's vocals are flawless as usual. They begin off rather slow and quiet, but break out in the chorus - almost as if the sun is breaking through clouds, or rising on a morning. Wow, a style that matches the title. Perfect. \\"Green Eyes\\" is another great song. The song has a great early 90's Oasis style to it in the verses, and the choruses are great with Martin's great vocal performance.<br /><br />\\"Warning Sign\\" is one of the best songs on the album. The song begins beautifully with a superb beat and the chorus is excellent with the lyrics, \\"When the truth is...I miss you!\\" These notes totally make the song, and propel it to future classic status. It's almost as if Martin begins weeping towards the end of the song, as he sings the brilliant lyrics, \\"So I crawl back into your open arms.\\" \\"A Whisper\\" is perhaps my least favourite song on the album, but that doesn't mean that it's rubbish - it's good, infact. \\"A Rush Of The Blood To The Head\\" is another one of the best songs on the album. The verses have some great lyrics, while the chorus boasts the brilliant musical arrangement of the lines, \\"Honey, all the movements have started to ache, see me crumble and fall on my face, as I know the mistakes that I've made, see it all disappear without trace.\\" \\"Amsterdam\\" is another amazing song with beautiful lyrics. Excellent, a song that has anthem written all over it. The song is extremely slow for up to four minutes, until it breaks out for a great finale to an amazing album. It leaves the listener wondering if this is the direction the band will take on their third album. And if this is anything to go by, it'll rock the world.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Coldplay have really struck gold with this album. Where Parachutes was the album that introduced the capabilities of this unique band, A Rush Of Blood To The Head was the album that confirmed their status and popularity as one of the best British rock bands. Ever. Their recent Grammy and Brit Award wins will push the worldwide sales of this record beyond the 10 million mark, and in time should become a classic.nthem written all over it.

B00006NSZ5|5.0|Skip the boring stuff and just review the songs.<br />1. Lose Yourself - 10/10 - If you haven't heard this song then I would like to welcome you to the 21st century. Awesome song to start off the CD.<br />2. 8 Mile - Eminem - 9/10 - Very good song to follow up one of the best on the CD. Eminem raps pretty much the same lyrics as Lose Yourself. <br />3. Run Rabbit Run - Eminem - 8/10 - The songs seem to go down in rating as I go down the list. This is a great song, though lacking a chorus. Takes a few listens to get to. <br />4. Love Me - Obie Trice, Eminem & 50 Cent - 10/10 - Awesome! Obie raps some of the best raps on the CD before Em and 50 get to even start. A good review doesn't do this song justice - just listen to it and you'll see what I mean. <br />5. Places to Go - 50 Cent - 7/10 - Okay song, gets boring easily though. Listen to it a few times, then get to the rest of the CD before you break your CD player. <br />6. Wanksta - 50 Cent - 11/10 - Whoever says 50 can't rap needs to get their ears checked. Listen to this once, get blown away, then listen to it more! Amazing lyrics and beat from 50.        <br />7. Rap Game - D-12 - 13/10 - ROFLMAO! - the one way to describe this song. Eminem and Plev are hilarious! He's all for America but he says **** the government, Em brings the rap fast and furiously following Plev. 50 does the chorus, then you hear some more D12 members (mind blank - can't remember names), then 50 again, then Swifty and that one guy (lol mind blank) before 50 does the final chorus. Comical and the best raps on the CD - what could be better?       <br />8. You Wanna Be Me - Nas - 6/10 - Boring. One listen and you're switching to the next song. NaS can do much better than this.       <br />9. 8 Miles and Running - Jay-Z & Freeway - 11/10 - Jay-Z and bad rap don't go together. Freeway doesn't sound like him in this song. No, he sounds like Jay Jr. ready to rap till he drops. Awesome song; worth listening to many times over.       <br />10. That's My N**** Fo' Real - Young Zee - 7/10 - Slow and as boring as 'Places To Go,' this song should be skipped after a listen or two as well.       <br />11. Battle - Gang Starr - 9/10 - Very interesting, although his syllables are way off :P. Good listen, and the mixing makes it worthwhile.       <br />12. Spitshine - Xzibit - 12/10 - Xzibit rapping amaznigly. This song makes me want to get up and rap the chorus over and over with lyrics such as 'Fight the good fight, don't need no help!' Never gets tired for me.       <br />13. Time of Your Life - Macy Gray and 14. Wasting My Time - Boomkat - 1/10 - skip 'em both; they ruin the CD.          <BR>     <BR>15. R.A.K.I.M. - Rakim - 6/10 - Bad rapping, bad rhymes, bad beat, what do you get? Rakim! Listen to it once or twice then stop laughing at the patheticness of this song.       <br />16. Adrenaline Rush - Obie Trice - 9/10 - Great song to end the CD. Great beat, and a very inappropriate chorus to please you :P.<br />All in all, this is a great CD and definetly worth buying. I'd give it a four and a half overall, but I can't, so I round up to a five ;)
0064407667|5.0|The Bad Beginning, a modern fantasy, keeps readers in tune with all the mishaps of the Baudelaire children.  Snicket pulls readers in with the misfortune of wealthy children who are used to living carefree, to children who have been reduced to house slaves for a distant relative.  The few illustrations in the book, placed in just the right place to focus the reader's attention to specific details showed important features.  THe Bad Beginning strengths were cretainly plot development with its constant rise in action and character development as we see the children develop throughout the story to save their lives.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Now I am a huge Fleetwood Mac fan, but the good thing about that is I'm such a huge fan that I can still be critical of their music...FORTUNATELY there is absolutely nothing to criticize here..This album is incredible.<BR>  Many classic rock groups put out mediocre and mundane albums years after their huge successes, but this album lacks no passion at all. <BR>  At first I thought that I might miss the presence of Christine McVie (who has retired from the group now) but Stevie and Lindsey put 150% effort into making these songs sound incredible regardles..<BR>  Stevie's voice is stronger here than it has been in many many years. She rocks out in the awesome tunes &quot;Running Through the Garden,&quot; and &quot;Everybody Finds Out.&quot;   Her ode to those lost and how it affected her in Sept 11 touches the soul deep down in &quot;Illume.&quot; Illume is a hard song to understand, but for those fans who read her journal entries she posted on her website (nicksfix.com) near the days of the attacks, it makes perfect sense.<BR>  Lindsey Buckingham shines immensely here, with his production skills and also skills as a musician and singer/songwriter. Highlight Lindsey tracks for me were &quot;Murrow,&quot; &quot;What's the World Coming To,&quot; the hard heavy rock &quot;Come,&quot; and &quot;Bleed to Love Her.&quot; <BR>  The album ends with sweet goodbyes, with Lindsey's &quot;Say Goodbye,&quot; closing with Stevie's haunting &quot;Goodbye Baby.&quot;<BR>  The old time Fleetwood Mac lovers will love the album, and it also is bound to attract a new following with this new fresh sound...they have a great ability to keep their classic sound while also mixing fresh new things at the same time.
0887308589|4.0|I had read Dilbert comics before, and I had read the comic strip compilations avidly. However, I was a bit hesitant about this book, knowing that anytime a person strays from their field of expertise (think Shaq acting, Will Smith rapping, or Jennifer Love-Hewitt doing anything more than looking good), they tend to [be bad] at it (regardless of what it is), badly. Therefore, I waited to buy this for a very long time... I read the book, and was pleasantly surprised to find a wealth of Dilbert cartoons in it. The letters from readers are also interesting, especially since several of them are readers emailing him urban legends, with themselves as the protagonists! The only real down side was that there weren't enough Dogbert cartoons in the book, as he is a good consultant, dictator, etc. and happens to be my favorite character. <br />As far as the writing goes, it was humorous, and it was grammatically complete, so it wasn't very bad. I have read deeper works, quite surely, but this was a fun read for a good couple of hours. I have already begun loaning it out to friends, especially business majors. :)<br />Definately a buyer, and a multiple reader as well.<BR>Harkius
B000083E79|5.0|This is the best greatest hits by Cher. She done a great job on this one.
B00004SZBU|5.0|This was my first SACD and, after listening, I can say it will certainly not be my last.  Truly an amazing format which gives increased depth to an already extraordinary production.  I've already got several more on order from Amazon (Blow By Blow, Dark Side of the Moon, Every Breath You Take etc.).  Looking forward to enjoying my \\"new\\" listening experience.<br />\\"Don't let your Meat Loaf\\"
B00001OH7N|5.0|Try not to compare this music to &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; or &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;.  Try not to compare it to other Bowie albums.  And it's probably best not to try and &quot;understand&quot; it, either.<br />As another reviewer so aptly put it, these songs are like a collection of &quot;ravens on your windowsill&quot;.  Similar perhaps in form, but screechingly unique in their possibilities.<br />Bowie's visions, Ronson's guitar playing, Visconti's production - &quot;Man Who Sold The World&quot; is probably greater than the sum of it's parts.<br />Sit back and enjoy the ride.
B000001FFJ|5.0|I bought this album in college, at the height of my U2 craze, when Bono listed it in the ROLLING STONE artists' poll as one of his favorites.  I thought, \\"Hey, it'll probably sound like U2.\\"<br />Ha!  The record starts off with the squawk of a deranged parrot, then into the lurching, alcohol-soaked marimba rhythms of \\"Singapore.\\"  After a brief intro, Waits begins to croak in a devilish growl: \\"We sail tonight for Singapore / We're all as mad as hatters here.\\"<br />Mad indeed.  The characters that populate \\"Rain Dogs\\" are losers, loners and drifters, their stories spilled out of an old burlap bag full of evocative details.  (\\"All the donuts have names that sound like prostitutes.\\")  Waits' loping arrangements support the lyrics with an almost cinematic eye toward unforgettable images.  If you close your eyes, you can almost feel the grit and grime of the timeless city Waits paints, as fractured guitar riffs by the likes of Marc Ribot, GE Smith, and Keith Richards tumble over drunken rhythms and freight-train rockers.<br />Back in college, my girlfriend and I laughed at \\"Rain Dogs\\" when we first heard it.  I thought about selling it to a used CD shop, but I was having so much fun playing for my friends as a lark!  Soon, however, I found myself hooked into this strange and foreign place -- and this visionary artist who has always followed his own path.  If you're the type of listener who can get into something completely original, \\"Rain Dogs\\" -- along with its companion pieces \\"Swordfishtombones\\" and \\"Franks Wild Years\\" -- is the musical diversion you've been waiting for.
0385720920|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk has his themes down at the point of \\"Choke\\". His protagonist, Victor Mancini is partially self-loathing but attempting to redeem himself. His friend, Denny is at worst one of the most screwed up piles of nerouses.<br />Victor is a sexaholic, a scam artist desperate to pay for his ailing train wreck of a mother who much of his self-loathing is directed at and is created by. He scams to be touched, to bring meaning to others lives, to make them his emotional parents who will dote on him with money and affection. He makes them feel special by choking at nice restaurants where there look to be well to do patrons.<br />As a day gig he works in a theme village which results in many of his scenes as caretaker with Denny.<br />At once a dispicible charater, one he makes not question of in the narrative, we still feel for him as he hurtles down the road towards rock bottom, again a typical Chuck Palahniuk theme.<br />Beyond trying to give away the plot or even explain too much of it some differences are clear in Choke compared to Fight Club and Survivor. The pace is a bit slower and there is more empathy engendered towards Victor and Denny. In fact all the characters while deeply flawed are very human and often humaine which is a bit different from Palahniuk's usual mode of character development.<br />While still a fast paced, tightly written novel Choke shows a lighter side, mind you when I say lighter I'm saying bleak rather than morbid, but it's there and welcomed.<br />You feel for these characters. There is a delusional segment that runs in Choke as in Palahniuk's previous books but this time it is a sad and well meaning situation instead of the flaming train wrecks from characters degenerating in previous books.<br />There is even hope in Choke. To me it is a sign that Palahniuk is examining his ideas and testing new waters. Think of Choke as a quest style book. It is less broad in it's spanse but focuses more on the duality in humans in a way that is sad and elegaic.<br />Another strong Chuck Palahniuk novel.

B00006CXXU|5.0|From reading other people's reviews, I have to agree, I was disappointed with her first single, Dirrty. But, after listening to the whole cd, I have to say that it is really good. Christina has an amazing voice and great talent. This CD has a lot of different styles and her voice sounds fantastic in all of them. People keep comparing Christina to Britney Spears but there is just no comparison.
B000006ZKY|5.0|This is one of those albums where all the right ingredients came together at the right time.  <BR> <BR>It positively jumps out you, huge choruses, magnificent production, good track balance. Heavy but extremely melodic. A pleasure to listen to. <BR> <BR>These people were heavily tipped to go on to Scorpions-like mega stardom but somehow they just couldn't get up onto that rung of the ladder. It wasn't for lacking musical talent though. I had the pleasure of seeing them live on several occasions and they gave it everything (their London Astoria show is one of my all-time faves). <BR> <BR>There isn't a weak track on the album. Heavy and commercial at the same time but without being a blatant sell out. Claus Lessman's voice shines in its own special way proving once again all German Heavy Rock/Metal singers have the knack of never sounding alike. <BR> <BR>A unique record by anyone's reckoning.
B00006CXSS|5.0|First, a quick rejoinder to the bitter people from Sweden and Germany who seem to base their reviews not on the content of the DVD, but on resentment that the US was on the winning side of WWII.<br />I am not sure how we can deal with the fact that this is a \\"typical\\" US war movie with the US winning the war in the end.  As it stands, we've won more than we've lost, so our war movies tend to be about a winning effort.  On the other hand, our experience in Viet Nam has been thoroughly dramatized for the cinema, too.  So, we have spent as much time examining our successes as our failures.<br />And we have known war on our shores as millions were involved in the American Civil War.  Not to mention a recent attack that killed 4,000 of our civilians who were not combatants in any way.<br />Band of Brothers does portray scenes such as looting and the killing of POWs.  Some of it was by Americans, some by the French.  This is to show that the American and allied troops were not saints.  It is an honest assessment of the behavior of our fighting men and women.<br />As for the people who called Lt. Spiers a war criminal, they missed the entire essence of what the movie was saying:  Spiers never killed those POWs, nor did he kill one of his own men, as was rumored.  He allowed the rumors to persist because it made him feared.  His well documented and well-witnessed exploits in combat are why he was a hero.<br />Perhaps someday Germans will be honest enough to give us an honest portrayal of the less savory activities of their men in uniform during the second World War, complete with the murder of defenseless civilians, especially the Jews.<br />Yes, we portray the Germans as sometimes being inept.  In other movies, we portray the Americans as being inept.  In this DVD set, we portray a British tank commander as being inept.  There was no shortage of ineptitude on any side of the war.  The fact that the particular unit was highly trained and was competent militarily, is no reason for apology.<br />So, in a word, if you expect us to be sorry that we won, and that we stopped the spread of Nazism, and the extermination of the Jews, sorry.  We just don't feel that way.  We won, Europe is free as a result.  Deal with it.  If you dealt with the shortcomings of the German military in the frank and honest manner that US issues have been portrayed, you'd have more than enough national shame to last the rest of the 1000 year reich.    <br />As for the DVDs, they are magnificent and as good a job of depicting the books as I can imagine.  I had no idea that the airborne had origins in the best trained soldiers America produced in WWII.  That they trained for 2 straight years before seeing combat is an indication of how thoroughly prepared these men were.<br />As a paratrooper during the cold war, I never had an inkling of the incredible origins of the original parachute infantry regiments.  They are much closer to Airborne Rangers than to today's 82nd Airborne.  Or, perhaps I should say, the Airborne Rangers are closer to them.<br />The DVDs are fascinating first and foremost because it portrays the humanity of the men involved.  They had lives before and after the war.  They had families, they had friends.  As I read the book, the movie is very realistically portrayed.  Criticisms about the DVDs in terms of realism have been petty at best.  This is a very, very well done cinematic achievement.<br />Sorry about the rant, but it seems that euro-trash never misses an opportunity to try and tear down our country.  Envy.  That's all it could possibly be.  Envy and knowledge of their inadequacy.  And perhaps some introspection as to why they were willing to let Saddam kill 200,000 a year, while doing nothing, then cursed the brave men and women who put Saddam's regime to and end.

B00005V3Z4|4.0|First , I LOVE bizzare films (see Welcome to WoopWoop, Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead).<br />Second, I couldn't believe the same Drew Barrymore who flashed her hotchamatata's to David Letterman would have the brilliance to produce this film!<br />This movie draws you in from scene one. You have no idea whether the `hero' is psycotic when he sees Frank The Giant Rabbit, or sees things we just don't. And Patrick Swayze as the charismatic Love/Hate guru was a stroke of genius. You hate him and his bible thumping followers...and then you find out his secret truth.<br />From the moment we know Donnie is `different', to the moment the jet engine crashes through his bedroom, to the final moment when HE discovers reality, WE don't know the reality.<br />Donnie sees things no one else can, and they have to do with time travel and different possibilites of the future. Personally, I loved the aged alzheimers woman who goes to her mailbox, sees nothing there, walks away, and turns in the middle of the dirt road, to see if something may have been placed in her mailbox while her back was turned (she is the secret to the film...). My only tsk tsk is they could have done more with her...<br />This is a film of teen angst, the futility of correcting a wrong space/time has decreed, and an EXCELLENT sci-fi-eerie-romance. Some high profile actors (Noah Wylie for one) took on this movie in minor roles( I LOVE that cameo mystique...). Dark irony rules here.<br />I'll tell you how good this film was....I watched this instead of CSI. I bought this DVD. My friends who saw it were awed and bought it. Do NOT miss it.
B000000W5F|5.0|Virtually every fan and critc agree - rightly - that Beggars Banquest, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main Street are the Stones greatest albums (and among the greatest in rock).  After that, there is a difference of opinion: does Some Girls or this, Tattoo You, rank next?  For me, Tattoo You, hands down.<br />Those who side with Some Girls will quickly point out that Tattoo You is just a collection of tracks left behind from previous album session (and mostly from the Some Girls-era).  Disregard this.  Tattoo You is more cohesive, features just as many great Stones essentials, and - unlike Some Girls - even the experiments are successful.<br />The quality of the album can be attributed to three central factors: the first being that throughout the album the Stones play exclusively to their strengths.  They take what makes them great - the distinctive (and simple) chord progressions, Keith's rhythmic sense, the interaction between the band, and Mick's skill and abilities as a vocalist and lyricist.  Stones songs have always had simple chord progressions.  Here, the riffs and hooks ARE the chords: \\"Start Me Up\\", \\"Little T&A\\", \\"Worried About You\\", even \\"Waiting On a Friend\\" - all of these songs feature Keith's distinctive I-IV progressions.  It's how Keith plays them (and what Ron and Bill and Charlie contribute) that make them unique.  Listen to the guitar fills in Start Me Up - so simple, but absolutely irreplaceable.  Mick's vocals have never sounded better and more accomplished.  He can still be the best rock vocalist in the world, but the \\"ballad side\\" of the album is filled with him expanding his range and refining the falsetto he began experimenting with on \\"Fool To Cry\\", on through \\"Beast of Burden\\", and \\"Emotional Rescue\\".  On those songs it was apparent he was aping.  On tracks like \\"Worried About You\\", \\"Heaven\\", and the classic \\"Waiting On A Friend\\" his vocals are accomplished, authentic, and (even) beautiful.<br />The second reason the album isso good is the mixing.  Bob Clearmountain (who also mixed Roxy Music's essential Avalon) polished these tracks and as a result this is the best SOUNDING disc in the Stones canon.  Bill's bass playing has never sounded cleaner, the guitars never sounded so pure, Mick's vocals never employed so much atmosphere.  Without Clearmountian's contribution, the Stones could never have pulled off the New Age-y expeiment \\"Heaven\\" (a song unlike anything else in their catalog - it's amazing to think this is the same group with songs like \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\", \\"Rip This Joint\\", and \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\") and Black Limousine would sound merely like a dated 12-bar blues.<br />The third reason is the presence of Sonny Rollins.  His sax playing takes the jam \\"Slave\\" into territory that the Stones otherwise don't have the chops to pull off, \\"Neighbors\\" achieves even greater cacophony with his solo, and \\"Waiting on A Friend\\" is lifted into a classic with his playing on the outro.<br />I really recommend this album highly.  The only reason maybe not to get it is becuase you think you've heard Start Me Up to death.  Fear not: the only reason this album isn't considered as one of their best of all time is because the Stones legacy casts such a long shadow before it.  Get it.  It's still a HUGE recommendation to say it's the fifth best Stones album ever
6305910340|5.0|You are eight years old. Your father (Joe Montagne) teaches you chess for the first time. After three games, you beat him. After that, you beat everyone else. And are thrown into competitions, and compare to Bobby Fisher, the greatest chess player of all time...<br />Ben Kingsly plays the chess teacher searching for the next Bobby Fisher, hoping it will fulfill his own shortcomings. He has found a wunderkind in Josh, who in a very short time, has the vision to see 20 moves into the game (something only Masters can do), but lacks the killer instinct. Josh just wants to play the game. Lawrence Fishburn plays the drug addict Central Park player who teaches Josh that the game is all about The Game.<br />The film portrays the difference between what drives adults to succeed at life, and what drives a child just to fit in. Flawlessly infused is actual footage of Bobby Fisher playing multiple players, while Josh narrates Bobby's expectations and ultimate mental breakdowns.<br />This is a seamless film, and does a superb job of creating the razor's edge between adult expectations, and a boy's innocence.<br />I am never wrong about good movies. This is one of them.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Glengarry Glen Ross is a sleeper film that brings a viewer into the often brutal world of sales.  It is not solely a depressing film though, as it has so many hilarious moments.  The all-star cast delivers a wonderful film for all who are interested not just in the life of a salesman, but in human motivation.  After seeing the film, and specifically Alec Baldwin's performance, the following lines will become etched in your mind, \\"Put that coffee down!  Coffee's for closers!!!\\"
0783233477|5.0|There is a reason this remake of `Death Takes A Holiday' works.<br />Simply, this, Hopkins is Hopkins, and Pitt actually ACTS.<br />Death assumes the body of a man Hopkin's daughter has met. Death decides he/it wants to experience the human life that he is so used to taking. The thing is, Hopkins (Bill)is not your average man, and his daughter (Susan)is not the average woman. And it near destroys him.<br />This film is not so much about Hopkins (absolutely incredible performance as always) trying to deal with Death (he is due to die within 24 hours), as Death trying to deal with human emotions and justify his/its own actions.<br />Pitt/Death, learns from Hopkins that there can be a morality in the powerful, and that it must be meted properly. He learns to repect the man, and also learns what love means from Hopkins daughter, Susan, whom he falls hopelessly in love with. Discovering his feelings, Death decides to take Susan, along with Bill. Hopkins (Bill), shows Death that his actions are selfish, and argues that Susan should be allowed her true future.<br />Death is supposed to be without feeling, without remorse, but because he has assumed the guise of a man, he is flooded with emotions and ultimately the desire to do right. Something Death is not supposed to consider.<br />Most viewers will see this as a man dealing with his impending death, but it is really about Death (set as a real figure) dealing with newfound emotions and the struggle between right and wrong.<br />While this film may have been slow at the box-office, it is so worth seeing. The cinematography is excellent, the soundtrack excellent, and the team of Hopkins and Pitt excels. Hopkins is always good, but Pitt as Death really acts in his role. He underplays nicely, and allows the story to supercede his stardom.<br />The dvd is 2 1/2 hours long, but I was never bored, and felt every emotion the movie was supposed to convey.<br />This is a great love story, with a nice twist.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie was great.  Disney and Pixar hit it off again with another great computer animated movie. It's amazing to see how the physical actors are represented in the computer characters.  This is a fun story and recommend it for &quot;kids&quot; of all all ages both big and little.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I got this disc on eBay in LP format about 2 months ago as an import from England. I just got the CD about a week and a half ago and let me say, from the first track \\"Seven Nation Army\\" this is a blues/punk/rock/grunge speedball. Mixed and recorded on pre-80's technology, no computers or fancy reverbers we're used on this disc. What you are hearing is raw human sound coming through Jack's wailing guitar or Meg's throbbing drum backbeat, this is an instant classic with the 'indie kids'! While if you got into The White Stripes in 2002 when \\"Fell in Love With A Girl\\" came out, you'll think, where is the good music?! And then you'll dismiss them as a one-hit wonder. But neigh, these eclectic geniuses know how to play the media for fools and they do it to a T. The Rolling Stones recognizance of \\"There is No Home For You Here\\" and the \\"Its True That We Love One Another\\" is pure bliss with a duet with Holly Golightly. The rock-ballad \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" runs just over 7 minutes and is peppered with sexual references. I am listening to the CD whilst writing this, and I recommend that YOU buy it now!
B00006FDCD|5.0|This was, without a doubt, one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen...well, the first part that is. It seemed as if Stephen King not only portrayed fantasy scary clowns, but also some issues as well - getting accepted by fellow students, racism, bullies, abusive parents, et. cetera. So it's a pretty topical movie, if you catch my gist. Sure, the clown is a little freaky, but I think that this was definitely a good movie. The young actors did a fine job portraying their characters (even if the adults were a little more than hokey), and they really made this movie seem as good as it was to me. You also got to catch a glimpse of Seth Green's early years on this film, along with Jonathan Brandis. But personally, I really liked Ben Heller, the guy who played the young Stan Uris. I absolutely adored him throughout the movie and was sad when I found out it was his only one. He did a good job, along with all the others. <br />But yeah, watch this movie. I suggest only the first part, because the second half was a little corny, if not boring. (Giant spider?) Hey, if you want to watch the second half, go ahead, but the first part really is what makes this movie as good as it is.
B00008I8IF|5.0|I am a mature music fan, roots in 60's rock from Beatles, Beach Boys, Byrds,Zeppelin, Mowtown &amp; Soul, to U2,Springsteen ColdPlay, Red Hot Chilli Peppers. There is nothing like a good melody, something lacking from much of the alternative sound of the past 15 years. I can't imagine how the Jayhawks are not a household name, if not among the teenage listeners, at least to those in their 30's, 40's.  They have done what great bands do in that they began with Alternative country roots, but have grown and changed with each album enough to never get boring, and in my opinion to keep getting better.  It's the kind of music that gets better with each listen.  It's the kind of music you find yourself wanting to play again and again.  Seeing these guys live is fantastic because they unfortunatly (for the band) still only play small venues.  I strongly recommend checking out the new album.  If you like it go in reverse chronological order, remembering the early stuff is good but more country rooted.
3931141802|5.0|What can one say about a classic?  Is it possible to review Beethoven's Ninth?  Faulker's \\"As I Lay Dying\\"?  No.  This is arguably the book that most influenced almost all the subsequent generations of photographers.  Frank looked at the world with a fresh viewpoint and his photographs were a slap in the face.  It's impossible to put ourselves in the world of photography that preceded this book because Frank has changed our prespectives so drastically.
0517053616|4.0|The very idea of reviewing or giving stars to Shakespeare in this format is superfluous:  he is the epitome of English literature. The source and inspiration for many subsequent classics, the well from which many popular expressions have sprung, the basis for many brilliant (and not-so-brilliant) stage and film renditions of these classics -- Shakespeare's literary greatness lies universally ackwnoledged and unquestioned. In reviewing any edition of the man's works, then, the reviewer's task is not to comment upon the work itself, but the presentation. This Gramercy edition of The Complete Works (yes, that's all 37 plays -- comedies, histories, and tragedies -- as well as all of the poems, sonnets included) is the most popular and widely-available -- and inexpensive -- version available. Is it the best? Well, no. Other reviews of this edition have commented upon its shortcomings -- extremely small print; very tight and hard-to-read layout; no margins for notes; no footnotes or annotations; no background information on the plays; errors, typos, and generally questionable editing. That said, this edition may have what you're looking for. It does indeed contain the complete works; it also has a few other small incentives:  a hard cover that looks great on a bookshelf, a built-in bookmarker, and various illustrations. Clearly, this is not an omnibus for the Shakespeare scholar. If you want an edition of the bard for in-depth study or for academic use, you are better off buying more expansive editions of the individual plays themselves, with plenty of background info, notes, annotations, and space for your own writing; or else one of the more expensive editions of the Complete Works. That said, if you are just looking for a Shakespeare book that has all of his works in one place, that is convenient and, above all, inexpensive -- or you just want a Shakespeare tome sitting on your dust-ridden bookshelf to impress friends -- then you could do worse than picking up this.
B000083E79|5.0|It's a great CD, and I actually have more Cher compilations, but this one is one of my favorites, because it really has the very best of Cher, I got you babe, save up all your tears, song for the lonely, It's really amazing!!
B000028U0Y|5.0|Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison is unquestionably one of the finest live albums ever recorded. The time and place, the atmosphere surrounding it, and the aura of the performance could never be repeated in today's modern world. What artist today would have the sheer umitigated gall to play an entire concert's worth of songs about prison life, murder, death, adultrey, and love for those immediately out of reach -- in front of an audience of prisoners? As the photos in the booklet clearly show, Cash is simply performing on a stage in front of a room containing 2,000 inmates -- no fence separating them, no walls, and only a couple of security guards. Indeed, Cash sits down on a stool literally inches away from the front row of prisoners to sing his mini-set of ballads, and later shakes hands with one of them (whose song he closes his performance with) and moves about them. This was a masterful show, transcendent not only for its performance, but for its sheer atmospheric effect. Cash clearly has the audience in the palm of his hand, singing songs that address prison life directly (with the prisoners whooping and hollering loudly for the most violent lines and after curses), and cracking off-color jokes against the prison establishment and taking the prisoners' side. This newly-uncensored version truly shows the great show that it was, including the classic moment where Cash announces that the show is being recorded and that you can't say words like... it is fleshed-out with a newly-invigorated sound and expansive liner notes. An absolute classic of American music that belongs in any music library.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is no doubt on of the best albums ever made. In fact, Q, who held a public vote (2002), found that this was the SECOND BEST ALBUM EVER behind Nivana, in front of the Beatles in third.<br />Every song is powerful and affects you in its own way. Some may say that its a classic album but hard to get into but it isn't really. If their are a couple of seemingly average tracks inbetween two that you like almost straight away, you listen to them and it sounds better each time untill they become great songs. That's what I found anyway.<br />You then like every song for ages. They contain so much care and quality from one of thee most talented bands ever (even though I think they are sad and miserable) that the songs don't just get boring after a few listenings, such as Linkin Park (example used in an early review, I know, but I have to emphasize that point).<br />A listening technique for all Radiohead albums, so that you don't miss some of the greats that the music world has to offer: <BR>-Listen to the whole album, not just a select few tracks.<br />This is one of the best albums ever made. You can't criticise it. Seriously.
B00008PBZW|1.0|The worst Nicolas Cage movie of all time, this movie appears to have potential but is a disappointment. The movie is about two soldiers (Cage and Slater) who are assigned to protect Navajo Indians during WWII. The Navajos have been trained to use their language as a military \\"code\\" to help disguise communications. This concept is actually very interesting, and a story which COULD make a great movie. This movie, however, is FAR from great.<br /><br />The plot is thin, and the story ends up being mostly a cheesy action movie. The main conflict occurs when Nic Cage has to decide what is more important - the lives of the Navajos or \\"the code.\\" The problem is, the movie quickly degrades into meaningless sequences of action scenes interrupted by a little dialogue. I think Nic Cage kills about 200 enemy troops in one battle.<br /><br />Another problem I have is that the reason the movie seems appealing (the Navajo language/ code etc...) Is BARELY used to enhance the movie. It is merely a gimmick to sell this otherwise completely carbon-copy war movie.<br /><br />In summary, if what you are seeking is a sub-standard war movie that has already been done many times (and done MUCH, MUCH better) just because you own every other war movie....then you might like this movie. If you want depth of character, real emotion, the suspension of disbelief, and the gruesome reality of war...then buy ANY other war movie.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead continue experimenting with a lot of skill. They still haven't followed up their famous OK COMPUTER and instead produced KID A and this: two different albums altogether, only a few glimmers of their old selves amoungst loads of wierd sound effects.I think they deserve a lot of respect for that; They don't follow the market and instead try many different things, which always get a lot of effort and end up being of the highest quality.<br />This particular album is more down to earth than Kid A but not quite as good.<br />Amnesiac, like Kid A takes a lot of listening to. At first it sounds poor. Even later it doesn't sound that good but eventually it clicks into place and becomes an excellent album full of wierd but powerful tracks. However this, like their very first, has a few flaws. Some of the songs are weak and I don't believe the album is structured very well. A couple of songs seem out of place, or just poor, such as Hunting Bears (where they got the name from I don't know).<br />Overall, though one of their weaker albums, it is done by Radiohead and thus is a great album. If you can appreciate this, try getting your head around Kid A. It was voted by the public in the top 40 greatest albums ever (displayed in Q mag)for being so wierd but so good. That's good to say they didn't release any singles from it.<br />Amnesiac is a great album, though you must give it time.
B000002H33|5.0|As a person who has listened to thousands of recordings by thousands of metal bands, it is only fair to say that 'Master Of Puppets' is the greatest metal album by the greatest metal band in the world. 'Not as fast as Slayer ...' and 'Not as heavy as Pantera ...', but with unequalled heart, talent and substance. If I could give it 6 out of 5 stars I would. This album is a gem for any general rock listener and not just metal fans. Get it and treasure it now.
B000021Y77|4.0|This film took me by surprise years ago and has remained on my &quot;Most Favorite&quot; list. The music is great as it keeps time with the action. Whether you have a great sound system or not, Lola is outstanding both visually (with director Twyker's interesting use of colors) AND audibly (is that a word?).<br />Usually I don't care for foreign films, but I'll watch this one over and over again!
B000005DQR|5.0|What are you meant to say about an album that's received so many 5-star reviews already? Endtroducing...is this the coolest album ever made? Right down from the sleeve of the vinyl junkies' heaven to the faultlessly constructed songs, samples that sound so great together that you wonder how they could have ever been apart.<br />Its a pioneering mix, with old-skool soul, hip-hop and jazz all melded into a mellow, chilled out canvas. Centrepieces like &quot;Building Steam With A Grain Of Salt&quot; and the album's best, &quot;Mutual Slump&quot; transcend words. People say &quot;trip-hop&quot;, people say &quot;ambient&quot;, people say &quot;sample-based&quot;, I say &quot;genre-less&quot;. I say &quot;unclassifiable&quot;. I say unlike anything you've ever heard in your life. <br />Don't come looking for catchy tunes, don't hear this is pioneering hip-hop and come looking for gangsta rhymes, but come here looking for musician's music, so incredibly made, so effortlessly cool, and so like nothing you ever heard before. Endtroducing is the sound of the future constructed from the past.
B00008H2LE|5.0|I like many others heard a few tracks off of hybrid over the radio and tv and made the decision to buy the cd out of curiosity mostly because of the hard hitting single \\"One Step Closer.\\" After buying the cd I was amazed and I have listened to it none stop for the past few years and never gotten tired of it.  After hearing the long awaited first single of their newest kick[in'] album METEORA I knew the bar had been raised.  I went down and bought this bad boy first day it came out and it was far far from anything even close to a disappointment.  Music just does not get better than this, call it pop rock or whatever the hell you want, but I listen to alot of other hard stuff including bands like Metallica, Slipknot, Tool, NIN.  And I can crank this cd up in my car and get twice as amped up than listening to Metallica's song Fuel.  These guys kick ..., they have an awesome heavy sound mixed with some crazy dj bumps and they don't even cuss.  The lyrics blow the first album out of the water, now they got great beats and lyrics that make sense and reach out to the listener.  And every single track brings a different element even the rap interlude with Shinoda, you are captivated every minute of this cd and I wouldn't skip any one of the groundbreaking songs and take in their greatness.  If you are into any kind of heavy rock and you wanna get amped up buy this cd, don't burn it this band deserves your money!

0385504209|4.0|It has been over ten years since reading Umberto Eco's playful though erudite fictional response to the myriad of Grail theories that surfaced throughout the eighties in his novel, 'Foucault's Pendulum'. One reviewer called this book a mental adventure and a cross-referencing nightmare. So it was with great curiosity that I finally read ~The Da Vinci Code~ last week to find another intelligent approach to this intriguing subject in the form of a paperback thriller. It is a majority consensus that Brown writes this genre as it should be written: one simply cannot put the book down until all the mysteries are solved and you read the last page. Most would agree that this genre of novel has developed into an art form, and it is obvious that Dan Brown, along with his editors, have taken the form to near perfection in this book. If it weren't for the sun making a surprise appearance through my window, and the terrible realization that I had to work that day, this excellent novel would have been read in one sitting.<br />To be fair, one really cannot make a comparison between Eco's novel and ~The Da Vinci Code~. Both texts cover similar ground in respect to Grail theories, the Catholic Church and that mysterious organization, The Priory of Sion. ~The Da Vinci Code~ slaps the subject matter into a fast-paced-thriller-context, that doesn't let the reader rest for a second, which is what this type of book is designed to do. In other words, this book only scratches the surface of the many secret societies and religious theories that truly exist all around us. Whereas Eco's 'Pendulum' explores these theories and societies from a variety of different angles and at greater depth. Eco does this, of course, with a sly wink and his tongue planted firmly in his cheek.<br />It is obvious, however, that Brown is not playing any games, and uses this captivating subject matter to great effect, which amongst other things, is informative and extremely entertaining. If you're even slightly interested in religious conspiracy theories, and a fan of the thriller genre, ~The Da Vinci Code~ will give you everything you require...and more.interested in religious conspiracy theories, and a fan of the thriller genre, ~The Da Vinci Code~ will give you everything you require...and more.

Carol Neblett is the weakest link here, she simply has no power, and does not carry the role. This is more painfully evident when matched with Milnes and Domingo. I gave away my copy of this set.<BR>Decca has finally rereleased the studio recording of Fanciulla with Tebaldi, del Monaco, and MacNeil. This is the set to purchase!

0385504209|5.0|A book with some strange and alarming news about the last supper!! and a book that will keep you up throughout the night. The story revolves around a symbolist, who hails from Harvard, and who is invited to the louvre to meet the curator while he is in Paris. But before they meet the curator is attacked, and as he is dying, he leaves clues which he illustrates with his own blood for the police. Sure enough he writes the professors name, which is enough evidence to book him.  Then comes Sophie Neveu, the curators granddaughter who happens to be a cryptologist; she believes in the professors innocence and together they set out to solve the Da Vinci Code. Its a great adventure, a real page-turner and I recommend it for sheer entertainment. Now if you're looking for a few other interesting titles that will keep you glued to your seat look no further than these, Buckland's Hot List: most creative, The Butterfly: A Fable (Singh); most engaging, The Alchemist (Coelho); most interesting, Life of Pi (Martel); most enlightening, 9-11 (Chomsky); most thrilling, The Lovely Bones: A Novel (Sebold); and finally, the most creative, engaging, interesting, enlightening and thrilling book of all, The Little Prince (Saint-Exupery). These are the books I'd recommend to my family, friends, students, and wife. There are many more, trust me, but these are the first that come to mind (for having left an impact slight or proud as it may be). If you have any questions, queries, or comments, or maybe even a title you think I should add to my list, please feel free to e-mail me. I'm always open to a good recommendation. Thanks for reading my brief but hopefully helpful review. Happy reading. Donald S. Buckland.
0312305060|4.0|Fans of straightforward story-writing might be frustrated by Michael Cunningham's book, which swirls back and forth between modern New York, 1950's California, and late Edwardian England like a whirlpool.   But its emotional effect is powerful and it is worth an effort.<br />I found it had a profound impact on me once I started reading it as though I were listening to a piece of music.  Themes rise to the surface, submerge, and reappear (purchasing flowers; a kiss shared between two women; a life-threatening illness; an interrupted attempt to run away from one's life; a suicide reconsidered)-just as in music.  Let it wash over you rather than analyze it, and you will be well rewarded.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Nothing helps a movie like a good soundtrack. A real die-hard soundtrack fan I rank this one right up with the finest that you can leave the repeat button on. If I was to have one qualm with the DVD edition of the movie it would be it didn't offer the ability to single out the soundtrack as some DVDs have such as Don Juan DeMarco.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I'll give no long review,in my opinion their best album, 'nuff said.
B00006J3T4|5.0|This is not heavy drumming, hard rocking Dire Straits.  This is a quiet CD, with beautiful music played by a master guitar player and incredible song-writer.  You will find something in every one of these songs that will play over and over in your mind when you are not listening to it.  That is a sign of a great CD.  This is a great CD...buy it!  Is there a better songwriter than Mark Knopfler who just seems to get better and better?  I want more!
B00005B36H|5.0|ALL of their albums are good, but this one made my skin crawl!
B00005U1YO|4.0|Indeed this record is totally what you would expect from The Chemical Brothers. Good thing or bad some people have asked themselves before me...Well my 2 cents is that it is a good thing. Although the Chemical Brothers are no pioneers in dance music they have that something different to their sound, an unexplicable &quot;extra&quot; which makes every album into a cracking solid i-can't-stand-still sound... Perhaps this lack of inventiveness comes because the Chemical brothers don't really have to put a lot of effort into making a fun and good album. Or to say it in other words...they just &quot;do their thing&quot;, and that's all we'll ever ask...
B000000ITC|4.0|The first of many intriguing concept albums by the Alan Parsons Project, \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" is available as it was originally conceived on this Mercury/Mobile High Fidelity 'Ultradisc.'  Featuring 24-carat gold plating and a deluxe jewel case, it's well worth the extra money (if, that is, you can find a copy for under ...).  The sound is magnificent and matches the often grandiose instrumentation of, say, \\"The Fall of the House of Usher.\\"  Although Parsons and Woolfson were still finding their way as a songwriting duo, this CD withstands the test of time and is highly rewarding overall.  Listen especially to the final track, \\"To One in Paradise,\\" to get a taste of the almost surreal beauty which was cultivated on future releases (cf. the song \\"Time\\" from Turn of a Friendly Card).
B000056N8X|5.0|It's a pity this film didn't receive the following it deserved at the box office. It surpasses the original Highlander film and equals the best the TV series produced. Part of that is due to Adrian Paul. Part of it is due to the villain. Part of it to the script, the music and the brilliant sword fights. Part of it to Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert acting in the film together. <br />There is memorable cinematography and haunting sequences of love, betrayal and death. Unforgettable. Emotional. Yes, even inspiring. It deserves to be on your shelf next to the DVD TV episodes. Of all the Highlander films shown in the theatre there can only be one and this is that one. The only other in its league was the first.
B000051S3H|1.0|If you love the story of Jane Eyre, this version is not for you.  The performances are lacking, and the screenwriter made too many changes to the plot.  If you absolutely have to see it, find somewhere to rent it, but don't waste your money on a purchase.  The A&amp;E, Zeffirelli and BBC versions far outshine this film.
B00004VWAF|5.0|...One being to imagine what it was like being a Miles fan or Jazz fan at the time, and hearing it in that context, or viewing it now, as 30+ years have passed and that this is just an historical musical document.  Well, since I was born in '74, option 1 is not an option for me, so I'll have to tell you that this album, when I first heard it totally blew me away.  I love Miles, I love Jazz, and I love funk.  But this was just hardcore groove-funk music, and when it first made its way into my CD player, I couldn't stop.  Forget about the other stuff that Miles was doing at the time or before (although this IS a logical extension of where he had been heading), and just listen to this sucker.  And twist one up, cuz this is someheavy ...
0670880728|5.0|How can you not love Ms. Jones?! Fielding's novel is a great example of singletons everywhere; all obsessed with love, work, weight, men, weight, men and of course...weight!! The bit with Colin Firth is just too much for words, as Bridget's obsession with Mr. Darcy takes over the interview. Jones makes you laugh, cry and wonder about life and what it holds...the witty banter and the closeness of friends makes you ache for more!!
6305014140|4.0|The movie actually has a plot and the story is told masterfully, which is something you don't see very often in most anime movies nowadays. Unfortunately, had it not been for the distasteful sex scenes I'd have given the movie 5 stars, to be frank. Personally I'm not very concerned or offended by gratuitous sex scenes; however, the scenes involving Kagero at the beginning, then with the Daimyo and his concubine were totally unnecessary, and extremely witless. It kind of degrades the movie as a whole, in my humble opinion. The story was simple enough, Jubei - realizing although Kagero and other characters kept calling him \\"Ninja\\" but he's actually a masterless Samurai, a Ronin - was forced to join a Tokugawa government spy in his investigation to stop the Eight Demons serving the Dark Shogun from stealing a government's ship of gold. On his way he also rescued Kagero, and a love story slowly unfolded between them eventually into the movie, you know the drill here. The fight scenes were top-notch, lots of gore, and over all it was a pretty fast-paced movie. All the fights were over WAY too quickly before we got to see any of the demons really getting to use more of their special power; in the fight with the snake girl,  she even got killed by her own team before she got to make any move! Besides, I'm not so sure about creative characters here. All the demons, as well as other fighers in Ninja Scroll were undeniably inspired by the popular fighter game series Samurai Showdowns I, II, III, and IV. If any of you had played it you should know what I'm talking about, we'd have the ever-popular blind swordman Ukyo here again, along with the steel-armed Sieger, the buddhist monk Nicotine, a hunched back guy that resembled Gen-an, the game boss himself with his electric attacks (and also looked and acted a lot like a lady, just like in the game!), the shadow guy from Samurai IV with his retractable metal claw, and of course, our main hero, appropriately being the samurai Haomaru. Of course they've changed all the names of the main characters, but you'll run into a bunch of other secondary characters that had kept their names over from the games, like the ninja Hanzo himself; unfortunately he died too quickly, like almost all of the other fighters in Ninja Scroll. All in all, I love the story plot, this is not a classic in any means like \\"Spirited Away\\", but a great movie nonetheless, go rent it!
0385504209|2.0|It is amazing to me that this book is a number one best seller.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised, when murderers of the language like Tom Clancy and John Grisham can be at the top of the list.  The writing in this book is TERRIBLE.  Although the intellectual puzzles posed are interesting, it is completely implausible that characters under such stress, lack of sleep, etc. could suddenly have the solutions to these puzzles dawn on them.  In addition, the plot has more deus ex machina moments than the entire history of Greek theater.  Very disappointing, and not even a good read.
B000050IE6|5.0|\\"Still Life\\" is yet another example of what makes Opeth such a unique and compelling band.  No metal band composes epic songs quite like they do, and their talent and emotion is nearly unparalelled.  As the reviews on this site attest, if you like melodic metal, death metal, or even prog rock, you can get into Opeth.  The reason is simple: Opeth combine elements of all three genres.  Raging metal shares space with mellow folk- and jazz-influenced passages, allowing Opeth to explore a broader range of musical and emotional territory than most bands would even dream of.  This band isn't content to abide by the \\"rules\\" of one genre; they instead stake out their own ground by taking the best of several styles.<br />Mikael Akerfeldt, the band's frontman, is doubtless one of the most singular vocalists you could ever hope to hear.  He can spew forth earth-shattering death vocals one minute, and then turn around and soothe your frayed nerves with some smooth singing.  The music, meanwhile, is as complex and virtuosic as always.  Insinuating guitar harmonies, screaming solos, thumping bass, and Martin Lopez's technical drum work add up to one of the most impressive sonic onslaughts I've had the pleasure of hearing.<br />All you have to do is listen to the eleven-minute opener, \\"The Moor,\\" and you know you're in for a treat.  The intro may be soft and acoustic, but it's deceptive, as if the band were trying to lull the listener into a false sense of security.  \\"The Moor\\" turns out to be one of Opeth's heaviest songs, but it combines its gut-wrenching heaviness with stunning virtuosity and melody.  While \\"melodic death metal\\" is a term that's come into vogue in recent years, much of what falls into that category is really just melodic metal with harsh vocals (In Flames and Soilwork are good examples).  Opeth are one of the few bands I've heard that can infuse melody into true death metal without compromising the genre's trademark heaviness, and \\"The Moor\\" is one of the best examples of how well they do it.  Fans of Morbid Angel or Suffocation (as I am) should love this song.<br />The next track, \\"Godhead's Lament,\\" is another classic.  Even more than \\"The Moor,\\" it demonstrates just how effectively Opeth can combine disparate elements.  This song is so complex and diverse I don't even bother trying to anticipate what's coming next; I just enjoy the ride.  One minute Akerfeldt and Peter Lindgren are unleashing shredding volleys of violent guitar work, the next they're slowing things down for a pleasant acoustic passage.  Akerfeldt's vocals are pure venom early in the song, but that just makes it even more sound even more heart-wrenching when he turns on that mournful singing voice.  These constant shifts in vocal and musical style give songs like \\"Godhead's Lament\\" a dynamic that's rare in any genre, metal or otherwise.<br />The quality doesn't stop there, either.  \\"Benighted\\" is a soft, largely acoustic song with all clean vocals that provides a nice break after the heaviness of \\"The Moor\\" and \\"Godhead's Lament.\\"  At five-plus minutes, it's a bit longer than I think it had to be, but it's still a very pretty song in its own right.  The combination of acoustic and electric guitars that opens \\"Moonlight Vertigo\\" is easily one of the best intros ever, setting the stage for yet another of Opeth's diverse masterpieces.<br />\\"Face of Melinda,\\" another choice cut, is an epic eight-minute ballad, easily one of Opeth's most moving songs.  The first half consists of little more than acoustic guitars and clean vocals, but the pain and vulnerability in Akerfeldt's voice makes it work.  And when the guitars turn electric about halfway through the result is, well, electrifying.  \\"Serenity Painted Death\\" is another viciously heavy song that will definitely appeal to those that liked \\"The Moor\\" and \\"Godhead's Lament.\\"  For whatever reason, the guitar leads on this song in particular stand out to me.  Good stuff, I say.<br />\\"Still Life\\" ends on the best possible note with the ten-minute \\"White Cluster,\\" which basically encapsulates everything that's come before it.  The song is yet another epic that combines sounds as it seems only Opeth can do.  Intricate arrangements, addictive melodies, fearsome death vocals, soaring clean vocals: it's all here.  It's up against some stiff competition, but \\"White Cluster\\" may well be the best song on here.<br />So, there you have it.  \\"Still Life\\" is seven more tracks of the customary brilliance that we've call come to expect from Opeth.  At sixty-two minutes, it manages to never sound pretentious or boring.  Considering how much mindless \\"music\\" is polluting the airwaves these days, it's really sad that great bands like this one don't get more attention, but those of us who appreciate something well-written and well-played know where to look.  And be sure to check out \\"Damnation\\" next week!ds on the best possible note with the ten-minute \\"White Cluster,\\" which basically encapsulates everything that's come before it.

0194314243|4.0|I volunteer teach in the library Literacy Program and bought this book for my student from Fiji.  She loves it and carries it with her all the time.  Although it's geared for advanced learners, my student is just reading English at about 4th grade level and finds this book very helpful.  She uses it to look up words she doesn't understand and to learn synonyms and antonyms.  She will still be using this book ten years from now when she's reading English at college level.
B0000584V3|5.0|...it's hard to decide which one I like the most.  It seems that out of the last four Opeth albums, my favorite is whichever one I happen to be listening to at a particular moment.  Well, anyway, \\"Blackwater Park\\" is a good a candidate as any for the title of Best Opeth Album Ever.<br />Although Opeth clearly have roots in death metal, they routinely transcend the genre to produce music that any metal fan can enjoy.  I happen to like death metal, but Opeth are a different beast entirely.  While the brutal heaviness of many of their songs is obvious, Opeth manage to augment it with stunningly skillful and melodic playing, making their sound palatable to non-death metal listeners without abandoning the core elements of the genre.  And they combine their metal assault with ample doses of acoustic guitars and clean vocals for a diversity that more traditional death metal bands lack.<br />Although Opeth are renowned largely for the \\"soft\\" aspect they bring to extreme metal, anyone who doubts their ability or willingess to throw down need only to listen to the album opener \\"The Leper Affinity.\\"  This song's violent paroxysms of guitar work and fearsome death vocals are more than enough to please even the most hardened metalhead.  And if there's still any doubt that Mikael Akerfeldt is one of the best death vocalists ever (if not THE best), then this song should put them to rest.  I listen to lots of death metal, and while plenty of death vocalists can get down as low as Akerfeldt, few if any can match his melodic sensibility.  This guy rules, plain and simple.<br />Of course, \\"Blackwater Park\\" wouldn't be an Opeth album without exploring a wide range of sounds, and there's more than enough variety here to please listeners of many tastes.  The aptly-titled \\"Bleak\\" actually introduces some Eastern-accented guitar work into its steamrolling sonic onslaught, and Porcupine Tree frontman Steven Wilson's guest vocals are downright mesmerizing.  From there, the quality continues uninterrupted.  Some songs continue with the heaviness of the first two, while others explore softer territory, and some combine the two approaches in a manner that few bands could even dream of.  Whatever the case, though, it seems almost every song has something different to offer: the lush arrangements and vocal harmonies of \\"Harvest\\" and \\"Drapery Falls,\\" the alternating mournfulness and viciousness of \\"Dirge For November\\" (another appropriately titled song), the insanely catchy riffing of the brilliant \\"Funeral Portrait,\\" the gentle acoustic guitars and pianos of the instrumental interlude \\"Patterns in the Ivy.\\"  This stuff is a lot to digest, but with time it all fits together.<br />The concluding title track deserves some special mention as well.  Much like on their previous album \\"Still Life,\\" Opeth start and end \\"Blackwater Park\\" with a pair of classic epics.  \\"Blackwater Park\\" (the song) starts with a swirling, malevolent intro, and when Akerfeldt's fearsome vocals come in it sounds like you're in for some serious musical punishment.  But then suddenly the guys stop on a dime and go into a quiet, ethereal instrumental passage.  And then a few minutes later, they just as suddenly switch back to all-out heaviness for a truly foreboding conclusion.  I can't think of another band that shifts styles so sharply and completely (except for maybe Mr. Bungle), but that's what makes Opeth Opeth.  Hear them, and see what I mean.s uninterrupted.

B00008J4P5|5.0|Oh man, this band is so good.  And this may be their best cd.  The songs are amazingly catchy and good. (except maybe the last one, its a little pre-school) Theyre the kinda songs you wished went on forever!  I love song #2! o man. ok, just buy the cd, guys.  Its worth it! I promise!
B000067CPX|5.0|This is such a great album!  I bought this album last July, and I still listen to it on a regular basis.  There is not a bad song on the entire CD.  All of you old-school RHCP fans who say they've lost their funk...well, they progressed past their funk stage.  If they were still making music similar to BSSM, they probably would be out of a job and homeless on the street.  Just a great album!
B00008DDXC|4.0|First, you should know that I never read the books.  Had absolutely no interest.  My oldest daughter (now 18) really enjoyed then but my two other kids did not.  So, I am not a purist.  I know many of you who loved the books didn't like the movie.  But I had no such distraction.  So, on to the review.  This is a very clever story that continues on with the same characters from the first (although a tad older now...with voices changing noticably).  First rate acting.  first rate production values AND a real surprise....6.1 dolby digital.  If you were ever looking for a reason to upgrade to 6.1, this might be the movie to convince you. This is a fun movie with lots of surprises and real dastardly people.  The spider scenes (and the snake scenes)might be a bit too much for the very young but everyone else should love this.  Have fun!
0743424425|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. As pointed out in the intro by KIng (and by the last review) this book has a lot simplier prose than later books, but its just so good! Things intertwine, the characters are strong,the stroy is well-paced. And, 'o course, its scary. Its a great way to start off on KIng books.
B000000OE7|3.0|Not a bad album..<br />As with many of Queen's post 1980 albums, there are a handful of great songs on this album-but others that are mediocre.<br /> 'I Was Born To Love You ' and the inspirational 'Made In Heaven' -both originally released as part of Freddie Mercury's 1985 solo album ' Mr. Bad Guy'- and Brian May's beautiful 'Too Much Love Will Kill You' are all fantastic.<br />There are a few others I would have left off and replaced with remakes of songs from Queen's 1970's golden era.<br />All in all, there is some memorable stuff here.
1881273156|5.0|For anyone in any sort of relationship (that would be all of us!) this book is a must read! I devoured this book in two days and am looking forward to reading it again and again and again. Love is such an important topic yet so many of us equate it only to romantic involvements. The Five Love Languages will give you a vast understanding of how ALL the people in your life will benefit from knowing their particular love language and that of those around them. I am giving this book to a lot of people for Christmas aqnd it will become a staple in the way of wedding presents! I cannot place enough emphasis on the importance of this topic!
0375823360|5.0|Many of the people who like this trilogy try to defend it against the attacks.  In all fairness, this series takes a dramatically anti-Christian stance (slowly at first, and climatically near the end, as if the tension of the plot and the vileness of faith are exposed in parallel).  Christians do well to avoid it, unless they're willing to be offended.<br />However, this series has the potential to show through fiction what hundreds of angry essays have failed to communicate - that the war we fight is not \\"good against evil,\\" or \\"order against chaos,\\" but rather knowledge against ignorance.  However, this moral isn't dropped heavy-handed.  Rather, the books characters, plotline, and subtly alien worldview (a culture almost exactly like our own, only without any real division between magic, science and theology) engross the reader without regard to the reader's metaphysical stance.
6303855474|3.0|Sylvester Stallone is Dredd - one of an elite force of super-soldiers who assume the roles of judge, jury and (not infrequently) executioner in the futuristic megalopolis of Mega-City.  With most of Earth reduced to a barren and virtually uninhabitable desert (called \\"The Cursed Earth\\"), those who wish to survive squeeze themselves into huge but cramped \\"Megacities\\" like the one policed by Dredd.  Though full of flying cars and other futurama, Megacity's overpopulation problem has turned it into an urban hell, forcing the city's leaders to take  drastic steps.  Whether looking to expand capital punishment to include \\"lesser crimes\\" or to re-start a shadowy program called Janus, the most bellicose of the city's leaders, Griffin (played by Jurgen Prochnow) is willing to overcome any obstacle - the first being Dredd himself.  Griffin hooks up with Rico (Armand Assante), a former justice who was exiled to a nasty, high-security prison in Aspen when he turned vigilante.  Sprung, Rico returns to Megacity and frames Dredd for the murder of an exploitive Geraldo-like TV reporter (judges are equipped with personalized weapons that imprint a record of their DNA on every round fired).  With Dredd out of the way, Rico and Griffin touch off a crime-wave - one Griffin is sure to bend the council to his plans.  Little does he know that Rico has plans of his own.  Both suffer a shock when Dredd manages to escape enroute to Aspen, and re-enters the city.<br />Unfortunately, unlike all of the character in this flick, the script itself has no plans of its own, and the story never arises from being a pastiche of countless action movies (including \\"Demolition Man\\" in which Stallone was a lot more fun).  Though it's got great visuals, the plot meanders around, never coming together before the explosions kick off.  Besides, it takes more than CGI to astound us now.  Rob Schneider plays the comic relief and the lovely Diane Lane plays the anonymous love interest.  Armand Assante tries to heat things up as Rico, but his over-the-top delivery just reminds us how much more fun we had watching \\"Demolition Man\\".  This flick would have been much more fun if it took itself a bit less seriously.
B00005JLEU|5.0|In the past year Spirited Away replaced Titanic as the highest grossing film in Japan and won a Best Animated Oscar. Unfortunately many Americans have never heard of this wonderful film.<BR>     The recent imports of Anime (animation from Japan) such as Pokemon, Yu Gi Oh and Digimon, have given American audiences an incorrect image of anime. In many cases these shows have been completely reworked for American audiences. As a result many of the rich and complex story lines are diluted down into fast moving action with little plot. It is no wonder many adults relegate Anime to children's cartoon.<BR>     Luckily masters such as Hayao Miyazaki are still showing the amazing powers of animation. Spirited Away, arguably his best work ever, is the story of a young girl, Chihiro. She and her parents are moving to a new town. Along the way they take a wrong turn and end up in a spirit land. The center of this magical land is a giant bathhouse where the spirits come to realize and rejuvenate themselves. The bathhouse is run by Yubaba, a witch with again head, a giant mole, a giant baby and a twin sister. When Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs, she must take a job in the bathhouse cleaning tubs in order to save herself from the same fate. Chihiro must overcome her fears and find the strength to save her parents and get them all home. <BR>     The spirit world is populated with many fanciful creative the like of which we have not seen since Alice fell down the rabbit hole. But don't worry, extensive knowledge of the Japanese Religion Shintoism is not required to enjoy this film. Simply know that they believed everything had its own spirit from radishes to rivers. <BR>     If you did not get a chance to see this movie in the theatre, this is your opportunity. The film is a sweet, funny and slightly trippy story that is sure to delight. <br />Read a review of the whole DVD at shelikesdvds.com
B00008J2DQ|2.0|Godsmack is an incredibly overrated band. <BR> I guess this is for kids who never heard heavy rock before.

Alice In Chains being a great band of actual worth to music.<br />So they take the name GODSMACK...I always think of bands like SHOOTING STAR, when I hear the name Godsmack.  SHOOTING STAR a decent rock act, who took their name from a BAD COMPANY song.<BR>It was [weak] and of course, although Shooting Star had some good songs, they were never really a band of subsatnce to rock n roll.  Took their name from an actual good, impactful band and eventually faded into the \\"What Ever Happened To\\"<br />That's how it should go for Godsmack as well.  But in this current culture, I can see them going on and on and on, with their \\"same old\\" indistinguishable, Metallica, Alice In Chains...act.<BR>Hey, I can listen to their songs.  It's just that I'm sitting there like, \\"Oh well\\"  \\"Whatever\\" \\"This is boring me to tears\\"<br />It's like kids will eat up anything thrown their way these days...trying so hard to have an important act in their lives.  This is sad to me.  But Godsmack can laugh all the way to the bank, as long as these kids are fooled into thinking this mundane 6th generation [stuff] is actually important.<br />Well, rock n roll is supposed to be fun, so if they're having fun, then I guess it's good for that.<br />One thing though, that furthers my opinion of GODSMACK being a load of bull......<br />That midget lead singer from Godsmack (you know, with the pointy chin and thick neck)  I saw a clip from MTV news last week, where this guy is saying, \\"Oh, I wouldn't change my life for a thing, I'm just the happiest guy in the world!\\" (sounded like...Sally Field or something)  <br />*Then I see them performing on Leno and he's singing, \\"I can't see a reason...to JUSTIFY MY RAGE!!!\\"  and then that other song on FACELESS...  \\"I F*@$#*!@  HATE YOU!\\"<br />This guy is full of it kids.  It's pretend angst, fake emotion...and sterilized compressed sounding music....<br />Like it's just so perfect and so perfectly BORING and full of fakeness.<br />Great bands from the original punk movement of the 70's, Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley, among others had REAL pain, angst and emotion.  Iggy Pop had REAL angry fun  Ozzy in Black Sabbath emoted exactly what he was..genuine and you could feel it!<br />This guy in Godsmack is just full of it.<br />And the rest of the band (save for the drummer, who looks like a real rock n roll guy) look like rejects from Creed or Live, with that perfectly dresed and mock angry nonsense they're putting forth<br />Children of the REAL ROCK n ROLL, let us unite and extinguish this 4th rate,10th generation Pearl Jam[-like] nonsense!<br />Get something going that emotes the passion of honest kick...rock n roll!  Something that gets metaphysical at a show.<br />Something with wit, true charisma, and for God's sake, some humor again!<br />Does anyone know why BON SCOTT was so great?  Not only for the muscle and growl, but for his wit, charisma and genuine rock n roll attitude.....AND a great sense of HUMOR.<br />Very nice GENUINE person as well.<br />So buy this Godsmack CD if you want some superficial, perfectly sterilized sounding and boring \\"pretend\\" rock<br />For me, I might as well be listening to a Faith Hill record, when I listen to Godsmack.<br />It comes off just as safe and boring in some way.<br />Real Rockers...ROCK ON!!<br />Marc
6305291446|4.0|H20 is one of the best sequels in the Halloween series. Highly enjoyable, with a great cast (including Josh Hartnett, Michelle Williams and of course Jamie Lee Curtis) it shows us what Laurie gets up to twenty years after the nigh He came home. <BR>I've seen all the Halloweens so far (including Resurrection) and I must admit that this is one of the more scarier ones, and ranks almost at the top with the original. It's really cool, but I knocked one star off because it drags a bit, but then once it gets going, you find yourself on the edge of your seat!

B000060K4O|2.0|Since no one else will, I'll point out what the problem with this movie is:  it has aged poorly.  The first half is still pretty funny, but it peters out into a bunch of badly dated special effects.  <br />The DVD was highly touted when it first came out as being &quot;loaded&quot; with &quot;goodies.&quot;  Well, I have come to pretty much ignore extras on dvds at this point, but I will point out that compared to the extravaganzas being released these days, this dvd is nothing to write home about.<br />This movie will always be noteworthy for becoming such a huge hit, but time has not been kind.

Why on Earth would I do something like that?<br />It's because this band should be paying royalties to Glassjaw, The Deftones, Saves The Day and At The Drive-In for writing all their songs for them.<br />Just listening to the first song of this, I could tell that this was more easily digested, major label * for kids who think that they're groundbreaking and original. It sickens me that a band like this could get signed while other bands who have been working twice as hard for three times as long as them still get no recognition. Every time I see someone wearing a The Used shirt, I want to ask them what the hell they are thinking.<br />OK, I can't say anything good about this CD. I'm just stopping now.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Being a fan of both Rage and Soundgarden, I've been waiting for this for a long time.  I knew it would be good and all, but whoa!  This album exceeded my expectations by a long ways.  This is bar none one of the best albums I've bought in a good while.  Chris Cornell's vocals are great, and Tom Morello's guitar playing is better than ever.  You all know the singles, you all love the singles, but it doesn't stop there.  Every friggin song on here is amazing!  This is nothing short of a masterpiece, and I really hope these guys put out something else pronto.  In a day in age where everything on the radio sounds the same, this is one band that truly stands out.  Buy it, buy it now!!

B000003S0P|5.0|RED is and will continue to be the final statement for the era truly known as progressive rock. Even though it only contains five tracks and barely 40 minutes worth of music this, my dear friends, is the most powerful and intelligent progressive rock record ever created. It slammed the door shut on the era with a tremendous thud of power, dignity and finally grace. Bill Bruford has been quoted as saying that all progressive rock should have died in 1974 because everything after that time period was a carbon copy or repetitive. All though most of my favorite bands are of this ilk and i appreciate much of their music beyond 1974, he is correct and this album...this album my friends is the DEFINING ALBUM of prog rock. Its angular, complicated, pompous,completely non-dancable, beautiful, heart breaking, ugly and truthful. I recommend this CD to anyone with the heart and the brains to pick it up and devour every morsel of its goodness. I have owned this album for almost 20 years now and the final track &quot;Starless&quot; still brings a chill up my spine and a tear to my eye for its shear beauty and mastery. Thanks for listening.
0743244249|5.0|Don DeLillo again shows that he's our best novelist of American absurdity with this strange off-kilter comedy that centers around the events of an eventful day in Manhattan.<br /><br />Against a backdrop of raves, a Presidential motorcade, a rock star's funeral, mysterious street demonstrations and the constant, ghostly electronic feed of news of pending financial disaster, a young billionaire asset manager limousines uptown to get a haircut in order to embrace his sense of inevitable, personal apocalypse. DeLillo's writing is outstanding, funny with a cool lyricism, poetic when you least expect it.<br /><br /> The brillance here, as with \\"White Noise\\" and especially \\"Mao ll\\" is the way characters seek to reconfigure their metaphors, their assuring base of references , once their world view is rattled and made less authortative by unexplainable events and human quirks. This is semiotics at its best, an erotic activity where DeLillo probes and glides over the surfaces of ideas , notions, theories and their artifacts, things intellectual and material emptied of meaning, purpose.<br /><br />It's a hallmark of DeLillo's mastery of language that he gets that psychic activity that constantly tries to reinfuse the world with meaning and purpose after the constructions are laid bare; Eric, here in this world of commodity trading, which he regards as natural force that he's mastered and control, attempts to reintroduce mystery into the world he is trapped in. He is bored beyond the grave with the results of his luck.<br /><br />His efforts to live dangerously , spontaneously and thus get a perception he hadn't had and perhaps secure a hint of a metaphysical infrastructure that eludes, all turn badly, but for DeLillo's art it's not what is found , discovered, or resolved through the extensions of language, but rather the journey itself, the constant connecting of things with other things in the world; this is the poetry of the human need to make sense of things in the great , invisible state beyond the senses, a negoiation with death.<br /><br />His imagistic tilling of the semiotic field yields the sort of endless  irony that makes for the kind of truly subversive comedy, a sort of satire that contains the straining cadences of prophecy. The city, the place where the the hydra-headed strands of commerce, history, technology and government merge in startling combinations of applied power, becomes an amorphous cluster of symbols whose life and vitality come to seem as fragile and short-lived as living matter itself.<br /><br /> A major novel by one of our great literary artists.enses, a negoiation with death.

0743201140|5.0|Now Discover Your Strengths describes a revolutionary way to approach managing people by placing them in positions that capitalize on their strengths rather than positions in which they would work tirelessly in attempts to correct weaknesses.  The implications of the concepts and strategies found in this book encompass all organizations from business to education.  An important concept that is discussed in the book is that leaders should focus on the strengths of individuals and place them in positions in which their strengths will produce the best results for the organization.  This concept does two things. The first is that the individuals placed in positions that capitalize on their strengths will tend to enjoy their job more.  The second is that the organization will benefit from the strengths of the individual.<BR> Educational organizations can use the information in this book to help guide administrators when making personnel decisions.  Teachers can use the concepts in this book to help students realize their strengths and reduce the anxiety about their weaknesses.  As an educator I have used the book to identify my own strengths.  I also read a small section of the book to my Anatomy and Physiology class to support materials I had presented regarding the brain and how people learn.<BR> The thirty-four themes provide a description of the different strengths followed by short examples of what the strength sounds like.  The book then discusses common questions asked, how to manage your strengths, and how to build an organization based on strengths.  This book is enlightening and challenges people to view themselves and others in a different light by asking themselves, \\"what does he/she bring to the table and how can we best utilize it\\".
B00008DDXC|3.0|All due respect to Chris Columbus, but I'm definitely anticipating seeing how these stories will transfer to film in the hands of Alfonso Cuaron with the next movie installment.  The pacing and editing of this movie is dreadful, very similar to the first movie.  The music is completely rehashed from the first movie, and frankly, I don't think it was that great to begin with.  Certainly not John Williams' best effort.  In fact, it sounds remarkably similar to his \\"Home Alone\\" score.  The film works reasonably well because of the quality of the story itself, but there are many changes that would have improved the overall film, in my opinion.  Jason Isaacs and Alan Rickman are flawless in their roles as Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape.  After seeing Rickman in the first movie, I was sure no one could possibly upstage his sinister, evil persona -- boy was I wrong.  Isaacs just OOZES malevolence in every word he speaks.  Regrettably, we don't get to see much of Rickman's Professor Snape on-screen this time.  The child actors have come along nicely and the casting was, once again, spot on.  Maggie Smith gives another wonderful turn as Professor McGonagall, and Julie Walters is fantastic as Molly Weasley.  I also thought Christian Coulson was well-cast for the role of 16-year-old Tom Riddle.  I thought the Whomping Willow was a little ridiculous-looking, but apart from that, the special effects were spectacular.  Even though the movie drifted away from some fairly important parts of the book, I did like how the movie mirrored the darker tone of the book. This is particularly evident at the film's climax, and it will be interesting to see how this continues with \\"Prisoner of Azkaban,\\" which I think is even darker still.  For me, the absolute worst part of the movie was the very, very end -- the abominable \\"There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid\\" scene.  Just awful.  Pure Chris Columbus cheese and it drags on interminably waiting for the music to reach its final crescendo.It's a horrid and completely ungratifying sequence.  It would have been much better had they just stuck to the book on this one -- the huge feast and pajama party in the Great Hall with Gryffindor winning the house cup.  As far as the DVD, the video transfer quality is good, 5.1 digital is very nice, and thank GOD Warner Bros. listened to the outcries following the release of the ghastly \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" DVD and made the special features less game-y and frustrating to viewers over the age of eight.  It's still not a top-drawer DVD as far as extras go, but it's loads better than the first one.  If only they'd take a cue from New Line Cinema and release an extended version DVD... *sigh*
B000063DGC|5.0|this cd is perfect in every way, it is a live album, the only one realeased in ozzy osbournes career before randy rhodes- a god, tragically died. Randy rhodes was a genius from his pounding rythyms to his blazing solos,randy rhodes was a perfect guitarist in almost anyway you can think of.<br />This cd features a great compilation of songs. it has the entire blizzard of ozz album and a few songs from diary of a madman, and also features 3 songs from ozzy's black sabbath days. the Songs from &quot;ozz&quot; are fast and furious with randy playing every note faster and more accurate than on the studio album. the diary songs are the same way. and the sabbath songs are great. featuring randys own spice into the mix of already is a hot enchilada. he makes the songs more his own by adding notes and techniques to make them more crazy. all in all, this cd rules, you cant ask for a better cd from the god of rock and roll. and you cant ask for a better performance by the guitarist who brought ozzy osbourne back to life. R.I.P randy rhodes

B00003CX5P|4.0|I'm rating the DVD as well as the film itself. The movie plain and simple, is not good. It stinks. It was an astonishing visual achievment, but the writing, well..... was pathetic. Its like watching a really elaborate video game. Except video games have better plots, and characters. I found both the childrens performances to be a little wooden, but given the dialogue, who can blame them? Everyone else plods along gamely enough, and the whole thing seems to work on a ; buy these toys at your local kay bee level. I was rather dissapointed.<BR>The DVD itself is pretty good. Several deleted scenes fully completed , special effects and all. The sound on the DVD is some of the best you will find and if your good home theatre system and are a fan you'll enjoy this DVD.
B000002U9W|5.0|I didn't buy this CD from this site, I got it years ago when CD's were new, before that I owned the vinal album.<BR>No it's not there best but it's close to it.

B00008H2LB|5.0|What can i say? Ever since i picked up Hybrid Theory, i was in love with Linkin Park. I enjoyed their mixing of &quot;hip-hop&quot; and rock music together. Meteora is sort of a next-level to that. There are some songs on this CD that i can relate to (ex: &quot;Somewhere I belong&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, and &quot;Lying From You&quot;) while some i can get a bit annoyed with. (Especially from Chester's screaming voice. It's get tiring after a while) But, in the end, if you're the fan of rock music that's both in your face and has some meaning to it too, go grab Meteora. Trust me, you'll get hooked.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie is First and Foremost meant to entertain. It makes droll and not very subtle fun of several stereotypical groups of people. BUT it does so with lightness and fun and I'm sure you will be able to tell those who take themselves too seriously by their reaction to this movie. <br />I LOVED it (no, I'm not blonde, rich, super smart, gay, a society girl, trailer trash OR a lawyer)! And I'll try to tell you why I love this movie in under 1000 words. <br />Reece Witherspoon portrays Elle Woods(blonde, California college girl and fashion major just looking to get married as quick as possible to the man of her dreams) with such a deft touch that one would think she IS that girl--if they hadn't seen some of her other film work. Elle loves Warner Huntington III whose plans for the future are law school at Harvard and then politics and a \\"serious\\" minded finance/wife. Beautiful Elle doesn't fit the image, so Warner dumps her---On Valentine's Day....during dinner at a lovely restaurant....where Elle Thought he was going to propose!!  OOOOH....if there is one lesson guys should learn from this movie it is: Don't mess with a beautiful blonde on the Holy Grail of Romance Days or you could live to regret it. <br />In usual Elle fashion, she deduces that in order to 'get' her man, all she has to do is go to Harvard Law and so she proceeds to plan B. Just....Nail down an acceptable SAT, video a killer essay to Wow the admissions committee and accomplish it all without breaking a nail. Before you can say \\"Let's shop for whole new wardrobe\\" Elle is at Harvard asking for her Activities and Mixers schedule. <br />Favorite moment: When Elle gets chosen to be on Callahan's legal team for a high profile murder trial. You can practically see Elle changing from ditzy dreamer to determined achiever. <br />There are so many well crafted performers I had a harder time than usual picking favorites. However, two that really shine for me are: Jennifer Coolidge as Elle's friend and manicurist, Paulette Bonafonté and Holland Taylor's turn as Professor Stromwell. Luke Wilson was perfect for Emmett (he does 'nice, decent guy' so well) <br />Legally Blonde is an affirmation that people can generally do a lot of the things that are important to them.  And that most are capable of doing more AND better if they will just try! It's a feel good movie that I love to watch. I highly recommend it!
B00008PW3Q|1.0|This is Motown music for white people: same rockers, same ballads, same lyrics, same beat, guaranteed to convince Clinton era self-satisfied baby boomers that if they're wealthy all is right with the world. Hard to believe this band was once a well respected British Blues band in the early 70's. Of course back then, Eric Clapton hadn't turned into Perry Como, either. Anyway, that was long ago. Since the alignment with Buckingham and Nicks, this out fit went straight for the middle of the road. Along the way, Buckingham recycled ideas that were kinda cute first time through, entirely predictable 20 some years later. McVie lays down bass parts by memory, Fleetwood injects ideas that suggest there was something at the bottom of all this, and Nicks seems to have embraced the parodies of herself.<BR>Anyway, if images of Bill Clinton honking mediocre sax (and likely it was dubbed, given his penchant for inauthenticity) while FM paraded anthemic power chords over inane lyrics, make you weak with nostalgia, then this is for you. For anyone who welcomed punk's rebellion against the corporate formulaic bloated junk of the 70's, this will make you nostalgic for the vitriol of Johnny Rotten and Sid Viscious. <BR>I've seriously insulted the friend who sat me down to listen to this by sticking a safety pin someplace private, but it's the only way I can deal with this garbage. Has a nice beat, though......<BR>God Bless Christine McVie. She was the only thing about this band that had any articulate intelligence and she NEVER pandered her musical chops. As genuine an R &amp; B singer as Steve Winwood, she had the decency to bail on this project with her integrity in tact.

B00003CXI1|3.0|I left this movie when I first saw it thinking of how it was a \\"not bad\\" movie. Many of the parts of the book have been completely eliminated. The action night adventure entitled \\"The Midnight Duel\\" in the book was completely eliminated, and actually ruins the whole point of them being afraid of Filch. The scene with them rescuing the dragon was also completely eliminated. The scene in the Forbidden Forest was also  shortened. Basically, once Harry reaches Hogwarts, there are very few BIG action scenes until the end. (I'll also add that that has less action than in the book.) Nothing has been done to the action scenes to make them acceptable movie action scenes. Many of the effects are completely unbelieveable. It is almost impossible to look at that Centaur, Voldemort, or that Quidditch match and not notice how fake everything looks. Nobody acting in this movie was doing their best, espechily Harris, who's performance lacked any of the humor described in the book, but I guess the director is more to blame for that. Columbus does such a better job in Chamber that this movie looks like a complete joke in comparrison. But it was cool to watch, to see the things come to life, the wizarding world come to life, so 3 stars. I received this DVD for free. Otherwise, I wouldn't have owned it. <br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />

I contains so much information for the ear that makes some other recent productions of self-proclaimed musical visionaries cheap and plastic by comparison.<BR>This is also the first cd I purchased in months, without first auditioning it. <BR>I think that if more music artists spent more time creating real music instead of the usual [music] they put out, the industry would no be suffering as much.<BR>Listen to Peacekeeper with headphones and see how fast the song takes you out of yourself.<br />Great job guys.
B000001FKY|5.0|I am starting to get a concerned about people who rate indidvidual songs.  An album is an album and should be rated like that.  Hysteria, in my opinion, is the best album from Def Leppard, that's not to say Pyromania, High and Dry, and Retroactive aren't incredible albums, but the sum of the parts of this album make it one of the Top 5 albums to hit shelves during the 80s and Top 25 in the last 25 years of music. Hysteria redefined what rock, pop, synths, and much more could be harmonized together.  I grew up in a strict home(no rock music at all) until I was 15.  Songs like Rocket, Women, and Animal plunged me head long into a new realm of absolute pandemonium.  The entire album, I mean every song, is a good, in its entirety.  Yes, some are definately better than others, but the sum of all the songs makes this album great.

B00005QDW5|3.0|After the landmark Beatles 1 album was released to overwhelming critical acclaim, it seems that nearly every \\"classic rock\\" act has proceeded to issue its own respective compilation disc(s).  While these ensuing albums showcased bands as legendary as the Who and the Rolling Stones, the most surprising compilation to be created by this recent resurgence of 60s and 70s rock is certainly the 2 disc Echoes set by Pink Floyd.  A band that was always very album based, a compilation of any sorts seems like an odd choice for the defunct Floyd.  Thankfully though, Echoes is a \\"best of\\" as opposed to a \\"greatest hits\\" album, which greatly expands its scope, and it is also executed with great tact and care.  Gathering tracks that range in origin from 1967 all the way to 1994, the incredibly seamless flow of Echoes is inspiring, but its actual point is still shrouded in mystery.  Tracks like \\"Time\\", \\"Hey You\\", and \\"Astronomy Domine\\" are all undoubtedly classics, but removing them from the conceptual context of their respective albums does nothing more than hinder their impact.  Furthermore, the grand concepts dealt with on later Floyd albums are entirely lost when isolated to a few tracks and perhaps most disturbing of all, Echoes also fails to meet its promise of being a \\"best of\\" set.  While Floyd's best tracks are certainly a matter of opinion, it's obvious that the egos of Waters and Gilmour got in the way of Echoes original goals by including several tracks that were written long after Pink Floyd had jumped the shark.  Containing an astonishing number of tracks by Gilmour's disgraceful post-Waters \\"Pink Floyd\\", if you can call them that, and a few too many of Waters' non-musical egotistical fillers, \\"When the Tigers Broke Free,\\" \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\\" Echoes quickly changes from being just a bad idea into an actually bad album.  For a newcomer to the unique music of Pink Floyd, Echoes does not prove to be a suitable induction disc because it offers a very inaccurate, and even biased, portrait of a timeless band and for the longtime, diehard fan, Echoes is a completely unnecessary addition.  Pink Floyd were always consistently amazingly in their prime and after their final great accomplishment, The Wall, they were always consistently disappointing, so therefore, rather than buying a ... 2CD set of both good and bad Floyd material, I would recommend just buying some of the band's actual albums.  As individual CDs, Piper at the Gates of Dawn through to The Wall are all brilliant and inspired on their own terms and to try and parallel this immense wealth of creativity that Floyd presented in their work on a single flawed 2 CD set is virtually impossible.
B00005JLK1|4.0|I really thought this movie was well put together. It may not be the greatest horror ever but it certainly was entertaining (How do I class entertaining ? You can sit spellbound for an hour and a half without fidgeting). I must say that the picture and sound quality is stunning on the R1 version which I bought. The picture was really detailed considering that most of the movie was shot in low light conditions. The special effects were superb and not overly done. The score was well chosen too. To appreciate the movie to its max though, you need to watch it on a top notch 5.1 hi-fi system. There is a great deal of bonus stuff as well. You should enjoy this movie if you enjoyed House on Haunted Hill ...
B00006LI26|2.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge Helloween fan. I came to Helloween when I heard \\"I'm Alive\\" on a mix tape somewhere & I was amazed. I then went out & bought \\"The Best The Rest The Rare\\" and went on to some of thier other albums. \\"Walls of Jericho\\", thier first album, was one of my later acquisitions. While I do like the album, I can't understand how some fans can prefer Kai to Michi or Andi. His vocals alone cost this album a star. The other drawback is the immaturity of thier sound. Fans like me that came later to Helloween are used to hearing the realization of thier distinct sound, not the genesis of it. Without the unique sound that would evolve in the \\"Keeper\\" albums, there is very little in \\"Walls\\" that seperate Helloween from a lot of other bands of the era. In short, If you are a mid-eighties metal freak, you'll love this CD. If you already like Helloween, I reccomend this as a completion to your collection. If you are new to this amazing band, I reccomend that you start with \\"The Keeper of the Seven Keys II\\" or \\"The Time of the Oath\\" & go from there.
0440234743|5.0|I give this book 5 stars for a somewhat superficial reason: I found it entertaining. It was my first Grisham novel and a breath of fresh air from some heavier readings I've had. It is a page turner and the book was over before I knew it. <BR>It starts with the mystery surrounding the old man working up his will and it gives you the thirst to find out why his family deserves his malicious intent. From there, the main characters perils in the amazon are abundant, and again, you find yourself frantically flipping pages to see \\"what happens next\\". <BR>It fell short for a bit during his encounter with the pastor of the church once back in the states, but it wasn't significant enough to knock a star off the rating. <BR>I appreciate Grisham weaving in the personal battles that Nate deals with in his turbulent life , all the while embarking on his biggest challenge yet, which of course, turns out to be an epiphany. <BR>This book was easy to follow and enjoyable to the very end. And I look forward to my next Grisham book.
B00000JCOV|3.0|Look slipknot are a good band and probably are very talented, but i just find it hard to like a band who combines in their songs rap, death metal, and dj scratchings, and behinde the masks slipknot are a terrific band, and i have to admit they can really scare the hell out of me, though like other reviewers have said they are way to noisy, and they have some annoying sounds. So any way im glad i burnt this cd off a friend, and yes i listen to it sometimes, and i guess if you like rap, death metal and techno than i guess slipknot is the band for you. THANK YOU FOR READING-peace
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this album.  I have been listening to Fleetwood Mac since 1975 and I think this is the best album they have done since Rumors.  I hope to see them at the Grammys next year.
B00005QK3D|5.0|I love this CD - I personally feel that it is the ultimate evolution of the &quot;classic&quot; Helloween sound, both heavy &amp; melodic.  Number One, The Chance, Mankind, Your Turn, &amp; Kids of the Century are all amazing songs.  Mankind may even be my favorite Helloween song of all time.  Heavy Metal Hampsters is probably the only weak point, and the reason is self-evident.  I find that Helloween album reviews are often misleading, because &quot;Pink Bubbles&quot; &amp; &quot;Chamellion&quot; seem to be almost universally loathed by the headbanger contingent, but they are by far the most sophisticated and creative efforts that the band has ever had.  If you are only interested in thrash, you won't like this CD.  If you love music, this CD will make your regular rotation.
B000002GJS|5.0|I really like Bryan Adam's music so so much. I saw him in concert years ago it's been a very long long time but sure do remember how it was going to his concert the very first time I didn't saw anything like it it seems that he did put on a great show. Only one song on this cd I fell madly in love with that's to the &quot;Original Soundtrack of Robin Hood-Prince Of Thieves&quot; is &quot;Everything I Do (I Do It For You) the way he sings that song is that he has a wonderful voice! His voice is very eerie, melancholy, energetic, bright and dramatic. When he sings that song, tiny bit the instrumental part comes in when he pause for a moment, then, he goes into more of notes of his lyrics it's gonna keep doing that every entire time that he has short stop to breath in and out to catch just a tiny bit high notes-I hope he will succeed in the music business forever or probably not, and his success will never make a stop at all I give him 20 stars of doing good as pop/rock singer.
B000002HIK|5.0|theres not really enough i can say about this album<BR>it has always been the perfect album for me<BR>its strong and compelling but not invasive
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This is the Fleetwood Mac I saw onstage at the Cotton Bowl in the late 1970's.  Oh sure,  the songs have changed; but the tone, the unique, stylish flourishes are all in evidence, as if unblemished and fortunately unchanged through the decades.  I would give this CD 5 stars if it weren't for the one missing element;  Christine McVie's delicious vocals and sharp keyboards.  This is the real deal.  Fleetwood Mac fans can now rejoice in a brand new century with a fantastic new studio prize.  Excellent!
B000089A07|4.0|I would have to say that I was surprised with this film.  Anthony Hopkins give off yet another wonderful performance as Hannibal Lecter (maybe one of the freakiest characters in cinema).  Hopkins and Ed Norton led an amazing cast that included Harvey Keitel, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Emily Watson, and Ralph Fiennes.  Norton, Hopkins and Fiennes had amazing performances.<BR>The movie starts out with Hannibal helping out FBI agent Will Graham (Norton) in solving a case which involves cannibalism.  Soon Norton figures out that its Hannibal, then Will turns around only to get a knife in the liver.  With barely enough strength he picks up arrows and jams it into Hannibal and then shoots him in the shoulders and chest.  A great opening scene, good enough to get anyone interested.  Several years later Graham is visited by Keitel and decides to help the FBI with the current murder case.  From there the movie just takes off.  It might move slow at first but it picks up and turns into an intense thriller.<BR>Brett Ratner proves his directing talent.  This movie will open him up more projects.  He also has the Rush Hour movies working for him.  Overall a great movie, not as good as The Silence of the Lambs but much better than Hannibal.
B000001EKX|4.0|The second in the trifecta of KISS' classic albums again suffers from the poorly defined production, but the band again came up with a good batch of songs. The sole problem with \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" is that - like with most bands - you have a lifetime to make a first album and six months to make your second. Likely for that reason, these songs sound incomplete and forced. \\"Going Blind\\" is one such example of a song that would have probably been much better had the band had more time to spend on it.<br />That doesn't distract for the band's growing strengths...Ace was becoming an intergalactic guitar force, and Gene's dragon man personality was moving front and center in his compositions (like the sexually aggressive \\"Watching You\\"). Once again, these songs would be brought to full bloom on \\"Alive!\\" (\\"Parasite\\" and the title song the most obvious examples), but for sheer melt-the-paint-off-your-walls rock firepower, \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" continued the growing mythology that was KISS in the seventies.
B000088E6D|5.0|it takes me back to the days of my youth when my father used to listen to Frank Sinatra on the record player...and we used to dance around the living room.  I first heard this cd in Borders while browsing through some cd's...and at first I couldn't place who's voice it was that I was hearing.  Michael Buble's voice is so clear...smooth...and relaxing.  You can hear shades of old Blue Eyes when you hear him sing.  I searched high and low for the artist...and finally when I was at my wits end, I looked up and there was Michael's cd.  I turned it over to see the list of songs...and I was completely blown away.  This young whipper snapper was singing not only an eclectic list of music...he was singing it well.<br />The whole album itself is wonderful.  It is like a trip down memory lane for music lovers...especially lovers of big band, swing and jazz.  &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Moondance&quot;, &quot;The Way you Look Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Summer Wind&quot;,  are true shades of Blue Eyes himself.  <br />But the other songs, remakes of more recent songs, like Queen's &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; and the Bee Gees &quot;How Can you mend a Broken Heart&quot;...are surprising little treasures.  He makes these songs his own...with his own unique style.<br />You can also see Paul Anka's influence on this album with Michael's rendition of &quot;Put Your Head on My Shoulder&quot;.  It is a remake of a classic love song...but done with a contemporary flare...and it sounds great.<br />I can honestly say that there aren't any bad songs on this cd.  It has something that has been missing from many cd's put out today...quality.  Michael's voice, the selection of songs, the arrangement of vocals and music...all make this album complete and a joy to listen to.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've never written a review for Amazon before but I have to reply to the two aberrations already posted on the site.<BR>This is the dramatisation of the US Army's 101st Airborne Division wartime exploits in WWII. It neither trivialises nor glorifies any aspect of this conflict.<BR>It focuses on 'Easy' Company, beginning with their training in England; their deployment on D-day; their crucial involvement in the Ardennes, on to the ultimate fall of Nazi Germany.<BR>It shows the soldiers as real people, not as caricatures as the other reviewers stated. We see their fears, hopes and failures. I thought the series was brilliantly acted by a largely unknown cast, the only actor that was instantly recognisable to me was David Schwimmer (Friends) as the hapless Captain Herbert Sobel.<BR>Before each episode we see a prologue where the ACTUAL men involved give an insight into different aspects of their experiences. This impressed me as we not only get see a dramatised (for example) Capt. Winters but also get to see the real man. I think this went a long way to convincing me of the accuracy of the series. I doubt these men would have been involved if it were \\"just another american war movie\\" described by the other reviewers.<BR>I watched it TV & couldn't wait for the DVD release which is excellently presented in its own metal box.<BR>I thoroughly recommended this release and before anyone posts any similar reviews to the other two, they should remember that if it wasn't for these men and their 'Band of Brothers' none of us would have the freedom of speech to belittle their sacrifice.
B00008977N|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Peter Gabriel's stuff but he sure makes some poor decisions with reguard to video representation.  This package, like P.O.V. before it, fails in many ways to present the show to the fan. <BR>    The Secret World Tour was a stunner of a show in the arenas, I saw it four times.  This package really doesn't capture the essence of the show that well.  I have to admit that I have only seen the video version of the last half of this show twice.  Once when I mistakenly purchased a Pay-Per-View package on cable for the Woodstock II performance ( which shamelessly cheated viewers out of the first half of the show for what I suspect were business reasons) and the other time on a TV  freeview I stumbled apon the other night.  Of the parts I saw, I really don't feel compelled to see the rest.  What I did see was way too many extreem close ups of the faces of; PG and his band: Tony Leven, David Rhodes, Paula Cole, Papa Wemba(I think), Rabbie Shankar, Manu Katch.  All these wonderful expert musicians and all we get are close ups of their faces!  What about their instuments? What about the skill of the musician?  Tony Leven is one of the most respected and awe inspiring bass players on the planet Earth, and all they can do is show his face?  Odd editing choice to say the least.<BR>    The performance lacks some other subtleties as well.  During Digging In The Dirt PG uses an elaborate head gear video camera to project an image onto a screen behind him, it was an effect that was wonderful in concert because it was obvious to the audience that the image on the screen behind was captured in real-time and instantly projected for the crowd on hand. And it was very strange to look at PG wearing the alien looking head gear, juxtaposed with the image it produced.  However, very little of this was captured because the directors of the DVD and video really only show the projected image with very little visual information as to why it is there and what we are seeing.  In short the head gear worn by PG was part of the image behind him.  To only show the projected image misses the point dramatically.<BR>    All this \\"tarting up\\" of sound quality, (as Steve Hackett calls it), and as referenced by another review or two, is a bummer, I would like to see and hear a concert as it was performed THAT night.  To remove that element is a gross misjudgment of my intelegence as a music lover and fan.  I don't want another studio album I wanted a live show  in a video presentation, P.O.V. made the same mistakes only that time by adding MTV style video elements that were not very interesting and only served as a distraction and annoyance.  Like PG isn't interesting enough on his own.<BR>    Peter Gabriel is one of the most interesting performers in Rock Music today, and I will always watch what he is doing and probably purchase it too. Perhaps he is so big and busy a talent that he has lost control of his scene a bit.  To the producers of this package and the one before it, I can only ask one thing;  <BR>What was it you were thinking of?
B00005JKHN|4.0|The title has just been released in Mexico in DVD and I bought it as soon as I knew it was available. This is my favourite classic Disney movie and was expecting that all the extras would be treated in the same way as in Snow White or Beauty and the Beast, but was very dissapointed. Most of the \\"Extras\\" are just plain text and the menu in the second disc is very plain, nothing to talk about.<br />The images are very clear and the sound very good, that's the least Disney could do for its very first movie in stereo.
B000009PNY|4.0|The biggest mistake fans make is to rate covers only against the original song. The CD should not just be compared to the prior band but enjoyed on its own merits too. I admit if you've heard the song before, it's hard to enjoy a bad version of it. But, everyone agrees there are gems on this album and while they don't like the same songs, the album is a nice listening experience. Some of the songs are a little bland but still enjoyable, while a few are a bit jarring.<br />My personal favorites: to me these songs make the CD worthy of purchase. The track by God Lives Underwater is very dark and [sultry], with a compelling chorus. Failure's is smooth yet edgy, and The Cure gives us a dark and heavy rock song.<br />Good/interesting ones: Meat Beat Manifesto is a good one, with a strong beat and well blended music. Gus Gus has a funky beat and builds up slowly, paired with a far-away female voice. Monster Magnet was dark and moody, Dishwalla's Policy of Truth was smooth and easy to listen to. Rammstein's version of Stripped has an energetic, industrial feel I enjoyed. While I'm not a fan of heavy music, it was enough upbeat to enjoy. The somewhat sweet lyrics paired with heavy beat made an interesting combo. <br />Lacking something: Smashing Pumpkins felt a little flat compared to their normal work. The Veruca Salt track had sweet vocals but it lacked humor. <br />Uneven songs: Self did a playful song ruined by a terrible and sluggish chorus. Locust's Master and Servant was done to lounge music and is lacking the original's brilliant, dark edge. Rabbit in the Moon's vocals and music seemed badly paired at first. It came upbeat midway through and turned into an enjoyable song. <br />Not my favorites: Apollo 440 was jarring and loud, with random yelling in the background. (Maybe I don't like industrial punk enough?) Deftones had some very heavy bass guitar and felt too noisy (sorry, Deftones fans.)
B00007KWHO|2.0|Yes is one of those bands that doesn't age very well.  Pompous and arty, with not much of a beat.  Jon Anderson's voice is pretty annoying too. Even the pop songs like Sweet Dreams are pretty much unlistenable.  If you are into exploring the relationship of man and the universe or fathers and sons with dimestore philosophy and dramatic organ music, or need something to listen to while you are playing dungeons and dragons by all means get this record.  Otherwise stay away from it!
B000063UR1|2.0|I liked this movie when it was first released to the theatres in the 1970s.  I thought a revisit on DVD would bring back some of those fond memories, but, sadly, the film looks very dated.'<br />Forget the premise - it's pure enviro-fiction.  Think about it for a minute: the planet earth has no more forests, trees, deserts - no wilderness left.  We had to put all our critical environments in pods and orbit Jupiter with them (why Jupiter?  why not orbit Earth?).<br />This very Asimovian premise falls on its face in light of science: since green plants give us the oxygen we need, a planet devoid of all green plants would be a dead planet - there would be no oxygen-breathing life on it.<br />OK.  Let's say, though, that the radical environmental movement has succeesed in numbing your sense of reason - the film still fails in its scripting, which is needlessly whiny.  Bruce Dern gives a rather egalitarian performance as the tree-hugger, which doesn't help to lend credibility to his cause.<br />Some of the effects still hold up, but overall the film has that shaky, matted look of cheesy 70s sci-fi (even STAR WARS has that look).<br />The most interesting thing about the DVD is the Special Features, and the documentaries on the making of the film.  Once I finished with those, I had nothing more interesting to watch.
0805062971|5.0|This is not the easiest book to read.  It has a brilliant or at least odd idea on every page, and if you want to get the most out of it, you'll have to put it down and think about it more than a few times.  It's philosophy disguised as throwaway pop culture, it is a new use of the written word and it is, in my humble opinion, brilliant.  The only other novel that I've ever read that matches it's style is We All Fall Down by Brian Caldwell.  It's a Figh Club like take on the Christian apocalypse and it struck me as very similar to Fight Club in it's depth of ideas and density of insight.  Both Palahniuk and Caldwell are a new breed of writer's who seem to be building on what's been done before rather than simply re-hashing it.
B0000683DH|5.0|After the motion picture debut of Star Trek received mixed reviews from fans and critics alike, hardcore Trekkies responded immediately to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan with overwhelming glee.  This is the character driven Trek that fans longed for, and finally got.  This installment (which also began the trend of the even numbered Treks being better) finds the newly promoted Admiral Kirk at odds with an old nemesis (no pun intended) in Khan (Ricardo Montalban) who is seeking revenge on Kirk and his crew.  The special effects were way ahead of their time, the acting is fantastic (Montalban especially), and the battles between starships epic, most of which are thanks to director Nicholas Meyer who would play a much larger hand in the future of the Star Trek universe.  A young Kirstie Alley appears in her first film role as a young vulcan lieutenant being mentored by Spock.  This Director's Edition DVD is worth noting as well; it is beyond everything Paramount's original full list price DVD had in terms of extras (in the latter's case, zilch), and, just like the rest of the Director's Edition films in the Trek series, is more than worth owning if you've ever considered yourself a Trek fan.
B00007KWHN|3.0|One of my favorite records when I was in 10th grade, this, like everything else Yes did, doesn't hold up very well.  The lyrics are just too stupid. I'm not sure that any of it has been done better elsewhere, but Starship Trooper?  How pretentious can you get?  Admittedly, there are a couple decent songs on here - - &quot;I've Seen All Good People etc.&quot; is an OK and melodic hippie song, and I always liked the synthesiser riff on &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot; because it was used back in the early 80's as the introduction for Channel 2 news in Atlanta.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Fleetwood Mac's first new album in many years is an admirable accomplishment, given the absence of long-time member Christine McVie and a long-time hiatus from recording. The material on \\"Say You Will\\" is stronger and more consistent than on the band's 1980's albums \\"Mirage\\" and \\"Tango In the Night,\\" and the chemistry between Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham continues to spark. Buckingham remains a better Producer and Guitarist than he is a Singer/Songwriter but he is clearly inspired on \\"Peacekeeper\\" and \\"What's the World Coming To.\\" Nicks' last solo album, \\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\" was excellent and she continues that trend here. Since she quit smoking in the 1990's her vocal range has improved considerably and her songwriting is pretty consistent. The album's gems are \\"Running Thru the Garden\\" (an extraordinary Nicks performance) and the title track (the first time a Nicks song has been a FM title track). Stevie's \\"Illume 911\\" is supposed to be about the day America was attacked but the lyrics are too oblique to make much of an impression.
B000002LMK|5.0|Being a big Neil Young fan, I picked up this album.  I had heard that it is some of his best work, and arguably his heaviest.  When I heard the album, it turned out that everything I heard about it was true.<br />Neil Young & Crazy Horse have always been the best garage band imaginable since their first album together, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.  This album is full of raw songs, many extending past the 5-minute mark.  Some of Neil's best lead guitar-playing ever can be found here.  Ragged Glory is chock full of great songs and garage jams.<br />The album's opener, \\"Country Home,\\" could have worked very well as a country song, likewise \\"White Line,\\" the song that follows.  But here, they are transformed into rocking, raw, grunge tunes with everyone in the band, especially Neil, kicking serious butt.  \\"Mansion On the Hill\\" is sure to be included on the next Neil Young retrospective.  Only these guys can take a simple 3-chord riff and do something with it.  This was the single release from the album, and it's easy to see why, as it is easily the catchiest tune on the record.  \\"F*!#in' Up\\" is pure Neil Young angst, with all four boys rocking hard and playing their hearts out.  The two songs that pass the 10-minute mark, \\"Love To Burn\\" and \\"Love And Only Love\\" are classic epic Neil Young, much like \\"Down By The River\\" and \\"Cowgirl In the Sand\\" from Everybody Knows..., and \\"Cortez the Killer\\" and \\"Dangerbird\\" from Zuma.  \\"Love to Burn\\" is based on a chord progression somewhat reminiscent of his recent hit \\"Rocking In the Free World,\\" though not a blatant copy.  Both \\"Love\\" songs contain awesome guitar playing from Neil.  The album's closer, \\"Mother Earth (Natural Anthem)\\" is taken from a live recording, and recalls Jimi Hendrix's classic treatment of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" from Woodstock.  Though I have never heard the original \\"Farmer John,\\" I am willing to bet my bottom dollar that the cover found here blows the original out of the water.<br />Ragged Glory isone of the few albums I know that lives up to its title.  Recorded in a barn on Neil's ranch, mostly live with very few overdubs, There are definitely some ragged sounds here, but Neil & the Horse definitely achieve glory here.  The album is true ragged glory.  Recommended to any Neil Young fan, any grunge fan, or any rock fan.  There is no doubt that everyone who hears it will enjoy a great deal.  It will stand the test of time, just as Neil's earlier work has, and will be loved and enjoyed for a long time to come.<br />5/5
B00005JKHP|3.0|Director Robert Wise (West Side Story) got to helm this big screen adaption of the classic sci-fi show, and while it's certainly not the best in the series, it would only pave the way for some of the best science fiction films ever made to follow.  Captain James T. Kirk and his crew are reunited on a newly modeled Enterprise and soon encounter an entity known as V'Ger which (naturally) threatens the galaxy.  The plot has bits and pieces from old Star Trek episodes, and hardcore Trekkies balked at many a moment in the film (especially those bland Starfleet uniforms, good God...), but in the end Star Trek: The Motion Picture is still a good hearted sci-fi film that went on to be a phenominal hit (and spawned numerous sequels and spin off TV series).  This Director's Edition of the film includes some extra footage which actually helps the film make more sense, and the DVD itself is one of the few DVD's worth paying Paramount's full list price for (Paramount is famous for overpricing their DVD's and including no extras whatsoever other than a trailer) and the extras will keep Trekkies (young and old) entertained for days.  All in all, if your a hardcore Trek fan, than you most likely already have this, but if you don't give it a look.
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay delivers an excellent follow-up to their critically acclaimed &quot;Parachutes&quot; with 2002's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. What i liked about this album was its ability to draw you into the music. The entire album is very listenable, and just when you get tired of one song, it ends and the 2nd songs starts up. Never surpassing their ability, Coldplay goes to their limits as a band and produces a very solid album that is indestructible to critics. Sure you might get the sell-out fan who doesnt understand what real music is, but if you dont like RUSH, you honestly cannot hear. All tracks are along the same level of quality, with Politik, Clocks, &amp; A Rush of Blood to The Head as the tracks i would say have single potential. All are very good however. The band was right in saying that there was no need to make another album after this due to the fact that this is about as good of an album as they could ever release. Don't expect super-hit sounding songs like their ever-famous &quot;Yellow&quot; but at the same time dont expect boring-bland songs either. In fact the only song that i had any objection to (and the reason for the 4 stars) is the albums first single, &quot;In My Place&quot;, which although has an excellent guitar-riffed beginning, but after that sinks into a pointless bland ballad. If they kept the song and changed the lyrics and maybe the chorus it would be better, but all in all, not a horribly bad song. <br />In conclusion, it would be a good buy. In a marketplace right now where there are hardly any decent cd's being released, its refreshing that some bands still got it straight.
006092988X|5.0|This book was truly wonderful. Written with beautiful yet poignant and clear language, this book is breathtaking. Following the life of Francie Nolan as she overcomes basically everything--poverty, harrassment, broken hearts--this is a great classic for everyone! I highly reccommend you read this book! Buy it!
B000002I2G|4.0|When this album was released, it split the Doors fan base right down the middle. You either loved the experimentation with horns and strings (plus untried musical styles), or you demanded they `cut out the crap' and repeat the first two albums ad nauseum. Hopefully, time has allowed for SOFT PARADE to be given a reappraisal. To my mind, the weak tracks are not the ones touched by horns and string; whenever they appear, they do nothing but good for they track they're on. True, this is the weakest Doors studio album, but it can still stand proudly with other 1969 releases such as ABBEY ROAD, BAYOU COUNTRY, and LET IT BLEED. So put it in your stereo and travel happily back to the time when the Doors of experimentation were well and truly open.<br />TELL ALL THE PEOPLE - Almost hymn like opener written by Robbie Krieger with horns and Krieger's guitar blending well. Jim Morrison was uneasy about this track because he didn't want to sing about anybody following him as a guru-figure; something that unfortunately has come to pass since his death in 1971.<br />TOUCH ME - First single released from the album. When Krieger brought this song to the group, he jokingly called it HIT ME, after the problems he was having in his love life at the time. Morrison wisely told him to change the title. Jim sings very romantically and again, the horns lend a nice touch with sonny Rollins adding a blistering sax solo to the song's climax.<BR>With offbeat Morrison humour, Jim slips in a line from a detergent commercial in the dying seconds:\\" Stronger than dirt.\\" <br />SHAMAN'S BLUES - A musical link to the first two albums, this is full of Morrison's strong poetic imagery and off centre spoken adlibs. The keyboards by Ray Manzarek really come to the fore here, as Krieger puts forth some tasty blues licks. The line `cold grinding grizzly bear jaws hot on your heels' still sends a shiver down my spine every time I listen to this track.<br />DO IT - A filler track that exhorts the children tochange the world; something that has been expressed better in countless other songs. The band seems confused; their playing, a little scattershot. Jim sounds bored.<br />EASY RIDE - This tune gallops along at a canter with some brilliant zipping axework by Krieger and some playful lyrics by Jim: \\"The mask that you wore, my fingers would explore.\\"<br />WILD CHILD - This is the Doors at full power: hypnotic, sensual, dark, mysterious and dangerous. Drummer John Densmore raps out an almost military beat and Morrison's lyrics are the best on the album. The kicker is the spoken climax: \\"Do you remember when we were in Africa?\\"<br />RUNNIN' BLUE - A bluegrass hoedown tribute to Otis Redding (!) co-sung by Jim and Robbie (and after you listen to this track you'll know why he did not sing again until the Morrison-less albums OTHER VOICES and FULL CIRCLE!).Sorry but this track doesn't quite jell for me.<br />WISHFUL SINFUL - Beautiful ballad, with orchestra lending flavour and Jim at his most mellow. This track should be on all the greatest hits packages.<br />THE SOFT PARADE - A multi part epic in the vein of THE END, CELEBRATION OF THE LIZARD, and WHEN THE MUSIC'S OVER. The band plays boogie in one section, then bouncy the next, before settling in to a slinky and evil rhythm. Near the end several Morrisons arise from the mix to confront us before vanishing once again.
6305841861|5.0|Honestly, I don't know really WHERE this movie fits in the story of the Evil Dead/Army of Darkness trilogy, but it is there.  It is technically the second movie, but it is kind of a remake of the firt, tying it in with the third (and better), Army of Darkness.  Bruce Campbell is the man.  A dramatic actor with great talent, especially for these types of movies.  The gore is, of course, overdone, but that's the point of the movies.  This is a FUN movie, not oen that you really have to think about too much.  I HIGHLY recommend it.
B00008MNYS|3.0|Although Escapology is a great release Internationally, the repackaging of this album and the absence of several potential hits (and stand out tracks) like Hot Fudge and Cursed make me wonder what Virgin Records was thinking when they took them off the album. Past that however, Escapology represents even more of a musical evolution than ever experienced between previous releases. Although this isnt necessarily a &quot;radio friendly&quot; disc, it does make for a good listen, and will stay in your cd players for a while. If you have never heard the international version of the album then you will be satisfied, but my opionion would be to buy the import. All in all, Escapology is just Robbie recovering from having a full orchestra in Swing When Your Winning. Most of Escapology's tracks are very organic sounding and rely more on his voice than the music, which is okay, but just a total 180 turn from his last couple of releases. Hes not afraid to drop the F-word and cuss his heart out, so i guess its still robbie now isnt it. I would buy it, but take caution, Escapology is Robbie like you have never heard him before.
B000063WDH|5.0|If you're at all remotely a fan of the White Stripes, you will absolutely LOVE the Black Keys.  This band puts the &quot;Rock&quot; back in rock n roll. Set amidst this resurgence of garage rock, the Black Keys sets themselves apart by bringing a tight blues edge to their music. Even more so, this duo of guitar and drums create an enormous sound that would blow any 4 to 5 piece rock band clearly out of the water.<br />I'm not much of a White Stripes fan, the percussion is loose and over simplified, I find the guitar and melody to be a bit hollow.  So, if you're at all mildly impressed with the White Stripes, but not completely convinced, give the Black Keys a &quot;go&quot; and they'll win you over full-force.
B000000OAC|5.0|By 1977, Punk was in full bloom in England and bands like Queen were seen as overblown and pompous by certain 'rock critics' and the punks themselves. In answer to the brickbats, Queen toned down the extravagances of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and A DAY AT THE RACES to show to the waiting world that they could move through the punk storm unscathed. (As a matter of fact as they were recording NEWS OF THE WORLD, Freddie Mercury had an encounter with the Sex Pistols 'bassist', Sid Vicious. The dialogue went something like this: SID: \\"Oi, Fred! So you're bringing ballet to the masses, then?\\" FREDDIE: \\"Ah, Mr Ferocious! We all try our best, dear!\\"). NEWS proved that Queen was a lot of substance that could work without a lot of flash. There is a welcome `raw' feel to the album that would carry onto their next album, JAZZ.<br />WE WILL ROCK YOU - Now known as THE anthem in every arena (music and sports) in the world. The mixture of handclaps, footstomping and Brian May's guitar marries well with Freddie Mercury's brutal vocal about a professional agitator who treads the same line unto death. The moment that May's guitar starts bleeding into the mix is pure rock magic.<br />WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS - The OTHER arena classic. A ballad with superb Mercury intonation. When this single was released, some 'rock critics' took exception to the pomposity of the lyrics with realising the tongue in cheek attitude that was visibly present. Queen never did take themselves too seriously; that was the whole point, to entertain you and do it well.<br />SHEER HEART ATTACK - Fast and furious riffing from May compliment the angry lyrics and vocals from drummer Roger Taylor (Freddie would sing this track live) in this direct challenge to the British punk band of the time,\\" TAKE THAT!\\" The highlight of the track for me is near the end where Brian coaxes sonic bleeps out of his homemade guitar (made out of a fireplace, no less!) and Roger travels all over his drum kit in a short, but unbelievable solo.<br />ALL DEAD, ALL DEAD - Piano ballad sung by Brian, about the death of a love affair, with soft bass backing by John Deacon.<br />SPREAD YOUR WINGS - A track that should have been a bigger hit than it was. A tale about Sammy, a loner who works at the Emerald Bar and yearns for something better, much to the disapproval of his boss. Great axework by May and uplifting vocals from Mercury. <br />FIGHT FROM THE INSIDE - Guitar funk sung well by Roger, who has regularly given great vocal performances on Queen albums. John Deacon's funky little bass work spices the track nicely.<br />GET DOWN, MAKE LOVE - The most erotic Queen song ever. This is their WHOLE LOTTA LOVE, complete with spacey middle section. All band members are firing on full cylinders.<br />SLEEPING ON THE SIDEWALK - A Brain May blues song about a player who has a hit on the charts but finds things get rocky for there on. Great sing along chorus saves a slight May vocal.<br />I DON'T NEED YOU - A Spanish guitar flavours this great 'kiss off' song. Mercury obviously relishes giving this lover his/her walking papers.<br />IT'S LATE - An epic tale; three 'acts' about three different couples in three verses.All three couples are suffering the breakdown of their loves or are very confused by the whole business. This is Queen at their 'rockiest' with the jam session at the end of the track is a pure joy to listening too; all four let go in the feeling of the music and send the track on home.<br />MELANCHOLY BLUES - An English version of the sad saloon songs that Ol' Blue Eyes made popular. Freddie has ended the party sober and in a blue funk because his baby has left him. Restrained vocals and a 'late-night piano jazz' arrangement makes this track a fine way to end this album.
B000002NJS|5.0|Summary: Cohesive, textured, intricate, deep and yet oh so fun to sing and dance to! Madonna really did it this time in 1998 when Ray of Light was released. Like many fans in the mid-1990s, I was beginning to lose interest in the Queen of Pop. Like many pop artists at the time, Madonna began to sound sadly generic. With a couture chameleon like Madonna, it should be second nature to play with an audience and take them on a roller-coaster ride of different &quot;identities&quot; all the while maintaining a signature presence in one's music and art. However, on her preceding 1994 album &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;, it started to become painfully clear that Madonna was becoming very much UNclear of who she was. I, like most fans, did not like the course she was heading down. Of course, this had much to do with the fact that she worked with multiple producers on the &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; album. What can a pop artist do when &quot;Pop&quot; becomes a dirty word? Simple: be uncategorizable. With Ray of Light, she returned with a cohesive, well-assembled record worthy of all the high praise it garnered in 1998 on the charts and at the Grammy Awards. William Orbit breathed new life into her career. And of course, the return of Patrick Leonard is always a welcomed sight on any Madonna Record. All in all..... a very solid album. Though the album spawned five hit singles (Frozen, Ray of Light, The Power of Goodbye, Nothing Really Matters, Drowned World), it is the non-commercial tracks that really deserve attention. Highlights of the record: &quot;To Have And Not To Hold&quot;, &quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot;, &quot;Skin&quot;, &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;. If you're looking for an album that will tire of you before you tire of it..... look no more.
B000069HKH|4.0|Singer/songwriters, especially male s/s are really and utterly not my cup of tea. I knew about Bruce (who doesn't?), and I never really liked what I heard - you know, \\"Born in the USA\\" and all that. I thought I never would like stuff like this, I had already dismissed him and others of his ilk completely. But, as fate would have it, my ex mistakenly got this one from a CD club, and she handed it over to me. I told her I was not really interested, but she said she just din't want it. I figured, hey, let's give it a spin. Guess what? I loved it! The simplicity of it, the emotion - it all grabbed me unexpectedly. Maybe it was a welcome breath of simple air after all the avant-Jazz, Death Metal, Goth and other relentlessly non-mainstream music that I am constantly listening to. And, for the record, I knew he was alluding to sept.11, but that is not the reason I like it, not at all. Just the music itself, and the emotion of the vocals are enough, no matter what the theme. But, thankfully, the lyrics are not ultra-obvious - they subtly allude to the events, but from a deeply personal perspective, a perspective of human relationships, not a political one at all. What I learned is that from now on, no matter how uninterested I might seem with an artist, I will not say anything until I really get the chance to at least listen to a whole album. I never actively disliked Bruce, but I never thought I would actually like his music. Never say never again.
B000000OAN|5.0|Carrying on from the groundbreaking SHEER HEART ATTACK album, Queen went into the studio with Roy Thoms Baker to make the best album of their lives. Happily for all of us they succeeded. There are no fillers tracks on OPERA; and this time they were experimenting with more musical styles. Each member gets the chance to shine. Oh, and there was this little throwaway track called BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY . . . ever hear that one before? <br />DEATH ON TWO LEGS (DEDICATED TO) - Dedicated to a rat of a former manager, this album opener begins with some tasty piano trills before a heavy metal storm is unleashed courtesy of guitarist Brian May. The storm finally breaks into a piano and guitar led rocker that has venom at its core. If they never see this guy again alive, it'll be too soon for them.<BR>Concert favourite from the mid seventies to the early eighties.<br />LAZYING ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON - Freddie Mercury does Noel Coward, and does him to a tee. Mercury always had an affinity with early twentieth century British music as tracks like this and GOOD OLD FASHIONED LOVERBOY prove. May's lead axework fits right into the mix.<br />I'M IN LOVE WITH MY CAR - Drummer Roger Taylor's tribute to a racing car buddy (Taylor being an enthusiast himself). This slow paced rocker became Roger's signature tune in concert.<br />YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND - Hit written by bassist John Deacon. This is a perfect song for lovers who are also each other's best friend. Great keyboard work by Mercury and harmony guitar by May.<br />'39 - Tale written and sung by Brian. Acoustic guitar works well, with a little lead guitar fretwork thrown in and superb harmony vocals. Sung live by Freddie and included in an `unplugged' segment (See? Queen were trendsetters; and not just in killer videos!)<br />SWEET LADY - Rocker straight out of Led Zepplin's books about a lady who is anything but `sweet'. In the midst of massive production, Queen could still rock hard.<br />SEASIDE RENDEVOUS - A huge slice of English `camp', courtesy of Mr Fredrick Mercury. Not only do we get witty Noel Coward lyrics and delivery, we also get barbershop harmonies and short tap-dancing lesson!<br />THE PROPHET SONG - Epic that is a showcase for Brian May's fretwork, this suffers by being of on the same album as BOHEMIAN RAPSODY. Stellar harmonies throughout and brilliant riffs abound.<br />LOVE OF MY LIFE - Beautiful ballad that would reach legendary proportions us a concert audience participation number. Although nice here, it reaches it's true potential on LIVE KILLERS.<br />GOOD COMPANY - Jaunty Brian May sung number, with more than a dash of ukulele thrown into the mixture for good measure.<br />BOHEMIAN RAPSODY - What can be said about this track that hasn't been sent before? Pure brilliance. Deserves the title: `Epic'. When Queen gave a test pressing of the song to English DJ Kenny Everett and told him not to play it, he `accidentally' dropped the needle on the record about ten times or more! `Nuff said!<br />GOD SAVE THE QUEEN - A fitting end to the best Queen album ever; this would become the concert closer as well. Brian May played this at the `other' Queen's tribute last year.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I just want to say that this was one of the best purchases I have ever made. HBO has done a teriffic job in bringing home the emotions that were felt by those who fought in world war II. Thank you
B00000DC10|5.0|Yes, I too was much dismayed upon hearing that Refused had disbanded shortly after this albums release, but then thought, did they have a choice?  This album covers so much musical territory so successfully that I don't know what they could have done to top it, hence, any follow up would have been a disapointment.  I have read some reviewers suggestions that if one wants &quot;real&quot; punk they should listen to the Germs, Black Flag, OpIvy, etc.  These people have clearly ignored the title which professes to be the shape of punk TO COME, not that HAS COME BEFORE.  If for some reason you have decided to compartmentalize your muscial interests and consider yourself a &quot;hardcore or punk&quot; fan you will love this album.  However, if you are a fan of truly well crafted and powerful music, regardless of genre, you MUST add this album to your music library.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I am sure I am one of very few who disliked this movie.  The singing was barely passable, the acting mediocre, and the plot one of the corniest of our time.  What did Moulin Rouge have going for it?  A killer soundtrack and great use of colour.  So, allow me to elaborate.<BR>The singing was all wrong.  Ewan McGregor hasn't any talent at all, forcing his falsetto to the max and making it dreadful.  Nicole Kidman has about as much ability in phrasing as I do in my pinkie finger.  <BR>Kidman can act, as can McGregor, so where was there talent through Moulin Rouge.  I think they were so concerned about masking their poor singing they downplayed their acting talent.  A shame really, as this is what these two persons are first and foremost.  <BR>The plot was so incredibly hokey.  Boy loves girl; girl loves boy; fakes it.  Does anybody else see Aida revamped into a big-screen colourful display of trashy outfits with contemporary songs?  I would say that the plot became too ornate and took away from the movie.  So much of it was not needed.  Why Nicole Kidman's character sickness?  Like in Aida it is presented to prove true love . . . that should have been forced infront of much of the other plot as it is an intrical part.  <BR>I enjoyed the colour used, it definetly stated what the Moulin Rouge was all about.  The extreme close-up shots were annoying and far too frequent.  The use of contemporary music was intriguing . . . it actually helped the plot come along.  I made a game of it to see how many I could named.  The use of music in a movie can really express a character in a way he or she cannot express verbally or physically . . . the music chosen somewhat accomplished this.<BR>As stated before, I know I am in the minority but, this is my opinion.  This movie had a lot of potential, and it failed.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Nobody was more excited about the prospect of a new Fleetwood Mac album in 2003 than me, so even if the Mac put out a relatively \\"bad\\" album, it would still have been alright because it is \\"The Mac,\\" as I have always known and loved them.  But if they had put out a phenomenal album, and if they garnered a new generation of admirers as well as the commercial success they so richly deserve, I would have been downright ecstatic.  That said, I am very happy if not exactly ecstatic about the new album.<br />New albums by superstar rock artists entering the fourth or fifth (as is the case with the Mac) decades of their careers are not entirely scarce.  Bands like CSN(Y), Yes, Boston, and the Rolling Stones continue to issue [bad] albums that usually prove to do little more than to tarnish their bodies of work and provide excuses to go on nostalgia tours.  Then there are the rarer veteran artists who continue to create relevant, challenging music- like Joni Mitchell, Steely Dan, Patti Smith, etc.  With \\"Say You Will,\\" I can rest assured that the Mac belongs in the latter category rather than the former.  This newest album has drawn comparisons to the Mac's legendary 70's output such as \\"Rumours\\" or \\"Tusk.\\"  But those comparisons miss the point entirely.  As brilliant as \\"Rumours\\" was, it was a by-product of the lite-FM California sound at the time.  \\"Tusk\\" was Lindsey Buckingham's reaction to punk and new wave.  I can say with confidence that \\"Say You Will\\" seems to exist in its own timespace that stands apart from everything they have done in the past.  While obviously taking cues from contemporary music and the Mac formula of triumphs past, on \\"Say You Will\\" Lindsey pushes the envelope in terms of production and arrangement.  There is not a producer/musician/songwriter today who can create the orchestra of guitars that Lindsey has painstakingly framed around each of these songs.  And where past Mac efforts may have sounded a bit too sweet or overproduced, \\"Say You Will\\"contains enough of a raw edge and space that keeps it from being too comfortable.<br />While the production and sonic texture push the envelope musically, the material is sometimes not up to par.  Where Lindsey has been a solid, if not particularly profound songwriter in the past, his newest compositions are either very generic (\\"Miranda\\") or very abstract/impressionistic.  There are quirky moments that actually work, such as \\"Red Rover,\\" which is a fragmented sketch of a song, but is salvaged by Lindsey's layered production and virtuoso guitar technique.  But other songs like \\"Murrow...\\" seem self-indulgent and unfocused.<br />Stevie Nicks's contributions also run the gamut from solidly sublime (\\"Say You Will,\\" \\"Thrown Down\\") to subpar (\\"Everybody Finds Out,\\" \\"Silver Girl\\").  But Nicks does manage to knock it out of the ballpark completely with the propulsive 80's rocker \\"Running Through the Garden,\\" which is perhaps the strongest Nicks vocal since her \\"Rock a Little\\" days.  Another song that gets better upon repeated listening is \\"Destiny Rules,\\" with its haunting backing vocal arrangements and sparse arrangement.  In general, Nicks's voice seems to have rebounded somewhat from the years of drug abuse and smoking.  But her croaky, sheepish lower register is problematic.  As such, some of her songs could have benefitted from a key change a couple of full steps higher.<br />In summary, this is a full, challenging, satisfying effort from the Mac.  It is certainly not their best effort as a group, but it is definitely superior to their recent solo outings.  As the old saying goes, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  If there is any justice in the world, this album will attract a new generation of listeners and sell a bazillion copies.  But the main hurdle to that is the fact that it is simply too bold for total mainstream acceptance and does not feature any duets with Justin Timberlake and Michelle Branch.
B00008MNYS|5.0|As a long time fan of Mr. Williams, I can finally say I am proud of dear Robbie. After a slightly dissapointing Sing When Your Winning, Escapology is like a breath of fresh air. Ranging from mellow acoustic sounds (Nan's Song), to crazy rock tracks with gritty lyrics (Cursed), Escapology is like a well polished eclectic mix of true Robbie. Stuffed full of his overinflated ego, humor, and what seems to be a cynical or broken heart, Robbie gives us the Robbie we've come to love, but with an edge. How Peculiar carries off an Oasis like sound, but the gorgeous originality of Mariachi like Me And My Monkey made up for it well. It seems dear ol' Rob has matured, writing lyrically-amazing songs from a torn, pessimistic soul (Monsoon), but retains that lovable bouncy cheekiness we love (Hot Fudge). How does he do it? Or more importantly, how can we resist? <BR>I couldn't help it, once I let this record spin a few times I felt my self falling in love with Mr. Williams all over again. Definatly a winner.
0060537639|3.0|This fascinating but flawed book expounds the thesis that Chinese fleets explored most of the world decades before Europeans voyaged to the Americas (according to the author, explorers such as Columbus already knew the Americas were there because they had access to maps based on Chinese records).  Menzies even argues that Chinese colonies were planted in the Americas, disappearing from view as they mingled with indigenous populations.<BR> <BR>In his personal quest, Menzies has accumulated a vast amount of circumstantial evidence in support of his theory, attaching to it the interpretations most supportive of his argument.  Some of this evidence is persuasive, but much of it is only suggestive.  Nonetheless, the sheer weight of evidence will cause most readers to conclude that there is some truth to Menzies' thesis, at least enough to warrant more professional research. That makes one wonder why Western historians  have ignored or dismissed the evidence for centuries.  And how much history is unknown to us because political decisions dictated the destruction of records, as was the case in Ming China.  At the very least, this book should provoke a re-evaluation of Chinese influence on the West before the age of European expansion. <br />Menzies continues to pursue his theory, inviting others to provide supporting evidence through his web site.  He could save himself future embarrassment by hiring better fact-checkers from a variety of disciplines who would catch the sometimes glaring errors in this book.
B000002LE6|5.0|This album is fantastic one of Prince's best. It's definately a must-buy if you are a Prince fan!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I liked this album at first but thought it was overhyped.  Now that I've listened to it a great deal more, I've become a fan.  Jones really has a very seductive, beguiling voice that works its magic on the listener time and again.  It is hard to imagine anyone not being moved by \\"Come Away With Me\\" and \\"Don't Know Why.\\" She also does a magnificent rendition of \\"The Nearness of You,\\" which I thought had already been done to death.  I was wrong.  I don't like her father's music (Ravi Sankar) and probably wouldn't have listened to her if I'd known they were related (assuming, wrongly, that they'd sound the same).  Jones won 5 Grammys via this recording and I'm not surprised.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00008977N|4.0|Yep, the video blows.  I think what's going on here is that they had a 1994 4:3 film of the concert, and basically did a zoom and a pan and scan to \\"convert\\" it to 16:9.  That's why the video quality isn't that great.<br />But the concert rocks, and the sound is crystal clear.  Excellent 5.1 DTS, and I'm not sure of the complaints that I read that Paula Cole isn't loud enough.  Excellent mix.
B000051VWW|5.0|i just wanted to say that you are an amazing artist i love your music your such a deep writer and all of your music has touched my heart deep inside i love your style you are great i finally found an artist who i can TOTALLY feel. every song you have written has related to me in some point of my life <BR>thank you for giving me and the rest of the world a chance to listen to your beautiful words of music you are incredible
B00005YW4H|5.0|Since I listen lately such a lot of electronic tunes and vocoder, I started to forget that a song was something so simple as a lyric, a melody, a voice and an instrument. Norah Jones does it beautifuly and thats why she has to be heard as the artist she truly is. Shes not a product of the computers  age but a singer as traditionaly we know. She can sing, play piano, compose and arrange her songs and everything she does, does it perfect. Most of us call this MUSICIAN. If you like voices fixed digitally or artist produced as a merchandise, this CD is not for you. Otherwise, if you really respect talent, this artist will not disapoint you at all.
B00007K02F|2.0|The actress who plays Jane is quite good, and is certainly PLAIN.  The story is interesting or not, as you please.  I can't quibble too strongly with this adaptation, except in one major detail.<br />William Hurt's performance as Rochester is one of the weirdest, and worst, ever put on film.  He plays the role as if Rochester was afflicted with narcolepsy, and is having an especially hard time staying awake.  Hurt's characteristic mumbling and bizarre attempt at an English accent don't help matters much.  I don't see what on earth possesses even that poor governess Jane Eyre to find him even at all attractive.  Weren't there any hunky stableboys she could be dallying with?<br />There's a far more effective version starring George C. Scott, who is similarly untraditional in his outlook on Rochester but manages through sheer intelligence and acting ability to make it work.  Seek out that version for an entertaining and moving version of this story.
B00008URYM|4.0|What has made Madonna the biggest female superstar has becomethe subject of her anti feelings in these latest song - materialism and pop. This song is not the usual Madonna lead-off title from a new album. It's slightly less radio friendly and not so pop-sounding. Instead, it moves from 2000's #1 Music to more unstructured sound laced with electronic ducks and funky beats. The song alternates between a funky verse and an acoustic chorus.<br />Unfortunately, pop radio has decided to give this song a miss, rather unbelievable but expected this time round. For those who think it's anti-Bush and war-related, forget it. The song merely reflects Madonna's more than often misunderstood state of mind. It talks of how she has moved so far up that she's lost track of what she was doing all that for. Critics call this song a dud, but they fail to realize the parody within the song. Madonna was slammed for her in-your-face rapping, with some calling it souless but they didnt realize that Madonna was really parodying the oh-so-popular rap culture in the US which virtually dominates the chart!<br />You can say wat u want but Madonna is still Madonna and the critics have never been able to bring her down.<br />A slight disappointment would be that the fab video was not put on the enhanced section since Madonna pulled the video which was a sahme. It really deserved some airing on TV!
B0000248L1|4.0|This is just an awesome debut!  I actually met former bassist Wayne Darley a few years ago and was told that he had a lot of fun making this album.  A really nice guy!  I am acutally buying the album tonight as it is easily one to fall in love with.  I wish I had more time, I have some stories to share!
B00005NWM3|5.0|this album has a regular place in my CD player, it is an awsome album - all killer, no filler, have you no ears?<BR>BUY IT!
B00005QDW5|4.0|Of course, it's excellent because it's Pink Floyd, but some of the song choices were off. There were things left out that should not have been, and things included that could have been deleted.  It seems they stuck to some of the more popular songs for commercial value (except Fletcher Memorial Home, I was surprised to see that on here).  If you've never really listened to them, this isn't the best cross section of work.  If you're an avid fan, then just add it to your collection.
B000084T18|2.0|With all the hype about 50 Cent, people have overlooked the content of his CD.  Lyrically he's about as gifted as Shaq.  Statements like &quot;My flow's been hot for so long&quot; just don't seem to work for him.  Get some real stuff like 2Pac's &quot;Better Dayz&quot;.
B00006RU5B|5.0|A sort of lightning. The one that strikes with a good taste, impresses with a unforgettable sound, and leaves you breathless with a living memory of a beautiful music and smartful words.<br />Cochise has always been a strong one. But hardly the best. To the faster and heavier part of the cd, some tracks work pretty well: Show Me How To Live, What You Are, Set It Off, Exploder, and Light My Way, all of these, being varied in sound and structure, are equally loud, energetic, and memorable.<br />The slower part may impress you even more. The best of modern and classical rock trends was put into Like A Stone, I Am A Highway, and The Last Remaining Light, plus the catchiest choruses, a nice melody, and clever lyrics. What else is really necessary to make a modern classical rock tune?<br />Besides, and it is the most important thing: there's really something about their overall sound, whatever it is, the special feelings put in every note, or the unique talent of guitar and bass playing, or the higly passionate and sincere vocals, or all of these and much more - the whole thing creates a very special spirit of the album, the one that clearly and easily separates the guys from the rest of a rock crowd, and makes their music shine and live, and be so much desirable and powerful.<br />Definitely not your carpet ride.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Wow.  Who thought the Lips would follow up the brilliant SB with another sonic classic.  Y Battles the Pink Robots is catchy, intelligent, fun, introspective, and freaky all at the same time.  Wayne is one strange dude.  <br />No question that this is one of the best albums on 2002.<br />The first few songs are irresistible pieces of space pop, and then the album dives into a world of unknown pleasures and carnal sounds capes.  While the album is not as energy fueled as SB, it is more willing to let a soft moment linger in order to smack you in the face a second later.  <br />Let this one percolate on you.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|A timeless album that will blow your mind. with tunes form lindsey Buckingham to stevie nicks tunes this album rocks to a steady beat, then a hard core beat to a monatonal strech it is trulely a different fleetwood mac
B00005K3O4|5.0|Never tought this classic would be on DVD. I couldn't even find it in used video stores. I would have been very happy with a used, VHS rental. This b-movie is one of the best I've seen. A great twisted concept. More humorous than scary, even if you have a clown phobia.
0060537639|4.0|The author's thesis was not supported by numismatic evidence.  Chinese copper 'cash', i.e., holed coins, were produced in prodigious quantities.  Why have no hoards been found in the Americas?  They have been found in the Persian Gulf and East African ports.
B000089RVX|5.0|Throughout the past decade and a half that I've enjoyed hard rock (of all forms), I have unfortunately not been able to find many rock bands outside of alternative bands with female lead singers who sound right.  I don't know why this is, but, for the most part, rock bands with female lead singers, trying to sound harsh, or too heavy, or whatever, just don't sound right in my ear.  (I have nothing against female lead singers, please understand, they just don't sound right in my ear...in my opinion.)  Again, this is neglecting the alternative arena where bands like the Cranberries and Four Non Blondes, Six Pence Non the Richer, etc.  But The Donnas?  Hole?  I can't handle them: not one bit.<br />But then I heard Bring Me Back to Life by Evanescence on the radio and was grooving to the sound the first time around.  Think of these bands and you'll have an idea of Evanescence:<br />(*) Linkin Park (layered music with guitars, bass, thumping beats, piano/keyboard, rage-filled screams, and infectious riffs)<BR>(*) Six Pence Non the Richer for the amazingly talented lead singer with an almost-too-sweet of a voice<BR>(*) David Draiman (of Disturbed) and his song Forsaken on the Queen of the Damned sountrack for dramatic, killer music<BR>(*) Collective Soul for layered music with all that Linkin Park has plus strings and a smooth sound (minus the rage-fille wailing).<br />Then add a little Cranberries for the edge from the female lead and you pretty much have Evanescence.<br />There isn't a song on this CD I can't listen to over and over again.  It's just that good.  I normally try to be a little critical of music or books, even when I enjoy them, just to give a well rounded critique; but I haven't yet heard anything I have a problem with.  It is the first CD in years where I like EVERY song on it (even my favorite CDs from my favorite bands: Collective Soul, Metallica, Soundgarden, Audioslave, Pearl Jam, King's X, Live, Matchbox 20, etc., there are songs I don't like).<br />So, long review short: If you like driving rhythms, complex, layered music, meaningful lyrics, and a soulful, resonant voice in a singer, you oughta love this CD.
B000002GVO|5.0|Easily the best of the 1970s, Henley and Frey weave together an album of strong tracks, one right after the other.  Opening with the title track and closing with the classic &quot;Last Resort&quot;, every track in between is a good one.<br />A great taste of 1970s album oriented rock.  Those who don't appreciate this have no taste in music.
B00001U0DP|5.0|400+ reviewers have already spoken about the film and raved about it. I would like to add that I saw this film recently, after the horrendously immoral US attack on Iraq, that has affected me deeply. But seeing Guido's unflaggingly heroic efforts to shield his son from the obvious horror of the concentration camp ,it has given me some hope, that each of us is an individual, and we must try our best to lead the life we wish.
B00004BZ0N|1.0|The cover is suitable for framing.  The content is suitable for forgetting.  &quot;Train In Vain&quot; is good, but it can't save the entire album.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Every song begins with some wierd noises and fades in to the good old pretty traditional Linkin Park music.  Hey, it's Linkin Park, what's no to like?  Oh, and listen to Metallica and Nirvana, they're good too.
B000002MTR|4.0|Between BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK and CALIFORNICATION, which can be considered The Red Hot Chili Peppers'masterpieces, ONE HOT MINUTE is undobtedly an album which deserves more attention, even if it was recorded in a strange period for RHCP. John Frusciante had left the band 3 years earlier and,as the chemistry between the members had always been very important for RHCP's success, it was bound that OHM would have been a different album.This in fact is the most experimental album of RHCP,in which we can find episodes of real sadness(MY FRIENDS, TEARJERKER, but even AEROPLANE behind its funky sound is a very bitter song and we can see it by the lyrics) and songs where RHCP returns to their origin(DEEP KICK, ONE BIG MOB) and also episodes of great psychedelia and obscurity(ONE HOT MINUTE,COFFEE SHOP).a BEAUTIFUL ALBUM, even if i think, listening to the variety from one song to another,that the band was still looking for a precise identity.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Although it is nearly impossible to compile a \\"best of\\" the Beatles on one disc, this compilation of all of their American and British #1 hit singles is definitely worth purchasing.  Even though it may not have ALL of the Beatles' greatest songs, this album will get you into the band, and you won't be able to stop listening to this CD over and over again!  If you like this album, \\"The Beatles 1962-1966\\" and \\"The Beatles 1967-1970\\" are available, featuring 54 of their best songs on four discs.  It may be a bit more costly, but again, you'll love every song.  Even those four discs aren&#8217;t an essential collection of the Beatles, let alone the \\"1\\" album.  But this is an excellent CD to get if you would like to start getting into their music &#8211; but remember - THESE ARE JUST THE NUMBER ONE HITS, THERE'S MUCH MORE GREAT MUSIC BY THE BEATLES OUT THERE!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am not into pop or teen girl music, and I have to say that this Cd pleasantly surprised me.  She is one talented lady.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Sorry about that cheezy title.  But seriously, this is an EXCELLENT collection to get.  Great price for GREAT music.  If you're looking for a greatest hits packaging from Elton that covers his whole career, like I was, then this is definitely the one to get.  Besides, I don't think there's really any other one out there anyways.<br />Before I got this CD, I only knew approx. 10 of his songs, and when this CD came out, THEY WERE ALL ON THERE!!  It is definitely worth your money, and this music is CLASSIC.  You'll love it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When I first listened to this cd one word came to mind:WOW!<BR>This is one of the greatest debuts to come around in awhile.  Cornells voice sounds great and compliments Morellos creative guitar riffs well. I bought this cd about 4 weeks ago and havnt taken it out of my cd player since.  If you are a fan of rock music in general you ABSOLUTELY NEED to add this cd to your collection. Heres a breakdown:<BR>1.Cochise 10/10-Perfect opening song with tons of energy<BR>2.Show me How to Live 8.5/10- Overall good song with a kinda stupid ending<BR>3.Gasoline 10/10-A little on the grungy side but that just shows the diversity of the album.<BR>4.What you Are 9.5/10-Deep song.Cornell really shows sensitive side<BR>5.Like a Stone 11/10-MASTERPIECE<BR>6.Set it Off 9/10- Fun song<BR>7.Shadow on the Sun 10/10- Very powerful chorus<BR>8.I am The Highway 10/10-Very good change of pace.<BR>9.Hypnotize 9/10 Reminiscent of RATM<BR>10.Exploder 9.5/10 good song overall<BR>11.Bring em BAck alive 10/10 one of my favs with great riffs<BR>12. Light my Way-10/10 cornells voice in the chorus is off hte hook<BR>13. Getaway Car-9.5/10 nice peacefull song<BR>14.Last REmaining Light 9/10 good close
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This album is incredible. This is Lindsey's best work since \\"Tusk\\" and it's great to see him in top form.  I'm a Stevie fanatic, so all of her songs are flawless to me.  Stevie's \\"Goodbye Baby\\", \\"Running Through the Garden\\" and \\"Smile At You\\" have been circulating in demo form for many years, and now they've finally found a home in Fleetwood Mac's best album in years.  I highly recommend this album to everyone!!!!  Personal favorites of mine are \\"Goodbye, Baby\\", \\"Say You Will\\", \\"Illume\\", \\"Say Goodbye\\", \\"Miranda\\" and \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\".
B00004R9A4|1.0|Maybe I am just a traditionalist...or, more likely, I enjoy singing along with the movie, but this original fully restored version is the pits.  It was neat to see once but now I want the movie I have come to know and love.  I hope Disney comes out with the original version released in 1971 on DVD. ...
B000084T18|2.0|He OK, But He's Not That Bad.<BR>He sounds Like Mase.<BR>He sholdn't on Eminem's Lable, because his lyrics are not powerful.<BR>Anybody produce by Eminem should have TIGHT lyrics like Eminem
B00006F83Y|5.0|I don't have a lot to say about this CD, but when you first listen to it, you say 'Wow, this is a good album. The riffs are right on.' Then, when you really listen to the album and realize how completly amazing every aspect of it is, from Josh's vocals and emotionally drenched lyrics to Dave's out of this world drums, all you can say is 'damn'.
B000089A07|2.0|This movie has greed written all over it.  With there already being a very good version of Harris's book made in 1986 (Michael Mann's Manhunter), the only reason to make this is to capitalize on the \\"sucess\\" of Hannibal.<br />It's not that Red Dragon is THAT bad of a movie.  It's serviceable, with a cool action-y ending.  But the phenomenal cast is utterly wasted.  Norton looks brain dead, and Hopkins is so hammy it looks like there should be a green egg on either side of the screen.<br />If you like very basic thrillers, you might like this movie.  If you have any sense for artistic merit, forget it.  You'll be bored out of your skull.  Oops, bad metaphor.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk To Remember is by far one of the best books I've ever read.  As soon as I started reading, I fell in love with it.  Nicholas Sparks does a wonderful job.  He really knows how to touch your heart.<BR> <BR> This book starts out with a young man and woman who are complete opposites.  Landon's a rebel, Jamie's a goody-goody.  Landon says, \\"Jamie had never been on my social calendar, she wasn't exactly what I called attractive either.\\"  Surprisingly, the two become young lovers.  We now find Landon and Jamie both saying, \\"I love you.\\" to each other.  It has a great tragic ending that will keep you reaching for the tissues all night long.<BR> <BR> I'm not big into reading, but I found with this book, I had trouble putting it down.  This book has touched my heart in a special way that I won't soon forget.  I encourage everyone to read this book.  It will remain in your heart forever.
B00005JLEU|5.0|OK, if you're looking for a Disney movie, forget it.  This movie is better than the last ten Disney flicks put together (although Lilo and Stich is fun, I admit).<br />Spirited Away is a film, not a movie.  It has sequences in it that are as beautiful as anything ever shown on the screen, and I'm counting the masterpieces of Kurosawa, Fellini and Bergman in this mix.  You think I'm joking, but I'm not.  The visuals are gorgeous, the music entrancing, the detailed sound perfect.  The scene where our little heroine rides the train across what seems like an endless ocean, as ghosts commuted to whatever dreary lives they might live, drove me to tears for the first time since &quot;our song&quot; in Moulin Rouge.  Man, it's been a long time since a movie struck me emotionally like this.  Absolutely fantastic stuff.<br />Whether kids will like it is another question.  It can be pretty scary, but no worse than &quot;Atlantis&quot; or the such.  Parents will find it scarier (maybe more morbid) than the kids.  If your child likes to stick with the Disney type stuff, try My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service first.  They're almost as good and not as challenging to the beginner.  But it doesn't hurt to try - I know I would have LOVED &quot;Sprited Away&quot; as a kid.<br />I know this will be the first &quot;kids&quot; film I ever buy, and maybe the only one.
B000003TA4|2.0|I fully expect a 0/50 helpful vote score.<br />When Nevermind was released back in 1991, its popularity stemmed not so much from the quality of its music as how different it was from a lot of what MTV was playing at the time. It was not Poison, Paula Abduhl, or New Kids On The Block, but rather a totally different style of rock music. Since Nirvana seemed to be one of the few bands of the time period that didn't care much about image or looks, they were automatically hailed as these modern rock saviors and to this day are considered one of the greatest rock bands of the nineties.<br />Unfortunately, time did not treat the album too kindly as pretty much every mainstream rock band from Bush to Blink-182 owes at least a little to the album's sound. And the fact of the matter is that when you look past the lack of make-up and hairspray, Nevermind is not that great an album.<br />Part of its problem has to do with the lyrics themselves. Kurt Cobain's lyrics were often very incoherant and almost randomly generated. This is just as well because most of them were just his whining about how horrible society treated him in the past. The song structures weren't much better with a lot of oversimplified riffs, merely adequate drumming, and all around lack of originality. That's not to say there aren't a few high-points. In Bloom and Drain You are admittedly fun surf-rock songs, but two good songs out a total of twelve just doesn't cut the mustard when better albums like Alice in Chains' Facelift offer consistantly good music.<br />In brief, I simply can't recommend this album to anybody other than fans of modern alternative music. And even that is a bit hard for me since most probably already own it. But if you're looking for a good album from the grunge era, pick up AIC's Dirt or Facelift instead. You will be glad you did.
1400034779|4.0|The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books are great!  They read quickly, and they are an excellent way to escape to a far away place without too much effort!  Although the first book features a number of smaller cases, Tears of the Giraffe (book 2) and Morality for Beautiful Girls (book 3) focus on larger cases that aren't solved as quickly, easily keeping your interest for the length of the book.  <br />It isn't necessary to read the books in order, either.  The author does a great job of filling in pertinent details as he goes.  I would recommend reading the No. 1 Ladies Detective before reading the other books though.  Important details about Mma Ramotswe's life are disclosed in the book, and those events are often referred to later in the series.

B00008H2LB|5.0|i bought this album about a week ago and i havent stopped listening to it since. i listened 2 it no less than 10 times on the first day and alomst as many times everyday since.it is da best cd eva( otha than disturbed and hybrid theory)as u can c im a huge linkin park fan! it is a bit different from hybrid theory with a little bit of rap and sum different style music, but thats wat makes it good. its no good if all of their songs r the same, so its good to have sum variety. its also good coz most of the words rnt hard 2 learn and it tells u a little of how they came up with the songs. one of them took 5 yrs to get it right. u have to get it!!!
B000060K4P|5.0|These movies are super. <br />Ghostsbusters 1: I love this movie the best out of the two. This film tells how the guys got into business. This film is the most exciting in my opinion. I love it because you learn the history of the Ghostbusters. I just wish that it was availble in full screen too.<br />Ghostbusters 2: This film has it's good moments. But it also has it's bad moments. This film is my second favorite of the two. There are some funny moments in the film. I do suggest watching the Ghostbusters 2 as well.<br />I have both films on VHS and DVD. I also have both soundtracks on CD. Once you see the movies you will want to buy the soundtracks. The songs from the films are wonderful. My favorite song from the first movie is &quot;I Can Wait Forever&quot; by Air Supply.
B000005JA8|5.0|Let me be brief about a _long_ album with a whole bunch of (mostly very short) &quot;songs&quot; on it.  This is the best rock 'n' roll (I guess that's what it mostly is, but it's clearly very blues- and jazz-influenced) I ever heard.  I have been listening to it again and again since it came out.  It starts jamming with the first cut, &quot;Frownland.&quot;  Some of the best cuts are &quot;Neon Meat Dream of a Octafish&quot; and &quot;Hair Pie&quot; (both takes) as described in another review.  However, my favorite is an a capella sung poem (with skipping vinyl record background noise as sole accompaniment)called &quot;The Dust Blows Forward 'n' The Dust Blows Back.&quot;  One stanza of this goes:  &quot;I can hear the mice toes scamprin'/gophers rumblin'/in piled crater-rock holes/one red bean stuck in the bottom of a tin bowl/hot coffee from a crimped-up can/me and my girl named Bimbo/Limbo, Spam.&quot;  The whole album (4 sides) is full of great stuff like that.  Give it a listen.
B000002U82|5.0|What I want to know, and I haven't read all the reviews, but the Average Customer Review is less than 5, so I deduce that someone out there actually gave this less than 5 stars. Who are you? What friggin planet do you live on man? Do you not know that dsotm is THE friggin album against which all friggin albums are measured? It seems to me only complete moe-rons and eye-rakee's would think otherwise. Dig in, cause the end is coming, one way or t'other.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is an amazing movie.  It has groundbreaking special effects as well as an interesting plot and good acting.  The kung-fu scenes are amazing, and the actual actors/actresses were trained by Hong-Kong choreographers to do almost all of their own stunts.  It has remained my all-time favorite movie for almost 3 years now.  If you like good action, sci-fi, or just good movies in general, you will love this movie.
B000001Y5D|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums! I'm sure you remember 4 Non Blondes' song &quot;What's Up&quot;, and if you like it, you should be into the entire album! simply ENJOY it-Linda Perry has the best vocals ever!
0767803434|1.0|I rewatched this movie just last night (April 13th, 2003), to see what messages it actually uses to play on people's fears and misconceptions about the world around America. At times embarassing, at times eerily in tune with current events, and at all times constantly questioning one's own common sense. Hollywood is always seeking to entertain and distract its audience, but putting such political issues in focus without any thought or plausibility insults those with any mind to question.<br />Let's just say this is a theatre piece, and dramatic elements have to be employed to add to the plot or sequence of events. That this, and so many movies of its kind employ the use of Russians as the enemy (usually using a British actor to supply the villainy) perpetuates stereotypes and misinformation that has existed since the Cold War's birth. I loved the fact that America was seen as a bastion of technology, with blinking lights and computer screens, and intercoms, technology at the helm, while Russia and its leader had a little red phone and a bear on his table. Fantastic. It automatically sets up a perception that Russia is weaker on all fronts, and the victor will always be America, so the whole premise of the film being America in danger is compromised by its visualisation of its power as compared to Eastern Europe. It throws the whole plot out the window by default.<br />Apart from its Nationalistic stance, the dialogue of the film borders on the ludicrous to outright childlike. The only bite that is heard in this film is from the actual enemy (portrayed by Gary Oldman) when questioning the President's (Harrison Ford) moral constitute when dealing with his Oldman's homeland. The points raised were the only plausible or believeable lines in this movie, but it all too quickly falls into the 'remake Rambo' style of filmmaking too many times. This is just entertainment for the masses, and does not ask any questions of moral fortitude or revenge, or anything actually relevant to anything in any real world situation. Should I take this movie just as it is, entertainment, or for what it represents, 'Horse Blinker' propaganda aimed at the public.<br />I cannot guess why films like this get made???? All that money wasted on a piece of junk. The CGI throughout is quite weak, especially the 'crash' at the end which pays no heed to what a plane would actually do when hitting the water, which WOULD have been far more dramatic a conclusion, if they just paid attention to physics. It was actually hilarious.<br />I think the scariest bit had to be the speech at the beginning of the film by Harrison Ford. I've heard it before somewhere....<br />Don't waste your time, money, patience, eyesight, hearing or mind on this huge waste of finances. I can't believe some of the actors actually did.relevant to anything in any real world situation.

0790740443|5.0|This is one of the great, unsung science fiction films of recent times. The story revolves around a future where soldiers are segregated and trained from the crib to be merciless, killing machines. Kurt Russel, in a great performance, plays one of these soldiers who are soon to be replaced by a genetically enhanced new breed of soldier. Sgt. Todd 3465 (Russel) is believed killed in a training exercise and disposed of like yesterday's garbage on a waste-disposal planet. He survives, finds refuge amongst a colony of planet refugees, and tries to fit in.<br />This is, on a very rewarding level, a tremendous action film. Russel's nemesis in the film, Sgt. Caine 607 (played by Jason Scott Lee) is an imposing presence, and the fight scenes between the two are excellent and convincing. The special effects and battle scenes are impressive as well, and really transport you to a harsh, bleak, metallic future.<br />On another level the film is about the discovery of emotion in the highly trained soldier as he tries to fit into a more normal society. Russel is simply outstanding in the roll, doing an incredible acting job. He speaks a total of about 20 words in the whole film, but his internal struggles are always clear and very moving.<br />This \\"learning human emotions\\" trick is one several science fiction films have attempted, and most are embarrassing and painful to watch, dripping with sugar and sap. &quot;Soldier&quot; excels in this department as Russel makes the shift from killing machine to feeling man in a subtle, believable way. The film is just very, very well done and well written. The acting is fine all the way around, and the dialogue is completely absent of those wince-producing moments films of this nature often have.<br />Over time, this has become one of my favorite movies. I have watched it several times with increased enjoyment each time. I have quoted dialogue from this movie on more than one occasion, particularly the moment when Sgt. Todd tries to express his feelings, and all he can verbalize is \\"fear . . . discipline.\\"<br />This movie is carefully crafted, intelligent, and hugely entertaining from the opening credits onward.ress his feelings, and all he can verbalize is \\"fear . . . discipline.\\"<br />This movie is carefully crafted, intelligent, and hugely entertaining from the opening credits onward.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|I bought this cd for &quot;All the things she said&quot; and boy, was I glad I did.  This cd is awesome!!  I honestly can say that this is the only cd that I bought this year that I do not regret buying.  The music is not like the stuff you get spoon fed every day, it is so refreshing!  You will love this one.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|The highly anticipated album, \\"Say You Will\\", lives up to its title. The title track as well as many other songs on the album reflect Fleetwood Mac at their best. Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks contribute nicely to the album with songs like \\"Peacekeeper\\" and \\"Illume (9/11)\\". Although singer-keyboardist Christine McVie has opted to sit this venture out, nothing seems to be missing musicwise. Stevie's song \\"Say You Will\\" is a promising single for the future, with its country-tinged flow and chanting lyrics, it promises fun and better times for a realtionship turned sour. Yet songs like \\"Thrown Down\\" and \\"Smile At You\\" are bittersweet and do not promise any future understandings in a seasoned relationship. Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are doing well in the rhythm section, clearly staying away from drugs and alcohol, and delivering that familar beat we all know so well. This is definetly worth buying and will more than likely be one of the top ten celebrated music releases of 2003.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I am a Harry Potter fan so I would of course like this movie and give it a good review. The DVD picture is crystal clear and the sound is great! The second disc, packed with features, includes 19 new and extended scenes. Most of them are extended and a few are new and there is also 2 alternates. Most of the extended secens are short, sweet, and to the point. And I mean to the point! One is were Harry is trying to shake off the bludgeer and flys straight through the Slytherine Bleachers and all of them scream and move to the side. That scene running about 30 seconds, should have been in the movie. Well that is my review! Hope you enjoy the movie!
B00006IUL7|4.0|Chris Nolan's version of Insomnia is an American-ized (and slightly watered-down) remake of the excellent original Norwegian film, which featured Swedish Stellan Skarsgård (best known to American audiences for his work in \\"Good Will Hunting\\") as the sleep-deprived lead detective.<br />I had one fundamental problem:  I never really bought into the contrived circumstances that lead Pacino and partner Martin Donovan (who many will recall for his excellent portrayal as Christina Ricci's brother in 'The Opposite of Sex') up to Alaska.<br />Once ensconced in Alaska, I've got to admit:  Pacino does a really good Pacino here.  His Pacino persona is a hand-in-glove fit for this sleep-deprived role.  Pacino being Pacino, I'll bet he took the Method approach and literally didn't sleep for 5+ days.  Either way, his frustration and increasingly slowed reflexes and perplexity are palpable.<br />The real revelation for me was Robin Williams.  Even though he got an Oscar for 'Good Will Hunting,' I thought his fake Boston accent schtick there was dreadful.  Anyone who grew up within a 100-mile radius of Boston tuned him out the second he opened his mouth.<br />Here, though, he's superb.  Forgot \\"One Hour Photo.\\"  Williams is perfectly creepy and calculating here.  I never for a second thought I was watching another goofy Robin Williams role.  He needs more \\"Insomnia,\\" less \\"Death to Smoochy.\\"  I hope we see more inspired choices like this from him in the future.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from Mac on this one.  I figured like most artists older than 50, the creative juices wouldn't be there.  I was pleasantly suprised.  The best song is &quot;Murrow Turning Over in his Grave&quot; it's about Edward R. Murrow (the guy who battled McCarthyism).  With that song I think they are saying that Murrow would be upset that people today are afraid to speak their minds, specifically about the war.  I can't say I agree, I think that today people just aren't afraid to tell fatheads like Michael Moore to shut up, but the song is still great.  Another good one is Illume <BR>(9-11) it is about 9-11 and the people stuck in the WTC above impact,  it gave me chills when I heard it.  <br />5 Stars!
B00005JLXE|4.0|Superhero movies. They're on their way this summer in the forms of the Incredible Hulk, a \\"League\\" of gentlemen, and some guy named Wolverine. Could Daredevil just be a taste of what's to come? If so, then I say bring on them crazy superhero mutants!<BR> <BR>Daredevil was a great surprise to me. To begin with, I'm not a fan of Daredevil, Ben Affleck, nor Jennifer Garner. Not that their stuff bores me, it's just I'm not big fans of their work. Daredevil changed that. <BR> <BR> The story is simple. Murdock is a blind guy who has enhanced all of his abilities through his handicap. He uses these abilities to revenge the death of his father by giving justice to the city he lives in. When he meets Elektra, a new sort of justice comes into play. <BR> <BR> Our leads give a fantastic performance and their chemistry was awesome. The rooftop kiss in the rain scene is - in my opinion - one of the best kiss scenes. Colin Farrel gives a hoot of a performance as a co-villian and Michael Clarke Duncan rocks as usual. <BR> <BR> The action in this movie is high. There are a number of great fight scenes and action sequences. A bunch of adrenaline here.<BR> <BR> I only have one complaint with this movie, and it seemed it moved too fast at times. I need a little bit more character development (partially with Elektra) for me. But other than . . .<BR> <BR> Daredevil was a fun adrenaline-filled movie with the right amount of a side love story to settle it.
B000000OQF|5.0|As the title says, this IS the greates Hard Rock Albulm of all time. The genius of Axl,Slash, and Izzy is seen here as it brings in all the creative prowess of each artist. By the time Use Your Illusion comes along, Izzy is about to leave, and an intgeral part of the Guns triad is gone.<BR>If you are a hard rock fun you MUST have this record. Here is why. The 80's had a terrible affect on the world of hard rock. Bands such as Posion were dominating the music scene and spending far more time ont her hair then on their lyrics. Then in 1987, Appetitie for Destruction pumps a raw and powerful shot back into the arm of Hard Rock. From the thunderous Welcome to the Jungle to the final chords of Rocket Queen, you truly feel exhausted after listening to this albulm. This is Hard Rock and Guns at their best.
0066214122|2.0|This is a good story idea poorly written. At times, I was convinced that Crichton's twelve-year-old (if he has a 12-yr-old) wrote it. It was just that bad. The dialogue is often comical and should be embarrassing for a writer of Crichton's credentials. Crichton's insistence on using sentence fragments masquerading as complete thoughts was annoying. Literary license is one thing if it adds to the story. But sloppy sentence structure that leads you off in the wrong direction, or leaves you wondering what is being said, is inexcusable. If this story makes it to the big screen, it will need a major rewrite, hopefully by someone other than Michael Crichton.
B000000OQY|3.0|This is really not that great of a CD. Used to love her, and You are crazy are great songs but the rest are essentially filler. On that, I would award this CD 2 stars. However, Patience is found on this CD. That elevates the CD up to barely a 3.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I've got this set on VHS but for some reason, after only a couple of plays, the tapes have developed a tracking fault making them annoying to watch. Anybody else got the same problem? Thus I have been awaiting this DVD release for ages. It's amazing to think that here in Australia it's release wasn't anywhere as heavily promoted as a cheaper rivalling 5 DVD set called \\"The Long And Winding Road\\". It just snuck out. I only found out by chance on a news radio item about the extra '95 footage. I had to come to Amazon just to get some basic details. That said, it's beeen worth the wait. You haven't heard \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"A Day in the Life\\" until you've heard them in glorious 5.1 sound. just crank it up. If you want the DEFINITIVE Beatles story, go straight to the horse's mouth. All the little insights, legends, myths and other annecdotes are told here. The performances bring a tear to the eye on occasion. I was a child growing up with the Beatles and they had a major influence on my life. Paul & John met on July 6 1957, 2 days after I was born. Exactly 10 years later to the day, they were performing \\"All You Need Is Love\\" for the world to see. The Beatles certainly came along brilliantly from those early scratchy recordings in their youth. <BR>The extra features are great to watch. The making of the \\"Free As A Bird\\" clip is wonderful. Did anybody out there realise that George played the ukelele bit at the end of that same track. I applaud the inclusion of the \\"Real Love\\" clip as well though it's probably not as innovative as \\"Free As A Bird\\". Abbey Road revisited reminded me of an episode of the \\"Classic Albums\\" series. Methinks it's time to do A Beatle album for that series too (Revolver/Rubber Soul/\\"White Album\\"/Abbey Road - take your pick - Pepper was done in \\"The Making Of Sgt. Pepper\\" documentary). I digress. If you're a fan or even if you're not it's worth the price. You will laugh and cry and marvel at the music, especially the stuff that WASN'T released. (Listen to the end credits of each episode.) Buy It!!
B0000039PW|5.0|well what can i say, this is just an excellent debute from big. he really put it on this cd. the beats are sick and also the lyrics. he has it all on this cd. he really shows the streets who he really is. if anyone doesnt have this cd in their collection, then i suggest go out of your house get this cd right away before its too late. this is a must have. if you even decide to sleep on this cd. then , you're just krazy. i luv this cd so much because when i read the credits, he saw that he actually wrote mostly ever word in the album and when i listen to his lyrics and flow to the beat. im like YOOOOOOO he did it!! , when i read other reviews they all say 2pac is better or biggie is better but to me, they are both the best at the same rate becuz they are the best lyricist in history. i dont like to compare them at all. i just luv them both. now they both are gone and we cant party with new songs from them which is sad. well now life goes on like 2pac says. well thats i have to say for now iight 1 <br />RIP Tupac Shakur 1971-1996 & Christopher G.L.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|I just purchased this today, and it is a great album!  It's wonderful to have the FM lineup that we are most familiar with back together again (sans Christine McVie).<br />Stevie and Lindsey still sound great together -- and the effort is seamless.  From the opening strains of &quot;What's The World Coming To&quot;, you can tell that this is vintage Mac.<br />It's hard to explain, but both Stevie and Lindsey show glimpses of the music they used to make (both FM and solo efforts), while at the same time stretching into new directions.  Stevie's voice sounds great on &quot;Illume (9-11)&quot; and the title track gets back to the pop-rock that this lineup made famous.  Both of their songwriting styles have a strong showing here -- Stevie's songs are stronger on this album than they even were on Trouble in Shangri-La.<br />This album will be kind of like Tusk -- the more you listen to it, the more you will appreciate it.  If this does happen to be FM's last album, they are going out on top -- a solid effort, not a last-ditch, half-baked one just for the sake of putting an album out.

B00000272N|3.0|A by the numbers 90's metal album by the band that best defined the genre. Thought of as `alternative' AiC were really just a metal band, and if you like Jane's Addiction and Smashing Pumpkins you probably will like Alice In Chains to, but if you haven't formed an attachment to the genre, stay away, I beg you, let us let the genre die!
B00006LSM3|5.0|Brainwashed closes out the solo career of George Harrison as splendidly as All Things Must Pass kicked it off (save for the two 60s instrumental releases).<br />There's a sense of purpose to this recording, but there's also a sense of whimsy, and the two combine to make this one of the more special releases for the VH1 crowd in years.<br />George is in fine voice, the songs well-crafted and the musicianship is outstanding. But perhaps what makes this so close to a 5-star rating is that Jeff Lynne did an outstanding job of producing it without Wilburying every song to death.<br />Granted, there's still a bit of that Wilbury sound (Rising Sun), which isn't a bad thing in moderation. But there's also some mighty fine slide guitar work throughout (especially Marwa Blues), plus toe-tapping ukelele all over the place. And who'd have ever thought the uke could rock?<br />Of course, while there is lots of fun to be had listening to this CD, it wouldn't be from George if there weren't also a handful of ideas for us all to ponder. However, this time, he gets his message(s) across without the heavy-handedness that has weighed down previous efforts.<br />Maybe someday there will be a nice 2-disc overview of George's solo efforts after All Things... and before Brainwashed. But even if there never is, who would've thought that two of the five best solo Beatles albums ever would've come from the The Quiet One?
B000002MFE|2.0|Proof as if any were needed, that most live albums are no good. Eric Clapton was once considered a gOd, now he's just living on the hype. His unplugged redoes of old chestnuts are as uninspiring as they are downtempo. Anyone familiar with the painful ubiquitous butchery of `Layla' will know what I mean, the whole album is done at this speed. The other well-known track is the sappy `Tears In Heaven' about which the less said the better. This album is as tiresome and worn out as Clapton himself. Let the old dog die in peace.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I bought this CD on a whim after hearing Running - which is now one of my 2 favourite tracks on the album, the other being Platinum Blonde Life - and it hasn't left my CD player since!This is the first No Doubt album I've ever bought, so it's not like I'm a huge fan or anything, but I would definitely recommend it!<BR>I think it's one of those albums that you need to listen to a couple of times before it really grows on you. There are a couple of songs - Detective and Waiting Room - that, while I don't totally hate them, I usually end up skipping. Apart from that though, it was a damn good buy!!

B00000DCHD|2.0|Billy Joel sounds great to middle aged women and lovelorn agnsty preteens, but his shtick gets old pretty fast. Critics have suggested that Joel is not rock, and while this is not true, his debt to the Brill building is obvious. It's easy to imagine his songs being the basis for a snappy Broadway musical. I admit that I was a fan back in my own misspent youth, given as I was to soggy sentimentality, but unlike Billy, I grew up. You will too. Till then, you will probably love this album.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Daredevil is my first superhero film. No, I didn't see X-Men, Batman, or Spiderman, but from the moment I read the synopsis of Daredevil, it was the only choice for me. I come from the school of tortured souls: Louis from Interview With the Vampire, Nick Knight from Forever Night, Father Kiernan from Stigmata. I want my hero to be both powerful and remorseful. Daredevil is both.<br />Blinded as a child by a freak accident, Matt Murdock's other four senses are hypersensitive. As an adult, Matt is a pro bono lawyer in Hell's Kitchen, but despite his best efforts, his clients don't get justice. By night Matt dons a red leather costume complete with horns and doles out the deserved justice to rapists, murderers and thugs. But he is a tortured soul and seeks spiritual relief in a nearby church, the priest being one of the few that knows of his dual identity as Daredevil.<br />Matt views his gifts as more of a curse: tormented by the extreme noise of the everyday, he sleeps in a sealed chamber. His cupboard is stocked with Vicodin and assortment of painkillers. His body is covered with scars, showing all too well that he is only human. And his life gets more complicated when he meets the beautiful (yet lethal) Elektra. Both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner bring chemistry and believability to their roles, and there is definitely onscreen chemistry between the two. Matt's faith is tested as he is faced with losing everone and everything he's ever loved at the hands of Kingpin; it's a bitter fight to the finish.<br />The storytelling is at times disjointed, the camera work seizure inducing (made me think of MTVesque Stigmata), the music an ear splitting blend of rock, alternative, and Rob Zombie. The visual and stunt work is incredible, with superhuman leaps, suspended kicks, and weapon trajectories (never knew that paper clips could be lethal weapons, did you?). There are moments of dark humour, most provided by pottymouthed Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Jon Favreau as Matt Murdock's sidekick. Sadly, the love story between Elektra and Matt didn't really play out much, and the film is short (103 min.). I found the ending unsatisfying, although it obviously sets up a sequel. In spite of a few hiccups along the way, Daredevil is one heck of a wild ride.t Murdock's sidekick.

B00008DDXC|5.0|Harry Potter, the legendary teenage wizard has returned home to Hogwarts.  In this, the second instalment in the wonderful series, we see Harry return to Hogwarts after getting rescued from his &quot;prison&quot; by Ron and his brothers.  He is first warned to stay away by Dobby, the house elf, but doesn't listen.  Once the school year does start, so does the trouble.  Seems that the Chamber of Secrets, which was thought to be a farce, has been opened.  Who did it?  Why was it done?  While trying to figure out the mystery with the help of Hermione &amp; Ron, Harry encounters the typical school events.  He is introduced to new teachers, has trouble with Malfoy again, learns more about himself and faces rejection, along-side other things.   Do the trio prevail in solving the mystery?  You'll have to watch to find out.  Harry's second year at Hogwarts is full of adventure, action, triumph, mystery, and happiness.  This is an excellent movie and I highly recommend it.  I should note that the film is a bit darker than the first, and some scenes might frighten younger movie fans.  It is overall an excellent movie and is sure to entertain fans of all ages.  Relating to the DVD, that's where this movie shines.  The two disc set has a great deal to offer and has many gems contained within.  Disc 1 contains the film itself, and features the film trailer, cast &amp; crew info and a short look at the first film or &quot;Year One at Hogwarts.&quot;  Disc 2 has many features to behold.  The additional scenes are a real treat to have available and are great to view.  You can select them one at at time or view them in a continuous stream.  You are also able to view different scenes from the Harry Potter video game.  This is a nice treat, and quite interesting to see.  In the &quot;Spellcaster Knowledge,&quot; one is able to test their memory skills and see how well they know the magic spells from the movie.  Depending on how well you do, you'll be graded.  &quot;Gilderoy Lockhart'sClassroom&quot; is a nice little area where you can learn a lot more about the new teacher at Hogwarts.  You can view photos, certificates and learn a lot more about his book releases.  In &quot;Behind Hogwarts,&quot; a wonderful &amp; insightful interview is available with the author of Harry Potter and Steve Kloves (&quot;Conversation with J.K. Rowling...&quot;).  &quot;Interviews With The Students, Professors and More&quot; is a nice little feature where we get insight from some of actors involved.  The production sketches are a sight to behold and even been able to choose between buidling a scene or taking a tour of Dumbledore's Office are both great features that are fun to work with.  Lastly there are &quot;The Activities,&quot; and these can provide much enjoyment.  &quot;Collin's Darkroom&quot; is a nice feature where you can make up a slide-show of pictures from ones that Collin has taken.  &quot;Tour Diagon Alley&quot; let's you explore the area further and view shops of all sorts.  &quot;The Forbidden Forest Challenge&quot; is a nice little game that sees you trying to escape from the forest itself.  Lastly, there is &quot;The Chamber Challenge.&quot;  This a fun &amp; great game that has you answer trivia questions that relate to the movie to see you progress through the Chamber to the end and defeat the Basilisk.  Overall, I think this collection is superb.  The movie itself is excellent and highly enjoyable, and the bonus features that go along with it are amazing and are sure to keep you occupied for hours.  I recommend that this disk be picked up as it is sure to not disappoint.  Who knows, maybe after a couple of watchings you might even be tempted to mix up a batch of Polyjuice Potion?

It also spurs a terrible accident where the young man is doused with radioactive waste. <BR>The disaster leaves Matt blind, but his other senses develop a superhuman acuity; his newly acquired 'radar' allows him to 'see' in ways no other can. <BR>Don't read any reviews of this movie because they will trash it just give it this roller coaster ride of a film 10/10 stars.<BR>Great music score by Greame Revell.<br />Get Ready For This Year's Devil

B00008J2DQ|5.0|Now, I'm not saying that Awake was all bad, but in comparison to Godsmack's self-titled first efforts, something had to be done about the lacking job on the sophomore attempt.<BR>  With Faceless, just the news of Shannon Larkin joining the ranks as the drummer was enough to know that this wasn't going to be your ordinary Godsmack album.  Larkin's known for his hard-hitting, insane beats with bands like Amen, which is good for those who enjoy the harder side of things when it comes to music.<BR>  The first official peek at Faceless, the single &quot;Straight Out Of Line&quot; was even more proof of Godsmack's resurgance onto the metal scene.  Incredible guitar riffs, Larkin's well-performed antics on the set, and Sully's ever-so-present vocal ride right through the first track and continue on until the ending tracks.  &quot;The Awakening&quot;/&quot;Serenity&quot;, the final two tracks, show Godsmack's diversity in music, giving an eerie acoustic flow which was present with &quot;Voodoo&quot; on their first album.<BR>  All in all, Faceless matches the power that Godsmack's self-titled was able to accomplish back in '98.  The 'Smack is back with more to offer than ever before.  A must-have album for any metal fan.

B00008H2LB|3.0|...Then again, they've only recorded two full-length albums of all-new material.<br />This album was better the first time I heard it, when it was called \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" Basically \\"Meteora\\" is a carbon-copy of \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" except not as good. You can literally break it down song by song, and almost every song on \\"Meteora\\" has a twin on \\"Hybrid.\\" And in nearly the exact same order; for example, the former CD's track listing basically went like this:<br />#1 - #4: loud songs<br />#5: \\"deep song\\"<BR>#6 - #7: loud songs<BR>#8: \\"deep song\\"<BR>#9 - #10: loud songs<BR>#11: instrumental DJ song<BR>#12: loud, heartfelt finale<br />\\"Meteora\\" follows the exact same formula, except each song is bumped up one track to make room for the pointless first track, \\"Foreword.\\" With a song like \\"Numb\\" (the loud, heartfelt finale), you can actually sing along using the lyrics from \\"Pushing Me Away\\" (its \\"Hybrid Theory\\" cousin), and you'll find that it's virtually identical. The chords are slightly different, as are the lyrics, but you're essentially listening to the same song, only not as good.<br />Notable exceptions: \\"Nobody's Listening,\\" which might be the most hip-hop-inspired song on either of their original albums (one of the things I liked about their remix CD \\"Reanimation\\" was the noticeable hip-hop influence), and \\"Breaking the Habit,\\" which is not really a ripoff because it's annoying, and nothing on \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was annoying. I still wish they'd do a song that actually lasted more than three, three and a half minutes. Every song sounds like it's built for radio, which doesn't help the overwhelming appearance that they're built for record sales and heavily commercialized by Warner Bros. And ripping yourself off is not the greatest sign of originality, but then again, Linkin Park was never the most original band in the first place.<br />Fortunately, \\"Hybrid Theory\\" happened to be a terrific album, so a copy of it is still pretty good.
B00008J4P5|2.0|After firmly establishing themselves as the undisputed rock n roll resurrection, The White Stripes have answered their growing frenzy of devotees with one dud of an album. A band that, just last year, was universally hailed as a much-welcome throwback to a sound long dead, the stripped down guitar/drums duo from Detroit seems about as interested in fanning the flames of their growing fame as a 25-year-old Neil Young. \\"That album put me in the middle of the road, so I headed for the ditch,\\" Young, who followed up 1972s monumental Harvest with the deliberately inaccessible (and long out-of print) \\"Time Fades Away\\" in 1973, explained years later. It seems that the White Stripes are up to much of the same thing here, on the careless, uninspired and puerile Elephant.<br />What were addictive and delightfully anachronistic rockers on De Stijl and White Blood Cells have given way to a drab collection of clunkers that sound more like sloppy, half-baked demos and outtakes from the White Blood Cells sessions. It isnt that The White Stripes ought to be confined to the precise recipe of past successes, but rather that as they mature and grow into their own sound, they might build on the thoughtful and engaging project they began a few years ago. Elephant, instead, marks a considerable step backward.<br />Taut, muscular collections doused in blues and grit such as De Stijl demonstrated a mammoth potential, rekindling the hopes of long-time subscribers to \\"rock is dead\\" mantra. The orgasmic cacophony that emerged from Meg Whites sizzling drums and Jack Whites guitar and uncanny wail produced a sound that resounded with improbable richness and fervor. The sound was hardly unfamiliar, but still, somehow, distinctive. From gorgeous rock ballads like \\"Same Boy Youve Always Known\\" to raucous jams like \\"Fell In Love With A Girl\\" or the brain-searing \\"Lets Build A Home,\\" Meg and Jack White, knowingly or not, had taken the fate of rock n roll into their hands.<br />Beginning with an unlikely bass line complimented by Megs angry, thumping drums, Elephant serves as a mighty tease.  Just as it seems that Jack and Meg White, a divorced couple often posing as brother and sister, discovered a sound of even deeper texture and richness without compromising their essential minimalism, the album unfolds into so much noise and nonsense. If the raucous and inexplicably titled \\"Black Math\\" sounds encouragingly similar to the famed \\"Fell In Love With A Girl,\\" subsequent songs demonstrate that this is merely coincidence. Song after song rings hollow, as Jacks lazy guitar simply languishes through the old motions, and the downright irreverent snap of Megs drumming is conspicuously dormant. A shrieking, murky chorus ruins the aimless \\"Theres Just No Home For You Here,\\" while \\"I Just Dont Know What To Do With Myself\\" sounds, at best, like an anemic stepchild to superior ballads from past albums, such as \\"Union Forever\\" and \\"The Same Boy Youve Always Known.\\" Perhaps the albums most egregious moment comes on the pseudo-poetic \\"In The Cold Cold Night,\\" on which Meg White sounds entirely foolish, lending a self-conscious and timid croon to lines so juvenile as to be the stuff of bad teen angst poetry:<br />I saw you standing on the corner,<br />On the edge of a burning light,<br />I saw you standing on the corner,<br />Come to me again in the cold cold night,<br />\\"I dont care what other people say, Im gonna love you anyway,\\" she continues to the plucking of a guitar lick that sounds like a ragged attempt at nailing down the Pink Panther song.<br />As with most rock n roll mishaps, though, a few gems emerge from the rubble of an unfortunate album. The explosive \\"Seven Nation Army\\" resounds with such energy and purpose as to seem like the work of another band altogether. The mean-eyed \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\" would crack an indulgent smile from the mouth of any AC/DC die-hard, and a flicker of soul ignites the piano-drenched \\"I Want To Be The Boy.\\" Overall, however, the once formidable White Stripes seem to have morphed into a joke that few others are cool enough to get.\\" Just say Jack do you adore me,\\" Meg slurs on the silly, throwaway tune recorded with punk-rocker Holly Golightly, \\"Its True That We Love One Another.\\" \\"Well I really would Holly but love really bores me\\" Jack answers.

B00004Z400|3.0|The Deftones.  Ah, the Deftones.  What can be said that hasn't already been uttered?  They are the semi-pioneers (no where near as revolutionary as Rage, not as talented or original as Tool) of the nu-metal scene.  Somehow though, they get lumped around with Tool and others as an art-metal band.  I have a problem with this; while, musically, Deftones are head-and-shoulders above most of the generic nu-metal stock they are perhaps the most pretentious, self-indulgent band about.  Art?  Not by a long stretch.<br />Take their lyrics for an example.  If one were to take Burroughs' Naked Lunch, strip it of all the talented prose, leave only the sex scenes and drop all satire you might have something the Deftones would write - only Chino has no talent in making the torrid scenes interesting; \\"I taste you much better / Off-teeth taste.\\"  Most of his images fail (\\"She claws at the walls / And pulls meat down.\\") and his narratives lack the drive to be anything more than the type of stories highschoolers brag about.  It's not a new thing to probe the dark side of sexuality through words or music, and this is not done in a new way.  The Damned, The Velvet Underground, Burroughs, Tool, Manson, NIN, Miller, it's all been done before - and better.<br />Compare, for instance, the S&M anthem on this album (\\"Knife Party\\") to the Velvet Underground's Venus in Furs.  Both have allusions to leather, violence and pain.  What Knife Party lacks, though, is the psychological drive - the juxtaposing of pain and pleasure - the allusions and the power of the 40-year-old-song.  Knife Party may be, though, the most well-written song on the album: Some of the images (\\"Come sit inside my bones\\" \\"In here, we are all anemic) work very well, but the song as a whole is bogged down by the ever-present lack of creativity (\\"I am the new king, I'll taste the queen\\"...\\"Get filthy\\") and it all falls into a shamble of bragging and pretense - losing it's identity and saying nothing.<br />Not that this albumis bad; musically and vocally it is wonderful.  There is a lot of emotive singing and wonderful riffing.  The lyrics bother me (while other band's horrible lyrics do not) because they seem to be trying to say something - and this pseudo-poetry bogs down the album as a whole.  Had Chino put together an album of true emotion, and not tried to play Burroughs; had he not written anthems of self-indulgence and just written - whether or not the lyrics were genius - this album would be more listenable.<br />Unfortunatly though, trying to make art and writing a song about getting head in a car doesn't work.  Even if Maynard is on it.<br />***1/2 out of *****

After only one listen, &quot;Miranda&quot; &amp; &quot;Come&quot; stand out, but there are many other great tracks full of the inventiveness that's only Lindsay Buckingham.

While this too could have been done in a way that makes the reader go through a turmoil of emotions so strong that getting through the book is difficult, Harper Lee softens it without taking away any of the facts. <br />The book tells of the world through a child unaffected by adult prejudices yet having to face them, and of a man, her father, who dares to live the way he believes is right: to be the same on the street as he would be in his own house. With nothing to hide, always straight, always true. <br />The book makes you think, and learn and realise--like a book ought to do.

0316666343|3.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" written by Alice Sebold is a breath-taking page turner that makes you cherish each day and the good memories that make life worth living.  The novel reminds you that life is short and can be gone in one moment.  Life is all about chances and learning.  About seeing people for whats inside and understanding that everyone has a definate beauty.  At the beggining of the novel you are introduced to young Susie Salmon, who speaks to her readers from Heaven.  At only 14-years old, she was stolen from Earth and the people she loved.  Now all she can do is watch life go one with out her- seeing her family overcome the tragedy of a daughter missing, her friends at school remember the girl who sat next to them in class, her murderer wisely play it safe, and her love try to swallow away the tears.<BR>I was so intrigued and entranced by this work of literature that I did not want to put it down.  The novel was truly different than any others I had read and the characters were so vivid and realistic that I could almost connect with them.  How each person handles death is amazing.  I saw how the little sister of Susie shut herself out from the real world, pretending how the whole murder didnt happen and trying to move on.  Thats exactly what I did when I found out my little cousin died.<BR>The suspense in this novel is riveting and unknowling places you on the end of your seat.  Susie's captor, a lonely man, neighbor to Susie's house, with a disturbed soul, comes into the picture through out the course of the chapters and your always wondering will his cover be blown.  You, as the reader, develop a hate for this man and a sympathy for Susie's family, especially Susie's strong and passionate father. Susie's father begins to notice the oddness of the man next door, suspecting he might have been involved with his daughters disappearance.  You almost want to jump into the novel and become a character that will save the day, putting Susie's kidnapper away and actingon the father's instinct.  But this book isnt about saving days- its about life and how its not always perfect.  How there always doesnt have to be a happy ending and picture perfect familes, just that you got to move on and embrace the living, while the dead can always stay in your heart.<BR>This book was fantastic until the end.  The ending for me just didnt cut it.  It was completely to far fetched for my mind to engage in and went a little too far in the whole death connection plot.  It was just too impossible and I didnt want this book to feel like a fairy tale.  It just began to feel like I was reading one of those sappy romance novels.<BR>I recommend \\"The Lovely Bones\\" for mature readers and any one who is about to go on a self-discovery mission.  This book helps you create morals and values about life.  May be you will like the ending more than I did.  But overall, I enjoyed this enduring novel and learned that you got to live life in the moment.  You never know when there will be no more chances.
0881030376|4.0|The story took place in Soledad, California during the Great Depression. There were two migrant workers mentioned in this book, George and Lennie. They were best friends. Their relationship symbolizes strong vs. weak. One of them always causes the other trouble. You will think the weak one always causes strong trouble right? But the truth is, the strong guy(Lennie) always causes the weak(George) trouble. Why was that? First Lennie cause tiny problems, then bigger and finally the biggest trouble. Now what and how should the weak one(George) help or save his best friend?<BR>I give the rate of 4 stars to this book. It's a great book for love, friendship and at a loss as what to do. The theme of this book is sometimes friends have to force themselves do something that he/she doesn't want to. I recommend this book to those young children and adults who have been lost as to what to do.
0316666343|3.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" written by Alice Sebold is a breath-taking page turner that makes you cherish each day and the good memories that make life worth living.  The novel reminds you that life is short and can be gone in one moment.  Life is all about chances and learning.  About seeing people for whats inside and understanding that everyone has a definate beauty.  At the beggining of the novel you are introduced to young Susie Salmon, who speaks to her readers from Heaven.  At only 14-years old, she was stolen from Earth and the people she loved.  Now all she can do is watch life go one with out her- seeing her family overcome the tragedy of a daughter missing, her friends at school remember the girl who sat next to them in class, her murderer wisely play it safe, and her love try to swallow away the tears.<BR>I was so intrigued and entranced by this work of literature that I did not want to put it down.  The novel was truly different than any others I had read and the characters were so vivid and realistic that I could almost connect with them.  How each person handles death is amazing.  I saw how the little sister of Susie shut herself out from the real world, pretending how the whole murder didnt happen and trying to move on.  Thats exactly what I did when I found out my little cousin died.<BR>The suspense in this novel is riveting and unknowling places you on the end of your seat.  Susie's captor, a lonely man, neighbor to Susie's house, with a disturbed soul, comes into the picture through out the course of the chapters and your always wondering will his cover be blown.  You, as the reader, develop a hate for this man and a sympathy for Susie's family, especially Susie's strong and passionate father. Susie's father begins to notice the oddness of the man next door, suspecting he might have been involved with his daughters disappearance.

B00008DZ81|3.0|At least we won't have to worry about Chris Columbus mucking about with Harry Potter III; whether it's his or his editor's choice to make the so-called 'action sequences' of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets long and boring [yes, we know the willow whomps, spiders are scary, Quidditch is dangerous] to pander to an American teen audience and leave out important pieces of plot becomes more obvious with some of the 19 extra bits of scenes in part II of the DVD.<br />Excellent actors have mere seconds on the screen.  It's also jarring to see how the child stars age between scenes and back again!<br />Those are my biggest quibbles.  Of course, the special effects are again great as is the quality of the DVD, with quieter scenes such as the portraits on the wall, and the duelling table the best, Dobbie the most fake, and Moaning Myrtle's dubbed voice most annoying.<br />Although the CD-ROM seems aimed at pre-teens, the movie itself is too frightening for younger children:  definitely PG.<br />After you've seen 'Chamber of Secrets' to say you've seen it, watch 'The Philosopher's Stone' again and reread the books.<br />As for 'The Prisoner of Azkaban', bring on Terry Gilliam!!
B000089RVX|5.0|For the last three years I've boycotted all RIAA labels, purchasing my music used, or buying music from indie bands... until today.  This CD is nothing short of amazing, truly the best music that I've heard in a LONG time.  It was well worth the money.  Simply amazing.
0553208845|5.0|Having heard good things about Siddhartha, I decided to check it out. A one day read, Siddharth is as equally short as it is profound. Although centered around one individual's spiritual journey through life, Siddhartha is much more than a trite diatribe on religion, or Buddhism for that matter. It is more of a cathartic illumination of self-discovery of the title character, Siddhartha, as he learns the lessons and meaning of life the hard way - through his own experiences.<br />A brahmin's quixotic and inquisitive son, initially Siddhartha devoutly adheres to the ascetic lifestyle of the shramana wanderer. A journey, though profligate and debaucherous in nature, teaches Siddhartha the importance of finding, as opposed to simply seeking. For, if we are to only seek, Siddhartha says, we merely uncover what we already know to be underneath. Conversely, if we set out to genuinely find, we will, indeed, gain new knowledge. It is only through sincere finding, says Siddhartha, that we can truly obtain wisdom and understanding. Overall, a short, yet immensely provocative and recommended read.
B00005JLD4|4.0|another chapter to add on to an atrociously confounding litany of poor insights on the part of unfortunately misguided, benign- in-intention world demagogues (we wish we could hop into a time machine and give all the buggers a right royal 'kick in the arse', don't we?). That said, this is not a film strictly about 'That Evil Racist', although it is a testament to Branaugh's thespian talent that the man doesn't come off reeking of that despicable label.  <br />Nary a false note in this exquisitely realised film. One of the few films regarding racial 'misunderstandings' (too light a word?), which eschews the 'monority of the week' tag it could effortlessly have settled for. For the most part, this deceptively slight film is markedly restrained, with director Noyce eliciting brave performances from his untrained leads. Granted, a poorly executed, sappy reunifiation scene between mother and daughters does, unfortunately, drain and unjustly cheapen some of the resonance held within the staggering final shot. Then again, it is based on a book by the protagonists' daughter, the most availably irrefutable outlook on 'what really happened'. <br />Single irk aside, the simple, linear narrative trajectory should, strictly speaking, have lapsed (read: degenerated) into an empty, soporific morality tale or outraged, absurdly overwrought, vacuous polemic. It is heartening to suspect that there are a miniscule number of racially infused 'genre films' being made that can have a gratifying (but not gratuitous) emotional (dare I say 'uplifting', do not be put off by the word.... just this once) effect on an audience. Two minor key but worthy efforts from Philip 'Patriot Games' Noyce in quick succession? (the other being 'The Quiet American', based on a Graham Greene novel dating from the late fifties, which attempts to 'symbolically' lay bare the antecedents of the Vietnam War) Hmmm. Maybe the Antipodian has embarked on a twelve film rehabilitation programme. <br />Note: I am not anexpert (or even dilletante, for that matter) in Australian history. I can not, as some people have, deliver judgement on the macro-inclusiveness/ factual efficacy problem of this films content. If anyone feels that it is not to be trusted, please site 'the facts' as they are/ seem to you, with references so we  may see that you're not a mere soapbox 'spewer of caustic vitriol' from some arbitrary place in the world. Unqualified opinions are cheap.

B00008LDPU|3.0|I must say that The Flight of Osiris has some of the most realistic animation I have ever seen. You could almost pass it by as a live action short. It seemed to be too short though. I have also seen three other shorts on the internet. The animation of The Second Renaissance isn't up to par in its style of animation as compared to Osiris' in computer animation. The story though is very interesting because it begins to outline the war between humans and machines. If you are more of a fan of anime you will be pleased with Program. I am not a big fan of Japanese anime but felt that it was well animated and had a somewhat interesting storyline. The last short available for viewing right now is A Detective Story. The animation for this just so so, but some of the visuals are interesting. The story though seemed to be very weak and poorly scripted. I would highly suggest this DVD to those who are big fans of The Matrix. Even if you aren't a fan of The Matrix and just a fan of animation, you should really check out The Flight of Osiris.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|Fleetwood does it again! Wow is all you'll be able to say after listening to this new, edgier style of the, now, Fleetwood Four. Without the soft pop vocals of Chris McVie, Fleetwood was able to change their sound into a heavier, more meaningful statement. Not anti-war, anti-violence, anti-bush like some rockers today are, Fleetwood doesn't try to use their fame to send political messages to their fans [ala Striesand]. Stevie's haunting 9/11 memories sum up the feeling we all shared on that fateful day. Illume and others all help bring closure and remembrance to the shared events in all of your lives that shape and mold us as people. With 18 songs, this album proves Fleetwood is a legend. Twice the number of tracks Britney or Christina would try to pass off as their own, Fleetwood puts others to shame. After 20+ years \\"dancing across the stages of the world\\"  Fleetwood comes back at number one, where they're sure to rule for years to come. Still writing their own lyrics, Nicks and Buckingham have again reunited in a style unseen since the early Buckingham Nicks album of the 70's, and they've still got it. A soundtrack, or memory track if I may, Say You Will, proves that you CAN teach an old dog [or dogs], new tricks.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|After Stevie's terribly bland and frequently poorly sung last album, TROUBLE IN...<BR>I approached this new Mac album a little uncertain. Here are my first impressions, summed up.<br />If you like \\"Classic Mac\\" then Tracks 1,4,5,7,8,9,11, 13 and 15 should be new faves for you. And that's 9 tracks, not bad. However, that's only HALF the tracks on the album! The other nine feature Stevie in poor voice or dull songs/arrangements. Lindsey brings the spice here - Mick and John always give 100%.<br />Here's my track by track opinion:<br />1. What The World Is Coming To--classic Mac, with Lindsey singing in a lower register than usual.<br />2. Murrow--sounds like the guitar picking in \\"Never Going Back Again\\"; it's one of \\"Lindsey's experiments\\" and you know what I mean; reminds me of stuff from his GO INSANE solo album<br />3. Illume (9-11) -- Stevie doesn't sound so good here; but the bass is great as is the percussion; not very memorable and I live in NYC...<br />4.Thrown Down -- classic Mac, and Stevie sounds better!<br />5. Miranda -- Lindsey's turn, now from the TUSK era, with a little LAW AND ORDER/\\"Johnny Stew\\" vocals; nice little ditty<br />6. Red Rover - Lindsey again; nice \\"quivering guitar\\" work here, sounds like something from his OUT OF THE CRADLE album<br />7. Say You Will-classic Mac; Stevie's a little \\"whiney/nasally\\" on this one, but the Mac plays so well together!<br />8. Peacekeeper - Lindsey and what sounds like a drum machine (IMPOSSIBLE!?), but it kicks along nicely and he doesn't goof around (too much) with the vocals much; so far, the most \\"pop\\" song by Lindsey on this album<br />9. Come-Lindsey and a co-writer; a little GO INSANE and CRADLE-sound here; mellow with some musical \\"dramatic tension\\" in the front end, so you're waiting for this song to explode-which it does! Go, Lindsey, go! Finally he lets some chops go!<br />10. Smile At You-yawn, typical Stevie; sounds like a leftover from her TROUBLE IN...album. <br />11. Running Through The Garden- Stevie wrote the words and sings, but two other guys wrote the music and Lindsey is REALLY able to cut loose on this one. Think the soaring solos on GO YOUR OWN WAY and I'M SO AFRAID! The drums and bass really push Lindsey on and on and on! I hope there's more like this on the remainin tracks - the band REALLY cooks on this and this song will be great played live!<br />12. Silver Girl-Stevie again. Nothing new here. Voice okay, music is interesting, but the previous track is such a standout, that this one brings things to a halt...<br />13. Steal Your Heart Away-nice, mid-tempo song, from the MIRAGE/TANGO period and Lindsey sounds GREAT on this!<br />14. Bleed To Love Her - we've all heard this off THE DANCE; this is about 30 seconds longer.<br />15. Everybody Finds Out -Stevie sings and this is very much BIG LOVE part two, which isn't a bad thing. Nice to hear Stevie and Lindsey in harmony, and he really goes at the acoustic guitar. This could be from their Buckingham/Nicks LP...<br />16. Destiny Rules-Stevie this time; voice pretty bad here; arrangement very TUSK-era with bass, drums and acoustic guitar all in one accord. Not bad...but nothing special. (Except for Lindsey's picking!)<br />17. Say Goodbye - BIG LOVE (Part 3?) or Theme From Midnight Cowboy? (Everybody's Talking At Me). Actually, it's Lindsey in his CRADLE mode-really nice guitar going on here!<br />18. Goodbye Baby-Stevie ends things on a slow, low-key groove. Voice sounds pretty nice here; pretty, wistful song.<br />If they had cut this to maybe 10-12 tracks, it would have been a great album. With 18 tracks, it's too L - O - N - G!
B000088E6D|5.0|I guess you could say I was impressed! Yes I know that old blue eyes would have liked this young fellow. There are some similarities between the young Mr. Bubl and the young Mr. Sinatra, but thankfully this is not a young fellow trying to copy the late, great legend. This is about a young fellow 'doing it his way' -- and succeeding.<BR>I sincerely believe this type of music has never, or will never be lost. Bubl, aided by his ever so successful producer and executive producer (Foster and Anka) has made these songs refreshing and new ---- again. Great song choices.<BR>A new generation will find these soothing sounds as enjoyable as we did when we were 'kids'....
B00006LLNU|5.0|I remember about 2 months ago when I typed in \\"Sigur Ros\\" in a alltheweb.com search engine and downloaded the song called, \\"Untitled 4.\\" I was literaly blown away. This album changed my life. I just sat in my room and listened to it at least 6 times in a row as I lied in my bed and cried my eyes out. The hauntingly, gorgeous music just rips through your emotional barrier, making you vunerable for change and reflection, such as a small child. You can be free again. Just don't be afraid to take an emotional voyage. <br />     I am still in a state of shock from hearing this album. For god's sake, just support the greatest musicians alive and buy this album. If you like Radiohead, Godspeed You! Black Emporer, Bjork, or Pink Floyd, this progressive style of beautiful music will just fill you with the most tranquil feeling of sensational, perpetual bliss, just every single note tearing through your heart as you remember all the sad things that have happened to you throughout your entire life. How could something so beautiful be so sad? That is mystery of the band itself: Sigur Ros. What every these musical prodigies are making next, it is going to change my life. I just know it.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Real enough that you can believe it all. Nobody is larger than life in this story, none of the events are fantastic in anyway, but taken all together this film is epic. John Huston's best.<br />Not having this film available on DVD is tragically sad.
0316666343|5.0|I was wary of this book.  After all, the whole premise--girl murdered, girl watches over family from above and sees how they MOURN her--hopelessly teenage.<br />But the book is more, I think, a commentary on how the death of the child, a parent's essential inability to totally protect their child/daughter reverbrates through the family over and over, uniquely touching each member.  This family isn't all right--the mom bugs out, the dad gets obsessed and is viewed as a little freaky, the remaining daughter tries to be perfect and becomes touchingly protective of the father, the younger brother is angry about the sister who goes away (is murdered) and then the mother who just goes away, too.  There's no healing these scars.  And that is how it would be for a family in this situation.  And it is accurate and touching how Susie's character becomes frozen in time, forever 14, even as sister marries and has a baby, brother grows up.  We'll never know what Susie would have been.<br />The one discordant note for me was how Susie serendipitously returns to earth briefly through a strange friend she touched on her way out of the world at the time of her death.  She returns to have sex with her old Junior High boyfriend.  Hmmm.  Why did we need this moment in the book?  She's actualized now--she's had sex--she can rest in peace?  How fifties.  While I find the fleeting moments when Susie is seen or sensed or felt by her family as all too true of a sensation of a grieving family and therefore good and comforting, I found the little sexual episode as unnecessary and a moment when the book threatened to lose its' credibility.<br />But the the notion that the family does not \\"get over\\" the death but integrates it as a fact of their family history is satisfying as is the little plot twist about the eventual death of the uncaught perpetrator.<br />Read it; it's great.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Not a politican, not a diplomat, Patton was an officer before everything else. The film depicts this strutting character at the height of glory and his lowest ignominy during World War II. George C. Scott's performance is masterful, very much his best work.
B00008G9JM|5.0|BRAVO!    By far the most inguiness work by Ian and the lads! A continuous two sides of woven majestic brillance, with time changes and complex instrumentation threw out.  A PASSION PLAY is  progressive's rocks last stand as it were for after 1973 things began to go south not only for Tull but  for the entire kit and kabottle. Ian's best lyrics and a true \\"Masterpeice\\" if ever there was one. The pantheon /pinnical of Tull's career and argubly their best lineup.      A bit avant garde for the avarge listener so oviously a lot of none understanding to what tull or Ian  was really doing, really all about and many can easily miss the inner message behind the lyrics...very profound.....Never the less the ultimate  Tull record at their peak period! A shame this was their last real true lp as far as moving ahead artistically is concerned...one for the ages..Ian deep in your heart i know you know this was it, Tulls Peak!    I am sorry but else where i stated otherwise but this I think is the mother of all concept albums, this, Pawn Heats and then The lamb Lies down On Broadway! In that order!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Since Godsmack first started to gain popularity at nu-metal's height in the late 90's, the band has stuck with their tried but true alt-metal sound.  Now, with most of the bands they were once associated with left in the dust, Godsmack continues to move forward with \\"Faceless\\".  While I found their debut album and \\"Awake\\" good albums, both of which didn't offer much diversity and sounded very alike, but the band tries to improve on that and \\"Faceless\\" is a surprisingly above average album.  \\"Straight Out of Line\\" sounds like a made for radio single, and it's a half decent track, but the title track, \\"Changes\\", \\"Releasing the Demons\\", and \\"Serenity\\" are better than expected tracks that elevate the album.  However, even with the hit \\"I Stand Alone\\" from the Scorpion King soundtrack here, \\"Faceless\\" is too short, and the song \\"I ******* Hate You\\", while adrenaline pumping, is inane and is the definition of album filler.  All that aside, \\"Faceless\\" is a better than expected album, and is by far Godsmack's best to date.
B00008972S|5.0|Having played the role of Bernardo in many theatres, I have grown very attached to the film West Side Story.  The new DVD version is flawless:  The colous are clear and bold, Bernstein's music even more crisp and clear.  And unlike most 2nd disks on DVD with useless filming to upcharge you, the 2nd disk here is very impressive.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|My kitty cat likes to play with a ball of yarn that smells like fish. I will not let her play with yarn on my furnature because I do not like that \\"fish smell\\". So, needless to say, I do not own any fish. I just own a ball of yarn that smells like fish. My kitty sometimes goes out at night. I wonder where she goes? I wonder if she would rather be there instead of here with me? Sometimes, I think that my kitty is doing me a favor by staying with me. When she goes out she possibly has a tom cat trying to persuade her to run off with him. If I ever find that.....CAT it will be bad news. Kinda like Second Hand News but without the cool instrumentation or Mr. Buckingham singing. Come to think of it I haven't seen my cat all day then again I haven't been home yet. I use to have a dog but he ran away. Now it is just my cat and myself....Go purchase Say you Will it is a good c.d.
B00008DDXC|5.0|If you liked the 1st film, you'll love this one, specially the 19 deleted scenes!<br />With a tighter plot, incredible special efects, even better acting from Daniel, Rupert and Emma, and wonderful new characters, this is by far much better than the first movie!<br />A must have for every HP fan!
B00006RCPM|4.0|Minority Report - This movie got a bad reputation, but its creativity and moral questions are what keep the movie interesting. pretty soon maybe we will all be wearing numbers so the government can track you!! Spielberg, although not the greatest director or movie maker, does a better job at dropping subtle kubrick style hints questioning the world we live in. Tom Cruise is a good actor and the others were good too but the moral questioning is the movie. I like it.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Although \\"Say You Will\\" marks the return of Lindsey Buckingham to Fleetwood Mac, it also marks the departure of Christine McVie, a member of the group since 1970's \\"Kiln House.\\"  Christine's soulful songwriting, her helm at the keyboards, and her expressive voice were key factors in band's makeup, especially when the direction turned more toward pop-rock.  Christine's contributions in songwriting and singing were key in keeping some ground in the bluesy history of Fleetwood Mac.  Christine, turning 60 this July, has called it a career (and God bless her.)  \\"Say You Will\\" is a fine attempt to carry on without her.  <br />The album is bursting with signature Buckingham arrangements and guitar virtuosity, and the harmonies between Buckingham and rock goddess Stevie Nicks are a joy to behold.  Still, the album sounds more like 2 solo albums from Lindsey and Stevie, with occasional nods to the duo's past in Fleetwood Mac.   The best songs are, indeed, the collaborative efforts.  In \\"Running Through the Garden,\\" Stevie reveals \\"until she herself became the toxic garden, always frightened, no future at all,\\" and you know she is engaging you in one of those autobiographical tales, not unlike she did her songs in \\"Rumours.\\"  Lindsey's arrangements and guitar work are the perfect complement to her lyrics and vocal style.  Lindsey contributes \\"Bleed To Love Her,\\" a song first heard live on \\"The Dance.\\" \\"Bleed\\" may well be one of Mac's finest love songs, with Lindsey exploring the nature of a lover just coy enough to keep you wanting more. (\\"How she takes my breath away, pretending that she's not there.\\") Lindsey and Stevie mesh their vocals seamlessly and make this song a standout.  <br />More high points on this 18 song album are Stevie's \\"Illume (9-11,) which she wrote about \\"what happened on 9-11,\\" according to \\"Ask Stevie\\" on her website, The Nicks Fix,  \\"Murrow Turning Over in His Grave, \\" a Lindsey tour-de-force, \\"Say You Will,\\" \\"Peacekeeper,\\" which is a timely first single, and Stevie's \\"Silver Girl,\\" a revelatory look at her own life in the spotlight. <br />This is not to say that Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are only sitting in the background.  Both are solid performers and both add their flourishes to the music.  Mick gets to show off a little in \\"Miranda.\\" The liner notes make reference to \\"additional performers,\\" including Sheryl Crow and Christine McVie, but I have strained to pick out spots where I can hear them.  Perhaps it is Christine rounding out the harmonies in \\"Bleed To Love Her.\\" <br />This is indeed, a solid effort by the band, worthy to rank somewhere between \\"Tango In The Night\\" and \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" in the hierarchy of Mac releases.  Still, Christine McVie's blues-based pop songs were a glue that kept Fleetwood Mac together, and she is going to be missed.  \\"Say You Will\\" is all the evidence you need.

B00005JLEU|3.0|After hearing all the great reviews from various sources for Spirited Away, I decided to buy this DVD and prepare myself to enjoy a spectacular film.  Much to my dismay, it did not come close to all the hype.  Even the Academy makes serious blunders on occasion.<br />There are very few great films, and for me, there are 5 key points that need to be met to make a great animated film.<br />1) First thing you see is the Animation, and admittedly, Spirited Away was done very well.  I was impressed by the animation, the details.<BR>2) A good story.  Spirited Away lost it in this category.  While the story I will admit is interesting, it is a far cry from a GREAT story.  It is way too bizarre, and I suspect this is due to cultural differences.  I would suspect that Asian cultures would appreciate this film a lot more.<BR>3) Character Development.  This was done fairly well in the film, and you come to associate with the character once you get through the bizarre story.<BR>4) Music.  I feel this can be one of the most important factors that bring the rest of the factors together (If they are good).  Music will set the mood to the whole story, and I feel this is another point where Spirited Away let me down.<BR>5) Originality.  This is not as major of a factor, but one nonetheless.  Hands down, Spirited Away is very original.<br />I maintain that so far, my favorite animated movie is \\"The Lion King\\".  It meets all of these points with flying colors.  Some of you may argue that point on #5 citing similarities to \\"Kimba the White Lion\\".  I do not see a basis for that accusation.<br />In conclusion, the film was interesting, but I definitely cannot give it 5 stars.  I will not give up on this filmmaker though, and plan on renting \\"Kiki's Delivery Service.\\"
1577311523|5.0|This refers to the audiocassette recording of \\"The Power of Now\\".<br />This review is in the way of an open letter to Mr. Eckhart Tolle.<br />I have many thoughts about your work The Power of Now  - wait... bad start - shouldn't I be in a thought-free and ego less state of being in order to produce a worthy comment that reflects truth in all its untarnished glory.  Let me try again. I instinctively \\"know\\" that the thesis that you present in your book is as \\"right as rain\\" or at least as right as that limited mind orientated concept can express. (Life gets complicated in the realms of the \\"Now and Not Now\\".) I also feel that your simply and direct presentation of Eastern esoteric philosophy is brilliant and moreover that you yourself must be an enlighten being and if not, then you ought to be. Forgive the cynicism but that is the result of the discomfort that this imperfect comprehension of mine felt at the close of your work.<br />You see, this precarious mind of mine is all I have and it was God given. Insane, unconscious or destructive as you claim it might be, apart from some intuitive something that's going on in my personal universe, it's all that I have.<br />As good as you are at representing the case for the sublime entity; apart from one passing mention of \\"lila\\" - the divine drama, you seem to overlook the fact that it was the good Lord himself who created humanity and then placed it well and truly in the mud of time/space and physicality.  Did I miss something?<br />I'm not blaming you personally for what appears to this defective consciousness as faults in cosmic design, my problem is with the creator himself - which probably comes down to the same thing.  Why, oh why Mr. Tolle, why all the suffering - why the fear, why create deluded and imperfect creatures in the first place whose pain is very real. \\"A divine game\\" is that the best that you can come up with. Excuse me, what is divine about suffering and what kind of sick game is it where humanity can only achieve redemption by an act, which according to the best of its understanding is clearly suicidal. Maybe Saramago's Jesus had a point when he beseeched humanity to forgive God, as he didn't know what he was doing.<br />Once again, forgive the cynicism if I say that this is not a judgement; humanities pain and discomfort is a God inflicted fact. And when I am most aware of the limitations of my intellect and my ego frailties and have a glimpse of something beyond, it terrifies me that the only explanation in the offering is that the whole of creation is nothing more than an act of cosmic masturbation.<br />And yes, I would recommend this work, as I instinctively feel it is brilliant.only achieve redemption by an act, which according to the best of its understanding is clearly suicidal.

B00008J4P5|5.0|WOW, what a great album, thanks to all those reviews that convinced me to buy it...money well spent.  As far as sound goes, theres a little bit of everything 70's here, but not in that forced, pretentious, affected Lenny Kravitz way....this is genuine.  Theres a little bit of Bowie, Queen, Zeppelin and Guns 'n Roses too (!?)  All that is tied up with a Billy Corgan Smashing Pumpkins kind of polish (sans his tendancy to overproduce everything) and if you can understand all of that.....well then you should buy this album!  As most everyone else says they may not be the saviors of rock music, but they sure sound like they want to be.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is indeed a wonderful movie and if it can spread some positive messages of love, trust and friendship, then all the better. I saw this in the theater and I never heard any screams from the little kids. I saw little kids in the theater when I went to see \\"Hannibal\\" so I wouldn't place too much confidence in American parents' judgements!!!
0441172717|4.0|After seeing part of the movie (as much as I could stand to watch), I've always avoided this book, but after reading some reviews of it, I decided it was probably just the movie that stunk and gave it a try.<br />I liked the book.  I thought the plot was good, and the characters were solid, and I was always interested to find out what happened.  But the plot never really grabbed me, I never had to keep reading to find out what happened, so it went a litt;e slow for me.  But I think that may just be a personal preference more than any shortcoming of the story.  I thought it got a little too involved in the ritual and the customs of the Fremen, but what I was more interested in were the characters of Maud'dib and Jessica and the Atriedes and Harkonnen families.<br />I'll probably at leat read the next book to see if I get any more interested, but if I don't I probably won't go any farther with the series.  Overall, though, I thought this book was interesting and well-written if not the best thing for me personally.
B000002IWQ|4.0|I actually bought this CD by accident, but I'm glad I did.  Not for casual Rush fans, this album contains some of their more obscure tracks, the ones that didn't get radio airtime.  That notwithstanding it's an amazing compilation.  If you're a BIG Rush fan then this is for you.
B00006690F|5.0|This C.D deals with the issues people( not only him) have. I believe that he is the only rapper who is worth listening to. He's got a sense of style where he can make  song sound cool and  sad or sometimes funny.eg: Sing For the Moment, and Square Dance or Without me. I think Eminem is awsome.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|First off let me say that I am a big fan of the way Lindsey Buckingham can craft tunes. With striking lush vocals and intricate guitar parts he is appreciated by many a fan and deserves much respect for putting this disc together. That said however, no one in the current Fleetwood Mac is dragging their feet either. Stevie has written some great songs for this album and her delivery is strong and heart felt. The grooves that John McVie and Mick Fleetwood assemble could make the most lethargic drone tap their feet in joy, ie; the title track 'Say you Will'.<BR>There's alot of music on this disc with eighteen songs clocking in over 76 minutes. Most of the songs are stellar while some don't do much for me, like the song 'Come' with a chorus that sounds like it belongs in a Audioslave tune. I felt it took a few tunes until the record caught it's stride. Favorites for me include: 'Thrown Down' a catchy Nicks tune with a sweet chorus. \\"Red Rover\\" is a frantic Buckingham gem with a bit of a disturbed chorus, the only gripe is that I thought it needed bass from McVie to give it more bottom. \\"Say you Will\\" is a perfect pop tune delivered compliments of Stevie. \\"Peacekeeper\\" is the haunting first released single. \\"Smile at You\\" is an understated Nicks tune draped in lush vocals and melodic bass from John. \\"Running through the Garden\\" I thought is a good uptempo tune but with a keyboard part that sounds a little too 80's like. \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" is a beautiful sunny tune with lyrics \\"all alone we go all day after day/all alone we suffer oh to steal your heart away\\". My personal favorite track  is \\"Say Goodbye\\" penned by Buckingham. It's some of his most divine guitar playing wedded to some of his most self revealing lyrics. It's so sadly beautiful you'll find the images evoking strong emotions. You'll have to hear it to believe song crafting is still this good. This record leaves me optimistic about the state of popular music today and points to finely crafted songs not marketing hype.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Why isn't Robbie a big star in the US?  It seems that the world knows what the US doesn't - that Robbie is the most original singer/songwriter to come along in a very, very long time!  He's charming, adorable and writes original and singable songs that he sings in his own inimitable style and swagger.  His infectious, randy charm comes through in songs like &quot;Handsome Man&quot; and &quot;Me and My Monkey&quot;.  This whole cd is defintely a must own, as is the rest of the Robbie Williams discography!  No one can do it like Robbie can!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This CD is another classic just like Hybrid Theory and Reanimation. If you dont own their CDs and arent in the LPU you are krazy. Heres my opinion on all the songs:<br />Foreward 0/0- just an intro of mike beating the [tar] out of a cd burner<BR>Dont Stay 9/10- my least favorite but its still an amazing song<BR>Somewhere I Belong 9/10- actually its probably a 10 but its outplayed so I dont like it as much.<BR>Lying From You 10/10- not one of my favorites on the CD but still worthy of a perfect 10.<BR>Hit the Floor 10/10- great lyrics... amazing rap verses with a good hardcore chorus.<BR>Easier to RUn 10/10- soft song. kicks arse. if u like crawling youll like this track.<BR>Faint 10/10- one of my favorites. this song is amazing and im so glad that its probably the 2nd single. one of mikes best raps ever.<BR>Figure.09 10/10- not one of my favorites on the album but still worthy of a perfect 10.<BR>Breaking the Habit 10/10- my favorite on the CD. Amazing vocals from Chester and live strings in the backround.<BR>From the Inside 10/10- this is also one of my favorites. great lyrics.<BR>Nobodys Listening 10/10- pure rap. mike does an amazing job on this track and the flute in the backround is awesome.<BR>Session- 9/10- this is just an instrumental as cure for the itch was to Hybrid Theory and Technique is to the Hybrid THeory EP. Joe did a great job on this track.<BR>NUmb 10/10- an amazing finale to the CD. This song probably ties Breaking the Habit and Faint as my favorites.
B00006RIO7|4.0|The songs are well done overall. Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah are great. Zellweger is good but not quite up to Zeta Jones. Gere doesn't come thru in the CD as well as in the movie, primarily due to the lack of visual stimulous.  The items that keep this disc from beingt a 5-star are the overuse of the drums, creating somewhat of an incessant rock beat--which chicagoe/kansas city jazz of the 20'3 & 30's doesn't have--and the [bad] pop/hip-hop \\"extras\\", which to my ears are sheer junk and don't belong at all.  The recorded music industry doesn't have a clue how to keep from messing up an otherwise good product.
B000071ZZI|5.0|I purchased this DVD just off of want I had heard about it. I must say that this movie does not disappoint. From the very beginning it locks you into this story of a CIA agent/assasin (Matt Damon) by the name of Jason Bourne. Bourne has no memory of his name, history, or profession. He was floating in the ocean with two holes in his back when group of men found him. He was thought to be dead by his superiors. As the story unfolds, he befriends a German traveler (Franka Potenta) who helps him in his quest to discover his identity. I will say that the action scenes in this movie are spectacular from the fight scenes to the car chases. The use of martial arts within the movie were pretty impressive and exhilirating to watch. Jason Bourne, while trying to find his identity, had to fight off attempts by his boss (Chris Cooper) to kill him and cover up his \\"failed mission\\".The use of technology in this movie is just superb. The computer gadgetry was top-notch. Bourne had a bank account implanted into his hip. Even once during the movie they were sitting in a cafe and he surveyed the place and gave feedback to Marie (Potente) within minutes. Even stating that two waitresses were left-handed and the best place to find a gun was in the cab of the truck outside. All of this and he still didn't know who he was. The action takes you from Switzerland to Paris and is a thrill-ride throughout. This movie just never loses you from the word \\"Go\\". The action is non-stop and Matt Damon does an excellent job of acting out the personality of Bourne with passion and convincibility-if I can say that. He looked like he could have boyish-charm, but deep inside he was a \\"30 million dollar\\" killing machine.I feel that Doug Liman did an awesome job in developing the story and the characters. It doesn't hurt that he had some great actors too. I think that Franka Potente is an up-and-coming star in the making. She's already got me saying \\"shizer!\\". Job well done!
B00006CXXU|2.0|This CD ...... I ain't gone lie she can really sing but every song on the album sounds the same... So ... boring and oh my God Christina get over the \\"you can't hold me back\\" and the \\"I am beautiful\\" mood because your style now ... and that's life. I am telling you guys DON'T BUY the album because it ain't all that. She has this dark side that I just don't like anymore... And plus she has grown up into the biggest ... now...
B0002KQNL8|4.0|An army truck with barrels of a bizarre chemical called Trioxen passes by a small California town, suddenly one of the barrels fall off into a ditch by the cemetery. A young boy named Jesse (Michael Kenworthy) joins a club with town toughguy tweens named Billy (Thor Van Lingren) and Johnny (Jason Hogan) sneek into the graveyard and the ditch where they discover the lost barrell of Trioxen, they accidently bust it open unleashing the deadly gas that brings the dead back to life as brain-eating, fast moving and intelligent zombie creatures but can anything stop these monstrous beings?<br /><br />Comical sequel to the 1985 horror-comedy masterpiece \\"Return of the Living Dead\\" is a good and funny sequel that delivers some of the stuff that made the original a classic. The film co-stars James Karen and Thom Matthews reprising their roles again but as different gravediggers and there's a couple of sexy chicks like Susanne Sydner and Marsha Dietlein to please any horror movie loving guy. I do dig the dark humor in this movie such as the severed talking zombie head saying \\"Get that damned screwdriver out of my head\\" which made me laugh my butt off, there is some good gore and gooey effects like a zombie getting his face punched through and brain-munching. Tarman from the original movie makes a special appearence in this movie, but the problem with this movie is that it seems like a rehash of the first movie and feels like it's making fun of itself, while not the best sequel of the series cause that would be part 3 by Brian Yuzna it's still a worthwhile and funny sequel.<br /><br />This DVD contains great picture and sound despite the soundtrack altered while the original soundtrack is heard in the French language version and the only extras is trailer and audio commentary.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Return of the Living Dead\\", \\"Return of the Living Dead 3\\", \\"Evil Dead 2\\", \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", \\"The Stuff\\", \\"Resident Evil Trilogy\\", \\"Day of the Dead (1985)\\", \\"Night of the Living Dead (1968 and 1990)\\", \\"Fido\\", \\"Bride of Chucky\\", \\"Land of the Dead\\", \\"Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)\\", \\"Hell of the Living Dead\\", \\"Nightmare City\\", \\"Redneck Zombies\\", \\"The Monster Squad\\", \\"Night of the Comet\\", \\"The Serpent and The Rainbow\\", \\"Undead\\", \\"Junk\\", \\"Versus\\", \\"Grindhouse\\", \\"Dead Alive (a.k.a.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|This album is already being played in public places--I heard it at a restaurant the other day.  The charm is still there and Lindsey's musicianship shines through.   If you like this, I would recommend &quot;Out of the Cradle&quot;, which is arguably his best solo work.
B000069AUI|5.0|The tracks off of this cd are going to be played on classic rock stations within a few years.  This cd is going to be &quot;worn out&quot; from too much listening.  I cannot believe someone would call this a bad cd.  This is an original sound that I would compare to Pink Floyd.  Every song is excellent.  Well worth the money.  Buy it.
B00008PW3O|4.0|I was very excited to pick up Fleetwood Mac's new one and decided to pay alittle extra to get the 2CD limited edition version.  The music definitely shines at times reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac at their best!  I found a couple of the Lindsey Buckingham tracks alittle strange though.  <BR>My only gripe really is the packaging of the 2CD set which I feel may not be very durable over time.  The bound booklet is decent and I assume is the same one that would come in the regular single CD version and contains complete lyrics and some photos.  But since it is physically bound to the booklike CD jacket, you can't remove the booklet and the CD jacket's front/back creases are already wearing alittle.  The bottoms of the built-in cardboard sleeves for the CDs are slightly opened (intentionally?), and I am fearful that over time I will need to tape the bottom of these sleeves to keep the CDs from dropping out the bottom of the sleeves.  The CD also comes with a fold-out poster containing 36 black and white shots (in film format) of the band members in the studio. The problem is I have no intention of hanging this poster, and there is no pocket in the CD to house this poster for safe keeping.  You basically have to fold it up and slip it between the pages of the booklet of CD sleeves and hope it doesn't ever fall out by accident. The back cover appeared to contain track listings (which I always find convenient).  However, when I took off the shrink wrap, I found it was only a piece of carboard that I could either throw away or again slip inside the CD jacket...and again hope it doesn't fall out by accident.  Oh-the back cover is really blank with no print.  So if I want to know what track I am listening to, I have to thimb through the booklet to find the track listings.  That's alittle bit of a nuisance.  <BR>To summarize, I like most of the new songs alot. But I feel the packaging could have been designed alittle better..
B00008PW3Q|5.0|The new album is a must have.  Fleetwood Mac absolutely shines with this new album.  The songs are wonderfully written and guaranteed you will listen to this album over and over.  Fleetwood Mac hasn't remained around as long they have for no reason.
0385507755|5.0|Moved, still catching breath.
B00005JLF5|4.0|The first season of DS9 serves as a nexus from TNG, but it also stands on firm ground as fine science fiction. The introduction of the main characters (all wonderfully cast, btw), along with many memorable episodes (e.g., Duet) easily make viewing a pleasure.<br />Every TV show goes through a breaking-in period, and DS9 was no exception. There are certainly some raw moments here, but in the perspective of what a truly outstanding series that DS9 quickly developed into, those moments are still fun to watch.<br />The production qualities of this DVD set are top-notch. Picture, sound, packaging, and the special features all show care and attention-to-detail. <br />My highest recommendation goes out to this show and to this DVD series. And looking past this first season, let me tell 'ya....it's only going to get better!
B00004WG2X|5.0|This version is the true evil. I watched it for 6 times now since  the purchasing two weeks ago. And now I am kind of additive to it. I can't stop wanting it. My wife shared the same feeling with me. This is the true Jane Austen.   I also watched A&E 96 version, which is  a real angel, I guess, too good for me -- I finished it with great anger. I particularly don't like the acting of Mrs. Bennet, it is all pretentious.    *------------------------------------------------------  * a more thorough review that I posted for 1995 verion:  *------------------------------------------------------  I cannot comment on this film (1995 A&E version)without comparing it with the 1980 BBC's version. If I hadn't seen the 1980 BBC's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", I would probably adore this 1995 film like many people here. However, I must say that except the lavish decoration, this film is far inferior to the 1980 BBC's P&P in every respect: screenplay, performance, music, etc.     It's a pity that quite a few people are mistaken Jane Austen's spirited novel with a simple romantic story; one reviewer even praised the film as an epic. In her book, Austen writes about a serious topic with subtle humor, which is exactly what A&E version fails to capture. Both movies have added some lines or scenes based on the original novel, however, the Garvie/Rintoul is more true to the novel. Some people like A&E version because of the \\"extras\\" it offers, while some of these are described on the book such as Mr. Dancy's preventing his sister eloping with Wickham and later his searching for Lydia and Wickham in London, others are merely screenwriter's add-ons, three examples here, the first is Colin Firth came out of his bath and saw Jennifer Ehle playing with a dog, the second is the wet Colin Firth encountered Jennifer Ehle unexpectedly in Pemberly, and the third is Colin Firth practices fencing to show his determination of winning back Jennifer Ehle's affection. These are ridiculous and unnecessary. Atthe same time, the A&E version has missed or changed some important scenes that are essential to the book. For instance, Lizzy's first piano performance at Lucas' ball (instead, she went off to teach Lydia how to behave). Most of the interesting dialogues between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley are completely gone. Two in particular, one is after Mr. Darcy tells how he admires Elizabeth's beautiful eyes, the other is Miss Bingley's compliments about Mr. Darcy's writing. One dialogue is badly rewritten: in the book Mr. Darcy gives two reasons why he doesn't want to join Elizabeth and Miss Bingley in their walking about the room, here in the A&E film, he's only shown half intelligent and sharp by omitting one reason. Also the part where Elizabeth observes and analyzes his father's attitude towards his wife is replaced by \\"daily proof\\". The last part where she analyzes how Mr. Darcy falls in love with her at the first place should have been kept.    Regarding the acting, old BBC's version is more close to the period. Characters are more lady and gentlemen like. Characters in the A&E version, on the contrary, do not behave as courtly as they should. Upon seeing Ehle crossing her arms when listening to her father's comments on her refusal to Mr. Collins' proposal, I dislike this Elizabeth considering her very rude.    The A&E version is entirely miscast with the exception of Charlotte or maybe Mr. Bennet. Jennifer Ehle misinterprets Lizzy totally. She's not even physically up to the description in the novel. She always reads her lines in a hurry and even needs to catch her breath in order to finish the sentence. She doesn't show any wit and appears proud and rude like the two Miss Bingley (when she went to visit her sick sister and came across with Colin Firth [another \\"extra\\"], he appeared much more polite than she). Elizabeth Garvie's Lizzy is adorable, witty and beautiful. She IS Elizabeth, no doubt. Colin Firth is not a proud Darcy but rather a miserable one with gloomy eyes. David Rintoul may lack Firth's sensuality, but he IS the proud and satirical Mr. Darcy. A&E's Jane is not as sweet and beautiful as Sabina Franklyn's Jane. Bingley is OK but could be more candid. His sisters are hateful. Miss Bingley doesn't show any interest in pursuing Darcy (in the early BBC's version, Miss Bingley is perfectly portrayed by Marsha Fitzalan). Mr. Wickham is not as handsome and attractive as described in the book. Alison Steadman's Mrs. Benetts is nothing but noisy, Priscilla Morgan's Mrs. Bennet is a simple-minded mother whose entire interest is to have her 5 daughters well married. A&E's Mary is abominable while Tessa Peake-Jones's Mary is a young lovely bookworm with lot of comments. I particularly dislike David Bamber's Mr. Collins. He is not funny at all and appears despicable, Malcolm Rennie's Collins, instead is much more comical with his distinct long figure, awkward movements and some details such as the non-stop apology. Lady Catherine de Bourgh is OK but lack the bossiness as Judy Parfitt's portrayal of her.     The music in 1980's version is a perfect match to the film.    The A&E version is a fine productin and a great entertainment, but definitely not Austen.
B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck is one of us. Just look at those hands on the album cover for his latest effort, You Had It Coming (Epic) ? fingers don?t get much greasier. That's because Beck is a vintage-car nut, and sometimes, as he's often admitted, he'd rather be under the hood of a car than play his guitar. But when he does ply his axe, amazing things happen. Springboarding from the new directions he took on 1999's adventurous Who Else!, Beck continues to search for the ideal union between techno beats and good old-fashioned guitar rock. This is admittedly dangerous territory, as other veteran musicians have tried to embrace similar postmodern styles with embarrassing results, but Coming pulls it off. \\"Suspension\\" is the best example of this mating, combining U2-like chiming riffs with shuffling percussion and plaintive keyboards.  <br /> The touching \\"Nadia\\" is another benchmark; its first 0:50 features traditional yet otherworldly guitar noodling before the drum loops kick in to fuel the remainder of the track. The punchy \\"Left Hook\\" is mainly driven by the beats, while the gnarly \\"Rosebud\\" comes closest to auralizing the grease that drips from the album's cover shot. Only a raucous cover of the blues standard \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" sports full vocals, courtesy of London chanteuse Imogen Heap. But like the revving engine that opens \\"Roy's Toy,\\" this practically all-instrumental album will get your motor running.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Lindsey Buckingham has always been known as a kind of \\"mad genius\\" when it comes to his production work in the recording studio. It something fans have come to love about his solo work. Whole albums of the mad genius. But never in his career has Lindsey been so clearly over the top brilliant than on the new Fleetwood Mac album \\"Say You Will.\\" And never in the history of the band has he been able to mix his own style with that of the hit making machine of Fleetwood Mac so perfectly. That said, \\"Say You Will\\" is a breakout album for Stevie Nicks. This is the most experimental she has ever been. Using her voice as an instrument, as part of the intricacies of the song itself. The standout songs are Lindseys \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" and Stevies \\"Illume (9-11).\\" There are so many wonderful things going on in the former you feel at some point you may experience overload and your head will explode. (Always listen to a Buckingham produced song with stereo separation for the best effect). And Stevie makes the listener feel her words rather than just hear them in the latter. She has never been stronger or sexier than she is on this album. Christine McVie is glaringly absent on the album and while you stop short of saying sorely missed, the incredible optimism that she can bring to to the Buckingham/Nicks Fleetwood Mac leaves the listener with the uncomfortable feeling that something just isn't right. With the experimentaion on this cd, it will be interesting to see what the typical Fleetwood Mac fan might think of \\"Say You Will.\\"
B0000026KQ|5.0|Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop, along with Blow by Blow and Wired, is one of the most important albums of rock guitar. Simply put, to this listener Guitar Shop is Beck's best album. It contains a wide range of styles and awesome musicianship. It is also filled with unique emotion from each member of the trio. Of course, this is Jeff Beck's disc, and it contains some of his best playing ever. <br />This album is so finely crafted that you don't even realize there is no singer. Beck takes the spotlight, and he pulls off the melodies and solos like no one else could, proving that he is not only the greatest guitarist ever, but one of the greatest general musicians as well. With Guitar Shop, Jeff Beck shows once again that he is the best.<br />Every track on this disc is excellent, there is no filler. \\"Savoy,\\" \\"Where Were You,\\" and \\"Sling Shot\\" are among the highlights. \\"Where Were You\\" is both the technical and emotional highlight of Guitar Shop, and perhaps of Beck's career. It may be one of the most technically difficult songs of his career to pull off, but it contains so much of his heart and soul that you cannot help but take notice and be moved while listening to it. Cheerleading? Maybe, but you can't argue with emotion. <br />\\"Behind the Veil,\\" the reggae track, is another highlight, containing another healthy dosage of soul and mastery. It should be noticed here that Beck has innovated an amazing path in the way rock guitar playing is executed. He does not use a pick on this disc. It's all with his thumb and fingers, which leaves him totally unrestricted, and his playing is really at a peak because of this.<br />Guitar Shop is one of the most important and stunning rock guitar records ever. Words have trouble describing it, and I feel no need to go any futher. Put it on and listen for yourself.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Up to this point, I would put myself in the \\"casual fan\\" category: have grown up w/ \\"Rumors\\", really dug \\"The Dance\\", but am by no means a lifelong fanatic. This CD may change that.<BR> First off, Lyndsey Buckingham's guitar playing is absolutely amazing, and really shows his versatilty. Acoustic fingerpicking, weird overdubs/layered parts, all-out rock shredding; whatever sounds good for the song is what he plays. Since the band no longer has an official keyboardist, this is more of a guitar album than one might have expected.<BR> I kind of expected this to sound like a new recording of an old band. While the trademark harmonies and song styles are still there, this really sounds modern in production as well as energy. Stevie and Lyndsey are singing with as much passion as ever, and the rhythm section of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, while usually in more of a supporting role, can really rock when the song calls for it. <BR> Most \\"reunion\\" projects that involve new tunes sound like stale imitations of a band's heyday. \\"Say You Will\\" not only stands up to the classic albums of Buckingham-Nicks era Fleetwood Mac, it shows that they're a better band now, and just as creative (if not more) as ever. Highly recommended to Mac fans of any level.

B000089CKH|4.0|Having the same album title as Avril Lavigne's first offering didn't stop these guys from being all they could be. Nada Surf sure came a long way since they've released their one big hit here in America, Popular (that's still a good song, by the way). Sadly, this hit came from their worse record (not a bad album, but not as good as Proximity Effect or Let Go). After listening to their third rock-pop album, I've decided it's as good as it's predecessor. Proximity Effect had more classic moments but Let Go is prettier and more mature. I'd say that's about equal.<br />The record starts pretty slow with Blizzard of 77. It sounded like a weird choice for a first song, but afterwards I realized it wouldn't fit elsewhere. Then there's the first single, The Way You Wear Your Head, which is pretty energetic but takes a while to get into. The next 3 songs, Fruit Fly, Blonde on Blonde and Inside of Love are beautiful slow ballads that represents well the new Nada Surf sound. Inside of Love may be the most beautiful song on the album : &quot;I wanna know what it's like on the inside of love [...] Of course I'll be alright, I just had a bad night.&quot;<br />The record is not all slow, as the next songs speed things up (Hi-Speed Soul and No Quick Fix). Killian's Red is a song that builds up slowly. It's nice but, just like Happy Kid, it's not up to the others songs. If you haven't guessed, Là Pour Ça is a french song with nice lyrics : &quot;Les mecs c'est des salauds, mais peut-être pas tous.&quot; Indeed, they are not. Treading Water is the song that most ressembles what Nada Surf did on Proximity Effect. The ending song, Paper Boats, challenges Inside of Love in terms of beauty. Just like Killian's Red, it builds up slowly, the climax being much more touching and emotional.<br />This record is definitely worth owning. There are moments on this album you'll never forget. That doesn't mean you should stick to Let Go. As I said before, Proximity Effect is just as good. Trustme, once you get these albums, you won't let go (that was so bad...).

B00008PW3Q|5.0|There are so many reasons to buy this album, and I can think of 18 of them.  Every one of the songs on this album is so perfectly crafted (thanks in large part to the genius of guitar god Lindsey Buckingham!) that there is no room for improvement.  I just purchased this album and cannot stop listening to it!  Like my Rumours album, I can put this in and listen to it from beginning to end without having to skip once.  Mick Fleetwood's drum playing is the best it has been in years.  Stevie Nicks has retained her unique voice, adding so much depth to her beautiful lyrics (Everyone Finds Out is a new favorite).  John McVie's always-understated bass adds the perfect amount of rhythm.  And, last but not least, Lindsey Buckingham and his array of guitars have never sounded better than they do on this record.  Of course, the beautifully melodic presence of Christine McVie is only noticeable on a few tracks, and you can sense that the band misses her, but her leaving allows for a new dynamic that I cannot wait to get more albums from.  Good work, guys.  This one's a keeper.

B00005O5CM|4.0|Reese Witherspoon proves she's a box office Champ with this funny little comic gem.  If there were any doubts about this woman's ability to carry a movie on her shoulder's, Legally Blonde blows those doubts out of the water.<br />While certainly not shakespeare, the film wisely doesn't take itself too seriously.  Whitherspoon absolutely shines as Elle Woods, the sorority girl whose journey to Harvard proves never to doubt the ability to rise above expectations.  It's a warm-hearted little film that manages to eek out a few laughs.<br />And the extras on this make this DVD a steal!
0151008116|3.0|Do yourself a favor and skip the first 100 pages. They add nothing to the book. It's only at around pg 102 that things get tolerable. On occasion, the book turns preachy, and the author frequently falls into &quot;telling the story&quot; rather than &quot;showing it&quot;. (Telling me that this book is miraculous and will make me believe in God just doesn't cut it. I'm still an agnostic.) Also, the author frequently runs into entire chapters where he starts sentences with the same word, over and over. You'd think he'd add some variety, but I guess it's avante-garde to start each sentence with the word &quot;I&quot; or &quot;He&quot; and then go on and on in the smallest minutiae possible about a certain event. Just say you what you did and move on! Grrrr! On the whole, I put it somewhere slightly above stephen king and somewhere very far below Hemmingway. I give it 3 stars for effort.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I am a huge FM fan. I was excited about this album coming out. It has not disappoited me at all. A lot of their tracks have an old flare to them. All different and unique which makes this album one of the best Fleetwood Mac albums out there. I personally think it ranks in their best top 3~!<BR>If you love FM....you will love this album!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I like the Music of John Mayer; but I hate the way his mouth moves when he sings.  Kind of like I hate the way David Gray bobs his head when he sings.  I know that probably doesn't make sense to anyone but me.  Sorry.  I also think he has a sexy voice; but doesn't live up to that voice in the \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" video.  Anyhow, I think he has potential and will probably go far.  And the album is pretty darn good.  All those grammy nominations can't be wrong, can they?
B000084T18|2.0|This is a truely bad rap CD from one of the most overrated artists of all time.  It has great production, but 50 Cent is a flat-out horrible lyricist.  This guy is NOT the next Tupac, although he may be the next Ja Rule or DMX.<br />Someone said that if you like The Roots, you probably won't like this CD, and I have to agree.  If you like Eminem's new stuff (not his old, Slim Shady stuff.  They are completely different, as Slim Shady was FAR superior to the current, no punchline dropping, Em), or DMX or 50's underground tracks, you will probably like this CD.  If you like lyrical content in your rap, you will not.<br />It's a shame this guy was signed over Royce Da 5'9.
0688163173|5.0|U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, and his partner Chuck have been given an important assignment, find a young woman who has disappeared.  The woman is Rachel Solando and she is a prisoner/patient at a hospital for the criminally insane.  It seems Rachel vanished into thin air...the hospital is secluded on a small island with no viable means of escape, and the hospital is crawling with nurses and orderlies but somehow Rachel has managed to get out.<br />Teddy and Chuck begin questioning everyone at the hospital, only to come up empty-handed until the absence of a certain doctor and the discovery of a hand-written riddle found in Rachel's room become their first clues in a strange case that's as twisted and violent as the criminals on Shutter Island.<br />With a storm hitting the island, Teddy and Chuck race to find the violent woman who went missing and uncover the secrets harbored on Shutter Island, but the closer they get to the truth is that much closer they will be to their own madness, as someone plans on keeping the pair on the island for good.<br />WOW! `Shutter Island' is so good that I'm at a loss for words to describe how good it is.  The main mystery of the missing woman grabs you on page one, and pulls you deeper into the web of lies and murder that surrounds it with each turn of the page.  The characters are rich and colorful, and each development in the plot ratchets up the tension until you reach the explosive climax.<br />Dennis Lehane has-done-it-again...another page-turning bestseller that further proves him a master storyteller.  I have loved all of Lehane's novels, but `Shutter Island' is one of his, if not THE best he has written, and that's saying a lot considering all his books are among the best crime novels out there.<br />This is definitely a MUST READ!<br />Nick Gonnella

0385507755|5.0|Frey's account of this period in his life leaves you with an inability to put the book down.  It is raw with no apologies given, nor needed.  Not for the faint or those afraid to confront reality.
B000002JSN|5.0|This double album, regarded as (if not Zeppelin's best) then one of the two best, (with either IV or HotH) with great performance all around (though mostly on Disc 1 if my opinion counts for anything). At first you may be annoyed by the repetetive riffs on most of the songs, you'll get used to it. I was at first, and this was part of why I see this as the beginning of the end fro the band. It seemed like they were putting less effort into their music. I don't think this any more, but this is their last great album.<br />Custard Pie--a nice hard, sexy rocker for the opener, somewhat reminiscent of Black Dog. Plant is the most outstanding on this one.<br />The Rover--a cool, psychedelic riff carries this song through its length. What the lyrics mean isn't entirely clear to me, but it's a good song nonetheless.<BR> <BR>In My Time of Dying--among Zeppelin's top 5. Those 5 would be 'Kashmir', followed by 'Achilles', 'Stairway', 'Levee', so you can see what it's up against. Great slide guitar by Page with a number of hard rocking solos, pounding drums and bass lines, and of course one of Plant's best performances, playing the role of a dying man calling out to God to save his soul. It rarely gets better than this folks, so be glad this song is 11 minutes long. A display of Zep's talent for making sure the greatest songs are the long ones (the ones I listed as best are 8 and a half minutes long, 10 and a half, 8, and 7 minutes respectively)<br />Houses of the Holy--another very psychedelic guitar performance, and Plant puts on a great performance also. To me the lyrics sound like one of the band members, presumably Page with his affinity for the occult, trying to seduce a girl away from her conservative religious beliefs. But that's just me.<br />Trampled Underfoot--a very loud, hard rockin' song that will become mind numbingly repetetive after a while. It's catchy, but not Zep's best. Besides, I'm busy waiting for Kashmir the whole time it's playing.<br />Kashmir--my favourite Zeppelin song ever. An orchestra with sound edited heavily drowns out Page's guitar. There are also keyboards by Jones. Another of the 'drum songs' with a steady, heavy beat and some distorted psychedelic drumrolls as the song fades. The mysterious, middle eastern sound of this song will take you to another world in the same way Stairway did the first time you heard it...<br />Disc 2 isn't so great. In the Light is an average song, no more. Bron-yr-Aur is a beatiful acoustic guitar piece under 2 minutes (reminds me of Jefferson Airplane's 'Embryonic Journey') named after a cabin in the English countryside. The next two songs are too annoying to mention. Night Flight is very unusual for Zeppelin and a welcome relief to the boring songs on this disc. Dig it. The Wanton song is another average song. Boogie with Stu is a little jam session with the Rolling Stones' pianist ('Stu') that's good for a laugh and interesting percussion but not much else. Black Country Woman features some interesting drumming but nothing else to speak of, and Sick Again is horribly average for a Led Zeppelin closer, with lyrics that made me wonder which of them is 'sick'.<br />Anyway, the first disc is worth the purchase, and besides, what rock fan could live without this classic album?
B000006OBQ|5.0|&quot;Sinatra at the Sands,&quot; recorded in April 1966, was the first Frank Sinatra concert to be released commercially.  Sinatra is singing with Count Basie and his Orchestra, which was conducted by Quincy Jones.  As you would expect, this is classic Sixties Sinatra, putting on a show for the Las Vegas crowd performing the songs you would expect the man to sing, starting big with &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; and finishing even bigger with &quot;My Kind of Town.&quot;  The best of these tracks are &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; and &quot;Come Fly With Me,&quot; where the arrangements for the Basie Orchestra are arguably an actual improvement over the original recordings.  However, when Sinatra goes to his repetoire of saloon songs the results are more mixed; after all, he is singing in a really big room.  One of my all time Sinatra favorites, &quot;It Was a Very Good Year&quot; is a bit disappointing for me, but this is offset by his performance of &quot;Angel Eyes.&quot;<br />Sinatra's between song banter displays the expected level of charm, although the mavens of political correctness will wince several times while listening to some of the jokes in his rather long monologue.  &quot;Sinatra at the Sands&quot; offers up almost an hour of live singing from Ol' Blue Eyes, once you subtract the talking, and shows that there are a few songs (e.g., &quot;Luck Be a Lady Tonight&quot;) that you might actually prefer to hear Sinatra sing live.  Final Note on Album Notes: The album notes by Stan Cornyn won the 1966 Grammy for Album Notes, his second year in a row for winning that award for a Sinatra album (See: &quot;September of My Years&quot;).  Do they still give out that particular Grammy?  Anyhow, I was vasilating between 4 and 5 stars for this review, but those album notes tip the scale up for sure.
B000002J09|5.0|This album is of course Zeppelin's best-selling, because of guess which song, but a lot of people don't take the time to appreciate the incredible songs that populate the rest of the disk.<br />Black Dog--a sort of melding of blues and early heavy metal, this song's irregular rhythms and riffs, great solos and of course nonstop greatness from Bonham makes this one of the better songs on the disk. Like most of Zeppelin's songs, it gets better after repeated listening when you can appreciate the guitar playing skill of Page.<br />Rock and Roll--AKA 'The Cadillac Song'. I have more than once had to explain to someone hearing this song that no, in fact it is not The Cadillac Song, it is a Led Zeppelin song...oh well. After Black Dog with its random, roaming tunes, this song is pretty straightforward but not by any measure disappointing. Bonham really shows us what he's made of in a manner that rivals<BR>'Kashmir', 'Levee' and 'Achilles', although the rest of the band isn't particularly great.<br />Battle of Evermore--very unusual-sounding mandolins, a great harmony between Robert Plant and Sandy Denny, and mystical lyrics form a great ode to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. A relaxing break from the hard rock of the preceding songs and it fits right into the sound of the next song.<br />Stairway to Heaven--there's not a lot more to say about this song that hasn't been said but that it got to its place as the most popular and most played out rock song of all time for a REASON. Great performance from all four band members, great arranging skill by Page, the best guitar solo ever (so it's said) and it's great from it's quiet soothing intro through all 8 minutes to the loud, metal-sounding ending. Not Zeppelin's best song, but certainly one of the best.<br />Misty Mountain Hop--a song allegedly about a kid on his first acid trip, with the title being a Tolkien reference. It'll grow on you, I promise. Bonham sounding his usual (i.e. great) and nothing special from the rest of the band. <br />Four Sticks--aside from the fact that Bonham used two sticks in each hand to play this song (takes a lot of skill and produces and unusual sound) there is nothing great about it. It's just good whereas Zeppelin's usual is fantastic.<br />Going to California--an underappreciated song about hippies. Listen to it and you'll come to like it.<br />When the Levee Breaks--one of Zeppelin's best 5 songs, easily. Turn the volume way up right for this and let the drums shake the earth. A smashing, steady rhythm combined with distorted, slightly psychedelic guitars and harmonica especially near the end on this mind-bogglingly good song will leave you hyped for more when the album ends.

0140186409|5.0|This book absolutely strikes at the core of the American spirit.  We, like the Joads, are all immigrants.  Their story is the story of America.  The migration from Oklahoma to California mirrors the migration from Europe and Asia to America.  We all have a common bond with the \\"Okies.\\"<br />While Steinbeck does seem to propose a collective style economy in several of his works, he also is able to identify the fierce individualism that has allowed a nation of immigrants to survive and prosper in a harsh and unsettled land.  I think that he is off the mark in demonizing the haves and glorifying the have-nots.  The true story lies in the battle of the just against the unjust.  The struggle between givers and takers.  There are good and evil on both sides.<br />I did not especially care for the ending.  I would have preferred that he follow Tom to some sort of climax as he stood out as the central figure all along.  Of course, Ma was equally important and worthy of attention.<br />In summary, we have become a soft people.  We have forgotten the struggles and hardships that were overcome by our ancestors so that they might simply survive.  There is, most likely, a strong spirit within most of us today.  Unfortunatley, this spirit is buried very deep and held down by our numerous creature comforts and distractions.  The Joads, and all of those like them, were no better than the rest of us.  The circumstances of their lives, the proximity to mortality, forced their spirit to the surface.<br />To me, the importance of this book is that it causes the reader to take a breath and to reflect on the struggles that we all are confronted with.  We all have our desert to cross.  We are all the same no matter how hard we try to be different.
B00000099Y|5.0|Not enough can be said about how great this album is to me. It's one of those rare pieces of music that you aren't pressing the NEXT TRACK button on. Every track is a masterpiece, although my personal favorite is the epic \\"Third Eye\\". I don't get why people classify TOOL as a band that only \\"Goths/freaks\\" listen to. They're a very melodic and original band that don't get the recognition they deserve.

0671027344|5.0|I was a little leery of reading this book when I saw the ominous MTV logo on the spine. However, I did read it, and in doing so, I discovered one of the best teenager aimed books I've ever read. I grow increasingly tired of the same cliched books that every teenage girl is supposed to relate to. This book was refreshing because the characters were not stereotyped and they really captured the teen spirit. It's a great, great book. It's very touching and sincere. I could, and will, read it over and over.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|Fleetwood Mac fans who are used to the lush pop tunes of the 1970-80's will probably be disappointed with the group's latest release. In their first studio recording since 1987's \\"Tango In The Night\\" Producer Lindsay Buckingham experiments with some of the same stark rhythms and unorthodoxed arragements that were so evident the group's 1997 release \\"Tusk.\\" Christine Mc Vie's stylish, rich, pop harmonies are noticibly absent in the darker, moodier, tone of this collection.<br />This recording has not one single soft romantic ballad, but has more of a hard rock edge to many of the songs, with Buckingham's intricate guitar work. One particular cut, \\"Come\\" actually sounds like it could have come off a Led Zeppelin album. \\"Steal Your Heart,\\" comes closest to the material from Fleetwood Mac's highly successful, \\"Rumours.\\"<br />What this release lacks is the balance that Christine Mc Vie brought to the group. The 18 songs on this CD all sound a little too much alike, with Nick's raspy vocals and Buckingham's off-the-chart arrangements. Perhaps a little of Christine Mc Vie's breezy softness is needed to temper the sharp edges.
B000062U7B|5.0|Wow! Maiden gig at Rock in Rio must be one of the best live albums maiden ever recorded (yes, even better than Live After Death). The return of Bruce to lead singing, 3 guitars, awesome sound, great crowd... Not to mention the 2 videos that you can play on your PC after experiencing the music.

B000002H6C|5.0|I got hooked on Metallica as an 8-year-old in the late 80's from my half-brother, and in 1995, I *finally* had the money to buy all of their CD's except for the Garage Sale ones (keep in mind this was still before Load, which I won't touch with a 30-foot pole)... so I guess minimum wage does pay off! $4.25 an hour, baby!!! ;-) In any case, I was even MORE hooked after listening to Justice!! It's just awesome...<br />The entire CD works like one loooong track with two-second pauses in between, which is a *very* good thing here. It's like one big metal symphony, so to speak. Every song takes on a different aspect of American, hell, Western society and beats it to a sickening pulp. For a long time, \\"One\\" was my absolute favorite song!! It still ranks way up there, and every time I listen to Justice, I kinda wonder what retard took them over after 1991. In fact, the only song that beats \\"One\\" IMO is \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" from Puppets, which, by the way, you should also definitely get...<br />I mean it: *every* one of the tracks are worth listening to and embracing! That in itself is commendable, but they manage to pull it off so beautifully and heart-poundingly that you won't even want to *recognize* the existance of Metallica post-1991! From Lars' excellent drumming, to James' mastery of vocals and guitar, to Jason's pounding bass, to Kirk's equal mastery of the guitar, you will not be disappointed! It's just too bad that the bass on this album isn't given as much credit as it deserves... Grab this and every other album they've produced up to it, and you will not be disappointed...<br />Cliff Burton, rest in peace, man... this one's for you!
185984054X|1.0|Is this the worst that can be said? That Mother Theresa was Catholic (and so prayed, wanted to convert others to be Catholic and opposed abortion despite not having all the answers for India's population problem), and that people conributing to her order were contributing to an order (which built churches and convents as well as hospices and clinics) and not to a secular charity looking to impose a rigorous seperation between its works and any religious views of its staff. I really don't think the people who contributed, and contribute, to her order were ever in confusion about this.<br />It actually reminds me a lot of the criticisms leveled against her by the local govt in Calcutta. Their emperor's new clothes like problem was that despite their views on how she should spend the money given to her, she did a lot more actual good for the porrest of the poor in Calcutta then they did. The fact she didn'yt solve all their problems in one stroke did not take away from the fact she gave people abandoned on the street to die a place to die with dignity and caring - something they could not achieve despite annual budgets several times her order's.<br />The WHO, UN, USAID and the govts of Calcutta and India have not been able to solve Calcutta's medical situation. Hitchens critcisms that she did not do more are laughable. What did he do? What did any of us do to compare to what this woman achieved in the aleviating of real human suffering and desperation.<br />I would like to live in a world with more Mother Teresas and only someone who has never really tried to do anything about real problems could wish for less Teresas and more Indian govt officials mismanaging funds as the truely poor are left to die in the streets.
B00008DDSC|1.0|This hour and forty-something minute piece of garbage is categorically, emphatically, and undeniably the W-O-R-S-T movie I have EVER seen.  Period.  I guess the point is to try and introduce Sadomasochism into the &quot;mainstream.&quot;  Not in the sense of whips, leather, and chains, but more along the lines of two pitiful people with no real way to relate to each other.  <br />I can truly say that this was the first time in my life that I was ever embarrassed for the two main screen actors.  I wondered why, even with the money, James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal would humiliate themselves this way.  It was like looking at an elementary school production, except for these people are supposedly adults.<br />The best thing about this movie was the words, &quot;The End.&quot;
0866119760|5.0|My book review was on The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, written by<br />A. Conan Doyle. This was a fantastic book and I advise people who like mysteries or crimes to read this book. The book was written in First person point of view because you feel like your there as the narrator describes the situation there in.<br />This book is broken up into 3 stories the first one is the red headed league, the 2nd is the adventures of the speckled band, and 3rd is the adventures of the copper breach. They are all great mysteries and Mr. Holmes tries to solve each one of them.  Sherlock Holmes is a extraordinary detective he is observant of everything. Like in the book he says quote I see u came by a cart.  Yes sir, but how did u know that Mr. Holmes replies I see the mud splattered on your arm in seven places only carts through mud up like that and you have taken a train to get to your cart for I see the train pass in your pocket. So as you can see Mr. Holmes is a sneaky detective he is also a static character he never changes thorough out the book. The first part of the story is probably one of the best parts but after all it has to be to draw the readers attention. the 2nd story is a great storie and takes a lot of thinking but it isnt as good as the first one, but the last one Is the best one to rap up the book.<br />This book is a fabulous book to read it makes you more careful of your surroundings and makes you look at people more than you usually. do this book is a wonderful book and I recommend it to all readers. Thank you for your time and I hope you will read this book.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is by far the best Weezer album ever, if not the BEST CD EVER. These Guys know how to rock while portray there feelings, which is very uncommon in today's Alternative/Rock scene
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Wow what a cd! From what I have heard Peacekeeper has been the best. But anything from Fleetwood Mac is great! I can defanatly tell they took there time with this cd. I was defanatly worth the wait.<br />Exellent A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B00005JLEU|4.0|This movie is pretty good, it has a good plot and its really deep. Its a movie that you can't just start in the middle of the movie and start watching it in the middle of the movie. You have to watch it from the beginning to the end. I read one review about someone's 8 year old being scared to death about the parents tunring into pigs. So I definitley would not reccomend this movie for younger ages. If you are looking for a japanese anime movie for younger children, try kiki's delivery service. The only anime movies i saw before this one was the pokemon movies and kiki delvery service, but this one is weird, but yet, I love it. Before buying this movie, I would defintley rent it to make sure you know what your are buying.  Like the no-face eating people...and blood all over the place. But if you are a true japanese animation mainiac, i would say u will love it

B00000IP3S|5.0|One of the best Blind Guardian releases ever, Imaginations From the Other Side ranks second behind Nightfall on Middle Earth as my favorite Blind Guardian album. The songs have very good guitar and lyrical quality. This release has many of Blind Guardian's greatest songs and I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes metal. Newcomers to Blind Guardian will like the lyrical quality and the production and pure genious will be appreciated by everyone, especially metal purists. Blind Guardian has yet to make an inferior album. There are no bands within their own genre that match their genius, although Iced Earth comes close. This album is timeless. It is now over ten years old, but is still a masterpiece Blind Guardian album.
B000069KGM|5.0|Few bands in history have produced a greater quantity of banal pop music than Chicago, so it's always a shock to play this album and remember just how cutting edge they were, how confident, brash and aggressive they sounded, in their first release.  Few albums can boast as many outstanding performances as \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\", or \\"CTA\\", and with the exception of the Beatles, no band I know of ever boasted three lead singers as fine as Terry Kath, Robert Lamm and Peter Cetera. <br />\\"Beginnings\\" features a great vocal by Robert, lots of 7th chords, a gradually emerging latin beat, and fantastic trombone and trumpet solos.  \\"South California Purples\\", uses long fade-in, fade-out brass notes, laid down on top of the power blues bass.  \\"Poem 58\\" is a guitar tour de force by Terry morphing into a rousing, sexy, blues love song.  Check out the intro by Terry, joined by Peter's bass rising into the fray, my favorite moment on the album.  \\"I'm a Man\\" features all three singers strutting their stuff in succession to a jumpy, twitchy layer of percussion, putting even the fine version sung by Steve Winwood and the Spencer Davis Group into the dustbin of history.  \\"Questions 67 and 68\\" is perfect power-pop.  These are just my favorites, but there isn't a bad cut on here.  <br />In 1969 Blood Sweat and Tears had the hit singles and the grammys, but this was the horn band with the most guts and impact, and was the true musical and spiritual descendent of the original Al Kooper-led BST of 1967.  Much, but not all of it still sounds youthful and fresh 34 years after its release.  By 1972 Chicago had hit rock bottom (of musical significance, not the charts), but in this original recording, they earned the right to appropriate the name of the city that was their home.
B00008J4P5|5.0|that this album was so good. If your reading reviews on &quot;Elephant&quot; your probably thinking about buying it. You probably liked &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; and all the singles/stand out tracks. Let me tell you now my friends, everything on &quot;Elephant&quot; blows &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; out of the water. Jack is in a much happier mood on this album and the instrumentals are excellent. Though a few sound like rehased &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; tracks, overall the songwriting/music is masterful. It's almost impossible to explain how many genres this work splits. 60's psychadelica, pop, blues, rock, folk, wow! <br />This is also sort of a diparture from the White Stripe's earlier works. For instance, &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; (Track #8) clocks in over 7 minutes long! Mr. White was definitely listening to the likes of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Led Belly, etc. when he wrote &quot;B&amp;B&quot;. There isn't really a weak track on the cd, I could list them all as strong. I'm going to be making an indie rock mix cd soon and I have no idea which one of these tracks is gonna make the cut. Do yourself a favor and buy this cd. It's easily the best thing of 2003 so far. In one word, genius.
B000000W5P|4.0|It's a classic, no doubt, showcasing the Stones skill and enthusiasm for all the many facets of popular music in some of the best songs in their career.  Disco, punk, Motown, country, soul, and, of course, straight forward rock, it's all here, and virtually all of it is great.  <br />This is an example of the creative schism between Mick and Keith resulting in a whole far greater than the sum of its' parts.  Surprisingly, it was Mick, not Keith, who wanted to emulate the heavy guitar sound of punk.  Stories of in-studio arguing are rife, with Mick trying to speed up tempos and turn the guitars up even higher on When the Whip Comes Down, Some Girls, Lies, Respectable, and Shattered to sound more like the Sex Pistols.  Keith's response?  \\"Why do WE have to go and try to sound like the Sex Pistols?\\", and soulful, accomplished songs like Before They Make Me Run and Beast of Burden.  The results are exhilarating.<br />Mick's lyrics are some of the best and instigating of his career;  for the first time in years sometimes a songs' hook is the lyric as much as Keith's chords and riffs.  Let's compare: how many lyrics do you rememeber off the top of your head from Black and Blue?  Now name the songs that these excerpts are from:  <BR>\\"People think I'm...CRAAAAAAZEEEE\\", <BR>\\"Whatsdamattahwitchyouboy?\\", <BR>\\"I just don't have that much jam!\\", <BR>\\"You aaahhhlways have the Lord by your side\\"<BR>\\"We're talking heroin with the President, 'yes, it's a problem, Sir, but it can be bent'\\",<BR>\\"Ain't I rough enough?  Ain't I rich enough?\\"<BR>\\"AH! SHA-DOOBEE!\\"<BR>\\"Don't you know the crime rate's goin' up, up, Up, UP, UUPPP?!\\"<br />The only real question is if you're a casual Stones fan, should you get this or a greatest hits like 40 Licks: after all, 40 Licks does contain Miss You, Beast of Burden, and Shattered, the true classics of the album.  And though you can live without When the Whip Comes Down, Lies, and the campy Faraway Eyes, Keith's Before They Make Me Run would be lost, and you'd be missing one of his best songs.  <br />So get the album.  It's the sound of the world's greatest rock'n'roll band proving that in the wake of disco and punk they were far from obsolete, and perhaps fore-runners in melding all these disparate styles togther and form one cohesive, classic whole.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|Upon my first few listens, I feel safe deeming &quot;Say You Will&quot; a massive disappointment. The absence of Christine McVie is a major impediment since it is too Stevie and Lindsey-centric. The tracks are hardly memorable and some are downright lousy. Perhaps if they didn't focus some much on quantity (18 total tracks), the quality would be significantly better. The only standout is the title track, and even that song seems destined for obscurity and will likely wind up relegated to a doctor's office soundtrack.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Cast Away is just an amazing cinematic achievement.  You don't just watch this movie; you really have to devote an entire night to it; it's just that powerful and moving.  At almost two and a half hours in length, it is uncommonly long in and of itself (but it does not feel long to the enthralled viewer); figure in all of the incredible special features included in the 2-disc special edition, and you are looking at a whole night's worth of rich entertainment.  Cast Away has just about everything you could want in a movie: romance, adventure, action, heartbreak, suspense, mystery, nature at its most ugly and most beautiful, you name it; most importantly, it manages, after several cathartic moments, to leave one with a sense of hope and a strange kind of joy.  Tom Hanks takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride, and he deserves a tremendous amount of credit for making this film work as perfectly as it does.  There really isn't a lot of dialogue during the time on the island; long drawn-out moments focus on Hanks' expression, body language, and emotion.  When he finds a friend to talk to in Wilson, he makes that character really come alive and become a very real character in the film.  <br />Don't think that this is just another Robinson Crusoe remake.  Chuck Noland (Hanks) is an obsessive, deeply committed system engineer for FedEx.  Everything for him must be planned and executed according to the limits of time, and so he is truly a duck out of water when his plane goes down in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and leaves him stranded all alone on a deserted island.  Time is meaningless for him here, but he has a picture of the woman he loves with him to help him go on living when it would be so easy to just give up.  He learns to survive on his own in the tropical environment, but not without much pain and battles with hopelessness.  When the situation threatens to overwhelm him, the character of Wilson comes along.  Wilson is a volleyball, but he has a face framedwith Chuck's own blood and becomes the personification of the world of people he longs to return to.  After four years on the island, Wilson is a true companion whom Chuck talks to, argues with, but dearly loves as a very real friend.  The escape attempt from the island is very powerful, containing within itself more important truths and examples of the human spirit than I can name.  It is also where the first tears begin to well up in my eyes.  You might expect this type of film to end with a long-overdue rescue and return to a happy life, but in Cast Away, the real human drama is just getting started at this point.  Chuck's return home to his friends and the woman he loves is so much more than bittersweet; having seemingly lost everyone and everything he cared for four years earlier, his miraculous return becomes another tale of great loss.  This movie is a real tear-jerker; just when you think it's time to rejoice, you are met with more poignant heartbreak.  Hope never dies, though, and the writers do a tremendous job of subtly presenting that heart-warming message.<br />I love Wilson; he is such a great character that, volleyball or not, I think he should have been nominated for a best supporting actor award.  Amazingly, he really slipped into the movie by accident, yet much of this movie's power is conveyed through him.  The inclusion of a featurette on the life and death of Wilson on the second DVD is a testament to his importance to this story.  This second DVD is filled with an incredible selection of bonus features: features on the making of the film, its special effects, and a look at the beautiful and bonafide island paradise location of the filming; there is an interview of Tom Hanks by Charlie Rose, a survivalist documentary, and a movie-length commentary as well.  You can't ask more from a movie than Cast Away gives you, and you can't ask for more from a DVD than this two-disc special edition delivers.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I know how hard it is the make a CD better than one of the most successful CD's in recent history.  That's why it would make sense to have to work on a CD like this for so long. It does sound like Hybred Theory, however, those who liked Linkin Park's first CD(unlike the people who give negative reviews on bands they don't like in the first place) will like this one. It's actually reminds me of a crossover between Hybred and Reanimation. It doesn't surpass Hybred, but I haven't found a CD that has. This is classic Linkin Park though.
B000002C1V|4.0|As someone pointed out this album is Bleak, with a capital B. Essentially it's The Wall revisited with any and all pop star trappings and indulgances that plagued Pink removed and the World War II references highlighted and expanded upon to create Roger Waters' Pink Floyd swan song. It's almost as if Waters knew this was his last hoorah with the band so he purged any and all psychological traumas he had with the concept of war and how it personally relates to him and WWII and put them on wax. Maybe in the bottom of his heart he felt the final cut looming, as his lyrics suggest. The title track(The Final Cut) is Uncomfortably Numb but much more introspective and as such in my opinion, not as brilliant as Numb.<br />The entire album is a fitting epilogue to The Wall since is continues with a lot of the themes that classic 1979 album touched upon. But I can certainly see where the other members of Floyd were ready to move on and explore other forms of rock'n roll compared to the psychologically theraputial Roger Waters concept albums pertaining to war that The Wall and The Final Cut basically are. The two stand out tracks for me on The Final Cut are the last two- Not Now John, a ballsy exclamation mark to the album that finally brings Gilmour to the mic with some profanity to boot accompanied by equally profane backup singers. A brilliant track that takes us back to the raw energy Floyd was capable of exuding. The last track on the album, Two Suns in the Sunset, is a nice track that harkens back to something that perhaps they might have had on Ummagumma or Wish You Were Here. If you were to go from listening to 'Two Suns' on The Final Cut to 'Grantchester Meadows' on Ummagumma and continue from there you'd have an extraordinary experience with the evolution and almost 360 degree nature of the Roger Waters Pink Floyd years. Considering that it's also the(seemingly) last track that features Waters with Floyd, a very fitting song to go out with.<br />&quot;Could be the human race is run...&quot;
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones was the kind of cathardic musical experience I was expecting from the overhyped John Mayer: A musician so incredible, so wholly unto her own style, and completely immersed in the love of her craft. In every song Ms. Jones does, she never oversings to show off her range, never goes over the top with her piano abilities, and never once strays from the mood she wants to set with her music. It's not enough just to listen to Norah Jones, you have to fall in love with her. And her music makes it easy. It's the music of a lounge singer who doesn't care whether or not she wins eight Grammys and steals the show away from the pop stars. Not too long ago, Norah Jones was simply a lounge singer, occasionally opening for some bands and artists around the country. Now she is the name on the billboard, and deservedly so.<br />\\"Come Away With Me\\" landmarks the beginning of what is sure to be a career that will hike up to the stratospheres of Van Morrison and Bob Dylan. It is one of the most perfect albums of the last several years, and I know it won't be the last from Norah. True, the category of Best New Artist at the Grammys seems to carry with it a curse of some kind (remember Christopher Cross from back in the 80's who sang the infamous theme from \\"Arthur\\"?), but while most of the past winners in this category are practically embodiments of the trends of the time, Norah Jones has a timeless quality to her music. \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"The Nearness of You\\" would have been right at home in the smoke-filled bars of the 40's, with Humphrey Bogart sitting at a table with his black pants, white suit coat, and glass of bourbon. But, not surprisingly, it also works today. There's a reason why people still tap their feet to \\"Brown Eyed Girl,\\" mouth the words to \\"Pretty Woman,\\" and why Elvis' single \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" saw more popularity last year than it ever has: This music worked/works/will continue to work for generations after we're gone. Norah Jones fits into this group nicely; her music reaches out across the years to attract listeners as young as my niece and as old as my grandmother. And she can do this so easily because she loves what she does, because she's humble about it, and because she's just that wonderful.<br />Norah Jones was the closest thing to an impulse purchase I've ever made for a CD. It's some of the best money I've ever spent. Of course, the first track (\\"Don't Know Why\\") is phenomenal. The rest of the album is populated with songs that are just as spectacular and understated. One of my favorites, which I listen to religiously every night, is \\"The Long Day is Over,\\" which I plan to use in my film (shooting this summer). It's a song of such true emotion that evokes such a response from within me that I couldn't help but love it. The same qualities exist throughout, but think of how much of an accomplishment that is....<br />But if I were to go over every song saying what was great about it, I'd be here forever, and I don't want to take up anymore of your time. Suffice it to say that Norah Jones is a spectacular new artist who I hope will decide to stick around to populate the air waves with her amazing musical talents for decades to come.his group nicely; her music reaches out across the years to attract listeners as young as my niece and as old as my grandmother.

B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD is great, its like a drug that I can't get enough of.  I've listened to it 100+ and haven't gotten tired of it yet, and there isn't a song on it that I skip through. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 15. *****
B00008977N|3.0|Have owned the VHS since '94 and was really looking forward to the DVD version. All the comments you have read about the grainy picture are true. Some of the reviewers dispute this and lay the blame on poor quality tv's.  I played mine on a Sony XBR 53&quot; screen, and while the video quality is better than the VHS it is embarrassingly poor when comparing it to many other concert DVD, even some that were filmed well before this concert.  The sound is allright, but even there they did not improve on the versions that precede it.<br />To sum it up, if you have never seen the concert, buy it - you will enjoy it.  For those of us that have seen previous versions, don't waste your money. I wish I would have taken previous reviewers seriously and skipped this one.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Only one dud on this NYC band's CD track 3 &quot;NYC&quot;. That song is a bore, and not in a good way. It's the only track I skip every time. The rest of this disc flows nicely and you'll be hitting the repeat button again, at its finish. Buy this now!!
B00005JLXE|5.0|I really couldn't tell you one super hero movie that I ever liked... Until now!  The casting, the storyline, and the photography is all very well done here, and the soundtrack deserves some praise too. Ben Affleck plays the darkest and most fascinating comic book character ever brought to the silver screen!  As a matter of fact, his character is so dark and complex that it's hard to refer to Daredevil as an actual \\"super hero\\".  That's what helps this movie so much... It isn't sugar-coated for the kids, it's actually more for the parents if you ask me.  The reason I decided to give it a full 5 star rating is because it's the kind of movie you can enjoy over and over again.  Ebert and Roeper gave TWO THUMBS UP!!  If you thought SPIDERMAN was overrated, give this movie a shot!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This was an awesome CD--I couldn't stop listening to it for over a month.  Fighter was one of my faves--her recent new single.  I was very impressed as Christina co-wrote almost all the songs on the album.  The album has a nice mix of pop, rock, and blues--very different from her first album.  For any Alicia Keys fans, there is one written/arranged/produced by her called Impossible.  Also, I was blown away (almost to tears) by her song, I'm Okay.  The song is so honest and brave.  And, she apparently she sang it in one take!  Kudos to an amazing singer and an awesome album!
B00005T33W|5.0|\\"Ghost World\\" wins my award for best movie of the past ten years. The key to a great movie is that it's its own world -- a self-contained universe. \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" is one such example, so is \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"For a Few Dollars More.\\" Any of Billy Wilder's movies, too. This one was one of them.<br />I love Enid (played by Thora Birch, whose character is much more three-dimensional than the girl she played in \\"American Beauty.\\"). A teenage H.L. Mencken, Enid skewers pretentious poseurs and tips over sacred cows. But, underneath her outer punk persona, there is a soft-hearted hero-worshipper. Her predicament is that she's stranded on a social desert island and uses cynicism as a shield to protect her from the hopeless banality in which heroes and passion are deemed passe by people who walk through life questioning nothing, but just parroting the answers they've picked up from the larger society.<br />\\"Ghost World\\" abounds in social commentary, but doesn't fall into the schmaltzy trap of trying to \\"solve\\" the world's social ills. Although on the surface Enid is directionless, she nonetheless has a mania for sketching a diary of the oddballs and weirdos that make up her small town. An excellent artist and charicaturist, Enid ends up failing art class TWICE.<br />Her airheaded hippy/burnout art teacher, Roberta (Illeana Douglas), is a walking cliche of a total conformist affecting an air of anti-authoritarianism. She blows off Enid's diary and her cartoons of Don Knotts, but pushes her students to instead produce so-called \\"controversial\\" art. A really dead-on scene is when one of Roberta's sycophantic students creates a sculpture out of coathangers, which represents \\"a woman's right to choose, something I feel super-strongly about.\\" It's a gem of a parody on political art in which the politics are much stronger than the art. I was rolling on the floor when Roberta's real bad college art film \\"Mirror/Father/Mirror\\" clip was playing. Wow, that rings true. Roberta doesn't encourage the artistic impulse so much as pushing her agenda on the students to be \\"controversial\\" and \\"confront people's attitudes.\\"<br />So, Enid decides to spoof Roberta and bring in a \\"found object\\" of a Jim Crow charicature from the 1920s of \\"Coon's Chicken,\\" which depicts a monkey-like negro. This angers the other students (who were sotto voce receiving the message that they should only confront people with PC controversy), but the irony is in how Roberta reacts to the Jim Crow poster; Enid can't get the time of day from her when it comes to her own talented artwork, but her jokes on Roberta's inanities wins Roberta over to her cause and even inspires Roberta to get Enid a scholarship to art college. All this falls apart when Roberta enters the piece in an exhibit, and the local censors force her to remove the poster and fail Enid in her class. Her capitulation reveals her devotion to \\"controversy\\" and \\"confrontation\\" to be a hollow pose, and she covers her rear by letting Enid be the lamb to the slaughter.<br />The relationship between Enid and Seymour (Steve Buscemi) evinces Enid's yearnings to find someone to look up to, rather than down upon. I liked Steve Buscemi a lot. I'm so used to him playing funny roles, that it was sort of incongruous seeing him play it (mostly) straight in a comedic movie, but it worked quite well. Like Enid, Seymour is a middle-aged outcast, and at first becomes the victim to one of Enid's and her best friend Rebecca's (Scarlett Johansson) cruel pranks. But underneath the nerdish and pitiful exterior, Enid comes to discover in Seymour someone as isolated and alientated from society as she is. She finds in him a noble soul, whose passions are worn less on his sleeve than Enid's are, but locked up in his 1920s-themed room dedicated to his 78 rpm blues and ragtime records and poster art from the same era. Enid sees in Seymour a lot of herself, but also someone who has been run over once too many times in life and whose social rebellions have shrivelled into repressed loneliness. Enid finds in Seymour a hero, and gushes \\"I'd kill for a room like this\\" when complimenting his passion for nostalgia. To which Seymour -- who has given up on the possibility of ever fitting in or finding love -- replies \\"go ahead, kill me.\\"<br />By the movie's end, Seymour starts asserting his inwardly pent-up feelings to relate to the world through his romance with Enid. ....<br />As I recall, this movie was nomimated for only one Oscar (best adapted screenplay) by the Academy of Motion Pictures \\"Arts and Sciences.\\" And yet, this was the best movie in a year barren of talent, originality and true cinematic art. Now I understand why this movie is called \\"Ghost World.\\" <br />The DVD version is better, because it is widescreen, however the transfer is clean on the VHS.
B000059XXZ|5.0|I have been a huge Batman fan for over 35 years. Have collected many comic books, own different videos including the 1943 & 1949 movie serials. This version of the Dark Knight was the most eagerly anticipated version in years. I enjoyed the movie so much that I saw it twice in the theater. The only thing that I was a little disappointed was with how Bruce Wayne became Batman when his parents were murdered. The original version in the comics says that they were killed by Joe Chill, a lowly thief. In the movie version, the killer was a young Jack Napier who later became the Joker. I understand why the producers made this change. So that Batman could have a double motive to kill the Joker. The Joker's origin was changed also. In the comics he was first The Red Hood who later fell into the vat of chemicals & changed into the Joker.<br />Except for those 2 changes, the movie was basically the same as in the comics. The costume was incredible & so was the Batmobile.<br />The 3 sequels later on were more or less okay. Only Batman & Robin was bad. It looked like the 1966 TV series. BIG MISTAKE.<br />I can't wait for the next one. Hope this review helped.
B00008G9JO|1.0|Throughout most of this Ian Anderson sings, if you can call it singing, in a hoarse rasp, as if either his voice is completely shot or his throat is full of phlegm--not a pleasant, and certainly not a musical, sound. On \\"One Brown Mouse\\" he makes a different sort of unpleasant sound, one I can't really describe, a sort of nasal boing-boing thing. <br />What happened to the sweetness of \\"Wondering Aloud\\" from \\"Aqualung\\"? <br />I suppose it's possible Mr. Anderson was merely embarrassed by the material here. It's junior high school stuff, after all--purple prose, diatonic harmonic cliches (diatonic despite all the frantic--and musically unmotivated--key changes), and lots and lots of droning on a single tone.<br />But as Shakespeare's King Lear puts it, O reason not the need. Just avoid the recording.
0671027344|5.0|This book caught my eye only because of the title. I got the book, had it sitting around for a few days and then picked it up and began to read.<br />Charlie is writing to someone, telling them of his life. His hardships and his loves. He is writing because he is nervous about starting High School. He starts out telling about his friend Michael who committed suicide. Then he goes on to tell us about his family, whom are regular but never quite share there emotions. Then he goes on to tell us about his aunt Helen who was the only person he ever knew who really understood him. Charlie makes friends with Patrick and Sam, two seniors at his school who take to him easily. Charlie's life starts to go pretty well. Charlie begins to be part of Sam and Patrick's \\"group\\". Charlie documents his first experiences with drugs, girls and \\"The Rocky Horror Picture show\\". <br />There really is no way to describe how wonderful this book is. I read it late one night alone and I felt as though I was sharing something priceless with myself. It is now my favorite book.<br />Now, the book is completely wonderful but it is very dark. I wouldn't recommend it to people, who find little things offensive. You would hate this book. Please keep that in mind.<br />So in conclusion, I recommend this to anyone looking for a deeply moving book that tells you no matter how bad things are for you, they will get better. Happy Reading!
B00006G8G4|4.0|Here we go... (5) DANNY ELFMAN's dark, jittery musical score. Think of the roiling, angry energy of Elfman's music for the first 'Batman' movie [if you've forgotten, you can also hear it at the beginning and end of the Batman 'animated series'], then add the sound of an army of spiders scuttling across your living room floor, and you'll get the idea. (4) Director SAM RAIMI's wonderfully hyperkinetic visual style, propelling the action forward while emphasizing the larger-than-life feel of a comic book. (3) The much-maligned SPECIAL EFFECTS, CGI and all. The widescreen format preserves the 'rush' as Spidey swoops headlong through the city streets, barely missing cars and pedestrians (and nearly running into buildings) in hot pursuit of the bad guys. It's a GREAT ride. (2) TOBEY MAGUIRE's understated performance as geeky high school kid Peter Parker. When Peter realizes that he has superpowers, you feel his joy as he leaps from rooftop to rooftop through the gritty city, empowered at last. Yet, even after becoming Spidey, Maguire never lets you forget the scared kid underneath the superhero, ready to break through at any moment. AND FINALLY... (1) J.K. SIMMONS' hilarious, scenery-chewing, all-too-brief turn as newspaper editor (and chief-Spidey-hater) J. J. Jamison. I hope we'll see a LOT more of JJJ in the sequel. Thanks for reading this, and see you at the movies!
B000083C49|4.0|Ok so this is the fourth Star Trek movie, but it is in effects the final part in a trilogy which was started in \\"Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan\\" and continued with \\"Star Trek III The Search For Spock\\". It seems that the Enterprise crew have dealt with the difficult stuff. They lost their comrade Spock, but they stole (I mean, borrowed) the starship Enterprise (which they would eventually blow up) from Starfleet to go on a mission that would lead to Spock being brought back to life. As the fourth movie begins, all they have to do is go back to Earth and face a court martial for their actions, simple huh? Alas no!- see there's this giant probe that is transmitting signals that are destroying Earth's eco-system. The signals are intended for some whales but by this, the 23rd Century, whales are extinct. Therefore, the Enterprise crew travel back in time to the late 1980s so that they can bring the whales back to the future (excuse the pun), and save Earth. Phew! Sounds like a very exciting and fun journey. Believe me, it is.<br />\\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\" is a lighter movie in comparison to all the others. There isn't a single space battle. However it is all the better for it. When it comes to laughs, Star Trek movies, like Muppet movies, seem to stretch some of the jokes, but for this movie the humor is just about right. The special effects are superior to the previous three and this reviewer thinks this movie has stood the test of time.<br />So here we have \\"Star Trek IV The Voyage Home\\" in widescreen on a 2 Disc Collectors Edition DVD with some interesting special features. By the way, note that when this movie was originally released it started off with a prologue of Admiral Kirk narrating what had happened throughout \\"Star Trek III The Search For Spock\\". This prologue is not on this DVD version. It is something I was very disappointed by since the prologue greatly added to the movie build up, but it's something I'll have to live with. The prologue is still available on past VHS versions however.<br />Anyway, onto the special features. Here we have a Commentary by Leonard Nimoy (Captain Spock, Director) and William Shatner (Admiral/Captain Kirk) which although slow at times is a welcome addition. There is only one Theatrical Trailer and that is for the movie in this DVD set (Note that the DVD for \\"Star Trek III: The Search For Spock\\" has a Teaser Trailer for \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\"). We also have a Text Commentary by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda (Co-Authors of The Star Trek Encyclopedia) and featurettes including the (as Spock would put it) \\"fascinating\\" Time Travel, along with Art of the Possible, The Language of Whales, A Vulcan Primer, Kirk's Women, From Outer Space to the Ocean and The Bird of Prey. Included as well are Tributes: Roddenberry Scrapbook (homage to the creator of \\"Star Trek\\" and \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\"), Featured Artist Mark Lenard (Ambassador Sarek- Spock's father) and Original Interviews with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and the late DeForest Kelley (Dr McCoy). Not forgetting Storyboards and Production gallery.<br />In conclusion, this DVD is the best of the Special Edition DVDs since the special features have improved, and the movie is the best looking and sounding version you'll probably ever see.vailable on past VHS versions however.<br />Anyway, onto the special features.

B00008GKEG|5.0|This is a fantastic insight in The Beatles reign period. Filled to the top with live performances of their great music in their usual and unusual form. The 5.1 sound is in top quality and does justice to the best rock band the world has ever known. A truly fantastic release on DVD.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I believe that this is Michael Jackson at his best. Although Invincible is a far advanced album (in terms of MJ playing instruments and practically doing everything) it doesn't have the musical edge which Dangerous does. OK, below is a list of tracks which are great:<br />In The Closet (5/5) - This is the sort of track that if you hear today will probably think Justin Timberlake sings. However this is a very accomplished song. The video sees MJ and a lady getting rather close...Great song however which is completely different to any work he had done before.<br />She Drives Me Wild (5/5) - This is a track which gets a lot of stick from people. I think that it is a clever track in that it builds up to the rap towards the end of the song which is highly contrasting to the overall &quot;voice&quot; of this song.<br />Remember The Time (6/5) - Like who hasn't heard this? The video was absolutely fantastic (y'know the Egyption one where MJ has his first on screen kiss). The beats are fantastic and the bass is some what subtle yet a driving force in it all. The song is clever in that quite a lot of the time it just rests on drum beats and MJ's voice.<br />Can't Let Her Get Away (6/5) - OK, many people hate this track. Fact: The song goes on to long. Fact: It was obviously a song whihc was slammed together to fill up space. Fact: This is a good track which has good keyboard riffs mixed with a different style of MJ singing. Despite everybody's critisicm's this is a great track which does sit well with all the others on the album.<br />Dangerous (5/5) - This is a fantastic track which has sharp beats and lyrics. Also look out for the Roger Sanchez remix which was released on the 'Blood on the Dance Floor' single in the UK (I dunno about USA)<br />Well I recommend this as a fantastic buy. I have a different taste in MJ than others, and I think many will disagree with what I say about the tracks, however visit MICHAELJACKSON.COM if you want to listen to samples!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Me encanta este cd. <BR>Jonh Mayer ha hecho un buen trabajo.<BR>Buenas letras + Buena musica = Buenos resultados.<BR>Lstima que no sea muy conocido en Espaa...Le deseo lo mejor para el resto de su carrera.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|\\"Say You Will\\", the new Fleetwood Mac CD sans Christine McVie, is actually a terrific Stevie Nicks album wrapped around a so-so one from Lindsay Buckingham. These two have never sounded more disparate in both sensibility and execution, and this time it's a bit jarring. In fact, \\"Say You Will\\" sounds like two completely different bands altogether. Buckingham is up to his usual experimental trickery (or gimmickry, if you will) that consistently brings undue attention to the production, with little of substance behind it. As an experimentor, Buckingham has a million ideas. As a songwriter....he has four. And it shows. \\"Come\\" is the new CD's version of \\"I'm So Afraid / Tango in the Night\\". \\"Murrow Turning Over in His Grave\\" is the new \\"World Turning\\". \\"Miranda\\" the new \\"Don't Let Me Down Again\\". Get the idea? Buckingham has always fancied himself an auteur like Brian Wilson or Prince, but he'd have to be a songwriter first, and his ideas aren't sturdy enough to support all the fuss. His one great experiment, the magnificent title song from \\"Tusk\\", is a quater century old. Most of what has followed is just much ado about zilch. His few pleasant numbers here, \\"What's the World Coming To\\", \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" and \\"Bleed to Love Her\\", are no more than that and still rate as filler to the best cuts here. And both \\"Steal...\\" and \\"Bleed to...\\" have previously appeared on other CDs, further evidence of Buckingham's dearth of new ideas. He has stated in interviews that he spent ten years developing these songs. Ten years? On this stuff? Irving Berlin he ain't. That said, Buckingham once again proves that no one arranges or produces Stevie's daydreams with the same panache or feel for texture. And Nicks has come up with a collection of songs to rival some of her best work (2001's \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\", described as her return from the ashes, pales in comparison). Her voice is more weathered than ever (she sounds a bit fried from her most recent tour), but it nevertheless has a welcome familiarity amidst Buckingham's oddball stuff. \\"Say You Will\\" is an instant Fleetwood Mac classic that easily stands with their best work. It's a euphoric ditty with a chorus whose hook could catch sharks. Nicks recreates her reputation here as a guilty pleasure who really knows how to create moving pop songs with sublime energy. \\"Thrown Down\\" and \\"Destiny Rules\\" aren't far behind in quality, with Nicks moving a bit beyond her trademark mysticism to reach a larger audience. At this late date, Nicks still shows progress as a songwriter, but these songs still manage to satisfy in her classic mode. More familiar territory is covered in \\"Silver Girl\\", another Nicks ode to herself, but this time Buckingham provides a resonant arrangement that enhances the song's melodic strength while deemphasizing its lyrical conceit. \\"Running Through the Garden\\" and \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" are two of her best flat-out rockers in years.  Another gem is the closer, \\"Goodbye Baby\\", which continues Nicks' tradition of elegant farewell songs and is an exquisite finale. Would that the CD held up this standard throughout. Nicks did her share. Well, Mr. Buckingham?
B00003OSU4|5.0|I have always loved this documentary, but there wasn't enough Dinah Washington for my taste.  I have the album, &quot;Dinah Washington at Newport '58&quot; and she sings Bessie Smith's &quot;Backwater Blues&quot; in a shattering performance.  Why they chose &quot;All of Me&quot; over &quot;BB&quot; is beyond me.  They probably filmed it, why didn't they include it in this DVD?
B00004Z459|1.0|the title of my review is not an overstatement. this really is one of the most overated bands i have ever seen. i still remember how popular this band was last year at my school. so many people had it playing on their walkmans. and i never understood why! this is simply a band that cant figure out whether they want to be hip hop or rock. chester's screams annoy me half to death. and they need to lose that mike shinoda guy. his little rap parts totally ruin what could be good songs. yeah this band does have somewhat of a shot at becoming something decent. it could happen if chester learns to sing, if mike gets lost, and if their guitarist learned to play rather than play the same chord throghout the entire song. you dont need to be Jimi Hendrix to notice that the same riff is played thoroughout an entire song. and a good album doesnt need to have half of the album released as singles. when the 3rd or 4th single was released, i was about ready to rip my hair out. and their music videos make no sense might i add.<br />you want some good music? check out godsmack, testament, iron maiden, metallica (pre-Load), megadeth, slayer, or judas priest. for people that think this is rock, you have my pity.
B00005U1YO|5.0|This is the greatest cd from them ever. From the test and come with us to star guitar and pioneer skies this cd is one of the best techno discs i have ever bought
1577311523|3.0|This is indeed a good book, making an established spiritual concept easily digestable.  It will surely help some people to feel better and take on a new perspective, at least for awhile, and that is a good thing. It will be interesting to see if this best seller begins to corrupt the teacher and his organization. Typically, the following herd becomes more and more worshipful, as the pedestal that the teacher sits on gets higher and higher. Already the web site speaks to more distance between Mr. Tolle and his corresponders and the \\"enlightened one's\\" every interest is examined. While those are certainly cynical thoughts, I have seen it happen too many times. The true measure of the veracity of one's teachings is weather or not one's enlightenment story REALLY happened. If it didn't, the teachings should be taken at another level, as  words for guidance, and a way to salve the author's ego and wallet, but not as ultimate truth.
B000002LR3|3.0|It's kinda hard to understand an album's historical relevance when you buy it 13 years too late. So I won't pretend to. All I can say is that if I heard this on the radio, I wouldn't believe it was all the same group. They don't even sound like they belong on the same record label sometimes. Still, if I heard it on the radio, I wouldn't change the channel. So what kind of music would I call it? I'd call it good early nineties music. No genre.
B000002J1L|4.0|\\"Nursery Cryme\\", Phil Collins' first album with Genesis, sets the tone for their albums during much of the seventies: great music, seamlessly incorporating classical symphonics and electric rock . . . and lyrics which tell bizarre, surreal stories. Among the subject matter of this collection of songs you will find: a music box which plays \\"Old King Cole\\" and channels the spirit of a murdered blueblood, giant plants taking over the world, and a fountain which turns all who bathe in it into hermaphrodites. The best song on this album is undoubtedly the opener, \\"The Music Box\\". This little ditty tells the story of Henry-Hamilton-Smythe minor, who is murdered by a certain Cynthia Jane with a croquet mallet. When she plays a certain musical box, the corporeal ghost of Henry returns and attempts to rape her, but dissolves when the Cynthia's nurse rushes in and destroys the box. Actually, I'm relying on the story which accompanies the printed lyrics in the booklets for this summary, since you sure couldn't tell any of this by the lyrics themselves. Never mind, because what really matters in \\"The Musical Box\\" is the music, which builds gradually from a soft lazy acoustic piece, to a powefully rousing, all-out rocking finale. \\"The Return Of The Giant Hogweed\\" contains an irresitible groove. \\"The Fountain of Salamicis\\" while not quite up to the level of these two songs, does have a beautiful intro piece. The shorter numbers help balance out the major epics, and \\"Harlequin\\" is particularly lovely. A very good album. If you only know Genesis from the radio-formula crud Collins churned out in the 80's and 90's, this album may surprise you (as it did me).
0609610570|1.0|Without substance.<BR>Like listening to a couple blow hards boast about how effective they are.<BR>Uninspiring.<BR>And most annoying, this book is arrogantly contradictory. You're reading along, and just as you think you might be reading a worthwhile and helpful point, the book flip-slops to an opposite point. \\"One must never micromanage\\" to \\"one must never be a delegating-type manager.\\" Or, \\"have humility, but be decisive.\\"<BR>In the end, the translation to this corporate manager reader is this: do whatever you want, pretend to have noble intentions, and always justify your actions with an \\"execution\\" spin.<BR>Very unimpressive.
B00008BXJF|5.0|A couple of years ago I wrote a raving review on \\"The ContruKCtion of Light\\".  I said that it \\"hits the high points of the last twenty years of King Crimson's approach\\".  Two years later, I still don't think that it's the worst entry in the King Crimson catalog, but \\"The Power of Believe\\" renders it obsolete.  I can quite confidently say that I think it's their best since \\"Discipline\\".<br />In my own mind, comparing \\"The Power to Believe\\" with \\"Discipline\\" is a very, very tall order.  In all actuality, it is hardly fair.  Even today, twenty years after its release, I can listen to that album and be fascinated by it.  \\"The Power to Believe\\" has not had the chance to weather that kind of test.  In all honesty, I think that \\"Disicpline\\" has an overall accessibility that \\"The Power to Believe\\" does not concern itself with.<br />While it may not have unseated \\"Discipline\\", it may give \\"Red\\" a run for its money.  As Fripp and Belew continue to chase melodies back and forth through unbelievable multimeter acrobatics just like they have since 1981, they simultaneously recall the menacing, riff-driven textures of the Wetton-era line-up.  This synthesis was an area that \\"The ContruCKtion of Light\\" had some success with.  However, the holy moments of divine intensity that album shared with \\"Red\\"- in particular \\"FraCKtured\\" and \\"Lark's Tounges part IV\\" - are the launching pad that the most basic styles on \\"The Power to Believe\\" takes off from.<br />You see, \\"The Power to Believe\\" was road-tested.  King Crimson's most serious fans have heard many of these songs before through EP's, internet-only releases and constant but unheralded live performances.  Fripp has increasingly espoused the idea that the spiritual support of the audience is a major vehicle for proper musiKCing, and the conviction that they display here makes that theory very believable.<br />Spirituality aside, this approach has given the \\"newest\\" members of King Crimson a solid opportunity to continue developing and refining their own voices.  Trey is transparent, brilliant, and is a fascinating voice in the lineup.  The drumming is also electrifying and sometimes inexplicable.  It's my understanding that one of the reasons that Bill Bruford parted ways with King Crimson was because he was not interested in the &quot;virtual drumming&quot; that Fripp was pushing for.  I always thought this standpoint was curious, considering for a large portion of his career Bruford has played octagonal pads that don't actually create any sound without being plugged into something.  However, in \\"Level Five\\", I can better understand the difference, and Pat Mastelotto is most certainly the man for realizing this new texture.<br />Other top-notch tracks (if I HAD to pick) would be \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" (great lyrics), \\"Dangerous Curves\\" (for recalling the ostinato-driven classic \\"The Talking Drum\\"), and the now-classic \\"Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With\\" (for improving the song by actually removing a substantial chunk of it).  Again, the harrowing consistency of the album makes it difficult to pick just these.  It really is a piece of music from beginning to end that is most satisfying when taken as a whole.<br />The lowdown: if you have read any of my reviews at all, you will see the name King Crimson come up a lot.  They are a very powerful musical influence on me personally and a reference for much of what I listen to.  \\"The Power to Believe\\" is a good one.g and refining their own voices.

B00008DDSC|5.0|For some reason, I never wanted to see this film.  The movie poster put me off somewhat.  I figured it would be just another artsy sex film, but how I was wrong.  Its starts as the story of a young woman emerging from a mental hospital and back into her life with a dysfunctional family that is all too real.  Unsure what to do with her life, she applies for a job as a secretary at a law firm.  But this is no ordinary office and Lee is no ordinary girl.  Edward and Lee begin a strange and turbulent work relationship that later develops into a Dominant/Submissive relationship.  As the film progresses, it becomes more bizarre. ...<br />What makes this film so great is Maggie.  She is able to lend an innocent quality to Lee that makes her oddly enduring.  Yes, she is submissive and a freak by normal standards, but she is also a demure quiet girl.  James Spader is good as well in his role as the sadistic boss that oddly falls in love with her throughout the film.  I have to say its one of the strangest romances captured on film and the characters are well-drawn and created in a way that makes them likeable in their own ways.<br />\\"Secretary\\" is a film some people will hate.  Well, I loved it.  Its strange and its fabulous.  If you like really different movies, this is the one to see.<br />I give it two thumps up!
0385486804|4.0|Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer was assigned to my senior English class at a significant time in our high school careers and was met with few objections. Growing up in the typical New England fashion, I can empathize with Chris McCandless' desire to escape the repetitious, self-involved lifestyle that plagues Connecticut and Virginia alike. For me, college is the first escape but I am left wondering `and then what'? Into the Wild tells the story of a young man who went in search of something more. After graduation, he picked up his backpack and hitchhiked across country. His family never heard from again, until he was found dead in Alaska. This story allowed our class the opportunity to question why a young man, very similar to all of us, chose to break from society and I recommend the book to anyone that is unsure where they are going. <BR> Jon Krakauer uses his skill as an investigatory journalist to capture the small details of the life of Chris McCandless, allowing us to somewhat experience what Chris did. While the majority of my class believes that Chris was arrogant and possibly suicidal, I firmly disagree. The boy was used to success so it was natural that he assumed he could make it out of Alaska alive and he did not think that he was better than nature as some Alaskans believe. He obviously thought incredibly highly of nature, to completely leave his family, just to explore it. However, despite my beliefs concerning his reasoning, the fact is we will never know. That's why this book was so good. While Krakauer sometimes bored the reader with his own biography, he picked the perfect passages from interviews and letters enabling the reader to know Chris as a person, which made us question why he left his comfortable life. The excerpt from Into the Wild that explained it best to me was the preamble in chapter three. From Wallace Stegner's The American West as Living Space, \\"It should not be denied...that being footloose has always exhilarated us. It is associated in our minds with escape from history and oppression and law and irksome obligations, with absolute freedom, and the road has always led west.\\" While I don't know where the road always leads, I do know that there is just something about an adventure that really gets us going. I think that Chris was trying to escape and find `that thing' and there was an unfortunate turn of events. I give Into the Wild four stars for its commendable efforts in the study of Chris McCandless.
0780622553|4.0|This movie reminds me of the same city like landscape that the Matrix holds. I think the same cinematographer worked on both of those films but that's my opinion. This movie is really good and the story is worth watching the movie and finding out exactly what is wrong with the town. The main character is excellent at portraying his innocence when he is the one with the true power and starts unlocking deep secrets held in the most darkest places of the town. Cool movie and worth the pick up!
B00005JKCH|4.0|Willem Dafoe, oh, he was perfectly cast as the Green Goblin.  He gets the job done, better than any comic book movie villian ever has.  Tobey Maguire as Spidey?  Well, I've see far studlier action heroes but he is pretty good.  Ladies, I'm sure you'll agree with me when I say he sure looked buff once that little arachnid sunk it's teeth in!  I like Tobey as Peter Parker a lot, but they could have had two people play the role (it's been done before and would have worked here): one as Peter Parker, and another actor as Spiderman.  He's too old for it, but fifteen years ago Arnold would have been ideal.<br />The special effects were absolutely thrilling.  Everything looked great with the vital exception of Spiderman himself.  In fact, my biggest problem with the movie is that Spidey looks like a cartoon character swinging around.  They should have used a real person.  <br />The DVD looks and sounds totally acceptable.  I have no use for the second disc, as I see no point in watching what are essentially advertisements for a movie that I already own.  Yes, there seems to be lots of stuff on the second disc, but what's the point?<br />Recommended for both girls and boys under 16.
B00008LOS1|5.0|This is already a great album and you probably have multiple copies.  But the bonus matierals show the band honing the material.  The live second CD features a tighter, more mature band than appeared on the amazing Live at Leeds.  I hope the band released more live material from various tours (Quadrophenia, Who By Numbers).  I personally want to hear as much of the band with Entwistle and Moon as the rhythm section that I can.<br />Pete-o-phile
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album just keeps rockin', song after song. Combining the best from its members' talents and past experiences, it entertains. As good as a greatest hits album from both Rage and Soundgarden, but with entirely new songs. 'Show Me How to Live' is one of the greatest &quot;pump it up&quot; jams to come out in a while. Try it, you won't be disappointed.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a great cd. Being a guitarist I respect what Evanescence is trying to do with there music. Amy Lee's vocals are so powerful that if you removed the music and just listen to her, you get a sence of tranquillity. The combination of power cord guitars, sting arrangements, and piano/keyboard only enhance Amy's awsome voice. I highly recomend this cd to anyone who likes rock, goth rock, or just good music. This band is soft and melodic as well as hard and edgy. Love this cd and can't wait for a follow up album.
B00005221L|4.0|Let me first say when I hear about Arnold Schwarzenagger being in a film I absolutely cringe when I hear it because to tell you the truth....I think he sucks. Anyways I like this movie because it contains a really good looking and scary villain and the only actor to take him on is Arnold which I did not mind this time. He does not talk much in this film (which is a good thing) as he tries to create a good strategy in destroying the man-hunting beast. I like how the creature can only see in infrared making it very hard for any human being to hide from the big bug looking creature. I like this film because it deals with the same matter as in 'Alien', in which you the viewer watch a man who has weaknesses try to defeat a 'Perfect Killing Machine' and tries to escape it's powerful fate of death.

B00000ILDF|2.0|The third installment of what would become a four-part (so far) series, Alien3 is by far the weakest entry.  The story isn't bad, though not terribly original, either.  Ripley, having escaped with Newt in &quot;Aliens&quot; lands on a prison planet.  There she fends off a smaller, faster &quot;Alien&quot; along with some inmates.  All of the actors are good in there roles, and Director Fincher does create a truly grimy, often overwhelmingly depressing atmosphere.  But that's the film's achille's heel too--its depressing.  In a trend that Fincher would &quot;fine-tune&quot; in his later film &quot;Seven&quot;, he creates a true Bummer of a film from the opening scenes.  When Ripley is discovered alive, it is also revealed that Newt, the lovable little girl who went through hell with Ripley to make it out alive at the end of &quot;Aliens&quot; is dead--killed by another Alien as she slept.  Why?  No reason given--other than setting up Fincher's obsession for bleakness.  Bottom line, Fincher, who got his start in Madonna videos, might make a good Director of Photography, but he's a lousy director.  Bleakness aside, this film has none of the suspense of Ridley Scott's original or the energy and action of James Cameron's follow-up &quot;Aliens&quot;.  Like a fat feline that just got back from the groomer's, it looks good but just lays there.  Stick with the first one if you want scares, the second if you want thrills.
0385504209|3.0|I liked this book more the first time I read it, when it was called Holy Blood, Holy Grail.  The Priory of Sion, Leonardo da Vinci the occultist, Catholic conspiracies, this material has all been covered many times before, Mr. Brown's much touted \\"research\\" notwithstanding.  The author's main achievement has been putting these polished little gems of Western religious counterculture in a briskly entertaining format with genuine mass market appeal, something that Mr. Eco and the authors of the aforementioned title lacked the marketing savvy (or desire) to do in their own efforts.  So chalk this one up as a success in the emerging paranoid-religious-occult genre, the title keywords being Freemasonry, Rosslyn, Templars, Holy Grail, and so on and so forth.  If you're looking for something a little meatier, I suggest the book I mentioned previously.  It is especially delectable for the way in which the authors are manipulated by the propaganda they are researching.
B000053VAF|5.0|I seen this movie in the theatres when it came out and fell in love with it from beginning to end. This movie contains more of the smart humor mixing fact with a hilarious factoidic twist! I can see why people either really hate the movie or really like it and that is mainly because that's how Kevin Smith directs his movies. If you like what you see in the beginning of this film then the whole film is non stop keeping you watching and listening till the credits role. Surprising cast at work in this one as well!
B00007AJKI|5.0|A great movie that explores the highest levels of psychology and sociology.  A movie that demands frequent viewing and discussion.  I'd recommend the DVD to see the story behind 'rotomation' the computer animation specially designed for this movie!
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I'm writing this after only two listens to the entire CD, but my reaction so far is: Sure do miss the down-to-earth influence that Christine McVie lent to the Mac. Lindsey and Stevie turn in some very nice performances here, but their eccentricities were always (in my opinion) easier to bear when every third cut was a Christine ballad -- without spacey lyrics and experimental instrumentations that sometimes work, and sometimes just interfere. However, there is one cut on &quot;Say You Will&quot; that has already become one of my favorite Mac songs: the title song (from Stevie Nicks). The melody rolls along happily, the lyrics are accessible and uplifting, and the harmonies remind me somewhat of '60s vocal groups like the Mamas and Papas. This tune helps fill the void left by Christine's absence. I wish the CD had a few more like it.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|What a career...What a band........ I was a little weary of the new Fleetwood Mac minus Christine McVie, but there was no need to worry. Stevie and the guys have pulled out a disc that is equally as good as Tango in the Night, and/or better. A total of 18 tracks, and only two that I found a little out of place. Standout tracks include Miranda, Everbody finds out, Smile at you, and Steal your heart away. This package of songs contains some of the best material that Lindsey and Stevie have been involved in for years. Stevie sounds stronger than ever, and it's like Lindsey was never away from the band. There will be some negative response since Christine stood out of this project. Honestly though, she is not missed. Yes, she has written and also done vocals on some of the most incredible Mac tunes, but the band succeeds in moving on without her participation. This cd is a must have for any true music lover that appreciates songwriting/ and musicianship in its finest form. It's like the Mac have never left us.............. A+++++++ Say you will is 5 stars and then some.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This album is due!!!! But it's finally here! What the hell is so good about Dave Grohl? If I grew my hair long joined nirvana and played the drums like I was having an epilecti seizure than I would be a great drummer too! QOTSA-STAY AWAY FROM GROHL!!!- I only say that because David Grohl is totally overrated and should look at his debut FOO album and try to fix a similair sound to that. This album contains that oh soo nice Queens rock sound that not even 20% of bands today dare to sound like (the whole stupid garage band phase)and the rock melodies continue from track to track creating an album to see in many peoples libraries soon! FOR SURE!
B00005JLF5|5.0|I'll spare everyone a lengthy review as I'm probably not saying anything new.  I just wanted to say that the series is as good as I remember it.  Especially given the atrocious &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Nemesis&quot;, it's nice to remember why I started watching Star Trek in the first place.
B000000LZV|5.0|This collection of tunes is necessary...<br />One moment they're weaving small tight grooves then suddenly boon will break off into a fragmented-elastic pseudo-blues/jazz riff... Very Cool (without getting over-used). The upbeat tempo's and catchy lyrics will leave you with a positive, if not somewhat fiesty, attitude!<br />Overall, this minutemen offering will stick with you like a bad case of herpes. Great driving music!!! You'll be tap'n your toes and sing'n along,  I guarantee!
B00008H2LB|5.0|At first, I was hesitant to listen to Meteora because I was afraid to be dissapointed like I had been when I heard Reanimation. However, just from hearing the foreword, I was sucked into this CD! I LOVE it, and I can't understand why people wouldn't. It's got a much more matured sound, Chester and Mike's vocals both took a turn for the better, and it was just overall AMAZING. I couldn't stop listening to it! Anyone who says that Meteora is boring and unoriginal must be going deaf because this is an EPIC album. It falls just a little short in terms of length, but I'd rather listen to 36 minutes of music worth listening to than an hour of sloppily put together garbage.<BR>Linkin Park is an awsome band, and they have outdone themselves this time. The long wait was DEFINETLY worth it.
B000067J1H|4.0|If you want a movie that gives you that type of repulsed, what the hell are they gonna do now! type of movie than Fight Club is for you. It's a story of a man who's life falls in shambles but after he meets a stranger on a plane he buddies with him and the chaos that the two combine are able to brainwash every male being in their perimeter of contact. Alot of cool facts are discoverd in this film and I would put this under the mullholland drive, pulp fiction type of movie watcher. The cinematography is really good in the film and you can even see some surprising pop-ups on screen where you will have to keep on rewinding and looking back closely to see if they actually bleeped that image for a second....maybe they did maybe they didn't...only you can find out when you watch this film.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I absolutely love this album. <BR>When I listen Norah Jones's voice at first, I really couldn't help surprising. <BR>Specially the first song of this album moved me deeply. <BR>A soft voice,a melodious music in album is sweet.<br />I run mad about music,in that JAZZ.<BR>I play the jazz piano, although I'm not an influential person.  <BR>And I am studying to be MISIC DRECTER. <br />Anyway I will gladly recommend this.
B000001EL3|5.0|KISS had something to prove after the runaway success of &quot;ALIVE!&quot; and they pulled out all the stops for &quot;Destroyer.&quot; First off, they hired Bob Ezrin, who was responsible for forging the chaos of Alice Cooper into a multi-platinum band. They also had never made any bones about the fact that they didn't just want to be stars, they wanted to be MEGA-STARS, so there aren't too many risks involved. (With the exception of recording the strings on &quot;Beth,&quot; perhaps.) They were - thanks to &quot;Alive!&quot; - crowned one of the hardest, greatest working live bands in the world, now they wanted to make it clear they could lay it down on record as well.<br />So into the studio they went, and out popped a semi-conceptual album about each member of the band. There's Paul the Love God (&quot;Do You Love Me?&quot;), Gene the Demon King (&quot;Sweet Pain,&quot; and &quot;God Of Thunder&quot;), Ace the rocker (&quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;) and Peter as the sentimental love cat (&quot;Beth&quot;). Ezrin's touch is obvious in the opener &quot;Detroit Rock City's&quot; car/radio/crash sound effects, and of course the squealing kids that pop up in &quot;God Of Thunder.&quot; Layering the production with keyboards and overdubs also brought out the best in the band's compostional skills.<br />Between Ezrin and KISS, &quot;Destroyer&quot; finally shows off the band's musical muscle. Criss' playing in &quot;D.R.C.&quot; is standout, and the band gets crunchy on &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; On the other hand, things gets a little too obvious with &quot;Flaming Youth,&quot; which sounds cribbed from Alice Cooper's Department of the same territory, and &quot;Shout It Out Loud,&quot; tries way too hard to be &quot;Rock And Roll All Night Pt 2.&quot; Save those minor missteps and you have one fine rocking album. &quot;Destroyer&quot; was polished enough to give us long suffering fans the dose of KISS we'd always known they were capable of, gave the band some of the critical respect that was due them, and perpetuated the KISS course to rock domination that they had worked so hard to attain.critical respect that was due them, and perpetuated the KISS course to rock domination that they had worked so hard to attain.
0425170349|3.0|I enjoyed this book on a surface level - it's fast paced and the action keeps moving and is quite exciting - but it falls foul to the usual Tom Clancy blunders - maybe even more than usual as all of the book is set in a non-American country. <br />Clancy uses all the sterotypical versions of &quot;foreigners&quot; - all the English call each other &quot;old chap&quot;, the Austrailians use the word &quot;rather&quot; which is completely untrue and I get the feeling that if some Austrians were in the novel they would be wearing leiderhosen and singing &quot;The sound of music&quot;. Other facts about the English setting are completely inaccurate - if a book is to be set in a real life place then care should be taken to accuratly describe the setting.<br />Then of course there is the usual Clancy right wing political and military musings which become rather nauseous after a while. The characters are pretty one dimensional and don't seem to have any depth to them.<br />It's a good book to simply read and enjoy - but sickening on a deeper political level and extremely annoying and insulting to the non-American. Hence 3 stars only
0790729628|4.0|This is movie displays alot of good filmmaking considered the fact that it was made during the 80's and the visuals for this are amazing and pure state of the art during the time of it's release in the theatre. I though there would be some big collector's edition of this film but this is the only thing they are going to release for Blade Runner in a long time. If your into the Sci-Fi genre with a few good twists and turns then Blade Runner is very fit for your collection!
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble is such a talented musician.  Its so nice to hear somebody with real talent amidst the fabricated pop of my generation.  As a young vocal jazz musician, it's very refreshing to have a younger jazz inspiration to look to.  Great CD!!
B00000AFHM|5.0|Well ther's not a lot to say about Belle and Sebastian<BR>their work it's just perfect and this very particular album is their finest pice of work, buy it.
0898159156|5.0|This has got to be the best book in print about raising carnivorous plants.  There is a lot of practical and down-to-earth advice.  I especially like that Hewitt uses everyday language to discuss the plants, and even throws in some humor in his discussions, i.e. cobra plants. . . buy one and enjoy its beauty now, because they are really hard to keep, and this is the best it will ever look. . .
B0000640SA|5.0|I first seen a show on this film which is a documentary feature on the dvd as well! (HAHAHA DVD is awesome) Then i heard that the same director - Chris Nolan was going to direct the next Batman film! So I picked this version up since the stoner guy who worked at the recore store quoted &quot;Dude, that's like a hefty limited edition man, if you don't get I will!&quot; So I bought it and I loved it, now I'm looking for his first film - FOLLOWING- which I can't but so far memento is absolutely amazing! I can't wait for any other type of work that Chris Nolan puts out with. He seems like he only directs movies with characters of truly very unique situations so Batman is a perfect fit for this future king of film! If you heard of memento then I suggest you see it because it is a film unlike any other that I have ever laid eyes on for a long time.
B00004Z459|5.0|I actually bougt this cd ot of curiosity, cause i havn't heard anything about this group before, from the moment i first heard the CD i was blown away, to this date in the best CD in my collection. Is one of those CDs that you can play and not hit the skip botton. This ladys and gents is a true clasic in it's oun time.
B00005JLEU|2.0|I've watched the movie in Asia over 2 years ago when it first came out. It is the most wonderful Japanese anime I've ever seen. I had waited two years for the zone-1 version to come out.<br />And I'm totally disappointed by the picture quality of this DVD! It's blurry and desaturated. It's lost all the sharpness and saturation of the original movie. Can't believe Disney did such a bad job on Telecine (the film transfer process) for this award-winning movie.<br />But the problem is, for this DVD, disc 2 (the Original Japanese trailers) is better than disc 1. The first several trailers just look gorgeously crisp and clear with absolutely no blurs, and the color looks vibrant and vivid.. <br />So, I think Disney should consider re-mastering this movie or offering a refund program. Watching this DVD, my wife says, is like watching a VCR. Great Movie, bad DVD...what a waste...
B000002H97|5.0|The 'Black Album' is the classic album that put the HEAVY in HEAVY METAL.  Of  course the Metallicats were accused yet again of selling out because, HORROR OF HORRORS, they dared put a ballad on this disc. Finally, with the help of super producer Bob Rock, (Oh yeah Bob was further evidence that Metallica had sold out)Metallica's sound in the studio does their music justice.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Fleetwood Mac's first studio album in 8 years, and it's first with guitarist Lindsey Buckingham since 1987, has all the characteristics of a classic Mac album. Stevie Nicks' deep vocals match her eclectic lyrics quite well, and Buckingham's dark and occasionally confusing songs are well represented. The album, however, is missing a key component in former keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie. McVie, who is responsible for such hits as &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;, and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; has retired from the band. Although she provides backing vocals on one track, her absense is quite evident. McVie's optimistic and happy music was the glue that held the band's music together. Her beautiful voice also was key in Mac's famed 3-part harmony.<BR>Best bets on this album are &quot;Thrown Down&quot;, &quot;Smile At You&quot;, &quot;Peacekeeper&quot;, and the title track, which is destined to become a hit.
B00005RIKD|5.0|This is a staple in my CD collection.  I love every song.  I play it when I'm reading or cleaning the house or spending time with close friends.
B0000640SE|5.0|In this package, you will receive both of Christopher Nolan's cult masterpieces. Both are very entertaining and stylistic, impressing the audience on several different levels. They are visually appealing, dramatically appealing, and each has an underlying aura or premise which will draw you in even further.<br />Memento is the more commonly hailed of these two, and might be classified as \\"mainstream.\\" Guy Pierce plays a man with a rare disease, which disallows him to form new memories. Since his accident, he has been unable to withold \\"new\\" knowledge for more than approximately five minutes. Yeah, it sounds kinda silly and far-fetched, but it's the key to the movie, and a testament to Nolan's genius. Pierce is determined to uncover the mystery behind his wife's death, while dealing with this terribly inconvenient disease. The audience will be fascinated by his shift in lifestyle, which includes having to write continuous notes to himself, many of which are tatooed to his skin. It's also very interesting to bear witness to how easily this character is taken advantage of, and all the strange events which play out as result of his condition. Of course, there is also another nice little touch, which is, of course...The movie is shown in reverse-chronological order. We're shown a scene, and then immediately after, we'll be shown another scene which actually came before the previous scene, chronologically. As one might expect, this can get terribly confusing, but it's also fun and suspenseful. Certainly one of the most notable movies you'll see, with a great ending.<br />Following is much more subtle than Memento, relying on atmosphere, acting and filming style to propel its obscure plot. Artsier in nature, this one is entirely in black-and-white, and has only three characters majorly involved in the main story. We follow a lonely, slightly insane man as he \\"follows\\" various people around the city. One day, he meets up with another \\"follower,\\" and they come together as ateam, robbing houses. Of course, they're not really robbing them for the material sake--they each get an emotional fix out of taking something intimate from someone's household. Naturally, the plot thickens when a female comes into the equation. Up until the last half hour, the movie comes across as simply a poignant, quirky drama about the twisted hobby of two men. However, it turns into something not unlike Memento, when the director plants a few amazing surprises which are bound to leave your mind stimulated. In my opinion, only a hair under the quality of Memento, and still well-worth watching.
B00006RU5B|2.0|A friend of mine couldn't stop raving about the new Audioslave CD so I got it for myself.  I never was a fan of RATM but I did like some of Soundgarden's songs.  I thought that Chris Cornell was the premiere vocalist to emerge from the nineties din of grunge and alternative.  While Audioslave does offer up some heavy riffs, the songs seem monotonous and one dimensional. It's as if they did the basic tracks and then put vocals on them and called it a day.<br />  If you like HEAVY, then you will probably like this disc.  When I listen to this disc, I have yet to get past track ten before being bored to tears.  Heavy Metal by definition is monotonous riff bashing. Therefore, the prerequisite for Heavy Metal bands used to be a guitar player that could smoke a lead and provide some well needed relief from the chunka-chunka monotony.  Audioslave's guitar player doesn't play a descent lead on the entire disc!  Instead he drenches his ... attempts at lead breaks with a plethora of digital effects.<br />The only reason I gave this disc 2 stars instead of just 1 is because I do think that Chris Cornell is a great rock singer and he does have a few nice dynamic moments here.
B00008H2LB|5.0|don't discuss any more. Linkin Park is the best rock band in the world. Meteora is awesome! i can hear it over and over again. My faverites are &quot;figure 9&quot;,&quot;somewhere i belong&quot;,&quot;breaking the habit&quot;,&quot;lying from u&quot;...no bad word, but still hard, it's their music. But why did they have to make their album too short? 36 mins for each Meteora and Hybrid theory. But they're much better than most albums out there. Linkin park is #1
B000003S09|5.0|This is an excellent debut of progressive rock.  The more quiet moments, as well as the absolutely epic &quot;Epitaph&quot; are where King Crimson really shines.  The way that they build songs is just incredible, and really powerful.
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent is what the mainstream has been waiting for. For too long now, we have seen ... rappers come and go, rhyming about things they have never done or even seen. 50 and his backers (namely Eminem) saw this and new there was a nitch already carved in the game that was waiting for someone like him. The hip-hop masses of America needed a true \\"gangster\\" to release a hardcore, yet fully relatable and mainstreamish-appeal album. And this is just what 50 did.<br />The first thing 50 Cent did right was pick his singles. In Da Club is possibly the biggest radio single in the last few years... Everyone, and I do mean Everyone, can sing along with the chorus. This is just 1 of the 4 songs that were produced by sound mastermind Dr. Dre. (with the other 3 being Heat, If I Cant, and P.I.M.P.) which are probably the best beats on the CD. But beats aren't everything. 50's lyrics and phrases need to back up what the engineers can give him. And for the most part - they do. Starting off the CD is a very gangster track, \\"What Up Gangsta\\", and it shows off what can be expected by the rest of the CD. 50 has a very laid back style, but at the same time his words are serious and memorable. He knows how to write a good verse that will stick with his listener. Eminem also had a major impact on the way this CD sounds and on 50's career in general. Without Em, I don't think there'd be such a craze for 50 at the moment. Producing and featured on 2 tracks of his own, Eminem adds a bit to the CD. \\"Patiently Waiting\\" is the first, and although 50 Cent has 2 cool verses on it, I still find myself waiting for Eminem to come in - simply because he's flawless in this song. The other Shady produced track is \\"Dont Push Me\\" which could have a better beat. Not feeling that one as much. On another note, 50's next single will be \\"21 Questions\\" which features Nate Dogg and is basically the love song of the album. It's a good song, but I think either \\"Heat\\" or \\"If I Cant\\" would have been better.<br />Overall this is a great CD. Not flawless, but for his first \\"big\\" CD, a very good piece of work. If you're a fan of rap, I'd pick this one up quick.<br />Beats: 94 / 100<br />Lyrics: 88 / 100<br />Flow: 87 / 100<br />Final Score: 91 / 100 . A-all this is a great CD. Not flawless, but for his first \\"big\\" CD, a very good piece of work. If you're a fan of rap, I'd pick this one up quick.<br />Beats: 94 / 100<BR>Lyrics: 88 / 100<BR>Flow: 87 / 100<br />Final Score: 91 / 100 . A-
B000002HRE|5.0|Reload is aptly titled because it is the second half of Load which was originally suppose to be a two disc set. The songs on ReLoad are of the same vein as Load albeit heavier.  The opening song, Fuel, is a straight ahead rocker about driving fast cars.  In fact, for the past two years NBC has used the opening of Fuel as the intro for their NASCAR coverage.  The Memory Remains is a strange 'video' song that  has Marianne Faithfull on backing vocals. Devil's Dance has a demonic sounding riff that sets a perfect tone for the song.  The Unforgiven II is another example of James Hetfield airing his personal problems in song that I think I may actually like better than the original.  I wonder what James is going to sing about now that he has gone through rehab?<br />My favorite song on ReLoad is the last track, Fixxxer. The intro to this song is vintage Metallica. The song fades in with some sampled guitar/bass sounds that sound like a heavy metal bumble bee.  Then comes a slide guitar with a four-tap delay on it just to make it interesting. then the bass and kick drum come in along with a second guitar playing a bluesy riff.  All of this builds to a thunderous crescendo that kicks into the song much like the beginning of 'Sandman.<br />My least favorite song is Low Man's Lyric.  This song just sort of lays there. It's another example of James airing his personal problems in song. I have enuff personal problems of my own so I don't need to hear about his in a mediocre song.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|For even the most ardent fans of Fleetwood Mac, Say You Will may prove to be an epitaph on a tombstone for this once great band.<BR>Though the abscense of Christine McVie serves as a dissapointment to most, that is not the problem with this release. The CD should have been entitled the Buckingham Nicks finale. While the rythmn section of Fleetwood and McVie are quite superlative in form on Say You Will, they seem like the backup of the other members. <br />The album is full of techno pop synthesized guitar and vocals by Buckingham and Nicks. It is completely divorced of reality as if<BR>it were the remnants of some mad dream. Buckingham has never really proved himself to be of the caliber of former guitarists Peter Green or Bob Weston from the spectacular Behind The Mask release. Save for four or five songs, the album meanders on in the new millenium.<br />Fleetwood Mac should have called it a day after the great live The Dance CD. It was their peak of a very long career.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Although Fleetwood mac have never left, this is their first studio cd with Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks since 1987's &quot;Tango In The Night&quot;... this new CD is GREAT.  18 songs, 77 minutes it's definitely padded but a majority of the songs are incredible, particularily &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; &amp; &quot;Thrown Down&quot;.  &quot;Miranda&quot; strays too close to sounding like &quot;Big Love&quot;, and one song(forgot which one) borders on heavy metal with all the guitars wailing and shredding and the tail end of the CD gets kinda uninteresting(and &quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave&quot; seems oddly out of place ANYWHERE on the cd) but with 18 songs, the hit/miss ratio is pretty high.  A must buy for any fan of &quot;Rumours&quot; or the Buckingham/Nicks years.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica proved that they were a force to be reckoned with when they put out this thrash metal masterpiece.  Of course this was their major label debut and many people accused them of selling out blah blah blah. Sellouts or not, this disc ROCKS!  If you like HEAVY, buy PUPPETZ. You will not be disappointed.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Here it is, the limited edition Degradation Trip 1&2, 25 tracks instead of the original 14! The complete artwork, the way Jerry Cantrell (Alice in Chains' mastermind and writer of hits like Would, Grind, The Rooster or Them Bones) designed it to be. It's a trip in the centre of your soul, your ego. Maybe it should go with a warning: no use in case of depression. No record you get easy access to. Although songs like Anger Rising - watch out for the video - and Angel Eyes or She Is My Girl (from the Spiderman-OST) actually have the classical qualities for success. But if you let go, you will be easily caught by the spell of these songs. This compilation offers you a whole new dimension. In comparison to Degradation Trip 1 you can call Boggy Depot (Cantrell's first solo work) though all its darkness a walk in the sunshine, cause Deg Trip 1 goes a lot deeper in Cantrell's psyche. Volume 1& 2 completes this and builds up a stylistic connection between both records. Most of the new material is related to the music-business and how it corrupts the artist's personality (Owned, Pro False Idol), and that quite merciless. It will surprise you that these songs didn't make it on the first version. Cause they give you a sense of Jerry Cantrell's versatility. So much variety and so much of the spirit of Alice in Chains, it's a pleasure! Sometimes it rises memories of Facelift and Dirt. When you listen to Pig Charmer it's like hearing Layne Staley (R.I.P.) sing. Not to talk of Hurt's Don't It with these haunting hypnotic guitars. No matter if you already have Degradation Trip 1. You have to get Volume 1&2 because of the new songs. When you are a fan of AIC ... this is an absolute must!
185984054X|1.0|Is this the worst that can be said? That Mother Theresa was Catholic (and so prayed, wanted to convert others to be Catholic and opposed abortion despite not having all the answers to India's population problem), and that people contributing to her order were contributing to an order (which built churches and convents as well as hospices and clinics) and not to a secular charity looking to impose a rigorous separation between its works and any religious views of its staff. I really don't think the people who contributed, and contribute, to her order were ever in confusion about this. <br />It actually reminds me a lot of the criticisms leveled against her by the local govt in Calcutta. Their emperor's new clothes like problem was that despite their views on how she should spend the money given to her, she did a lot more actual good for the poorest of the poor in Calcutta then they did. The fact she didn't solve all their problems in one stroke did not take away from the fact she gave people abandoned on the street to die a place to die with dignity and caring - something the local govt and various international agencies could not achieve despite annual budgets several times her orders. <br />The WHO, UN, USAID and the govts of Calcutta and India have not been able to solve Calcutta's medical situation. Hitchen's criticisms that she did not do more are laughable. What did he do? What did any of us do to compare to what this woman achieved in the alleviating of real human suffering and desperation. <br />I would like to live in a world with more Mother Teresas and only someone who has never really tried to do anything about real problems could wish for less Teresas and more Indian govt officials mismanaging funds as the truly poor are left to die in the streets.
B00005U122|2.0|A floyd fan since the 80s and a follower of the solo carreers to a lesser extent since about the mid 90s, when the opportunity came up to see Roger Waters in concert, I jumped at the opportunity.<br />It had its moments, but as a show, it left much to be desired.  After doing a couple old Wall tunes, he closed with his Amnesty International dedication.  Fans were incredibly disappointed that the progression of tunes they were used to from Floyd albumms and shows was not followed.  It was a TERRIBLE closing tune and everyone knew it.  Before it was even over, roughly half the seats in the MGM Grand stadium were emptied.  It was SAD.  The fact that no encore followed only drove home what I'd heard all along (from fans as well as from Roger's interviews) that he didn't really have much respect for fans.<br />Hold your money.  With a little luck, they'll all get over this childish garbage and do a Wall reunion.  Until then, I'm not supporting this garbage any further.

B00008DDXC|4.0|HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a big improvement on the first film. The pace isn't so sluggish and there is more action.Again directed by Chris Columbus, THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS begins with Harry's birthday which he is spending with his scummy Uncle, Aunt and his repulsive behemoth of a cousin. But things change for Harry when he finds Dobby the Elf in his room; who warns him of an evil plot being hatched for the forthcoming year at Hogwarts and tries to talk Harry out of going back. But even though Harry's uncle has literally turned his room into a prison, he is rescued by his friends in Ron Weasly's fathers flying car and returns to Hogwarts. Problems soon arise when someone opens the forbidden Chamber Of Secrets unleashing all sorts of evils for which Harry is blamed, naturally the members of Slitheron delight in this, but then Professor Dumbeldore (the late Richard Harris in his final role) explains that Harry has a special ability, which osctracises him from everyone... And that's only the tip of the iceberg.<BR>The effects this time around surpass the first film and Daniel Radcliffe and his young co-stars are growing nicely into their roles. Some scenes may be a bit scary for younger kids- especially the sequence with the giant spiders, but there is a lot more action here and for schmoes like me who can't get into the books this is well worth a look, if a bit long.<BR>Includes a bonus DVD with \\"deleted scenes\\" which actually appear in the film, so in that respect you've been diddled by Warner Bros. \\"Lockharts Classroom\\" which includes a photo gallery etc, plus photo gallery's for each major character in the film. There's also a doco \\"Behind Hogwarts\\" which features a J.K Rowling interview, \\"student\\" interviews and sketches. \\"Dumbeldore's Office\\": Take a tour and see how designers constructed it for the film. (There's more!) You can also take a Daigon Alley Tour where the viewer controls the camera angles allowing them to move down the street and look at the stores, though there's only one shop you can enter and browse in. And finally there is a game where you match the spell with it's effect and a preview of the computer game.<BR>So if you're a fan, this will be like having Xmas come early. And if you're one of those people who thinks Harry Potter is \\"evil\\", maybe you should find something more constructive to do. This is just a harmless fantasy movie. On lanimilbus segassem ereh. (Read each word backwards and you'll understand!!).
B00008GKEG|5.0|I became a Beatles fan when I first watched the Anthology on ABC back in 1995. I thought I had seen the best documentary ever on them, but there was so much more to be seen! The one that aired on television was about 7 or 8 hours long, this wonderful dvd contains 11 hours of pure Beatles magic! Anything and everything you ever wanted to know, hear, or see is on this dvd. There is footage I've never seen before and performances of so many of their classics. My favorites is the footage of them first starting out all the way through their first trip to America. It looks great, it sounds great, and the story is amazing. The bonus features are so awesome, listening to the three surving members (yes before George passed away) talk about how they created the songs. Just hearing them tell stories about the band was so bittersweet. I was especially moved when Ringo spoke of what it was like recording Free As A Bird and strange it was without John. This dvd is a MUST for any true Beatles fan, it's the best documentary you'll ever find. After viewing it, you will understand why The Beatles simply are the best band in the world.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Wow what a wonderful movie. I watched it with my 5-year-old kid I was moved by the story and animation, though my kid needed some explaining he loved every minute. <BR>Both of us who are used to Hollywood/pixar/Disney movies were interlard by the movie plot and visuals.<BR>Totally recommended. Thank you  Miazaki
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's album is nothing short of magnificent. Her voice has improved tremendously since her last album. The only word that can describe her return is 'WOW'. The album has so many good tracks, 'Impossible', 'Get Mine, Get <BR>Yours',  'Infactuation', 'Fighter', 'Beautiful' and the list goes on and on. The album is great. It's truly the album of the century. Her hair and dress code might be rather dirrty but she's definitely the songstress of the R&B world.
630024797X|4.0|It's nice to view a film which is sappy, but at the same time eschews easy sentiment without being (too) soporific. Great slice of Americana (do not dread the word) that benefits from Wenders' 'outsider' perspective (+ Cooder's guitar, Muller's photography etc.). On the editing front, although the 'not so ebullent' pace of the film is intentional, the amount of ritalin administered during post production might have prooved slightly detrimental to the overall effect. Still, this is an immensely enjoyable experience.
B000089RVX|3.0|I could not get over Amy Lee's beautiful voice and so I reluctantly bought the CD. It's good but.....it was disapointing. The whole CD is about Love and Jesus.  It's very obvious that Christianity is a big part of their music. The CD is really lovey-dovey, but Lee does have a beautiful voice, so I guess it's up to you. If you like serious metal, like I do then THIS IS NOT THE ALBULM FOR YOU. If you're a fan of Christian rock, you might like this. The bottem line: This is a good CD that is no where near hardcore enough.
B000089A07|3.0|Michael Mann purists may turn their qualified noses up at this offering, and there is, granted, much which can be faulted. Contrary to fringe belief, there is also a lot which can be faulted with 'Manhunter'. I do not need to expound tiresomely on these views; they sre to be found in abundance at various sites, including this one. Detractors are eternal. Flawed but entertaining.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Is there anything sweeter than the harmony of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham? Or anything more delicious than Lindsey's strumming of any stringed instrument? For me, after one listen, I can say that &quot;Say You Will&quot; has everything I want from a Fleetwood Mac record. I'm a fan, and I would put this one right up with &quot;Rumors&quot; and &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; in terms of pure consistency. The music is new and at the same time rings of the sound you would hope for from the Mac. I am not trying to neglect Christine McVie at all, she's incredible and she's missed, but this is one solid CD and it screams Fleetwood Mac even without her. Brilliant, can't wait to listen to it over and over. (PS The Limited Edition version is absolutely gorgeous, well worth a couple extra bucks!)
B00005JLEU|5.0|Being an anime fan, I took my mother to see this film over Christmas break.  Keep in mind, my mother is a huge drama buff - she graduated from Michigan State with a Major in drama, writes screenplays, directs, even held a Drama School for awhile.  Until she saw this film, she couldn't understand my enthusiasm over anime.<br />She sighed through the first 10 minutes, but once the parents turned into pigs - she couldn't even blink.  On the way home from the film, she couldn't stop talking about all of the hidden meanings within the film, the characters, the animation, the way that it makes Alice in Wonderland look like Barney in comparison.<br />If you want to introduce an incredibly cynical person to anime - this is the film to introduce them to.  You really can't go wrong with it, no matter how old they are.  After taking my mother, we both took her friend and her friend's 15 year old son, and they too became mesmorized by the film.<br />Adults and children alike will be swept by Spirited Away!
B00005OWEG|5.0|I love this movie. There isn't a dull moment in it. It keeps you gripped from beginning to end. As a creative writing student, I admire this movie greatly. The writing coupled with the superb talent of all those who appear in this film make it the great that it is. The only downside to this DVD is that there are no extra features. There's just the film and the movie trailer. Nothing else. I was surprised. But I still strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to take a peek at the madness of war.
B0000029GA|5.0|After going through all of my old reviews and seeing all of my exclamations of \\"Illmatic\\" as a classic I realized I had never reviewed it.  \\"Illmatic\\" is definately a classic that has in part shaped modern gangsta rap.  Nas, although he was only 20 at the time, came through with the best lyrics on any album I have ever heard.  His lyrics struck as ahead of their time, and ahead of the 20 years Nas had been on this earth.  Although Nas' later releases never were as good as \\"Illmatic\\", Nas is still one of the greatest rappers ever.  If you are confused for who is better in the battle of Nas and Jay-Z, just compare \\"Illmatic\\" to any of Jay-Z's releases, even \\"Reasonable Doubt\\".  Nas' lyrics are matched with top-notch production, and an untouchable flow that hints at his life and how real Nas is.  If you want to start a hip-hop collection, or if you like ANY kind of music, or if you have the money, no matter who you are, pick this album up, listen to Nas' distinguished flow, his straight up REAL lyrics, and the hot production, and I guarentee you, that no matter who you are, you will fall in love with this album.  It's been 9 years since this album came out and I still put it in my CD player and listen.<br />Although every track is special and great, my favorite tracks were \\"Life's A B****\\", \\"World Is Yours\\", \\"Halftime\\", \\"Represent\\", and \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\".<br />Once again, this is a fast-forward free hip-hop classic that should be owned by everybody.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite movies.  It is slow paced, but it certainly pays off in the end.  I did want to point out something raised by another reviewer, regarding the &quot;unnecessary&quot; insertion of the scene where Wentworth comes on behalf on the Crofts to Anne--Jane Austen actually wrote two endings to Persuasion.  The alternate ending you can find in the appendix.  One ending does feature Wentworth coming on behalf on Admiral &amp; Mrs Croft, and the other ending has the letter.  This movie has taken both endings and combined them.  I personally love that they did that, as they took my favorite parts from both.  So the movie didn't really deviate from the book in that regard.  And I think that Anne certainly did have her &quot;second bloom.&quot;  She's prettier and more outgoing during the second half of the movie.  My only small contention is Mrs Smith's story, they left out a large chunk which would have helped shed light on Mr. Elliott's character.  That being said, there's nothing better than curling up in front of this movie and coming away smiling.
B000002WPI|5.0|This is one of the best albums to date, and one of the best Wu albums also.  The production and lyrics and flows were the hottest ever.  I love it.  Buy it if you like rap and hip-hop.<br />My favorite tracks are \\"Bring Da Ruckus\\", \\"Shame On A N****\\", \\"Clan In Da Front\\", \\"Wu Tang:7th Chamber\\", \\"Can It Be All So Simple\\", \\"Mystery Of Chessboxin\\", \\"Wu Tang Ain't Nuthin Ta F Wit\\", \\"C.R.E.A.M.\\", \\"Method Man\\", \\"Protect Ya Neck\\", \\"Tearz\\", and \\"Wu-Tang:7th Chamber Pt. 2\\".  That's all of em, get it now!
B0000039QA|5.0|Ive got to say that this  is one of the best rap albums ive ever heard,one of the greatest.But this cd is just as good as 2pac's all eyez on me,or pacs the don killuminati.I like both of em they both had differnt styles,but i wouldnt say that this is better than all eyez.Ready to die was annother classic,but they both are good to be honest youve gota get both.I only brought this album today and was really pleased, and i dont think that long kiss goodnight was dissing pac even it was.It was bound to happen.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem has established himself as a household name, and probably the most well-known rap artist of his generation.  He has produced 3 multi-platinum CDs in 4 years and has released over a dozen singles.  His lyrics are amazing, and his production is nearly flawless.  His nasal flow has worked its way into nearly all of America's ears.  All of his CDs are non-fast-forward works of brilliant art, and this is no exception.  I love Eminem, and this is a great album from him.  I reccomend it to everyone, not just because of its brilliance, but also because it can be enjoyed but almost everyone as long as you don't mind cursing and some downright disgusting lyrics. <br />Here's my track-by-tracj analysis:<BR>1. \\"Curtains Up\\" - It's just an intro, not as entertaining as the other 2.<br />2. \\"White America\\" (5/5) - An angry song with a cool video.  Great with good lyrics and a hard beat.  Gets tired after too many listens though.<br />3. \\"Business\\" (5/5) - Great song, upbeat fast paced beat and great lyrics.<br />4. \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" (5/5) - Heartfelt, good song.  Really enjoyed it.  Good video also.  <br />5. \\"Square Dance\\" (4/5) - Upbeat, good lyrics.  Anti-Bush but whatever.  Took a few listens to get used to though.<br />6. \\"The Kiss\\" - Skit, not as good as others I've heard from Eminem.<br />7. \\"Soldier\\" (5/5) - Hard song, great.  Pretty good lyrics also.<br />8. \\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\" (5/5) - Great at first, gets a little annoying after awhile though.<br />9. \\"Drips\\" (4/5) - Annoying at first, but gets better after some listens.  Good although nasty lyrics.<br />10. \\"Without Me\\" (4/5) - Great upbeat song, funny and good lyrics.  Loses a point because it was overplayed.<br />11. \\"Paul Rosenberg\\" - Another below average skit.<br />12. \\"Sing For The Moment\\" (5/5) - Amazing song, phenomenal lyrics.  Great chorus by Aerosmith, \\"Dream On\\" is a great song.  Yet another single.<br />13. \\"Superman\\" (5/5) - Takes a few listens to get used to, but an upbeat song.  Good, I liked it.  Good video though, i saw the uncensored version on my 8 Mile DVD.<br />14. \\"Hailie's Song' (5/5) - Heartfelt, a little overplayed on the radio though.  I really liked it thought, good lyrics, although Eminem is not a very good singer.<br />15. \\"Steve Berman\\" - Eminem really didn't do a good job on the skits with this album, I liked the others from his older albums.<br />16. \\"When The Music Stops\\" (5/5) - Good song, great verse by Eminem.<br />17. \\"Say What You Say\\" (5/5) - Another great song, especcially lyric wise.<br />18. \\"Til I Collapse\\" (5/5) - Good song with a great Nate Dogg chorus.<br />19. \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" (4/5) - Great lyrics, takes a little bit to get used to though.<br />20. \\"Curtains Close\\" - The outro, not good.  <br />Overall, I felt that this was another phenomanal effort by Eminem, a great record.  A lot of hits too, \\"White America\\", \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\", \\"Without Me\\", \\"Sing For The Moment\\", \\"Superman\\", \\"Hailie's Song\\", \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\", there might have been some more or less.
B00008I8IF|4.0|So when exactly did The Jayhawks become a singles band?  This is the group, after all, that produced the 1992 classic album &quot;Hollywood Town Hall,&quot; that was the dictionary definition of the term Album Oriented Rock.  The band was so doctornaire in its single minded approach that selecting a single from the album was nigh impossible.<br />So here they come in the post-Mark Olson era with an album that features two of the best potential singles so far this year.  The sweet ballad &quot;All the Right Reasons,&quot; and the bittersweet mid-tempo rocker &quot;Save it for a Rainy Day&quot; are two of the best recordings this band and leader Gary Louris have ever produced.  So much so, in fact, that they overshadow the rest of &quot;Rainy Day Music.&quot;  The album's first half is excellent, containing the above along with the rocker &quot;Tailspin&quot; the sharp hook on &quot;The Eyes of SarahJane,&quot; and the sweet &quot;One Man's Problem.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, the second half lags with the songs contributed by Louris's bandmates Tim O'Reagan and Marc Pearlman being particularly bland.  As for the bonus disc, the best of the six tracks are an accoustic version of &quot;All the Right Reasons&quot; and a Louris solo live accoustic version of &quot;Waiting for the Sun,&quot; from &quot;Hollywood Town Hall.&quot;  The CD booklet also contains a full lyrics sheet and a list of players.<br />Overall, while not a classic, &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; contains several excellent potential hit singles that might bring this veteran band some long overdue radio airtime.
B000059H98|4.0|I decided to give this a re write. This is a campy futuristic, Cole Porter tune,Betsey Johnson fashions,Mutated Kangroos breed to be soliders,water depletion movie. After I saw this movie I was a Lori Petty fan. This is a wild chick film. I read the reviews Ms. Petty remarked about the script \\"She was Tank Girl\\".In the future water is precious . It's your David vs Goliath type story. Where a major corporation monopolizes a precious life giving substance. How the little guy goes up against a company. It's more to the story so find out for yourself.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I'll read the Harry Potter books.  I'll wear fake glasses, speak in quotes, and get a t-shirt with HP on it.  I have officially become a fan.  No constant urgings from all my other siblings made me run for the book as did this movie.  It's got a piece of all those wonderful things i've read in other books combined together to form this surprisingly epic story.  The movies always begin on the light side, fun esp. for kids, but by the end it becomes so much more as the real heart of the story is revealed. Harry has all the qualities of a hero, which are questioned as well as played out more and more through each film.  <BR>  I liked the first movie a lot (i LOVE the chess scene), but this one is definitely the winner.  I can only say that i'll never bypass watching the movies in a theatre again!<br />btw, i just began book one and am gushing already :)
0767803434|5.0|Harrison Ford as President--that aspect alone would be enough to drive many to see Air Force One.  Yet this thriller does not disappoint even the most discerning critics of action film and indeed stands out as one--if not THE--best action film made since the 80's.<br />The premise: ex-Soviet dissidents hijack Air Force One in revenge for the President's crackdown on terrorism and terrorist regimes.  Gary Oldman plays an excellent terrorist, and Harrison Ford's President is the kind of hands-on hero that would prompt a repeal of the 22nd Amendment (for those unsavvy of the Constitution, that's the one that limits Presidents to two terms).<br />The action ride simply does not quit as it begins with the hijackers' takeover of Air Force One (with the help of a traitorous Secret Serviceman) and the President's apparent escape to Ford's battle to retake the plane and rescue his staff to a near-landing at Ramstein AFB in Germany to the in-air refueling to MiGs firing upon Air Force One to the final confrontation... nor like some films is the pacing flawed so that the watcher is drained or left wanting after the first few scenes; Air Force One simply keeps viewers on the edges of their seats for the entire film.<br />If you enjoy action films, you will love Air Force One.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth are a very intersting band. I find their music intelligent and amazing. Each member play's his instrument very, very well. Each song has a little bit of something for any heavy metal fan as well (except for funk and rap). Whether you like black, nu, dark, and many other types. The singer can sing beautifuly and scream and growl like no other. <br />The Leper Affinity-Awsome vocals, cool guitar, light speed drums everything any metal fan could ask for.<br />Bleak-A little tad of Middle Eastern flavoring in this song, my second favorite. They use acoustics on this song as well as electric. The vocals on this song are very entreaging.<br />Harvest-One of two fully acoustic tracks. The lead singer noly uses clean vocals on this track. Beautiful.<br />The Drapery Falls-Interesting heavy track.<br />Dirge for November-Starts out acoustic then becomes the usual Opeth song.<br />The Funeral Portrait-My favorite song on the whole CD. Awsome guitar intro and very harsh vocals, great.<br />Patterns in the Ivy-A short acoustic track wiht no vocals, about two min.<br />Blackwater Park-Awsome lyrics, very good musicianship.<BR>        Overall I must say that Opeth is very talented and I will buy more of their albums as soon as I get more money. THis is dark_spiral saying, goodbye.
6304595247|2.0|This was not what I expected from a movie, that was based on a book that I love. Ralph Fines is a perfect Heathclif. Juliete Binoche was a dissapointing Cathrine. With a french accent, she was not believable in this part.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This album is second to Kerplunk! in my book.  Green Day is the only punk rock band that has the ability to drive me to tears with a song.  The song i'm talking about is &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot;.  &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot; talks about how in the end of everything you just need to keep hoping for something more.  It drives me to tears every time I hear it.  This is one of my favorite Green Day songs ever.  The most different, different to anything else they've ever done even on indie releases, is &quot;Misery&quot;.  It tells an interesting story and is just so different from anything else.  My personal favorite on this album is &quot;Church on Sunday&quot;, it is a very sweet song that Billie Joe wrote for his wife Adrienne.  This CD is very different than anything else Green Day has done.  They have evolved and this shows it.  Also, this (along with almost all of Green Day's music) was completely written by them, music, lyrics everything.  They also produced this album.  If you are a diehard Green Day fan i would reccommend getting the Limited Edition WARNING:  I have that and the extras on the CD are worth the price.
B000023VR6|5.0|This is Dr. Dre' best album, even better than The Chronic. The beats are like never before. Dr. Dre makes a great tribute to his deceased rival, Eazy-E, in \\"What's The Difference?\\", with a slammin beat and good rapping by Eminem and Xzbit. \\"Forgot About Dre\\" with Eminem talks about the time period when Dre was ignored. No one thought he could get back in the game when he had to deal with his brother's death, being in prison, and other things. \\"Forgot About Dre\\" has a good beat and good vocals. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg make an excellent team in \\"The Next Episode\\". This song has an outstanding beat and real good rapping. \\"The Watcher\\" has a good beat, like all the songs in this album. My favorite song, though, is \\"Still D.R.E.\\" The beat is just amazing. The song has a good flow and rapping. It talks about how Dre struck back from all the bad things he's been through to gain the top spot in rap once again and how he can't be stopped now.
0066214122|5.0|Crichton's new book is exciting in many fashions. First, it deals with a emerging new field - nanotechnology. Second, I liked the book because Crichton drew me in more by making the book read almost as a diary of the main character, Jack. The whole book is in first person and starts off kind of slow. However, the reason for this is to build upon Jack and show us his transformation throughout the book. The excitement grows page by page and will definitely keep you up all night reading. <BR>   I would recommend this book to any armchair adventurer. It is a book that will stay with you long after reading it, both for the story but also for the implications it makes on the future of technology and mankind's ability to control it.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I agree with the books are better, and BOOKS ALWAYS are better than movies! But, for a movie this was just amazing! I love this movie, the DVD IS AMAZING! This is by far my faviorte movie of all time!

B000058T5E|5.0|Defying comparison, Beck successfully fuses electronica and Moby-like dance beats with the alternatively weeping or screaming tones of the electric guitar. The album?s opener, ?Earthquake,? is a guitar-driven club anthem, backed by a drum track that practically lifts you out of your seat. In contrast, ?Blackbird? evokes the sad song of a bird, accompanied by Beck?s guitar. You Had It Coming is a club mix for the rockers of the new millennium reluctant to bring out Jennifer Lopez at their next party but nonetheless long for a formula to keep things moving. Like Moby, Beck makes electronica cool again. With amazing guitar solos and equally cool beats, any lover of club music or guitar playing should buy this.
0618001905|5.0|This book reads like a novel even though it is a well researched history. Before I read it, I had only a vague idea of the atrocities that went on in the Congo. I have read Heart of Darkness for several classes, but we mostly used the book to study the writing style and the literature rather than researching the specific situation that was the basis for the book. I was also interested in finding out more about the Congo after I researched the modern instability that Barbara Kingsolver writes about in the Poisonwood Bible. <br />As I read the book, I couldn't believe what a horrible man Leopold could be. It scares me when I study people who have such little regard for humanity. While I was astounded by Leopold's ... selfish nature, the focus of the book for me became those that stood up to him. E.D. Morel and Roger Casement in particular were able to at least put a dent in the situation in the Congo at much sacrifice to their own personal lives. The people who worked to bring down Leopold's regime were not perfect--Hochschild reveals many of their flaws. But they made a difference; they helped to end the horror that Joseph Conrad witnessed and wrote about.
B000083E79|5.0|When I found out that this album was going to be released, I just figured that it would be just like her last Greatest Hits.  But as I played it, the way that the songs are arranged and the lit of songs that were on there really amazed me.  I recommed this album to every Cher fan out there.  This is an album no Cher fan should be without.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Wow.  I have just seen this masterpiece a second time at the theater and was more blown away then the first time.  I cannot recommend seeing it on the big screen enough, I will buy the DVD to be sure, but one must see the grand scope of this to appreciate it in full.  It is not so much what it is as what it is not.  It is not a pretentious \\"adult cartoon\\" relying on kinky sex and violence to pass itself off as highbrow entertainment.  It is not that bad \\"anime\\" (spelling)? that I would hope we would have seen the last of by now.  This is original, heartfelt, funny and simply dazzling to look at.  How rare is it these days to see a good story told in an interesting way that is coherent and funny as well as dead serious and never heavy handed or depressing?  There are so many ways Japanese animation can go wrong (at least to American audiences) and this film steers well clear of all of them.  A child's journey of self discovery, of learning timeless lessons about friendship and family, and it is never politicized, never used as an excuse to push some religious or sociological agenda.  Small children might be scared at parts of this, the pigs in particular were disturbing (I was more scared then any of the children in attendance, which is usually the case anyway) but they will be won over by the happy but never sappy ending.  How sad that so many films feel it is necessary to have a depressing and downbeat story to be taken seriously, how sad that so many small minded producers cannot see past short term profits and commercialization, how delightful and fortunate that someone still cares about art for arts sake and takes the effort and expense to bring this wonderful tale to the screen, like all great art this film enhances life, one cannot help but feel better after having seen this, you really owe it to yourself to spend two hours in this magic place where good can overcome evil and everyone can solve there problems the right way. And the little girl from the ring voices the main character, how perfect is that?
B00005JLK1|1.0|This movie was terrible. It was not scary at all. There was no plot to speak of. The only good thing in the movie is a scene with a lot of gore in the first ten mintues or so (don't want to give away what happens). There is a extra of the dvd talking about and showing how they made the gore, etc. The extra is more entaining than the movie was. Do not buy. If you must see it rent it first. You have been warned...
0316666343|3.0|I, too, read this book after hearing many (well, mostly) good things about it. Although I don't read much mainstream fiction, as I prefer Fantasy, I found that 'The Lovely Bones' touched me. I was often reminded of my own losses and forced to reflect on them. I suppose you can't help but think on them if you've been through anything similar to the Salmon family.<br />However, I found the father, Jack Salmon, to be the only character who seemed real. The mother never grieved at all, only turning into a cold, emotionless woman who wouldn't even attend her own daughter's imprompto memorial! The younger sister, Lindsey, seemed incredibly mature for a 13 year old girl whose sister was just brutally murdered. The father is the only one who is intent on solving the case, although encouraging his daughter to investigate the suspected murderer's house is somewhat questionable. Further, Sebold's version of heaven makes you wonder, as other reviewers have pointed out. And don't even think of understanding Ruth Connors. She seemed a little too much like The Sixth Sense &quot;I see dead people&quot; character and I found she was poorly explained. (I had to go on assumptions with her throughout most of the novel.)<br />Despite all this, I would recommend this book to any who ask me, however. It's enjoyable and sad and sure to pull you in. Just don't expect much from the ending.
B00008PW3O|5.0|Hard core fans are gonna want the enhanced CD. No two ways about it. The bonus disc has enhanced video footage to be played on your computer. But the really cool stuff are the 4 bonus songs on the bonus disc. Love Minus Zero/No Limit is a Bob Dylan tune. When have you ever heard Lindsay Buckingham sing Dylan! Wow. This band is great. They have played together so long, that the interaction is effortless. They are also playing better than ever. Lindsay is soaring on guitar through out the CDs. Why doesn't he get more credit as a guitar god? Not Make Believe is an extra Stevie Nicks song. Some of her better writing and singing are on this album. I suppose her working stint with Sheryl Crow has paid off well. It really shows that Stevie has been working on her craft. Lindsay also draws the best out of her. Live versions of Peacekeeper and Say You Will round out the bonus disc. They were taped for a live AOL Session on Feb. 28th, 2003. Mick Fleetwood &amp; John McVie prove yet again why they are one of the tightest and most complementary rhythm sections in all of rock. With these guys behind you, anyone would sound good. The dynamic of the band is a bit different from the past. Christine McVie is no longer part of the band, so all the songwriting and vocals are shared by Stevie &amp; Lindsay. It makes for a very groovy album, full of surprises and rich textures of mood and sound. It is kinda like the feel of Buckingham/Nicks, but done by much more mature artists. It certainly IS Fleetwood Mac. You kinda don't notice that Christine is gone. This 18 track album is fantastic. Not a dud on the album. Now of course I just got it and I am still living with it, but I really do enjoy it. Lindsay orchestrates guitar part upon guitar part, like a modern day Brian Wilson. Any fan of Stevie, Lindsay or Fleetwood Mac, would be sure to enjoy this album. And go ahead and shell out for the enhanced edition. You'll be glad you did.
B00004TH83|4.0|I heard her song \\"tout\\" (from her French album \\"Pure\\") from a MP3 files that I got from a friend. Giving that I don't know anything about French, her voice and the song stuck in my mind. I bought her every single album (mostly French) since then. This is a very good album but her French ones are perfect. I'm sick and tired of hearing Whitney \\"and I Will Love You ..... again, again, and again\\" Houston and Celine \\"My Heart Will Go On .... forever and ever\\" Dion, so people please don't compare this very refreshing, very elegant voice with them. For people who are complaining, go back and listen to your Britney and N'Sync. I will be getting her first DVD \\"Live\\" with an exception to my boycott of anything French. Plus she can sing fluently in French, Italian and English. My conclusion, she like SOCCER everyone except Americans like her.
B000000OU0|5.0|I bought this cd a good while ago but just got around to really listening to it.  (I also just bought the video.. ;) ) And I was VERY pleased. After more than a decade and countless interviews denying there would EVER be a reunion, This was a great and long awaited treasure. There are acoustic versions of some of their greatest hits as well as original versions, and even new songs! The guys perfromed great, showing they haven't let time get them down. So buy this cd and own a piece of Eagle history! &quot;For the record, we never broke up we just took a fourteen year vacation.&quot; -Glenn Frey
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Lindsay Buckingham is an excellent producer who has a genius alternative edge that keeps Fleetwood Mac from being The Mamas and the Papas.  Whereas I used to always love the Stevie songs most on any Mac album...now I have to say that Lindsay takes the prize.  His \\"Peacekeeper\\", \\"What's the World Coming To\\", and \\"Steal your heart away\\" all bring the old FM sound to the millenium.   Stevie sounds like she's once again stimied in the writing area...relying on 3 old songs (written in the 70's) that were never that good (except Goodbye Baby, which is up there with her other ballads) to begin with.   The worst is \\"Silver Girl,\\" a self indulgent, non-melodic ode to herself.  No...wait...the worst is \\"Illume 9/11\\"..nice words...nice tribute...but no melody.  \\"Thrown Down\\" is a reliable sounding \\"Gypsy\\" without the imagry.  \\"Say You Will\\" seems to be her attempt to add some of Christine's sugary goofiness to the collection.   All in all....I would say this could have had 10 tracks and it would have been more consistent.
B000003TAR|5.0|I Love This CD And I Mainly Listen To rap!!!!!<br />Tourette's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|The Strokes .... I avoided the White Stripes for sometime when people without taste kept claiming them and the boring Strokes as saviors of Rock for 2002. While The Strokes sound like Rock music as much as Bare Naked Ladies, The White Stripes have a style all to their own. The music can be sexy, hard, melodic, soft, and fast all on one album.<br />This album surpassed my expectations. I now feel that this is as important to a hard rocks fans collection as Back in Black, Paranoid, and Nevermind. (If you don't own or know those albums - shame!). This album, this band, has character. It's visceral, straight up rock and roll complete with the folk and blues influence.<br />My favorite track, at the moment, is track 9, The Hardest Button to Button. The beat thumps, the guitar is distorted, and the voice is passionate. It's all I ask from a rock band.<br />Some of the fans here expressed some dissapointment because of the slight departure from their previous style. But it's just two people, how consistent can they be from album to album!?<br />This is a classic, and will hopefully be recognized as such.
B00001QEE9|3.0|The 1940 classic &quot;Pinocchio&quot; is one of my all time favorite Disney films. Created with no computer animation, the film features the talents of Dickie Jones (Pinocchio), Cliff Edwards (Jiminy Cricket),Chistian Rub (Geppeto), Walter Catlett (J. Worthington Foulfellow) and others, and that wonderful song (&quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot;) the film remains a beloved classic since its creation in 1940, which means the film was made 63 yrs ago! The 3 pt. rating is because the DVD offers no bonus features but the 1940 trailer.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Hybrid Theory was an incredible album by this band and anyone who saw them live understood that they get the agression out.  Well, this album did just what we thought couldn't be done.  Every song is killer, the oriental theme throughout the album is different and adds to the uniqueness of Linkin Park.  I thought the radio would kill \\"Somewhere I belong\\" but play the album start to finish, you'll hear NIN influences for one, and it'll all come together.  It's well organized, chaotic and angry but beautiful.<br />Everything Crazy Town wanted to be!
B00008PW3Q|4.0|After leaving Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey Buckingham was able to explore and refine his style and sound. This album is comprised of much of his work from his proposed solo album &quot;Gift of Screws.&quot; The songs are generally good and catchy. I think Lindsey could have thrown in a couple of gutiar solos. Fleetwood Mac has a new sound and is back in the spotlight.
B000089RVX|5.0|It isnt often when the rock industry comes across something completely original. For all practical purposes, the industry has been re-inventing its self since led Zepplin. (not that I mind anything that has come along the way........) <br />Evanescence is just that, original. Unlike some songs and  bands that were original (sir mix alot) Evanescence has unleashed a CD that announces to the world that it is a serious band. <br />As far as the Music is concerned, listen to \\"Bring me to Life\\", Most of the songs on the CD are similar, in that the same amasing voice is complimented by the same guitar, bass, and drums. The Melody for most songs is hard, verry hard, but at the same time slow, making it original. As far as overall preformance I would say that it is in the top 10 CD's that I have ever purchased, and consider my self a die hard metal/rock/punk listener. So you decide, but if you choose not to get the album, Just realize that you decided not to get one of the best 60 minuites of music that Money can buy
0440237688|5.0|The main character in this book is a 12-year-old boy named Jonas.  He lives in a community that knows no feelings, color, illness, poverty...in other words, they all live in a perfect community!  In this community, everything is chosen for everyone.  The indivuals cannot even choose their own destination!  Jonas' destination of Receiver of Memories is chosen for him on his 12th birthday.  There is only one Receiver of Memory in the community.  His job as Receiver of Memory is to retain memories.  You'll understand what is meant by that once you have read the book.  This is an excellent book!
B00008H2LB|3.0|I sat through and listened to the entire album all the while wondering what happened to this band.  Their first album, Hybrid Theory, completely blew my mind!  When Reanimation came out, I was still very excited because most of the tracks were excellent.  But then I pop in Meteora and got a different vibe from it.  It's slower and less heavy.  You hear Chester doing a lot more singing and less screaming.  The whole mood of the album just seems mellow to me.  If you are a Linkin Park fan, get the album just to be loyal.  But if you're a new fan who just started listening to them, stick with Hybrid Theory and/or Reanimation.
B000075BFK|1.0|I have every CD that 2pac has ever put out (alive and dead), and this 2 disk set is horrible. Almost every track lyrically sounds like 2pac was warming up on the mic before actually recording the track he was there to record.  Outside of Still Ballin and the commercial Thugz Mansion, this rest of this mish mash sounds like demo's and outtakes and not actual songs. Also, ...price tag is ridiculous for this [garbage].  <br />Also, his rhymes dont go with the beats on almost all the songs.  Because they sound like Pac was freestylin in the studio as opposed to recording a song. Props to Jonny J for trying to create something out of nothing. Also, leave Tyrease and Nas off of Pac's tunes.  Not one song on this 2 disk set compares to Pac's 4 tracks on the Gang Related disk. Pick that up instead.
B000002U82|5.0|Words just can't explain.  It's not just music.  It's an experience.<br />Awesome.
B00005JLT5|5.0|A moving, understated, almost documentary-like story of a  Jewish pianist's attempt to survive the Nazi holocaust in Poland. Polanski's direction is beautifully restrained, there is no spelunking in violene nor melodrama, but a simple, unrelenting story of both a people's suffering and especially one man's suffering and survival in a world temporarily gone mad. The note of hope at the end is realistically done and mitigates but does not cancel out the suffering we have just spent the past two hours witnessing. Adrien Brody's Academy Award was not only deserved but indeed ineluctable unless Hollywood wanted to publically confess it is no longer interested in film as art. This is an infinitely sad, infinitely moving but also infinitely human testament  to the art of music, the art of life and the art of film.
B000067CPX|5.0|When I first heard &quot;By The Way&quot; on the radio I knew I had to buy this album the day it came out. I did and it was sure worth it! If you liked &quot; Californication&quot; you will probably like this one.
6304698623|3.0|This is a classic children's book that is definitely more appealing to girls since they are the focus of the story, but that has a worthwhile message for anyone. There have been several film versions of this movie made but so far the best one that I have seen is the BBC version. The Warner Bros. version is notable for its dramatization of Sara's stories which are very stylized and lavish and focus on the folktales of Krishna, Vishnu and the like. That is the one aspect of this movie which makes it special besides a brief scene of Sara's childhood in India. However, I felt that changing the nationality of Sara, the oversimplification of Miss Minchin as a classic Hollywood bad guy with no redeeming qualities, and the pathetic slapstick romance of her sister Amelia detracted greatly from the overall story.<BR>Most importantly of all, the focus of this movie on the supposition that \\"All girls are really princesses.\\" undermined what I have always felt was this story's greatest strength. Sara treated everyone as equals and rose above her difficulties because of her belief in herself. She voiced this belief in terms  of being a princess but the basis was really that if someone is special and has advantages then they have a responsibility to those around them to treat them fairly and to share those advantages whenever possible. Someone who is truly special does not need to belittle others and can trust themselves to handle whatever life may give them. Saying that \\"All girls are really princesses.\\" is something which, in my opinion, hands worth to people on the basis of merely being female and thus removes the necessary value of the need to earn that privilege. It is a syrupy sentiment that says that females are special because they are female, a supposition which has been a part of the whole \\"project self-esteem\\" debacle and its feminist counterpart. A more useful idea, I believe, is that all people are capable of being special and have special qualities within them which,if they develop them and work to make the best use of them, will naturally help them to create the person they want to be. I think that the BBC version of this movie handles that aspect of the story much better than this one does.
B000089RVX|2.0|It's depressing when your favorite band never makes it. It's even MORE depressing when a band comes along and completely rips of your favorite band and makes it. When I heard Evanescence, I didn't know what to think. They sounded like Joydrop with a singer whom only had a tiny portion of the talent that Tara Slone holds. This music is a shame! I even downloaded most of the tracks from the CD to give it a fair chance. Still nothing. How can they be called good, let alone ORIGINAL? For the love of God, please buy one of Joydrop's CDs before even thinking of buying this one. Believe me-- it's like choosing chocolate cake over an M&amp;M.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|It has been long worth the wait for the new Fleetwood Mac album and I am not disapointed  one bit. This is a really good album and I hope it goes far in wininng awards I have only listen to it once and I aready have too many favroites.I can't wait for the tour this summer.
B000060P79|1.0|When I first heard this song, I couldn't remember if it was Sum 41 or Blink 182. Or could it have been New Found Glory? All American Rejects? How many of these artists are there? They all sound the SAME! There IS one difference, this guys voice is painfully BAD... like the lyrics. Simple Plan's name states it all there: They have a simple plan-- mix poor, simple lyrics with a whiney cute boy sterotype lead singer and you'll get your ... on MTV. That's exactly what worked for them. I can tolerate most poppy punk, in fact, I even fancy some of it. This is just bad. It's all a copy of what's already been done.
B000002JST|5.0|Don't get me wrong, AC/DC did plenty of great work after recording LTBR, even some with Brian Johnson. I happen to like almost all of Razors Edge. But this is the group's definitional album - the one that stamps them, and us the listeners, with the essence of AC/DC, what makes them unique, the sound that sends shivers up and down our spines and compels us to keep on listening with the volume way up. Rock as a relentless, inescapable force, scary and exciting. Yeah, with these guys we know even before the cd is out of the case there'll be no bleepin' ballads. But even with High Voltage fresh in mind no first time listener, not in 1977 and not now, can be prepared for what LTBR delivers. Malcolm lays down a perfect rhythm underneath the lead hooks of his brother. Angus is relentless, never missing an opportunity to ratchet up even more the tension in Bon's vocals. Bon is demonic, feeding off Angus' energy, pushing the vocals to and beyond the edge, chorus to chorus, track to track. Listen to the guitar-vocal byplay in Go Down, an unconscious redefinition of rock as crazed improv that picks up where Led Zep's BBC Sessions left off. LTBR never lets up. \\"Just\\" 8 tracks but no filler, no song ending until they've got it right.
B000062TU1|5.0|Well, Im not talking about a simple movie, its just the most succesfull movie in the planet, after TITANIC of course, but that is say something of a movie for kids, I personally think that the second part is better, but this is really good, full of magic and with excellent performances, its awesome, the only thing that I dont like is the format of the DVD, kind of boring, but the rest is great.
B00005JLH3|5.0|THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE!  IT'S BEEN QUITE SOME TIME SINCE I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A MOVIE THAT I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED, BUT THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!  MAKES BEING IN THE BAND ACTUALLY LOOK KEWL!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|this group has their future bright and best wishes to the two ladies hope th relationship works out in your favour stay sweet and keep up the grrrrrrrrrrrrrreat work<br />thanking you<BR>claudia
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I just got this CD and I can't stop listening to it!!  It offers a super mixture of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham at their best, all blended together to showcase the incredible non-stop talent of Fleetwood Mac.  Mick Fleetwood's drumming has never been better, this CD is more than worth the investment!!
B00005AXEL|2.0|Unfortunately, Stevie's voice ruins what is a solid collection of songs and musicianship.  I realize she has never had a great voice, but it has grown so raspy and unappealing that I found it hard to listen to the album.  You're better off buying the classic Mac albums of the 70s and early 80s.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I have really enjoyed the series and was not disappointed in this one.
078401115X|5.0|THIS MOVIE HAS SO MUCH SYMBOLISM WITHIN IT'S CONTEXTS THAT AT TIMES IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP WITH IT AND EVENTUALLY IT GET TOP HEAVY.  THE MOVIE IS WELL WRITTEN & DIRECTED BY ALAN PARKER.  MICKEY ROURKE STARS AS A BROOKLYN GUMSHOE(DETECTIVE) WHO TAKSES ON A VERY UNUSUAL CASE.  HIS CLIENT IS MR. CYPHIER( I'LL LET THE AUDIENCE SEE IF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT THE RELIVENCE OF THIS NAME).  CYPHIER PAYS ROURKE VERY WELL FOR A 1950'S PI.  THE CASE INVOLVES A PERSON BY THE NAME OF JOHNNY FAVORITE WHO WENT MISSING AFTER WWII.  HE MADE A CONTRACT WITH MR. CYPHIER AND NEVER FULFILLED HIS PART OF THE CONTRACT AND NOW CYPHIER WANTS ROURKE TO FIND JOHNNY SO THAT HE CAN FULFILL IT.  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WATCHING THIS MOVIE OR PROBABLY WILL READ NO FURTHER.  BY THE END OF THE MOVIER JOHNNY FAVORITE WILL HONOR HIS PART OF THE CONTRACT.  ROURKES INVESTIGATION TAKES HIM FROM THE STREETS OF HARLEM WHERE HE HAS A RUN IN WITH A REVEREND IKE TYPE PREACHER, AND FINALLY TO THE STREETS OF NEW ORLEANS.  THE SCENES IN NEW ORLEANS TO ME WORKED ABSOLUTELY WELL.  LISA BONET GAVE OT HER ALL IN THIS FILM AND IT PAID OFF WELL.  IF YOU ONLY KNOW HER FROM THE COSBY SHOW WELL WATCH THIS MOVIE AND I GURANTEE YOU'LL BE SUPRISED.  SHE HAS AN X-RATED LOVE SCENE WITH MICKEY ROURKE WHICH STIRRED CONTRVERSY WITH COSBY.  THE ENDING IS A SUPRISE WHICH I WONT GIVE AWAY.  THE SMOKE FILLED JAZZ CLUBS WERE EXCELENTLY FILMED.  CHARLOTTE RAMPLING WAS OF IN SOME OTHER WORLD WHICH ROURKE DID NOT UNDERSTAND.  FINALLY THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THE SUBJECT THE MOVIE TOUCHES ON IS VOODOU.  VOODOU IS REAL FOR ALL YOU NON-BELIEVERS OUT THERE.  I KNOW FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. I SERVED IN HAITI AND SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN NEW ORLEANS AND AROUND THE BAYOU.  THE MOVIE DID AN ACCURATE HOLLYWOOD PORTRAYAL OF THE SOUTHERN LOUISIANA CULTURE, AS WELL AS THE VOODOU CEREMONIES.  LISA IS A MAMBO IN THE MOVIE AND I WONDER IF THIS ROLE HAD ANY BEARING ON HER PRACTICES OF VOODOU WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED TO LENNIE KRAVITZ(WHOOPS IM SORRY,ROMEO BLU).  ALL THINGS CONSIDERED THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY, WATCH AND WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.
0792844882|5.0|Okay, first off let me say that i have read all the reviews on amazon. Some are good, and describe what this film really is, and some on the other hand are very bad. This is a very good film. A lot of reviewers have called it a \\"comedy\\", but it really isn't.(do you think rape is funny?) A few things in it are meant to be funny (like VER-SAYSE), but it is really dramatic. I think all the actors are great, the plot is great, the directing, producing, and everything else is all great. Really, you have to watch 'showgirls' to know if you like it or not. To do this you must have an open mind. Don't watch it and think about what all the reviews said. If you do ,I do not think you will like it.<BR>There is a lot of nudity (and a lot of sex)in this film, so it isnt suited for all ages. This film is my all-time favorite movie. I recently ordered the DVD (actually, today, so it hasn't arrived yet), and can't wait for it to arrive. I've already seen this film twice, and really want to see it again. ALso, I do not think that strip-tease is anything like this film. I think Striptease is quite stupid.  <BR>Thank you for taking your time to read this, and enjoy this movie!
B000001GPX|5.0|I see that DG are about to re-release this classic performance as an SACD. Why? <br />I recently upgraded my speakers and amp (to twin valve amps and valve pre-amp) and this was one of the first discs I played on the &quot;new&quot; system. I always knew this was a great recording to match a great performance, but my god, its so good it is genuinely an organic part of the performance. Who needs an SACD re-issue (and I'm by no means hostile to SACD) when the original is as good as this?<br />As to the performance, nothing to add to other reviews except to say that yes, of course there are other fine performances and maybe the adulation given this recording may seem a little hysterical to some with older allegiances, but not even the karajan 61-62 set's seventh and the 1977 set's fifth can trump this pair of performances, even though in an ideal world you'd want to have them as well (and for an alternate,  budget recording of the same coupling, the under-rated Mackerras on EMI).
B00006IUL7|4.0|I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan. Even though I only saw Memento in 2001, I knew great things were meant for this director. Unfortunately, Insomnia isn't as great as Memento was but it definitely still a great movie that kept me intrigued the whole way through.<br />One of the strongest things about the movie is the performances by the two leading actors, Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Pacino displays depths and many character stages in this film - he's excellent, as per usual. Williams doesn't get as much screentime unfortunately, but the time he does have is chilling and enthralling - I was very interested by his character. The two supporting actresses - Hilary Swank and Maura Tierney - were good as well, especially Swank, who needs to be in more movies!<br />I loved the style of the film. It had some very clever editing techniques used and I just adored the cuts Chris used. The cinematography was great and the atmosphere was very \\"dangerous-small-mountain-town\\" which I appreciated.<br />There were a couple of problems in the movie - Robin Williams' character should've been developed further because he is SO interesting and the chemistry between him and Pacino is SO good. Also, the final shootout scene - it just seemed rushed to me.<br />Christopher Nolan has done another good film overall though, and I look forward to seeing how his directing talents develop even further.
B0000041WV|5.0|I dont want or need to add anything about these performances, - other reviewers are spot on, - they are simply wonderful, life affirming, even. What i would like to comment on is the sound. This is a forty year old set, and had always sounded good. Recently, however, I upgraded from my beloved Castle Howard S3s and Nakamichi amp to Quad ESL63s with twin valve amps and new valve pre-amp. So, as you can imagine, I've been rummaging through my collection, hearing everything afresh. And the amazing discoveries? Several, but this is among the happiest. This forty year old sound is fresh as a daisy, - it has been superbly re-mastered from superb masters and sounds, well, superb. So dont just think you're getting one of the gramophone's most precious performances, you're also getting sound better than you could possibly have expected.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I didn't expect to like Spider-Man at all when I saw it in theatres. I am not a big fan of superhero movies and knew nothing about the story or the comics. I prepared to be uninterested. Well, I prepared wrong. This movie was EXCELLENT, and it wasn't just another superhero movie with lots of action scenes. I really cared for the characters here and sympathised with all of them.<br />I thought the motive for Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man was very well done. I really hate sitting through the scene where Peter finds his uncle shot and realises that it was partly his fault. That must've been brutal. Tobey Maguire and Cliff Robertson are both excellent in that scene. The last scene is also heartbreaking to hear Peter have to say that to Mary Jane (I won't spoil here), it kind of pisses me off at the same time as being very sad.<br />All of the performances here are great. Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man is a sight to behold. I didn't think Maguire could pull off a superhero, but he is amazing as both the nerdy Peter Parker and as the wall-crawling hero. I also loved Willem Dafoe. He is a great actor, and chooses very diverse and complex roles. Here he has to be scizophrenic, evil, leader of a successful business and a father. He mixes all these things up in some scenes and the outcome is one great performance. Kirsten Dunst is also stunning and makes her character more three-dimensional than I bet any other actress could. She was perfectly cast and I love her hair like that.<br />There were some outstanding action sequences in Spider-Man, including the final battle between the Goblin and Spider-Man, which showcases some brilliant sound effects. The scenes at the parade and also on the bridge were intense, scary and unpredictable, and especially the one at the parade had me practically falling off my seat in tension.<br />If there were things I didn't like about the film they would just be stupid little things. I don't like how the Goblin says \\"Itsy bitsy Spider came up thewater spout. Down came the Goblin and washed the Spider out!\\" It is a lame, cheesy and unneeded line. The end really gets on my nerves but brings across the motto of the movie in a brilliant and heartbreaking fashion - so I wouldn't call it a flaw.<br />Overall - a brilliant movie. If you don't like superhero flicks that's OK, because I don't and I LOVED LOVED LOVED this movie. I now own the DVD and watch it often. This is more than a superhero movie, much much more, and I can't wait to see the sequel.<br />--- DVD REVIEW ---<br />I own this DVD as I mentioned up there and I really love it. The special features are a sight to behold, there are many that really inform you on the movie. Unlike most films, the DVD has a lot of information and featurettes on both discs, whereas with most movies there's usually two discs, one with the film and one with the features. But this movie is packed with lots of features to enjoy. I love watching gags and there is a short gag reel. There is a few documentaries on the casting choices in the movie. It was an excellently put together package that is most definitely worth your money!
B000089RVX|4.0|The CD Fallen is a welcome addition to top 40 airplay for sure and it is nice to have a new, if recycled spin on the airwaves. Amy Lee's voice is far and above worth the price of admission here. Much like anything the Cranberries put out was listenable because of Dolores' voice. This is also very close in nature to the disbanded October Project. I deduct one star because of the obligatory ... rap-sung verse that diminishes the songs... Rock, or Rap, but never think that you can do both!!!!
B00005JL78|5.0|I am one of the many Speilberg fans that just really didn't like his 2001 movie, A.I. Artificial Intelligence. I thought the film was lame and idiotic, and it never held my interest. However, Minority Report has restored my faith in one of my favourite directors.<br />The movie had an awesome style, just as all Speilberg movies do. I loved the art direction, which I believe is truly the best art direction of 2002. It had so much effect on the atmosphere of the film - especially the bluish tints everywhere. Very well done! Speilberg keeps the tension running through the movie like hot water - I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through!<br />There are also some strong performances here. Tom Cruise displays surprising depth for his character, and you're rooting for him the whole way through. Colin Farrell is also very good even though his role isn't as meaty as Cruise's. Samantha Morton was the strongest performer here if you ask me, she makes a great crazy person, and like Cruise brings depth to her character so you ultimately care about what happens to her.<br />The action scenes in this movie are awesome, as you've probably heard. The infamous jetpack scene rocks of course, but it could've done with an orchestral score of some sort. I loved the car-hopping scene as well (the climax to that scene is hilarious) and the very intense scene where Cruise attempts to escape the building.<br />Overall, I just thought this movie was great. I found it hard to find any flaws. It had emotion, action, and a great story. I just loved the way this worked and the premise of finding the killer before the crime is really really cool and Speilberg's vision for the future is realised here more than ever. <br />Don't miss it!
B00008BRBG|5.0|The Polices debut album, Is the most punk of their albums, and in some ways, the best.<br />The two well-known and well-loved singles, Roxanne and  its B-side, Cant Stand Losing You are there.  One is about a girl whos a Lamp Post Lillie and the heartbroken schmo whos in love with her.  You dont have to put on the red light he keeps saying.  The suicidal despair of the other song is semi-pathetic but pathos-eliciting at the same time.  The sleeve for the original single features a guy hanging from a rope, apparently having hung himself.  However, the other stuff on Outlandos should not be ignored.<br />The frantic Punk/50s rock of Next To You is a perfect example of what should be expected.  How badly does the protagonist want this girl?  I sold my house/I sold my motor, too/All I want is to be next to you/I'd rob a bank/Maybe steal a plane/You took me over/Think I'm goin' insane<br />The white reggae that made the Police a new reckoning force on the charts can be found on So Lonely, one of their best social alienation songs, although that would be outdone in the universal Message In A Bottle next album.  The chorus is where Sting and company shift into three-chord drive before downshifting again.  Key lines:  Now no one's knocked upon my door/For a thousand years or more/All made up and nowhere to go/Welcome to this one man show/Just take a seat they're always free/No surprise no mystery/In this theatre that I call my soul/I always play the starring role.  How sad, how me!<br />Hole In My Life has the same theme, of loneliness.  Theres one downbeat line in that maybe looking for happiness is outdoing ones expectations since happiness is impossible.  As these lines says:   There's something missing from my life/Cuts me open like a knife/It leaves me vulnerable/I have this disease.  This is reggae with a harder edge.<br />The angry punk of Peanuts is a song of disgust at the crass Hollywood/yuppie lifestyle. Don't wanna find out what you've been taking/Don't wanna read about the love you're making/Don't wanna hear about the life you're faking/Don't wanna read about the muck they're raking.  Definitely, oh definitely!<br />The lyrics to Truth Hits Everybody has that atmosphere of ones world paradigm shattered, assuming one is bravely self-analytical enough to realize that.  Death is the only certainty, says the song so sagely.<br />The upbeat anthem Born In The Fifties is their paean to the Polices generation.  There are references to the Kennedy assassination, Beatlemania, and a swipe at Elvis And they laughed when the king fell down the stairs.<br />Be My Girl/Sally has the punk-repeated refrain be my girl before fading out to include a poem on a lonely man getting a blow-up doll that he makes his wife, bedroom companion, anything.  The rhyme scheme is X,A,Y,Ai.e. the second and fourth lines rhyme, the other two dont.<br />The album ends with the instrumental punk/reggae jam Masoko Tanga.<br />An essential album and the one to buy after getting the greatest hits by them!ss Hollywood/yuppie lifestyle.

B00006J3WH|5.0|Episode number 107 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer - Once More, With Feeling - was an episode breakthrough for international television. It was a musical, so daring and bold, where the cast did all their own singing and the creator wrote all the music and lyrics. It was an amazing achievement and as a big Buffy fan I have to admit I was not disappointed by the episode. The CD is also brilliant, and as well as all the songs from the episode, it has some scores and suites from other episodes, like Hush and Restless, two of my other favourite epiodes beside OMWF.<br />Here's my track-by-track guide to ONCE MORE, WITH FEELING...<br />TRACK 1 - OVERTURE/GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS<BR>Nice overture, and Going Through the Motions is one of the many comedic highlights of the episode while also showing Buffy's discontentment with her life. A great song, but would've worked better with the sound effects from the episode.<br />TRACK 2 - I'VE GOT A THEORY/BUNNIES/IF WE'RE TOGETHER<BR>Awesome track, and still very funny on CD. I've Got A Theory has a cool little ring to it, and is so fitting for the Scoobies. Emma Caulfield's Bunnies is hilarious, and If We're Together is a touching track sung brilliantly by Sarah Michelle Gellar.<br />TRACK 3 - THE MUSTARD<BR>This doesn't quite fit in the CD. It's hilarious in the episode though.<br />TRACK 4 - UNDER YOUR SPELL<BR>Amber Benson proves she has an amazing voice. This is a great song with excellent guitar work and stunning vocals. I listen to it a lot.<br />TRACK 5 - I'LL NEVER TELL<BR>Another really funny song, which shows Anya and Xander's nervousness before their wedding. Their complaints about each other are hilarious and always entertaining to listen to.<br />TRACK 6 - THE PARKING TICKET<BR>I was happy they inclduded this, it was hilarious in the episode. It was nice to hear the full version.<br />TRACK 7 - REST IN PEACE<BR>One of the more darker songs in the album. James Marsters is a member of the band Ghost of the Robot and he proves here why. He has an awesome voice and his Billy Idol-like song is a great addition to the episode and sounds great spinning on the CD.<br />TRACK 8 - DAWN'S LAMENT<BR>Short but nice collection of little orchestrals. Lets you know how Dawn might be feeling at the time, and the scary music at the end is really cool. Would've worked better hearing Dawn's scream.<br />TRACK 9 - DAWN'S BALLET<BR>A very short but brilliantly played ballet tune. The music here is exciting, fairy-tale like and memorable.<br />TRACK 10 - WHAT YOU FEEL<BR>Jazzy, catchy and entertaining tune to listen to, it sounds almost better on CD. I think it would've ben just that tad bit better with the conversations between Sweet and Dawn. Hinton Battle is a great singer!<br />TRACK 11 - STANDING<BR>Anthony Stewart Head is a great singer! This is the first of the very depressing songs on the album. It was written very well and shows the reason why Giles must leave and make Buffy stand on her own two feet. Just as great on CD.<br />TRACK 12 - UNDER YOUR SPELL/STANDING Reprise<BR>Amber Benson and Anthony Stewart Head's voices just mesh really well together! They sound amazing as they are probably the strongest singers of the cast. Excellent stuff, and I loved hearing the two tunes of Standing/Under your Spell mixing together.<br />TRACK 13 - WALK THROUGH THE FIRE<BR>On screen and on CD, this track brings a tear to my eye. It's brilliant. Sarah Michelle Gellar's singing here is very strong and the lyrics are heartbreaking. This is probably my favourite song on the track, I cherish it and listen to it a lot.<br />TRACK 14 - SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT<BR>Brilliant lyrics and brilliant singing. Sarah Michelle Gellar hits all the right notes here, she rocks. This is just behind Walk Through the Fire for my favourite track on the album. <br />TRACK 15 - WHAT YOU FEEL - REPRISE<BR>Wonderfully theatrical exit for Sweet. Great music and catchy tune.<br />TRACK 16 - WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE<BR>A short song but Ilove it all the same. One of my favourite songs on the album, it's very sad and the music is great. Loved hearing the full version.<br />TRACK 17 - CODA<BR>Nice little exit for the episode with Sarah and James' voices meshing well.<br />TRACK 18 - END CREDITS<BR>Another jazzy tune and a very happy note to go out on such a depressing episode. Very cool.<br />TRACK 19 - MAIN TITLE<BR>Altered Nerf Herder music especially for the musical. Very cool remix!<br />TRACK 20 - SUITE FROM RESTLESS<BR>Loved all of the tunes here, Willow's Nightmare is a scary one, while First Rage is awesome and action packed.<br />TRACK 21 - SUITE FROM HUSH<BR>A great collection of music from a brilliant epiode. I love the track Enter the Gentlemen, it's very creepy and brings back memories of the Gentlemen demons. First Kiss is lovely.<br />TRACK 22 - SACRIFICE (FROM THE GIFT)<BR>I love this music, it is so sad. It brings back acute memories of seeing Buffy jump into the portal to save the world in the season 5 finale. Brilliant, tearfully sad music.<br />TRACK 23 - SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT (DEMO)<BR>A lovely touch to end the CD, Joss' wife Kai sings Something To Sing About. Great voice Kai, and nice to know what the song would sound like with just the piano.<br />**<br />TOP 5 TRACKS<br />1. Walk Through the Fire<BR>2. Something to Sing About<BR>3. I've Got A Theory/Bunnies/If We're Together<BR>4. Under Your Spell<BR>5. Suite from Restless<br />**<br />This is an essential item for any Buffy fan. I just love this album and I love all the songs on it. Perhaps it would've worked better with some more sound effects but Joss probably wanted to made the episode individual with those and have the CD with JUST the music. That works fine with me! I don't really know what else to say, oh, wait this - BUY IT!<br />NOW!<br />:)
B00006CXXU|5.0|The Good<br />This cd was surprise to me.  Not that I liked it because I'm already a big fan of Xtina's.  But usually a cd that I have alot of expectations for and anticipate usually don't deliver.  Did it meet my Expectation?  No.  IT EXCEEDED THEM!  Here are a few thoughts on the tracks.<br />Stripped Pt1  It's an intro.  A few soundbites here and there.  Should put to rest any thought about it being a purely sex cd.<br />Can't Hold Us Down:  I like it.  I had to kinda chuckle at the \\"You must talk so big to make up for smaller things\\" lyric cause so true.(p.s I'm a guy and no its not a man bashing song)<br />Walk Away:  Okay but not wonderful.  A little padded.  It could've been a minute shorter<br />Fighter:  Fans often say Christina rocks.  Well that maybe a eupahmaism but in this song she does literally.  Great song about empowerment and rising above those who wronged you.  The video is also her best imo.  Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction does guitar on the song.<br />Primear Amor:  An itro.  For those who don't know it means first love.<br />Ifatuation:  No it's not about her father as one reviewer said.  It's about her ex-boyfriend/dancer Jorge Santos who was her first love.  It's okay I guess<br />Love's Embrace:  Another intro.  Kinda sounds like a relaxation tape.<br />Loving Me 4 Me:  I love this song.  A beautiful ballad about loving someone for who they are.<br />Impossible:  One of only two songs she didn't co-write(it was written by Alecia Keys who does piano and background vocals)  Great R&B song stirrs up thoughts of smokey bars.<br />Underapreciated:  Another Jorge song about the luster of romance wearing off.<br />Beautiful:  My favourite track.  the 2nd song she didn't write(it was written by Lynda Perry)  Great message behind it.<br />Make Over:  Okay but not great.  Kinda surprised by the chorus.<br />Cruz:  Just a great song.<br />Soar:  Sounds like a hym but like beautiful its got a good message(find your own path in life)<br />Get Mine Get Yours:  And people thought Dirrty was bad.  This songs about two people who get together for casual well lovemaking.  Best hook on the cd in my opinion.<br />Dirrty:  Contrary to popular belief this isn't about sex.  It's about going clubbing.  Great song though.  Rapper Redman appears.<br />Stripped Pt2: a follow up to the first<br />The Voice Within:  Xtina plays big sister in this song saying find the strength within yourself to overcome your problems.  Great song<br />I'm Okay:  Oh God.  This song haunted me the rest of the day after I first heard.  It's about her dad and how he abused her and her mom.  It's a chilling song that I can't listen too without crying.  Nobody deserves to go through that.<br />Keep on Singing My Song:  Good last song with Christina basically saying she's not let anyone not critics or hater or Eminem or Fred Durst or Kelly Osbourne or anybody knock her down.  Don't stop the cd when the songs done.  There's a litte extra at the end.  You'll laugh.<br />                     The Bad<br />Excuse me?  THE WHAT?  Not on this cd.<br />                     The Ugly<br />The Dirrty controversy was blow way out of proportion.  It's also stupid how people complained about the video but yet at the same time Shaggy comes out with one of the most chauvanistic videos ever(hey sexy lady) and yet nothing is said.  Can you say double standard?
B00005JLKN|4.0|I am a big fan of the Hannibal Lecter series. Although I've never seen Manhunter, so don't go expecting any comparisons here, I really enjoyed The Silence of the Lambs, which is one of my favourite movies, and Hannibal was great as well, well at least I thought so, but apparently not many other people did. Red Dragon is the weakest of the series so far but is still a fine film.<br />The bad was pretty standard really, I say this about a lot of movies - just too long. A bit boring in places. Whereas Hannibal used the long running time to supply suspense and plot developemnt, it seems a lot of this film was bumbling around and pointless scenes. They could've devoted some more scenes to Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman instead of having them all on Norton. I also thought this movie was released way too quickly and seemed to be a money-making machine instead of an overly-great movie. But it was still a good flick.<br />The acting here was as solid as it has been in the entire series. I had to seriously question before I saw this movie how they could fit THAT many stars into this film. Well, it seems like almost every single actor stood out here, though some more than others. Edward Norton is great as per usual and I really liked his hair. Anthony does his Hannibal thang and I loved it. His voice sounded too fake in some parts but he still did a really good job. Harvey Keitel has to stand around and spout off information, he does it well. Emily Watson was the most standy-outy of the actors here, she was brilliant and I really loved her character and sympathised with her. Ralph Fiennes is right behind her in second place for standy-outy performance of the movie. He was genuinely creepy and goes all-out. Great stuff dude!<br />The directing of this flick was awesome. Heavy atmosphere and brilliant camera angles, especially towards the end of the movie. I didn't really dig how they used so many of the same ones from The Silence of the Lambs at the beginning of the film (I was almost expecting to see Hannibal standing up really perkily like he was the first time we saw him in SOTL) but as the movie progresses it grows into it's own story.<br />A great thing to finish on is the great ending to this movie. I loved the reference to Clarice. I was hoping for a cameo from Jodie or Julianne but I liked the way they ended it. Almost made me want to flick on SOTL, but I'd probably be scared out of my wits because it was 12:30am when this movie finished, and I was already scared from this one!
B00004W52U|5.0|if you own any cd in your life you must own this cd.  i grew up listening to these guys, never realising what a cult fav they would be.  when i saw their last show, i thought the music that was, would be lost to everyone thereafter.  but fortunately for all of you you can still hear one of the best groups and one of the best cds ever made
B00008DDXB|4.0|I've read all the available HP books more than once, so I'm fussy about how the text is treated in the movie. Columbus and company treat the text with respect, and do a good job of translating to the film medium.<br />There's no way to get it all in, and DVD is perfect for including scenes which obviously were labored over and perfected before they were cut.<br />There are lots of games, additional tours, and special features that make this DVD worth buying. DVD is a great medium for allowing HP fans - or fans of any s-f or fantasy world - to immerse themselves more fully.
B00005JLEU|3.0|For someone who loves animation a great deal, I sat through this movie greatly puzzled at the praise heaped upon it and its box-office takings.  Yes, it has some strange and wonderful imagery, but come on!  So has tons of other Japanese and Chinese animated features.  Plus, the story is so plodding, and at times confusing, that my partner started nodding off half way through the movie.  For a vastly superior and more entertaining animated feature in the same vein, I greatly recommend Tsui Hark's 1997 animated remake of &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot;.  With its strange fantasy world of gods, demons, ghosts and timeless love, &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; is a great deal more engaging than the sleep-inducing &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.
0440237688|4.0|This story takes place in a utopia-like society.  One of the most unusual elements of the community was that the members were only able to perceive their surroundings in black and white.  The central piece of the story was that one person (The Giver) was the sole owner of all past memories and the time had arrived to pass that information along to a successor (Jonas).<BR>  The only persons experiencing any form of conflict in the story were Jonas and the Giver.  Being without memories, the rest of the society, including the Elders who ran the society, were ignorant of any other way of doing things and were, therefore, content.  Jonas was given the ability to see things from new perspectives, taking into account past pleasures and pains.  He began to understand different moralities of situations and seriously doubted the way of doing things that he had previously accepted without question.<BR>  This book is not necessarily a question of good versus evil, but rather a matter of learning from past experiences.  Was the decision of 'sameness' the correct one for their community?  Why wasn't euthanization (being released) a question of morality?  Were the decisions of doing things for the good of the community really good for the community?  And without memories, what was left to compare their lives to?<BR>  I don't think that many children who read this story would care to live in that type of society.  Middle School students (and I don't think that this book is appropriate for students younger than that) pride themselves on their originality.  However, the topics addressed in this book are interesting for any students ready to consider them.
B000002H70|5.0|Ambitious, emotional, utterly brilliant; those are just a few adjectives to describe this Cure masterpiece from 1989. The aura is evident right away on \\"Plainsong,\\" from the ethereal sound to the echoey vocals, to the way it seems to take the album a while to get going, this is one special piece of music, which continues the entire way through. Robert Smith takes a long time before singing on most of these tracks, as if he's purposely hoping to lull listeners into the sound and mood he's in. The drums on most of these tracks are simply played, big and booming, '80s style, amid a whirlwind of more complex music that is consistently grandoise and sweeping.<br /><br />A hopeless romantic, lead singer Smith wears his heart on his sleeve when he passionately sings. Musically, the guy is pretty boundless: The quiet guitar hooks are honest-to-God hooks that sweep you in, and the same can be said for the more important keyboard work on the album from Roger O' Donnell, which makes for an extremely catchy combination, despite the overall dark ambiance. At 73 minutes long, nothing on this album is chintzy; it doesn't skimp out on anything, and thus, listeners will get a lot out of it in more ways than one.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the dark pop radio hit \\"Lovesong,\\" at three minutes, 28 seconds, is sort of an oddity on \\"Disintegration,\\" as much for its short time span as its quick, get-to-the-point message. Another anamoly is the fabulous \\"Lullaby,\\" a quirky tune with breathy vocals. From the fragments of an anxiety-filled dream, the song comes off as entertaining and humorous, especially given the generally somber mood of the rest of the album.<br /><br />The meat of these outstandingly created, brilliantly windy songs takes place at the dark but somehow joyous and experiment-seeking \\"Fascination Street.\\" From that point on, no song is under six minutes. \\"Prayers for Rain\\" is bold but majestically hopeless and desperate-sounding; \\"The Same Deep Water As You\\" owes a debt to the Doors' lulling rain-drenched intro and outro heard on \\"Riders on the Storm.\\" Actually, both songs possess the same seductively mellow vibe that slowly draws listeners in. The title track has a much more immediate effect, an apologetic urgency, a sound of admittance, shame and guilt. Its simple piano hook is repetative and beautiful, making the long song perhaps the best one on the album.<br /><br />Though the final two tracks sound a bit tacked on, they're outstanding tunes, and they fill out \\"Disintegration\\" with grace, surely what Smith was going for. \\"Homesick\\" retains the spacey, atmospheric vibe of earlier songs, while \\"Untitled\\" might be the prettiest, most stripped-down tune on the entire record. Overall, this album is best heard as an entire entity -- if you have the time, that is. No doubt, if you're seeking solace on an endless windswept prairie of sounds, this is the music for you.rain-drenched intro and outro heard on \\"Riders on the Storm.\\" Actually, both songs possess the same seductively mellow vibe that slowly draws listeners in.

B000066NW0|1.0|This isn't bad for pop/punk music, but that's not saying much.  I still am trying to figure out why I have a copy of this, even if it was only four bucks.  There might be one or two good songs on here (especially the one she raps on... you're sure to get a good laugh out of that!), but most of the songs sound the same, and \\"Sk8er Boi\\" is one of the worst songs I've ever heard.  I've never heard vocals kill an already mediocre piece of musicianship like that.  \\"Complicated\\" was her only good song, and the only purpose it really serves is background noise for large gatherings.  I love Weird Al's parody of it; she left herself wide open for that!  At least Al's version has decent lyrics; Avril's songs are the most bland, repetitive, cliche, meaningless, and unimaginative in the entirety of the industry, save for rap (which really doesn't count as music).<br />At first, I thought Avril was going to be something different; a respectable artist, not a tramp like Britney or Aguilera, and someone who played her own music.  Well, it's quite obvious she's never been presented with the concept of voice lessons, and she doesn't actually play that guitar that she's always pictured as holding.  She never plays it in the videos, and I'm told she makes lame excuses for not playing it at shows.  I'm not patronizing Hilary Duff by any means, as she's as much a product of corporate zeal as the other \\"teen queen\\" dingbats, but when I heard that Avril came out and started talking trash about her for no reason at all, I thought to myself, \\"what's wrong with this girl?\\"  Does Avril think she did something incredibly wonderful or original by being the first female Canadian skatepunk to make music?  This \\"dissing\\" is ridiculous; these are supposed to be professional musicians, so they ought to act professional.  You don't hear Marco Coti Zelati bashing Evanescence simply because the sounds of their bands are somewhat similar.  Members of Iron Maiden don't chastise Jon Schaffer for making music similar to theirs, they praise his band's talent instead.  This is how professionals should carry themselves.  I think it's time for little Miss Lavigne to grow up, and if she's not willing to, then she should go back to building her sand castle.  I actually thought she had some potential at first, but now I realize the only usefulness one could find in her would be to use her sweet, slender throat as a hand-warmer or squeeze toy.  Who knows, maybe a little pressure on the vocal cords would help her voice out...<br />In the end, \\"Let Go\\" is an example of corporate industry ruling the music industry.  They put a pretty girl (and Avril is definitely good-looking) behind a guitar and microphone, and say to the MTV kids, \\"here's something different than Britney Spears.\\"  Yeah, so is Cradle of Filth.  Yes, I'm comparing a pop-punk act to a satanic black metal outfit.  But it's a good comparison; while Dani Filth may be accused of having the worst vocals in music, at least he puts some emotion into it, even if it is grotesque and unorthodox.  Avril just sounds like a whiny little girl who lost her favorite Barbie doll.  Dani's lyrics, while disturbing to many, are poetic and thought-provoking, whereas Avril's sound like they were written by a preschooler - and she doesn't even write half of them!  Talent-wise, well, you can't say much about it because every song sounds like the previous track, and the musicianship sounds eerily similar to other \\"pop-punk\\" artists like blink-182.  I could easily name at least 30 artists that the majority of you have probably never heard of that are aeons ahead of Avril in talent and professionalism.  To sell this many records without the slightest hint of vocal talent and mediocre instrumental abilities signals a major problem with our music industry.  Avril needs to grow up, take some voice lessons, teach her band how to play their instruments properly, and then try again.<br />P.S.: I want my $$$$ back.
B00005JLPK|1.0|I don't know why I thought I might like this movie when I went to see it. It gets an F in three catagories<br />1. Historical accuracy - Yes there was a woman named Frida who was married to Diego and lived in Mexico, but that's where the history seems to end. Frida was actually a staunch Stalinist (the last painting she was working on when she died was of him) and only briefly flurted with Trotskyism (mostly when she was sleeping with Trotsky). Her husband was more than a cheat as he was also a wife beater, but I guess feminists can't have a hero that goes back to an abusive husband.<br />2. Artfulness - It tried way too hard. Making her paintings become animated was mostly awkward. The black and white with parts colored was poorly placed, sympolized nothing, and was used WAY too much.<br />3. Acting - All of it seemed forced and Hayek is the most over-rated actress this side of Halle Berry. I could never sympathize with the main character as half her troubles are her own making.<br />Over all, the tragedy in the movie is found in its dishonesty, not in its story.
B00005YW4H|1.0|For some reason, I bought a cheap second-hand copy of this album, expecting something beautiful or masterful or worthy of some sort of complimentary term after seeing all the awards this girl won and all the positive feedback on this site.  Then I played it.  I cycled through some of the songs to see if any of them sounded different from the one before.  Nope.  I immediately thought to myself, \\"why does this girl get all kind of praise?\\"  Then I figured it out.  She's physically attractive, she's related to someone with lots of money and fame (although I've never heard of the guy), and she plays music that won't offend anyone.  A load of Grammys for that?  Wow, our music industry is really desperate!<br />Now granted, Norah has more to offer than Britney Spears or Eminem, but that's basically saying she actually has an electron worth of talent.  She does not have a good voice, her piano skills are very basic, and when it comes to originality, she gets a big fat zero.  Heck, two of the songs are covers of other artists' music, and they don't sound any different from anything else on the album.  This is music for elevators, fancy restaurants, dentist's offices, and maybe even massage parlors, but if you try to play this in your car, you're going to create a traffic hazard because there is nothing that will put you to sleep faster.  This genre of music (not sure what it is exactly) is boring and bland by nature, and there's not a whole lot you can do with it, so Norah doesn't stand out in it.  She got her voice heard on MTV, and they patronized her, so everyone in America wants to own a Norah Jones CD now.<br />I hate to go all-out to bash an artist who has good intentions, but I really have a problem with all the positive attention Norah gets while countless talented artists get left in the dust.  I'm sure that fans of this classical jazz or whatever type of music it is will love this girl, and I accept and respect that.  But there are ignorant people out there who say that Norah Jones is the only respectable artist in the entirety of the music industry.  Well, if the slightest amount of unorthodoxy offends you, then I'd say you're probably the type to jump to conclusions and are way too conservative (which is good for politics but bad for music).  Don't say that, simply because she doesn't play heavy metal or talk about anything other than romance, Norah is the only good thing in the music industry.  It only drives those of us who feel differently to want to strangle your sweet, innocent little Norah.  If you truly like what she's doing, then more power to you, but if you're riding the bandwagon and buying just because she's a big name, while ignoring the hundreds of talented artists that are out there but not as popular, then you're doing yourself a huge disservice, and you should be ashamed.
0451191153|4.0|Although the heroic architect of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is very loosely modeled on Frank Lloyd Wright, the novel is not really about architecture at all.  The story really centers on a man who knows what he wants to do and intends to work only on his own terms.<br />Howard Roark bucks architectural norms to create his own designs where form follows function.  While it sounds like an auto commercial today, the notion was more revolutionary when the story was written in the forties.<br />True to Randian form, the pack instincts of Roark's peers take over as they vow to take him down.  His originality and, more importantly, his refusal to act on any terms other than his own infuriate those around him.  Also true to form, our superhuman protagonist has a superhuman mate equally dedicated to pure excellence and pure ego.<br />Both &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; make for great reading aside from Rand's tendency to engage in speechmaking.  She never trusts the reader to draw the appropriate lessons from the story and therefore sets up melodramatic, scripted speeches of heroic length to drive her points home.  Nevertheless, the books are interesting, with powerful plots, and mark a potent answer to the drive toward collectivization of the twentieth century.

B00008PW3Q|2.0|Am I the only one disappointed in this CD? I've been a devoted Fleetwood Mac fan since 1977 (I even bought \\"Time!\\") and have looked forward to this CD ever since Stevie announced it two years ago. I heard a promo for the single \\"Say You Will\\" a couple of months ago and was blown away by it! I was surprised when \\"Peacekeeper\\" was announced as the leadoff single, but I think it is a good song in itself.<br />Which brings me to explain why I am disappointed in this CD...aside from the two above mentioned tunes, the rest of the CD seems \\"filler\\" material rejected from Stevie's last album and poor material from Lindsey (you'd think having ten years, he could write some great songs). The CD seems more like a solo album of Stevie and Lindsey songs. I guess that is to be expected considering the devastating absence of Christine McVie (I call her the \\"hit machine,\\" because she wrote most of the Mac's biggest hits). Lindsey has stated that Christine's departure has forced the band to go in a new direction. Sorry guys, but I like your old direction much, much, better!<br />That being said, the CD is worth the price just for the song, \\"Say You Will.\\" It has restored my faith in Stevie's ability to write hit singles. It is by FAR the best song on the CD, followed by \\"Peacekeeper.\\" The rest, oh well, maybe you will have a different take on it...
0446608955|5.0|A Walk To Remember is by far one of the best books I've ever read.  As soon as I started reading, I fell in love with it.  Nicholas Sparks does a wonderful job; he truly knows how to touch your heart.<BR> <BR> This book starts out with a young man and woman who are complete opposites.  Landon's a rebel and Jamie's a goody-goody.  Landon says, \\"Jamie had never been on my social calendar, she wasn't exactly what I called attractive either.\\"  Throughout the story Landon and Jamie end up spending time together.  Landon looks beyond Jamie's looks and sees that she is a wonderful person.  They end up falling in love.  We now find Landon and Jamie both saying, \\"I love you.\\" to each other.  It has a great tragic ending that will keep you reaching for the tissues all night long.<BR> <BR> I'm not big into reading, but I found with this book, I had trouble putting it down.  It has touched my heart in a special way that I won't soon forget.  I encourage everyone to read this book.  Sparks' story will remain in your heart forever.
0316666343|3.0|I read the book in 4 hrs because i was expecting something dramatic to happen, nothing happened. Mr Harvey got away with a quite death and was never discovered the other strong character was broken so much that he became too weak that was suzie's dad and buckley who had a budding anger building was simpered away from the plot, the blockbuster scene between Ray and susie/ruth was uncalled for.<BR>At the end i did know if i should be sad which i was because i did shed some tears or angry for being so unfulfilled however am still looking to her next novel
B000003TAR|3.0|There seems to be this thing with Nirvana that gets people to give them loads of praise and hail them as \\"The Band That Can Do No Wrong.\\" For example, had any other band done the solo for Teen Spirit, it would probably be considered mundane. But because Nirvana did it, people seem to be quick to call it the greatest rock solo ever. After the horribly overrated Nevermind, Nirvana attempted a harsher, less mainstream tone with In Utero. The end result is better than Nevermind, but still not quite up to the level of greatness in this reviewer's eyes.<br />Truth be told, In Utero is not the \\"anti-pop\\" album some make it out to be. Songs like Serve The Servants and Rape Me, despite their dark lyrical themes, are very pop-like tracks. While All Apologies and Heart Shaped Box are head on ballads, and nothing too non-commercial sounding (despite the intentionally sloppy production). <br />As for the album's actual problems, they're pretty much the same as what plagued Nevermind. Despite his impressive vocal range, Kurt Cobain's voice is very irritating IMO, often sounding like a drunken John Lennon if nothing else. The guitar work is also less than impressive and at times it just sounds like the band was trying too hard to convey loads of emotion with their music, making it sound more whiney than anything else. <br />Still, there are a few good songs here. Serve The Servants has a nice groove and good theme (namely troubled parents). Heart Shaped Box has an admittedly nice acoustic melody (though grating chorus), and Dumb is a catchy (almost humorous) acoustic track about (what else?) the joys of stupidity. In brief, if you MUST buy a Nirvana album, I'd say it'd be best to go with this one. Despite its problems, there is still some good music to be heard. Especially if you're a fan of alternative or mood music.

0385504209|5.0|This book is is great fun, and written in a way that the plot keeps moving forward and keeps you guessing. Within the book, are series of little puzzles which the reader can try to solve before the characters in the book do. It contains a lot of information of history and art, and specific examples of Pagan rituals hidden in modern catholicism. It also presents many feminist ideals as important to religion.<br />  The premise of the book is mostly based on a 1983 conspiracy favorite Holy Blood, Holy Grail. Despite the specualtive nature of this source, many of the organizations, buildings and artwork are real. Brown plays with this idea to make an incredibly amusing story that will leave readers looking into history books and  examining old paintings with a microscope. I highly recommend this book, especially for people who like puzzles and riddles, conspiracy nuts, history buffs, or anyone looking for a good story.<br /> The only people who seemed to dislike it are Catholics who got offended. Don't be so sensitive. :)
B00008PW3Q|5.0|As soon as possible this album was in my possesion. They have done it again, with amazing songs. I highly recommend this album for all of you Fleetwood Mac/Stevie Nicks lovers. I cannot yet say that I have a favorite song from the CD yet, but I have really enjoyed listening to &quot;Illume&quot; and &quot;Say You Will&quot;, but the whole album is by far, amazing. It is a great album to buy and I suggest anyone who enjoys Fleetwood Mac, to buy it. I rate it at 5 stars...Fleetwood Mac just keeps rising to the top with their music and beautifully written songs.
0385504209|4.0|Anyone who has read Brown's first Langdon novel, \\"Angels and Demons\\" will recognize the familiar formula used again in \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" The murder of a celebrated personality entwined with the bizarre use of a symbol that only Robert Langdon, noted Harvard symbolist, can decipher, let alone fathom, links the unassuming Langdon with a beautiful girl related to the victim and embarks him on an intellectual chase that unlocks the door to history's most guarded secret societies and the treasures they protect. Since this equation obviously worked for Brown before, he does not hesitate to use it again, but leaves a few loose strings in particular Langdon's affection for Vittoria from the previous book which is not-so-neatly dismissed and substituted by his relationship with French cryptologist, Sophie, in this one.<br /><br />In spite of its similarity to the first Langdon adventure, the reader cannot help but get involved in this story full throttle. The insight into some of the historical characters intrigues and delights; the knowledge of secret societies, their roster of historical luminaries and their interplay with age-old adversaries like the Vatican boggles the mind. Dismiss Langdon and the other characters who are not fully fleshed out--- its important to realize that they are mere conduits who provide speech and action for the true main characters--the puzzles and ciphers that account for the page-turning effect that you will experience once you start this novel. True conspiracy theory aficionados will guess many of the puzzles, but honestly, that just adds to the smug fun---the final resolution is one that I never guessed and yet fully enjoyed.<br /><br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" provides at least 24 hours of mind stimulation that anyone who wishes a fully engaged break from today's reality will appreciate. Brown documents his work with a sprinkling of book citations mentioned through the dialogue; he should have provided a bibliography for those who want to separate fact from his imagined fiction. The novel's format--short chapters told third person from the different vantage points of the police, the religious operatives, and the hero and heroine, Langdon and Sophie move the plot along at a breakneck speed that is reminiscent of Michael Crichton's style in Jurassic Park and Timeline. I recommend this book to anyone who indulges in escapist fiction with that hint of reality that keeps you wondering if what you believe in is really valid or simply propaganda.e fact from his imagined fiction.

0385504209|2.0|I bought this book based on the NY Times ecstatic review. It certainly did not live up to the hype. The most interesting parts were those giving the \\"historical\\" background to the grail legend. The rest was substandard suspense fare--one contrived cliff-hanger after another, written in some of the most amateurish prose I have ever read in a published novel. The characters are cartoonish, and the plot is so transparently mechanical you can see the gears turning as the author cranks up yet another improbable twist. The final revelations are of the type that give you a sinking feeling in your stomach. Botton line: this is a purely plot-driven book with interesting arcane religious lore thrown in.
078062999X|5.0|This version of Hamlet is one of the few to incorporate the entire play, without any revision or abridgement.  It is over four hours long, but worth every minute of it.  Kenneth Branagh does a superb job directing here, and plays an impeccable Hamlet.  The play is set in the 19th century, which allows for a very elaborate and glamorous backdrop to this classic play.  Branagh's Hamlet is a bit darker, a bit more sinister than most of us are used to seeing, but this does the play well.  Things only implied (such as the love affair between Hamlet and Ophelia) in the play are given full attention.  Also, Branagh's version gives a far different impression of some of the main characters than I'm used to, especially Polonius and Ophelia herself.  <br />This cast is star-studded, but all of the actors do very well in their parts.  Kate Winslet is a wonderful Ophelia.  Small parts by Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Charleton Heston, Jack Lemmon, and others add to rather than detract from the overall effect of the film.  Overall, this is an excellent representation of this classic play.  I highly recommend it.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I was anxiously awaiting seeing Dreamcatcher and catching Final Flight of the Osiris. After the huge disappointment that was Dreamcatcher, I only recall how excellent Final Flight was. I just loved how the CG flowed so well, especially in the opening fight sequence. However, this isn't what first hooked me. A while back, I downloaded Part 1 of The Second Renaissance, and that blew me away. Since then, I've been eagerly watching the Website for new downloads. I will be one of the first in line to see Reloaded when it comes out, and I will be one of the first to buy this DVD when it hits the shelves. Who knows, I may even brave Dreamcatcher for Final Flight again.
0553573403|5.0|After checking in with the Science Fiction and Fanasty Web Forum,  and reading all the kudos this book received I thought I would give it a try.  I Have not enjoyed a book as much since reading LOTR or the Wheel of Time Series.  This is a superb novel , while a little slow to get started,  by page 100 I was hooked and could not put this down.  Strong characters that make you root for the good guy... but who are the good guys?<br />On to book 2!
B00006AUIG|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies I have seen in along time. It was creepy and scary without the heavy metal soundtrack and tons of blood! The idea of 5 guys working lone in this crumbling old asylum was great, my hat is off to Stephen Gevedon (Mike) and Brad Anderson for making such a truly scary movie. It was very distrubing!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Though I may be a 13-year old girl, I felt much more moved by this film than NOW AND THEN, a very similiar movie. Maybe I just like adventures more, which this film had. It also just made every moment last with a very well-written screenplay (which was Oscar-nominated) and outstanding performances. This film is on the top 250 films list at the Internet Movie Database, and deserves to stay there. I'm sorry that this review is so breif, but all that I can say is that this film is outstanding.
B00000G3PA|5.0|this was on of the best action movies i have seen. the special effects were great. this movie is both funny and sad at times. i known i was'nt expecting to cry at a action movie but i don't care how many times i watch this i have tears rolling down my face right along with bruce's tears and they don't stop untit the credits roll.
1582432678|5.0|This is one of the most chilling and compulsively readable books Ive opened in a long time. As you read Eva Khatchadourians letters to her estranged husband you think this is what it must be like for parents whose child has just murdered classmates and a popular teacher.<br />As Eva reveals in her letters, she knew something was wrong with Kevin from the moment of his birth when he turned away from her breast snarling and screaming. The anger does not wane, even though outwardly he was a passive, disinterested child. She blames her own mixed feelings toward him, but her beloved husband Franklin fiercely defends the boy whenever she asks why babysitters never come back for a second time and other families go great lengths to keep Kevin away from their own children. And Eva doesnt like him. No matter how hard she tries--and she does try very hard, moving to the suburbs, staying home, none of which she wants to doshe does not like her son. <br />Since you know from the beginning that Kevin is in juvenile prison for killing his classmates, you might think that the suspense in the story will come from finding out how he planned his spree and carried it out. You would be very, very mistaken. Very late in We Need to Talk About Kevin Lionel Shriver introduces a twist that is completely unexpected and totally shocking. These are words too frequently used in describing thrillers which rarely deliver the unexpected or the shocking. Believe me, in this book, those words do not begin to describe the wallop Shriver packs in the last quarter of the novel.<br />I was unfamiliar with Lionel Shriver, and will (after a recovery period) look for her other novels. She digs fearlessly into the back of her characters minds and the bottoms of their hearts.   Read this book.

B00006RU5B|1.0|Man, it's about time! I mean, Rage Against the Machine was deep down inside a hard rock band that was unfortunately bogged down by Zack de la Rocha's whiny, poppy, emo-teen-angst rantings, while Soundgarden was a contrived boy-band whose frontman Chris Cornell, much like the repressed Justin Timberlake, was begging to break free so he could express his true hardcore rock roots. Thankfully, Chris and the three die hard rockers from Rage had the original idea -- without any influence from MTV or major label CEO's -- to put their heads together and spend an entire 19 days to write and record their self-titled debut.<br />Well folks, I'm happy to tell you that Audioslave delivers on all fronts -- incendiary political propaganda, crushing classic hard rock riffs, pounding funk/rock rhythms, soaring vocals, and innovative guitar noises that never get old!!![.] Yes people, this is the REAL deal. Buy this NOW if you dig other true rock 'n roll pioneers like Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne, Tiny Tim, Hootie and the Blowfish, Paul Shaffer, Smashmouth, and John Tesh.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I normally wouldn't sit down to write a review, but I'd like to be the first to say this is a great album.  If you're a Buckingham fan, this is a must.  The guitar riffs are catchy, Stevie growls out lyrics like never before, and Mick's drums have somehow managed to get more defined.  <br />The title track is infectious and \\"Illume\\" is a great upbeat 9/11 tribute.  I would have to say that the worst song on the album is the first single, \\"Peacekeeper.\\"  Christine McVie's absence on this one is felt and it should be noted that this album would be even better with her on it.  I can't wait to see them back out on tour.
1583762027|3.0|I have had the pleasure of seeing Brian Tracy in action at Peter Lowe Success Seminars.  What you see is what you get, no-nonsense approaches to &quot;success&quot;.  At times the book seems a little too general belaboring the point of doing the main thing, right now, that will bring you the most success.  Average joe employees will have to take the principles and apply them to the fundamental areas of life.<br />Mid-managers and others facing critical deadlines might benefit more.  The book lends itself to careers where there are very clear-cut goals (i.e. sales - which covers Tracy's background).<br />Overall - I'd recommend it.  Even those in careers other than in fields where goals are easily broken down can glean benefit from Tracy's recommendations to stop procrastinating.  The books is a very easy read, borders on repetition, and could be read at one sitting.
B00006690G|5.0|Ive just received the Album a few Weeks ago, and where i live in Germany theres just a bige hype about him, but i really think he just proofes one more time that he really has the skills to be one of the greatest Rap Artists ever.<br />\\"White America\\" - Intelligent Rhymes,clear beat, but when you hear it often you just wanna skip it.<br />\\"Square Dance\\" - Lives from his beat.<br />\\"Cleaning Out my Closet\\" - God damn biting Lyrics, but heard too often....<br />\\"Soldier\\" - For me, the weakest track on the album.<br />\\"Drips\\" - The Obie Part is very cool, but weak chorus.<br />\\"Without Me\\" - Excellent, the One that just promoted the whole album.<br />\\"Sing for the Moment\\" - Very good Chorus, plain raps, works out.<br />\\"Superman\\" - Ok, i really like it but very sexistic track.<br />\\"Hailies Song\\" - Honest Song, one of my favorites.<br />\\"When the Music stops\\" - Plain Rap, not soo gréat, but ok.<br />\\"Say what you say\\" - Good One, but often just dont wanna hear it.<br />\\"My Dad´s gone crazy\\" - Funny One, good ending track.<br />That´s my oppinion as a german rap fan.
B00004S6GL|5.0|One of the best pop/rock/folk albums in recent years.  It rewards repeated listening, which highlights Smith's subtle genious.  He is truly one of the greatest song composers alive in this genre.  Similar lyrical and craft genious of Steven Malkmus minus the heavy sarcasm and smugness that detract from Malkmus' works over time.  Album opens with a rocking Son of Sam and immediately switches to the elliot smith extreme quiet beautifully picked Just Somebody I Used to Know.  Every song is a gem, in particular happiness, wouldn't mama be proud, better be quiet now, can't make a sound, color bars -- OK, they are all great, not a single dud on the album.<br />Despite the overt beatlesque influences, his sound is astonishingly unigue.  Ignore the longime &quot;fans&quot; clinging to the past. This is far and away his best work and a must have.
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you loved this episode, it's worth a listen. Would have liked it better if they had of added some of the dialogue, but the music brings back all of the best scenes from the show. The demo by Joss Whedon is pretty cool and the liner notes tell a very interesting story.

B000002UJQ|1.0|I heard so much about this album, about how it was so &quot;creative&quot;, so &quot;amazing&quot;, so &quot;life changing.&quot; PLEASE. The only way this sounds creative is when it is played right after an NSYNC album, and then only marginally so at that. This is music that wants DESPERATELY to be cutting edge, but fails miserably because its creators have no musical ability or talent. The only thing they do have is access to a studio where simple, trite harmonic progressions can be mixed with studio effects in order to mask their banality.<br />This album is in deep competition with NEVERMIND for the title of &quot;Most Overrated Album of the Last Twenty Years.&quot; People who think this is avante-garde wouldn't know avante-garde if it slapped them in the face.<br />For those interested in some real creativity in music, I suggest Mr Bungle, Fantomas, Ruins, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, King Crimson, Dillinger Escape Plan, John Zorn and Thinking Plague.<BR>Of course, those who are really into this music would probably be scared $hitless by most of that music.

B0000894RZ|4.0|Lisa Stansfield has, for a decade and a half, managed to produce a string of effortlessly catchy and silky smooth singles and a handful of generally more inconsistent albums. That's why a comprehensive greatest hits collection like this is such a good idea. Biography includes all of her English Top 40 hits with the exception of the What Did I Do To You? EP. It also includes a couple of extras in her track from the Red Hot and Blue album and one from the Five Live EP with Queen and George Michael. Those two are the weakest tracks here, interrupting the seamless flow of smooth dance-pop confections before the one-two finale of All Woman and All Around The World. While there are a couple of other personal faves that I would have liked to have seen included, there is no denying that this set is a great retrospective and shows that Lisa's music sounds as strong today as it ever did.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|The DVD version is much better than the movie released.  The added scenes are necessary to bring back the true horrors of war and to balance out the romantic vehicle used to move the story plot along from place to place.  In reality the people played by the actors never existed, yet the war did and for so many people it was a living hell that America and the world should not forget.  That Americans are offen divided in peace time but become one people in time of crisis and war, and that no attacker has ever survived untouched by her response.  As the Japanese pacific fleet commander warned on the that faithful day, we have awakened a sleeping monster, on that day he knew how the war would eventually end for Japan.  As the movie points out things would have very different if the aircraft carriers were in the harbor that morning.  It is those same carriers that launch the Dolittle raid on Tokyo and flight in Midway later.  Overall very good filming and sound for those who have 5.1 systems a good DVD.
B00000K44V|5.0|I am fortunate to not have the more recently re-mastered version of this CD, if I am to believe the comments of other reviewers.  Regardless of other comments, this CD is among the best of Jethro Tull's music, showing elements of progressive rock, rock, jazz and folk.<br />The CD kicks off with \\"With You There to Help Me\\".  The opening flute and harmonized vocal are pure folk or blues, but when the bass guitar and lead guitar slowly increase their participation in the song, it becomes folk-rock.  The harmonized vocals that are lead-ins to each verse are awesome.  The riffs are very characteristic of Tull.  Ian Anderson's vocals were so down-to-earth and fresh in 1970.  The bizarre stylings of Anderson's flute are without equal, and they are used very effectively in this song.  Near the end of the song the flute trades off with the lead guitar in a style that is unique to Tull.<br />\\"Nothing to Say\\" is less layered than the first cut, and has a more basic and raw sound.  The music is pure rock with a harder edge than track 1.  As usual though, the Tull sound is distinctive and unique.<br />The third song has more of the Renaissance sound that is often associated with Jethro Tull.  \\"Inside\\" is a LOVE song, if you can believe it.  It may not sound like a love song, but it is about getting a house and settling down.  Lots of flute and vocals, nearly pop, but with the classic Tull sound that is nearly impossible to pin down as one particular category of music.<br />On the next song, \\"Son\\", a flavor of progressive is felt more strongly than on the earlier songs.  However, before dismissing any of these songs as other than progressive, recall that this album was recorded in 1970, when progressive rock had yet to be truly defined.  This song starts out as rock, a youth protest song.  Then it transitions to the son's point of view, all mellow and laid back.<br />I haven't decided whether \\"For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me\\" is a lament that Ian Anderson didn't get to go on a moon walk, or whether he is lamenting the expenditure of time and money it took to get to the moon.  The middle verse seems to be envious, but the surrounding verses seem a bit more satirical.  Regardless of the meaning, solid song, good rock beat.<br />\\"To Cry You a Song\\" is a rock song that relies on impressionistic imagery rather than comprehendible lyrics.  No matter, the solid rock beat and the sound of the words carry the song.  Perhaps Ian Anderson was taking lessons from Jon Anderson regarding the use of word sounds rather than meaning to form lyrics.<br />\\"A Time for Everything\\" is much more straight forward.  It's a song about thinking you have time for everything, when in fact if you waste time, you have time for nothing.  An amazing lesson from a group of guys that were very young in 1970.<br />The next song is a standard for Tull, recognized by Tull fans everywhere.  \\"Teacher\\" is a story about lessons learned in ways other than the classroom; solid rock with enough unusual elements to be borderline progressive.  Anderson's flute is a key part of this song.<br />Sooner or later Tull has to talk to the audience.  \\"Play in Time\\" is Tull, and especially Ian Anderson, talking to his audience.  The song says that while he's trying to find a style, he's also trying to reach people with his music.  Are you listening?  This song is another rocking number; and that flute.<br />The last song is great.  The song seems to be more about society, and the constraints of society, versus the story about the singer and Sossity that the song initially seems to be.  The song appears to say that society tries to make people conform to a norm, putting up appearances for appearance's sake, and because of the way society behaves, it behaves as a woman.  The style is mellow and laid back, a very strong folk-renaissance sound (though I've sometimes had a hard time defining exactly what that means, which means it's likely sort of progressive).<br />The music here is Jethro Tullat their non-commercial, classic, best.  The sound has a raw exuberance to it.  The lyrics run from plain to completely cryptic.  The music goes from a hard-edged rock to acoustic folk.  In short, this is the Tull we remember from their incredibly creative early days.  If you are a fan of Tull's early music, this CD is a must have.  If you object to the later release with the \\"extras\\" on it, look for the previous version without.  Awesome music worth 5 stars.at their non-commercial, classic, best.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|If you have seen the movie or DVD there is little I can tell you that you don't already know.  The second time you view this movie you will spot the details that you should have caught the first time around.  For example the girl running around the birds in the park, but the birds don't fly away and there are others as well that catch now that you know what to look for in the movie.  But beyond all that the movie is a heart felt and teaches us all by giving us insight to a world none of us can image on our own.  In the end the story comes to a dynamic summation point, the meanling of life, love.  For without it life is meanlingless and sanity is merely a dream.
B00008I8IF|5.0|Like some of the previous reviews I always considered the Jayhawks my secret, always willing to share them with others only to look like a genius when the listener was floored by the band.  I discovered &quot;Hollywood Town Hall&quot; while working for the many Big Box mass retailers in the early 90's and have always kept track of their careers in the last 10 years.  <BR>This collection has all the familar traits that make the Jayhawks a truly great band.  Nothing ground-breaking, only great songs with harmonies and sounds that you can't help but listen to again and again.<BR>The Bonus disc shows the band in its true element, playing live and sounding as fresh and new as any of the bands currently residing in the Top Tens.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I first heard Norah Jones on an NPR interview around the time this CD was released. I was instantly attracted to her music and ran out and purchased the CD. Like the majority of music that I like, I never dreamed that this kind of music would get any radio play, much less multiple Grammys. In a way, I wish she would not have received all the Grammys because all too often, winners of that dubious award are the direct result of record company hype and \\"pay for play.\\" Contrary to what many of the Amazon critics insinuate, I don't believe that Norah's popularity is a result of those practices. Now that she has her awards, people are compelled to make ridiculous comparisons to other artists and in general, take cheap shots at her.<br />If you buy music based upon how many Grammy's the artists received, are prone to buying CD's base upon one song that you heard or you are a stylistic purist., you should stay clear of \\"Come Away with Me.\\"  It is incomprehensible that people like this purchased this CD, then turned around and bashed it. How stupid is that?<br />I have a collection of probably a thousand CD's, records and tapes that covers a broad spectrum of styles, but I find it so unnecessary to compare Norah to anyone else. I don't think her voice is extraordinary - she couldn't begin to compete with the vocal gymnastics of her contemporaries. Her choice of songs are exclusively low-key - no barn-burners. She can't easily be classified - she's not exactly country, jazz or whatever. These facts have prompted a lot of vicious attacks against her, but I consider them her strengths. Without mentioning names, I find the vocal gymnastics of her contemporaries tiresome. And although I appreciate the artists who can occasionally raise the roof, choosing not to do that on this set makes it an incredibly romantic listen from beginning to end. In my opinion, her voice is well-suited to a well chosen set of songs. The musicians backing her are exquisite and complimentary to her vocals. The combined result is a near masterpiece. My only question is, how will she follow up this gem?
B000002WMH|5.0|Everybody has their favourite Elvis period, but my hands down favourite has to be the 50's Elvis.<br />It was way before the drugs and hollywood took over, and there's a particular honesty in the tracks that he would never be able to record again.  At least, not until the late 60's right after the Singer Special was aired.<br />This set has everything that was subsequently released on the \\"Sunrise\\" 2CD set, and then some.  It includes all of his singles up until his army days, a live disc of the early material, and his Christmas album, which I never fail to bring out around Xmas time.<br />The 60's, and 70's box sets are fine, but this one takes the prize.
B00008I8IF|4.0|The Jayhawks have had so many different lineups and sounds over the years that it almost seems like different bands struggling to amalgamate.<br />This lineup/sound does hearken back to the &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass&quot; era, which is a great thing, but may prove a little confusing to people who got onto the Jayhawks train with their excellent releases &quot;Sound of Lies&quot; or &quot;Smile.&quot;  All these albums are terrific, of course, but I wouldn't mind seeing the Jayhawks strike a balance between the lush sounds of &quot;Smile&quot; and the spare folk-rock of &quot;Rainy Day Music.&quot;<br />That said, &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; is an excellent album -- &quot;Tailspin&quot; being the true standout.  But &quot;Stumbling Through the Dark,&quot; along with &quot;Eyes of Sarajane&quot; and &quot;Angelyne&quot; are as good as any songs the Jayhawks have ever recorded, simply transcendant folk/rock/pop in the best CSNY, Byrds, Eagles, Emmylou Harris traditions.  Even in comparison to those greats, and with hints of brit-pop sounds like Travis thrown in the mix, the Jayhawks do have a unique and wonderful sound, primarily through the songcraftsmanship and singing of Gary Louris, a true talent.<br />With one of the finest voices in rock today, the Jayhawks can do very little wrong as long as Louris remains at the forefront.  The second half of the album does trail off -- &quot;Don't Let the World Get in Your Way&quot; plods unmemorably and cops a faux-Beatles feel that seems out of place; &quot;You Look so Young&quot; is a rare Louris misstep, and sounds like a handful of other (better) Jayhawks tunes; &quot;Will I see you in Heaven&quot; is also missing something, though maybe it is simply out of place, not able to operate as the de-facto album closer.<br />Regardless of quibbles, every track on the album is listenable, and most are classics.  Simply put, the Jayhawks are better than most of the bands working today, and certainly make their own road musically, which is laudable.  I hope they find a sonic balance between this release and &quot;Smile&quot; one day (I confess to imagining what &quot;Angelyne&quot; and &quot;Tailspin&quot; would sound like with an electric guitar and a piano), but if they keep putting out excellent albums like &quot;Rainy Day Music,&quot; they'll certainly continue standing head and shoulders above the rest of the crowd.
B000005IS1|5.0|Regardless of what era of punk you claim to love, respect must be paid to certain albums that acted as both precursors and spiritual godfathers to \\"punk\\".<br />Although Iggy and the Stooges would go on to achieve much more notoriety (for their incendiary live act, if nothing else), and the MC5 itself recruited Jon Landau to produce their subsequent albums (\\"High Time\\", \\"Back In The U.S.A.\\"), nothing will ever diminish the stature of this LP in the annals of Rock 'N' Roll history.  It's an essential album to anybody's collection.<br />I always loved KISS for their use of Detroit LOUDNESS and FUZZINESS in their music, but this is the source; raunchy, blues based rock that is still messily produced, and still manages to strike a nerve more than 30 years later.  \\"Ramblin' Rose\\", \\"Rama Lama Fa Fa Fa\\", \\"Kick Out The Jams\\", and their cover of Sun Ra's \\"Starship\\" rock out to the fullest, kicking out the jams and everything else in sight.<br />An album that all other albums are to be judged by.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|I was lured into 'Strictly Ballroom' by an 'indie-phile' friend of mine, and I was certain it was going to be one long boring Ingmar Bergman film of crane shots, brimming with double meaning and intellectual purpose. But the film opens documentary-style, with ballroom queen Pat Thompson so distraught over her son's improvisational dance steps she actually breaks down in sobs saying, \\"I keep asking myself why? Where did I go wrong as a mother?!!\\" I've never laughed so hard five minutes into a movie in my life. From that moment on the film is a marvelous, slightly over-the-top, ode to the art and serious business of professional ballroom dancing (a form of entertainment I admit I was only aware of from the biannual PBS specials hosted by Ron Montez and the late great Juliet Prowse). But director Baz Luhrmann (whom I think went a bit too MTV for the film 'Moulin Rouge') gets the balance of comedy and Hollywood musical spoof just right here. The film goes from mock-docudrama to a charming, hotheaded-boy-meets-shy-awkward-girl story flawlessly, and even though there are sizable cliches' throughout the film (awkward girl is ostracized by society for no apparent reason; all accomplished dancers seem to be sprayed with a layer of tanning lacquer and gunite), the film nips each one of them in the bud quickly, and you end up not minding the swan-like transformation of leading lady Tara Morice. (Her casting in the film is inspired as she is not a conventional Hollywood 'hottie,' but uniquely beautiful just the same.) The dancing is marvelous, especially the final 'paso doble' with Morice and Paul Mercurio (who seems to be channeling Jose Greco and Bob Fosse). Don't live your life in fear- check this one out.
6304806442|3.0|I view this film as being on the same level as \\"High Fidelity\\"; far too calculating to be brilliant, but so well-crafted, I can't help liking it.<br />There's no question it's disturbing, and given the subject matter, it's not surprising it wasn't the big hit Mirimax's marketing department expected it to be.  But all that aside, some solid performances by Ewan MacGregor, Robert Carlyle, and Kevin McKidd.<br />It's endlessly quotable, which lends to its perpetual cult status, and despite being a bit long, is definitely worth a rental.
B00007AJF8|5.0|Everything about this movie was great, the cast, plot, tone...etc.  The all-start cast consisted of John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, and Catherine Keener.  The main character, Cusack, is a struggling puppeteer married to Diaz, a pet-obsessed woman with frizzy hair.  One day, Cusack takes a job as a filer in a bazaar firm that is on only half of a floor, and he discovers a portal into actor, John Malcovich's, brain.  All the while, Cusack has been obsessed with Catherine Keener's character, Maxine, and so has Cusack's wife, Diaz.  Things get confusing for everyone, Diaz thinks she's a transexual after being in Malcovich's head, Maxine is only inlove with Diaz while she is in Malcovich, and Cusack will do anything to win over Maxine including tying up his wife and leaving her in a monkey's cage.  Very weird idea for a film, definately not mainstream, but I really enjoyed it.  It's genius.
0783240236|4.0|I'm a big Hitchcock fan, and \\"Marnie\\" is my favorite Hitchcock movie. I like Tippie Hedren. She is the typical cold, blonde heroine that Hitchcock favored, but my, what subtext! As an actress, it's what you want to achieve, especially on screen: the sense that there is much going on under the surface that is never vocalized. The scene that the other reviewers talk about in their reviews--the gas explosion with the flashes of Tippie's face, for example--are kind of campy now, but even through the campiness there is a sense of unease. There are many scenes in this movie that are just gems of tension and subtext. The scenes between Tippie and the mother, between Tippie and Suzanne Pleshette: the actresses and the screenwriters don't make the obvious choices and that's part of what makes these movies so fun to watch again and again. The scene with the woman birder in the cafe is very enjoyable. The minor characters in these old movies have major impact. While not a great movie, it is worth having in your collection if you enjoy tension, great acting and writing, and a few giggles at the melodrama.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album shows the kind of undeniable talent that SOAD have. This album rings with a rarely seen viscosity, and truly rocks from beginning to end. Some of the songs are very politically based,(think Rage Against the MAchine) which only adds to the meaning of Serj's lyrics. The only song i could have done without is probably 36, but it isnt atrocious or anything. Personal favorites include: Innervision, Roulette, Ego Brain, Streamline, MR. Jack (very cool), and i-e-a-i-a-i-o.
B00000JMQC|4.0|\\"Return to Oz\\" has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. I believe I like it more or just as well as the original \\"Wizard of Oz.\\" Though no one can be as great of a Dorothy than Judy Garland, a young Fairuza Balk stars in her first movie(recognized in such movies as The Craft, Almost Famous, The Waterboy, etc.) she captures Dorothy's image beautifully. In this sequel, Dorothy escapes a strange clinic type place to get rid of her bad dreams. On her second journey back to Oz she is accompanied by Belinda a talking chicken. Only this time the merry ol' land of Oz has been destroyed by the Gnome King who has captured Dorothy's best friend from Oz, the scare crow. She is on a mission with new friends Tic-Toc, Jack, and a couch/moose head-brought to life by magic dust she steals from an evil princess who collects beautiful womens' heads, and traps Dorothy in there intending on getting her head as well. New things are introduced to this movie such as rollers, the Gnome King, the evil Princess (can't remember her name at the moment). The ONLY thing this movie lacked was the realistic features of the tin man, scare crow, and lion, they look VERY different than they do in the Wizard of Oz. Overall i recommend it to anyone. Though some scenes may be disturbing for very young children.
B000002UAO|5.0|Any album with In my life,Michelle,Nowhere man,Norweigen wood and Girl on it is a five star album...A classic album that lives up to it's great reputation!
B00008AY3L|2.0|I can't believe he did such an awful album, let me just summarise the main points:<BR>1) It is much, much overproduced!! Hey Ben, you don't need to put 120 instruments in a song to make it nice! You should know that, most of you albums were great because you were bare, essential, just you and your guitar! This is the secret, not putting synthesizers, 2 guitars, piano, horns, and whatever else you can think of!<BR>2) It is a completely caothic album: it's as if old Ben wanted to try as many musical styles as possible. He ranges from Reggae (the first, and the only good, song)to Funky, to Soul. Some of these songs could have been done by Prince or by Lenny Kravitz, only they did this 10 years ago, not now!<BR>3)Even when, on songs like \\"she's only happy in the sun\\" he starts well, with a quiet guitar,he then changes style and adds too many instruments or a rock rythm.<BR>4)All songs are not bad, they are just useless, no real melodic achievement<br />I gave it 2 stars just because of the first song, which has got nothing to do with the rest of the album but is great.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is an amazing cd. You just listen to a few of the songs and your addicted. It might not be as hardcore as Hybrid Theory but still one of the best cd's i've heard in a long time
B00008J4P5|5.0|I bought this CD less than a week ago, and have already played it about a hundred times!  I actually had to take it out of my car CD player cuz the tunes were running thru my head all the time! I don't want to repeat all of the previous comments about how great &quot;Elephant&quot; is- suffice to say that it will go down as one of the best CDs of the year, as well as one of the best rock albums of all time. I also love the fact that this wonderful wall of sound was recorded on low-tech equipment with a simple guitar and drums arrangement. If you love rock, punk and blues, you will want this CD.
B00008J4P5|5.0|So, how do you follow up a platinum breakthrough album, arguably the biggest break through of 2002?  With &quot;Elephant&quot;, of course, and nothing else.  This album is not only the best White Stripes albums (yes i have all four) but their most ambitious, intricate, and fun albums to date.  Instead of one sound on the album, (such as the self titled debut, where its mostly hard riffed &quot;organized noise&quot;, or de stijl, with mostly soft, melodic pop/rock music white-stripes style) this one balances it all out.  Ball and Biscuit has to be the best part of the whole CD, as no other artist would have the balls (haha no pun intended) to put something liek this out.  This album sounded like it came straight from 30 years ago, more so than any of their other albums.  They recorded it in a studio predating the beatles- and you can tell.  no wonder critics like it- this album is liek taking a journey back in time.  This album is going to be on every single critic's top-10 lists this year, and i will be very happy and stunned if their is an album that comes close this year.  &quot;The Headphoen Masterpiece&quot; by Cody ChesnuTT comes close, but nothing can beat this album so far in terms of quality, ambition, and overall achievement in this album.
B00005A8GY|3.0|I have this SACD and the CD.  I believe they went back to the 24 bit PCM master rather than to the original analog tapes.  The other SACDs and DVD-Audio discs I own absolutely blow the CD and vinyl versions out of the water.  This SACD sounds identical to the regular CD.  <br />This is probably Santana's best album, and one of my 10 favorite rock albums.  The music is 5 star all the way.  It was an album which altered the path and perception of rock music.  It, and the public, deserve better.  Buy the CD, save the extra 5 to 10 bucks and be happy until it is done properly.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is truly an album which must speak for itself. I can only say that it is extremely rare for me to find a band which I love as much and as quickly as I love Evanescence. The only other album that ranks as high in terms of sheer beauty (for me) is A Perfect Circle's Mer de Noms. With Mer de Noms, I loved perhaps 85% of the tracks. With Evanescence's Fallen, I find myself enjoying every song on the album, from start to finish, even Bring Me To Life which I have heard FAR too many times now. This album has no low points. The varied style throughout the album is refreshing, and especially well-executed are piano/guitar pieces, a duo which I find to be quite complementary. Amy Lee's gorgeous voice is often accompanied by violins and choral arrangements which fit the album impossibly well. Highlights of the album which I would recommend are My Immortal, Tourniquet, and Whisper. These three songs exemplify what else can be found on the album. Those who didn't necessarily like Bring Me To Life or are just plain sick of hearing it (understandably) should give this album a look regardless, since Bring Me To Life does not represent any of the other songs on the album (and is in fact very Linkin Park-like, much to my disdain). It's difficult to think of artists which Evanescence can be compared to, primarily because of their unique sound. The best example to be drawn is between Tori Amos and Amy Lee. Both have beautiful voices and piano talent. If the two were ever to duet, it would be an auditory treat.
B00005A8GY|3.0|I have this album on SACD, vinyl, DTS and CD.  This SACD sounds identical to the regular CD.  The other SACDs and DVD-Audio discs I own absolutely blow the CD and vinyl versions out of the water.  To me, it sounds like they went back to the 24 bit/44.1k PCM master used to make the CD rather than to the original analog tapes.  No matter how good the SACD format can sound, it cannot produce sound better than the source material.  Garbage in, garbage out!    The DTS version is also not worth purchasing as they forgot the bass.  Santana's music is very dense, with tons of percussion and Santana's amazing guitar.  He is one of the Guitar Gods!  No one can get into the meaning of a note the way he can.  The bass is needed to balance and ground the music and gives it a primal feel.  It is sorely missed on the DTS version.    This is probably Santana's best album.  The music is 5 star all the way.  It, and the public, deserve better.  Buy the CD, save the extra 5 to 10 bucks and be happy until it is done properly.    To the reviewer who says \\"the SACD version blows away the CD version only if you have the right equipment,\\" I have a near audiophile HT theater system consisting of a Yamaha C-750 DVD-A/SACD player, a Harman/Kardon Signature 2.0/2.1 pre/amp coupled to HK Citation 13 main speakers (the larger precursors to Shahinian Accoustic' ARC speakers) with a Velo sub.  (Since writing this, I \\"upgraded\\" my speakers and sub to Infinity Kappa 9s with a dual 12\\" Infinity sub and Kapp 7.1 surrounds with no change of opinion.)  To me, with the right equipment, the SACD still sounds identical to the CD.
0385507755|5.0|James Frey has been getting a ton of press and hype over his debut work, and rightly deserved.  But what really matters is that this is simply a great, intricately told story of Mr. Frey taking back control of a life that he had lost to addiction.<br />Frey's memoir made me really uncomfortable at times, but it was always gripping and honest.  From not even knowing where he is at the very beginning of the book, Frey becomes fully aware of who he is by the end.  Fortunately, he never pretends to know what will happen next after rehab, only that he'll die if he ever gives up control again to his addictions.  He takes responsibility for his life, for his decisions, and for his future rather than giving up control to a higher power.  <br />If you are simply looking to whack around with the same old chapters on Don Gately, A Million Little Pieces may be beyond your scope.  However, if you are hoping to read a story that will jolt you emotionally and give you honest insight into the recovery of an addict, A Million Little Pieces is a great book.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Popular thought has it that, once a band has been going for as long as Fleetwood Mac has, they start to tread water and dry up creatively. As this CD shows, that's absolute nonsense. From the first track to the last, this is classic Mac that stands up there with the very best work that they've ever put out. The production work is both interesting and impeccable and the songcraft is superb, especially from Lindsey Buckingham. Highlights include \\"Peacekeeper\\", \\"Thrown Down\\", the title track \\"Say You Will\\" and two Lindsey Buckingham tracks \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" and the instant classic \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" (first aired on their live albumn, \\"The Dance\\". I cannot recommend this CD enough - there is no doubt that, in terms of sheer songcraft and talent, these guys are at the very top of their game. It's early in the year yet, but a possible contender for albumn of the year. Truly superb work.
B000067CPX|5.0|The Peppers burst onto the scene in the mid to late 80's with a fusion of reggae, ska, post-punk and rock. Some didn't understand them at first, many have copied or emulated them since. They continue to be innovators, and this CD is no exception. If they've mellowed a little after a decade and a half, they've also been amazingly open about their personal growth and journeys. They've survived the death of a founding member and heroin addiction of other key members of the band, and continue to produce music that is strong, melodic, erotic, beautiful, pulsating, multi-layered, exciting, mesmerizing. ...Considering how little the Peppers have ever tried to conform to anything or any one, it's fascinating to watch their growth as individuals and musicians. If you've really been following the Peppers, don't miss this CD.
B00005M91K|5.0|Has no plot.  Simply incredible scenic shots the world around. Also looks at various cultures and their mannerisms.  Splendid work! Nice soundtrack too!  Highly recommended.

B000002H33|5.0|Lets see how can I describe this album, I would say it is a sonic masterpiece. Its not like anything else Metallica has ever done. All the songs on this release are strong and well crafted. There's everything from heavy and melody on this release. Good (not great) guitar work. The drumming is great Lars really did a good job on this album (too bad I think he's lost that fire he had back in '86). The bass work however is very fine. This was Cliff Burton's final album before he was killed in a bus accident. I feel that Metallica has been lacking ever since he passed on. But anyway back to the album, from the intro to &quot;Battery&quot; to the closing notes of &quot;Damage, Inc&quot;, Metallica really out did their selves. Each song on the album flows well together and makes for a pleasent listen from start to finish. As with every album there's always a track or you that is a highlight. For me those tracks are &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Disposable Heros&quot;. Both are pretty deep tracks and you have to listen to the lyrics. Anyway hopefully my review has done this album justice. If you want a rocking album buy Master Of Puppets...

B00006IR5S|5.0|This is a great album. It's a lot better then the Sorcerer's Stone Soundtrack. There are many new great themes. There are also kind of remixes of old themes. \\"Harrys Woundrous World\\" comes back with a different ending. \\"Fawkes The Pheonix\\" is a great theme. It repeats in some other songs. I like \\"Cornish Pixies\\" which is a very exiting song. Here are my reviews of the songs:<BR>  1.Prolouge Book II and Escape From The Dursleys: It is a lot more exiting then the Sorcerers Stone verson of the Prolouge. It has the part where Ron comes with the flying car.4/5 3:31<BR>  2.Fawkes The Pheonix: This is the best new theme. It is great. The middle part is great right before the evil part of the song. It has a four note beginning reminding you that this is a great song.5/5 3:45<BR>  3. The Chamber Of Secrets: It sounds a little like the beginning of Fawkes The Pheonix. It is one of the evil themes on the album.4/5 3:49<BR>  4. Gildoroy Lockhart: A silly theme. It's not that great.3/5 2:05<BR>  5. The Flying Car: I love this one. It's very exiting. It's my favorite tied with \\"Deuling The Basilisk\\".5/5 4:08<BR>  6. Knockturn Alley: It's very short. It goes to the Diagon Alley theme after a minute. 4/5 1:47<BR>  7. Introducing Colin: Another very short one. It is mostly the part when Hermionie feels bad because Malfoy called her a mudblood.3/5 1:49<BR>  8.The Deuling Club: This is o.k. At some points it gets exiting then it dies down. 3/5 4:08<BR>  9.Dobby The House Elf: I like this. It really reminds you of Dobby.4/5 3:27<BR> 10.The Spiders: Very exiting. It ends like the flying car. It's great after they play the main theme once.4/5 4:32<BR> 11.Mouning Mytle: This is a ghost type of theme. It reminds you of all the ghousts in the school.3/5 2:05<BR> 12.Meeting Aragog: Not as exiting as The Spiders but it's o.k.3/5 3:18<BR> 13.Fawkes Is Reborn: This is played a lot in the movie. It also plays the Fawkes theme more then Fawkes The Pheonix does. 4/5 3:19<BR> 14.Meeting Tom Riddle:Sort of boring. At the end it gets to the loud Voldemort theme.3/5 3:38<BR> 15.Cornish Pixies: I love this. Although The Flying Keys on Socerers Stone was a little better. This one is more exiting.5/5 2:13<BR> 16.Polyjuice Potion: The beginning is really when Harry first enters Knockturn Alley. Then it goes to when Harry turns into Goyle.4/5 3:52<BR> 17.Cakes For Crabbe And Goyle: It's funny at the beginning. Then it gets evil when Justin and Headless Nick get petrified.4/5 3:30<BR> 18.Deuling The Basilisk: This is great. As I said before it is tied with The Flying Car as my favorite song.5/5 5:02<BR> 19.Reunion Of Friends: I love this one. This is like a longer version of Leaving Hogwarts on the Sorcerers Stone. There is more of a big ending at the end though.5/5 5:08<BR> 20.Harry's Woundrous World: The same as Sorcerers Stone till the end of the song. I think it's a little better.5/5 5:02<BR>  Total Time:70:17
B00005U18E|5.0|Hugh Grant is perrrrfectly cast! Sly, charming, and full of ego. Another EXCELLENT British comedy that's both hillarious and uplifting. Leaving the theatre after BJD left me with that great post-movie feeling of joy, the same feeling I had when I left \\"Bend It Like Beckham,\\" \\"Ameli\\" and \\"Men With Brooms\\". <br />Zellweger does a convincing job of capturing the loveable quirks of title character Bridget. Certainly a movie I could watch over, and over, and over agian! Witty, charming and hillarious!
B00005JKZT|5.0|I liked how the movie began with Gandalf fighting the Balrog and ended with the victory over the Uruk-Hai at Helms Deep with the help of Gandalf and the Rohirrim led by Theoden's nephew.<br />The fellowship was already broken up with the fall of Gandalf, Boromir's death, and the capture of the two young hobbits by an evil group of orcs and Uruk-Hai.  Frodo and Sam began their lonely quest until a very creepy, hateful, evil creature showed up at night.  His name is Gollum. But his real name was Smeagol, who was once a hobbit of the Stoor tribe.  He claimed  the ring after he had killed his cousin, Deagol over 500 years ago.  Frodo made him his servant who could guide them to Mordor, a barren wasteland of volcanos, fire, sewage, and ugly buildings such as the tower of Barad-dur.<br />Trouble comes to Rohan once Saruman put its king Theoden under his control so as to render ineffective to rule or to do anything for that matter.  Grima Wormtongue was Theoden's advisor to the king as well as a paid spy and servant to the evil Saruman at Isengard, which is not that far from Rohan.  Saruman wants to take the ring for himself and to become the master of Middle Earth, but Gandalf, coming clean from victory over the Balrog, is stronger than he and that he released the king from Saruman, thereby frustrating his plans of control.  It's not over yet, for Saruman had amass an army of ugly, brutal Uruk-Hai who could destroy Rohan and the rest of Middle Earth.  It's genocide in the extreme.<br />I could go on and on about this powerful, but disturbing movie.  Time wouldn't allow me to do so. I cannot wait to see it on video and I'm aching to see the extended version as well.  Thanks, Peter Jackson, for bringing Tolkien's books to life.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|The success of this unquestionably charming film lies in its casting. Hugh Grant, Toni Collett and Nicholas Hoult are each obscenely talented in their own right and posess a spot-on grasp of their characters. Hoult's portrayal of the awkward and introspective Marcus is particularly sharp: a shy and authentic misfit whose only real human connection is with his emotionally unbalanced mother. That is of course until he meets Will (Hugh Grant) an emotionally unavailable thirty something that has no time in his life for the troubles of a young boy.  Grant's character is an entertaining cross between the devilishly sly character he played in Bridget Jones and the adorable geek he played in Notting Hill. <br />What's wonderfully rare about this film is that it's touching without being the least bit overdone or precious. Through dealing with issues brought up by Marcus' mothers attempted suicide and Grant's relationship with his deceased father and issues of emotional isolation the film holds on to its sense of humor and charm. 'About a Boy' never tries to be what its not and as a result turns out to be a paradoxically heartbreaking and hilarious film that you'll want to watch over and over.<br />Badly Drawn Boy's terrific soundtrack and the direction of Paul and Chris Weitz (perhaps most famous for the `American Pie' Trilogy) are also part of the film's strong points.

B00008GKEG|5.0|Even if you spent the money and bought the Beatles Anthology on VHS when it came out a few years ago, buy it on DVD now. It is worth every penny.<BR>Of course, the picture quality is great. This is the format in which you will get the very best video of the old concert footage and interviews.<BR>However, what really blew me away about the set is the audio. It is truly fantastic. Hearing all those great songs in 5.1 surround sound sends shivers up your spine. Take 'I Am the Walrus' for example. In the original stereo recording, the song switches to 'fake' stereo half way through due to recording limitations of the time. However, in this remix, the song is presented in 5.1 all the way through. Fantastic!!<BR>Every song has been remixed in the same careful way.<BR>The features on the 5th dics are very interesting and entertaining. The only thing I would have wished for would have been more concert footage, perhaps the entire Shea Stadium or Washington concerts. Still, seeing Paul, George and Ringo playing together for what turned out to be the last time was very moving.<BR>All in all, this is a great set. Buy it today, and you won't be disapointed!!

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Hey, I'm 47 years old. I remember the night I heard this album the first time. I had such goose bumps! I'd seen the album in the racks but, never heard them before that night. &quot;Who ARE these guys?&quot; I thought. <BR>What can I say? I STILL get goose bumps listening to this album 25 years later! Has it been equaled? No. Nothing has come close. There have been contenders but, nothing has reached the heights this band ( this album in particular ) has attained. My favorite ( besides ALL of them ) onm this album? &quot;I'm the One&quot; hands down! Eddie's playing is absolutely dizzying! Roth's yelps, whoops and overdose of testosterone are a killer. I have thousands of MP3's, CD's etc;<BR>Nothing has been played more than this album. Nothing. Sure, you can listen to a few bands over and over but, it never quite equals the thrill as when you heard it the first time does it? Van Halen's 1st album does. Everytime. 1978 was a great summer with Van Halen playing every night and being on the beach every day. I saw them in 1978 ( met Roth before the show ) and in 1981 ( I met Eddie then ). The show in 1978 should have been on film. I had NEVER seen anything like it. A true rock, sonic onslaught of showmanship and virtuosity. This album captures that same energy. If you have never bought this album then what on earth are you waiting for?

B00008PW3Q|5.0|It has been over a decade since a new I added a CD of \\"new\\" Fleetwood Mac music to my collection.  Well worth the wait for these 18 songs.  Stevie Nicks is without a doubt my favorite female vocalist of all time.  There is some true classic Fleetwood Mac on this CD.  Buckingham and Nicks marry their vocals along with some awesome bass guitar riffs from John McVie and the drums of Mick Fleetwood.  The tracks \\"Silver Girl,\\" \\"Peacekeeper,\\" \\"Miranda\\" will have you listening to this CD time and time again.  Your fans miss you Christine McVie.  \\"Say You Will\\". . . Thank You Fleetwood Mac for this  treasure.
B000089RVX|5.0|No matter what kind of music you dig, no one could possibly Evanescence.  Their songs are a mix of rock, yet you hear other instruments like the piano.  Amy's vocals will blow you away.  Bring me to life is just one of the many songs that'll make you go to sleep with your headphones on.  Take my word for it, buying this cd will be one of the best things you could possibly do.  Or at least let your friends burn you a copy:)

0064471837|2.0|I honestly have no idea why so many people liked this book. I saw how many great reviews it got, and decided to try it out, almost positive that I would love it. Wow, was I wrong!<br />The biggest problem of all is the author's writing. This book has more intervals than I can count where I really had very little idea of what was going on, and I was extremely bored reading it. It's true that Garth Nix had a new and intriguing idea about death- the bells of Abhorsen were very neat, and the contrast between Ancelstierre- which is very much like a modern land- verses the Old Kingdom, where death walks freely- was different. If only the author had actually explained it all with decent writing and a good plot, I might have liked the book.<br />I can't even say whether I think that the characters are dull or not, just because they were barely even characters. I didn't think that Sabriel even had a personality. I nicknamed her the Ice Queen, because that's just what she was- cold and unfeeling. The author tried to throw in some evidence about why she might be this way, that her father was never around and that Sabriel never knew her mother. However, then she'd have these emotional outbursts at different intervals, making the reader think that she is an emotional person. That was very confusing.<br />The character of Mogget, who I nicknamed maggot, was strange, too. He's Sabriel's friend, or is he? Does he want to protect her, like he tries to during scenes where Sabriel battles death creatures, or does he want to kill her, like he tried to after she crashed the Paperwing? That wasn't even explained. Pretty contradicting material, if you ask me.<br />The romance between Sabriel and Touchstone (odd name, I know) at the end was fake and forced. I try to ignore it because that was what made me decide to write this review, to warn other readers. I haven't read Lirael or Abhorsen, and you'd have to pay me to do so.<br />There was also some material in this book that didn't fit the plot of the story at all, meaning it wasn't necessary nor was it really appropriate. At one point the author describes Sabriel's breasts, and when Sabriel meets Touchstone, hey! The man is naked, and she doesn't mind taking a few peeks. Not really apt for the audience.<br />I'm not going to lie to you- I really don't feel that this book should be recommended to anyone. The only scrap of a good thing I can say about it is that the idea of crossing into the dead, and the nine gates, is an interesting one. However, I still don't understand many things because the author was so vague about it. I still don't really know what a Moridcant or a Shadow Hand is. It was almost as if he expected you to know everything about the dead world. Gee, sorry to disappoint.<br />I can't see why so many people rave about this book. Either they like to read about confusing topics that true, are unusual and interesting, though clearly undeveloped, or I was missing something as I read.he plot of the story at all, meaning it wasn't necessary nor was it really appropriate.

B00008PW3Q|4.0|This album is truly great! &quot;Say You Will&quot; is a blend of all the sounds from the past albums rolled up into one brand new work.<BR>I think of Tango in the Night and Tusk a lot while listening to a lot of Lindsey's songs on here. <BR> Stevie's songs are just classic here. Smile At You is one you probably have heard before if you follow the old Stevie &quot;demo-stuff&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; is a lot like &quot;The Tower&quot;.<BR> I thought there would be more &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; chemistry, but what they present is really great! The stage performences of some of these songs will be absolutly great!<BR> ENJOY, EVERYONE!
0321146530|5.0|Let me say first off that I agree with much that Kent Beck has to say: 1. Testing should be done along with the coding. 2. Use regression tests to be confident of making changes. 3. In many ways testing can be used as documentation since it is much more definitive than specification documents. 4. Testing should be used to have the client sign off on a product. In reading the book I learned the specifics of how tests are designed in TDD. It seems reasonable and I am going to make a conscious effort at designing my tests in the way suggested.<br />Where I disagree is in the use of the tests to drive software design. In the first part of the book, which I think is the most important part, a very good coding problem is analyzed - it is realistic, limited in scope and far from trivial. I followed along until I reached a point where things stopped making sense.  I skipped ahead to see where things were headed and then things became clear.<br />What is being advocated is a type of bottom up design approach. This may work for some. It may even be that the book faithfully reproduced Beck's reasoning process. It does not work for me. I first have to see the larger picture, what he refers to as the &quot;metaphor.&quot; The whole thing would have been much clearer to me if at the beginning I was told that one approach to summing money in different currencies would be to use an array to store the information but that instead the implementation would create a list similar to how things are done in LISP.<br />I urge the reader to judge for him/herself. Like I said this is a good example to go through. I even learned some things about more advanced uses of object oriented programming. As for software design I am going to stick with dataflow diagrams. They are still the best tool that I know of for putting together software, UML notwithstanding.
B000063JZQ|5.0|A powerful and nuanced production. Simply the best film version, hands down. No staginess, no stiffness, Polanski delivers the essential Macbeth. Forget all that mumbo-jumob about Tate-Manson, this version stands completely on its own as a stunning film version of Shakespeare's work.
0156027321|5.0|I've been a poorly misguided soul, quick to judge, quick to cast negative thoughts, an arrogant seller of fool's gold, an evil-doer in all respects. Please, is there any forgiveness? This book is simply amazing. The ending pieces it all together and has absolutely changed me in a manner like no other! The ending is amazing, and the poetry is complete. I wish that all divinations be provided upon this book!
B000001F3C|4.0|\\"War\\" was a landmark album for u2 in 1983 and for me, it was their first \\"great\\" album with more to come.  The raw energy that u2 brought to every song on \\"War\\" was amazing.  With Bono's soaring voice and insightful lyrics, Edge's rousing guitar playing, Larry's cadent-like drums, and Adam's bass laying the foundation, this album provided many memorable moments which allow you to delve deep into the songs and rediscover them time and again.  \\"War\\" is a perfect example that demonstrates the u2 experience is not complete unless seeing it live. <BR> <BR>\\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" sets the standard for all future politically-driven rock songs, a timeless anthem about the troubles in the group's home country.  Although it sounds even better live (check out \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\"), this hard-hitting song is one of my favorite opening tracks to any album.  While recording it at the studio, to get the drums to boom properly, the band recorded them under a staircase behind the receptionist's desk.<br />My second favorite tune on the album, of course, is \\"New Year's Day,\\" an amazing song in which Bono's singing (\\"I'll be with you again....\\") and Edge's guitar and keyboard intertwine to produce a true classic.  However, I feel the \\"jazz-man\\" takes center stage, as Mr. Clayton provided us with one his most memorable bass lines.  If you're at one of their concerts, when the lights turn off and suddenly Adam starts playing \\"New Years Day,\\" mixed with the crowd's reaction you can't help but get chills.  <br />A couple of the other popular songs off the album included \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" and \\"Surrender.\\"  The first was a single, an upbeat tune which Bono wrote for his wife Ali during their honeymoon.  Great song with a catchy riff from the Edge.  \\"Surrender\\" is another stand out, very popular among u2 fans such as myself. <br />There are other songs that stand out to me that are not as well-known.  \\"Like a Song\\" is a roaring track \\"a-la-Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" which also discussesthe issues in Northern Ireland, as Bono declares... \\"and I won't let others live in hell, as we divide against each other, and we fight amongst ourselves.\\"  Larry Mullen really shines on this album, and I feel is one of his greatest moments to date.  I also love \\"Drowning Man,\\" a kind of guitar ballad which fits perfectly because of the incredible, soulful delivery by Bono.  I also like \\"Seconds\\" and \\"Red Light,\\" which display the incredible maturity that this punk-rock influenced band had for just being four 21-years olds who learned how to play their instruments just a few years before.<br />\\"40\\" closes everything beautifully, a perfect way to end a great album.  Extremely well delivered by the band and produced by Steve Lillywhite.  Usually Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois get all the credit for the production of u2, but Lillywhite helped the band tremendously throughout their career.  This album shot u2 into popularity, and their proceeding tour made them one of brightest bands in rock music.  \\"War\\" is  an essential part of u2's history and I would recommend it to any music fan.
0385504209|4.0|A few years ago, i actually managed to read all of Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum even though I got utterly lost several times.  The end was disappointing - all that pretension never paid off.<br />This is vastly better - a thoroughly entertaining adventure.  It starts off kind of weakly but quickly becomes engrossing. By the end, I was sorry it finished...it's the first book I've read by him but I'm going to read more.
B00008H2LB|1.0|In case if you haven't noticed by my past reviews I really don't like this band, and I never will. Maybe I would be more impressed if it was one singer doing the rapping and singing but it's 2 guys. Not to mention the fact that the singer is a whiny little punk anyway. All the songs have the same structure from what I've heard; rap verses, and whiny singing mixed with rap lined choruses. They are trying to take 2 things and make them into one (rap and rock) and I hate rap-rock, so this doesn't do it for me. The guitar playing is weak too, perhaps I have been listening to too much Opeth and my expectations for guitar playing have gone up (Opeth is some damn good music. Solid, real musicianship). If you wanna go mainstream and just listen to whatever's cool then be my guest, but these guys are still totally lame. Like I said; nothing new, nothing good.
0060523794|5.0|The first book since Lance Armstrong's &quot;It's not about the bike&quot; that I've read in two sittings. Gerstner's straightforward explanation of what it takes to initiate and sustain large-scale change is simple and honest. <br />One gets to see that there's no rocket-science here, just a common sense approach to deciding what is important for your business, making sure your people are capable of and motivated to achieve your goals, and are held accountable.<br />A must-read if you are involved in any way with organisational change.
0375823360|5.0|Pullman's moving His Dark Materials series is based on Milton's epic poem \\"Paradise Lost\\" and deals heavily with religion and metaphysics. It's not for the very young, the easily offended, the narrow minded, the faint of heart or those looking for a light,easy, preachy or moralistic children's book. These three books make you think and feel. I reccomend buying all three books at the same time, setting aside a large chunk of time, reading a summary of \\"Paradise Lost\\" and stocking up on food and facial tisse because this powerful, but  heart- breakingly melancholy series offers no closure until the third book. I think it's about 1000 pages or more in total.<BR>That said, you'll notice that while many praise this book, it's dificult to say what's it's about (notice lack of plot summary in reviews and even on back of books). Let's just say that it is set in many different worlds, some like ours, some different, and the main characters are 11 year old Lyra, 12 year old Will and 3000 year old Dust. The three books really focus on what happens to and how people deal with Dust (a sort of conscious matter) in different worlds and planes of existence. <BR>The books are definetly fantasy, not sci-fi, and those who enjoy the richness and detail of Harry Potter's world , or Tolkien's work will enjoy this one. The His Dark Materials series is much more challenging, and frankly unsettling, because it is so imbued with moral ambiguity, and moral slippages- what's right in one situation isn't right in others, etc. It may leave you questioning what and why you believe. <BR>The Dark Materials series stands out because of the mixture of romance, action, mystery, technology,legend, and lore. More than being about religion, or other worlds or rites of passage the  His Dark Materials series is about Truth. Live truthfully, question the truth, and never, ever prevent others from living truthfully. The worse thing you can ever do, the series implies, is to keep the truth from people. Keeping people in the \\"Dark\\" prevents them from enjoying life and living in the moment.<BR>I don't feel that I can adequately describe how powerful, moving or important this series is. It's absolutely consuming; it'll take you away. Read this one- you won't regret it. I'd give it an infinite number of stars if I could.
B0000024JN|4.0|The verdict is in: Licensed To Ill is juvenile, crude, misogynistic, and obnoxious.<br /><br />But then again, so is AC/DC's Back In Black. So is Guns 'N' Roses' Appetite For Destruction. And admit it, you can't get enough of those albums either.<br /><br />The crossover appeal of this album was HUGE. It blurred the lines of hiphop culture, rap, and rock 'n' roll. Licensed To Ill is also home to some of the wittiest lyrics ever, penned by a trio of white boys from NYC who dared to flip off authority figures, censors, and your parents--all the while rapping over samples of everything from Led Zeppelin to the theme from \\"Green Acres.\\" You gotta love it.<br /><br />Fight For Your Right To Party was the obvious fratboy hit, but Licensed To Ill offers much more. Check out Slow Ride, which deftly plays War's Lowrider on horns. Do your best Beavis impression while rocking out to the monster riff of No Sleep 'Till Brooklyn. Laugh yourself hoarse to the storyline of Paul Revere. Groove to the massive bass beats of Brass Monkey.<br /><br />In a decade dominated by hair bands and new wave, Licensed To Ill was and remains a real gem. Buy it.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Aside from the landmark \\"Rumours\\" this new album is the most cohesive album i've ever heard. The tracks flow together, telling the life story of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. When buying this album i'd recommend listening to the entire thing before passing judgments. I think the best tracks are the last 7. They compliment each other, vocally, musically, and lyrically. You couldn't ask for a better album from a better group. \\"Murrow\\", \\"Say You Will\\", and \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" are some of the best!
B000088E6D|1.0|Why would I buy this album, full of Frank Sinatra covers, by some guy who sings no better than a million other lounge acts?<br />If I want to hear \\"Come Fly With Me,\\" then who sings it better than Sinatra?<br />David Foster is obviously losing his grip, and his inability to produce anything recent that is relevant has produced this desperate attempt at another [poser].<br />The CD is tacky.
0385507755|5.0|A Million Little Pieces by James Frey is written with such realness that it evoked, in me, numerous physical reactions to his accounts of the emotional and physical journey through recovery. I could picture each character so vividly in my mind that I felt as if I was sitting in the room next to them as an observer or participator. This is an amazing story written in a strong take-no-prisoners voice, it's inspiring and I plan to read it over and over.
B00004W52U|5.0|OP IV ought to be the cornerstone upon which every music collection should be built upon.  I listen to less punk than I used to when I was younger, but OP IV transcends all of that.  <br />To quote them:<BR>&quot;At certain points during some shows, the reconciled world is already here, at least in that second, at that place.  Operation Ivy was very lucky to have experienced this.&quot;<br />We were the lucky ones.
0312305060|5.0|One review of this book (it appears on the back cover) states: &quot;a smashing literary tour de force and an utterly invigorating reading experience.&quot;  I couldn't possibly agree more.  &quot;The Hours&quot; is an astonishingly and exquisitely written novel, exploring many personal themes of happiness and depression.  Aside from the wonderful story and themes, Cunningham's prose is beautiful, proving that even words can be a genuine work of art.  There were several times where I had to pause and think about the paragraph I just read...the novel has that effect on you.  The story appears depressing at first, but it is actually uplifting in it's provocation of the themes.  The reader can empathize with the feelings of the characters, for I'm sure we have all had our times of dissatisfaction and longing.  I strongly reccoment this book.
B00000K3D4|5.0|i love this film i have hardly ever took it out of my video/dvd player (i have it on both) when i first watched the video i did not have a clue what it was about but i still watched it as i like to watch the people in it but now i am older i realize what it is all about i think i am the only one in the whole family who like this film because they do not like david bowie but i think he is a great singer/actor and i hope he does more films like this as i would watch them over and over again and never get board. one of the reviews i have to disaggree on because david and the music work really well in this film and i think that i would not like it as much if the songs were not in them (but i would say that because i really admire david bowies work)<BR>well i hope you find this useful seeya
B00005JLEU|5.0|Another great work from Miyazaki!
B00008I8IF|5.0|The timing of this album could not have been more perfect. I'm not talking about wartime. I'm talking about springtime. It is the perfect April album - all harmonies and depth and sadness and awe. <br />Also, &quot;Save It For A Rainy Day&quot; may well be the best-written pop song I've heard in the past 5 years. If only pop radio understood that image isn't everything, these guys would be justifiably huge.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I am totally speechless, this movie is worthy of all the hype you've ever heard; rent it, buy it, go see it whatever way you can, don't take my word, you just gotta see it!
B000000OQF|5.0|On this record, there is not a single TERRIBLE song.  Although there are a few that are OK. However, for the good songs, they certainly rock all-out!  You have your classics on there, like Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, and Sweet Child O' Mine.  However, many of the songs not releasted as singles are great too, like Mr. Brownstone and Rocket Queen.  I personally think that Rocket Queen is a great song with an awesome drum intro and excellent bass riff throughout the song..  Best Cd ever released in the 80's.  Did for rock in the 80's what Sgn't pepper did in the 60's.  just as groundbreaking!!!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|A fantastic new album that makes the 16 year wait worth it. Although it does not feature Christine McVie, this is a showcase for the immense talent of the other 4 band members.  The most radio friendly songs are Peacekeeper and the title track, Say You Will.  Other gems include Miranda, Thrown Down and Smile at You.  Definitely get this CD!!
B00008PW3O|5.0|This is a great album. Just a fabulous CD. Every cut has something to offer all Fleetwood Fans. It is about time that we get this treat.<BR> The title song is good but, wait til you hear &quot;Peacekeeper&quot;. It will send chills through your body. Get the Enhanced CD. It is worth the extra few bucks. Get this CD...you will never be sorry.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|When I saw that a movie called \\"Bloody Sunday\\" was playing at a local theater, my first thought was, \\"Oh, that's the U2 song.\\" I knew it referred to a Northern Ireland civil rights protest where shooting broke out, but the song was basically the extent of my knowledge of the event. Once I decided it would be an interesting movie to see, I tried to avoid reading anything about what happened, in an attempt to go into the film with an open mind, to be completely receptive to director Paul Greengrass's vision. I saw the movie, and left the theater shocked, saddened, enraged, and bewildered, but with the firm impression that I had seen a truly remarkable film.<br />The movie is shot documentary-style, with many quick cuts and fade-outs to black to end a scene. It took a while to get used to this modus operandi, which at times seemed choppy, disrupting the flow of the movie. But as you lose yourself in this film the style makes sense and seems less obtrusive.<br />The acting is superb, lead by James Nesbit as protest organizer Ivan Cooper. And while it is fairly certain where Greengrass believes the blame for the tragedy lies, the film at least makes an attempt to explain the scenario from the British military's point of view. But instead of merely looking to reveal \\"who started it?\\", what should be taken from this view of events is that tensions were so elevated on both sides, that it took comparatively very little action to set off large-scale and vicious reactions. Such is the madness of war, which is basically what unfolded on the streets of Derry that day...<br />Greengrass's camera leads you right into the middle of this battle, from start to finish. The results are visually and emotionally jarring; the you-are-there feeling is intense. And at the end, almost as a reward for making it through the film, you are treated to a live version of U2's famously haunting song.<br />It is a travesty that this film was not nominated for (and chosen as) Best Foreign Film at thisyear's Oscars- supposedly an airing on European TV made it ineligible. Hopefully it will be honored in some other manner. \\"Bloody Sunday\\" is far from an uplifting movie but is definitely an important one, and nothing less than a marvel of modern filmmaking.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is worth every penny I spent on it.  It is one of, if not THE best CD I've heard in a long time.  The music is very haunting and and emotional, and Amy Lee's voice is stirring and beautiful.  There are no bad tracks, I especially like Bring Me To Life and My Immortal.  My Immortal is my favorite track.  It actually brought tears to my eyes, the vocals are so emotional and very heartfelt.  I would recommend this CD to everyone.
