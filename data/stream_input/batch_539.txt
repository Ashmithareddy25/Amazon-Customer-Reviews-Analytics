0790732254|5.0|Thank you for everyone who has contributed to this interesting thread of viewer opinion. And thank you even more for the articulation exercised. <br /> <br />I suppose it must (and for all I know maybe should) be the case that even with the kind of all-round filmic brilliance which this picture exhibits there will be a percentage of the audience which simply fails to appreciate the collective work and performance. And sure enough, I was not disappointed in this case bearing that in mind. <br /> <br />I will not bother to try and top what has already been written in praise of this film, neither will I nitpick those who failed to understand and appreciate it at whatever level. I'm simply glad that filmic material of this kind is available to be viewed by anyone with interest in either the greater art and/or the subject matters covered, most especially so today, at a time when the movie industry in America at least seems determined to record newer and lower still standards from one inconsequential, pathetic and all too often just simply incompetent film release to the next. <br /> <br />Anyway, thanks again to everyone who has participated in this thread. And to those who were unable to enjoy this excellent motion picture the first time around, I extend a warm invitation to screen it once again. The study itself shall never become dated, and you never know. <br /> <br />

B000286RNY|5.0|This movie is HILARIOUS! <br />It's the first movie out of HongKong that actually had decent computer effects AND a storyline. And just for that it's worth a spot on everyone's shelf ;-D  <br /> <br />But seriously, Stephen chow's stuff never stops impressing me. His movies always have his singature level of humor and entertainment. And what's best is his artistic blend of comedy with drama. You can be laughing your head off in one second and be totally taken away by deep profound emotions in the next. And yet you won't feel like you've just changed channels or something. <br /> <br />Shaolin soccer is definitely up on his \\"best to date\\" list.
B0006L16N8|4.0|i was actually tempted to give this one 3 stars at first.  the first few listens were quite disappointing.  but it was bound to be.  coldplay was following up on one of the best modern rock albums ever made.  i knew they wouldn't equal or top \\"rush of blood to the head\\".  a band always gets more processed, tries to make it's music more \\"mainstream\\" as they get more popular.  it's a shame.  but give it a few more listens, and it does grow on you.  i promise.  there sure isn't anything else better out there right now (if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know) just don't expect it to be \\"rush\\". oh, and by the way, the \\"cross between U2 and radiohead\\" comments are absolutely correct, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. :)
1573223026|4.0|This is the story of four people who all decide to commit suicide on New Year's Eve, coincidentally pick the same spot, and what then happens to them: a washed-up TV talk show host, a middle-aged woman with a severely disabled son, a failed would-be rock star, and a rebellious teenager. They take turns narrating the story (as in Faulkner's As I Lay Dying or Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible).    Even though the book is about suicide and a very big question (is life worth it?), Hornby manages to make it laugh-out-loud funny. As I listened to this on tape, I couldn't help but laugh aloud (even in public places).    In the midst of the humor, the characters will occasionally make a remark that rings true, about what might make life worthwhile. The end result is a fun yet thoughtful book. (It does slow down occasionally but gets back on track.)    Note for those who care: this book is chocker-block full of strong language. LOTS of strong language. Just so you know.
B00005AAFS|4.0|Even though they released their debut in 1996, Rammstein weren't very well known in the States until their \\"Sehnsucht\\" album spawned the hit single \\"Du Hast\\" in 1998. And with \\"Mutter,\\" this German, industrial-metal group returned to try to reclaim some of that glory.. It doesn't have a song which has the potential to be the next \\"Du Hast,\\" but it's still a very solid album.<br /><br />Although there are a couple tracks (the title track and \\"Nebel\\") on the mellower side, and \\"Mein Herz Brennt\\" features keyboards which almost sound like a church organ, most of \\"Mutter\\" is still quite heavy. Till Lindemann's snarls out the vocals over a rhythm section which is about as powerful as they come in industrial metal. \\"Feuer frei!\\" and \\"Spieluhr\\" both begin with twinkling keyboards, but they are flattened when the hefty, churning riffs kick in, and \\"Adios\\" has extra chunky riffs alongside some heavy, sexually charged panting. And, like \\"Sehnsucht\\" (and most of Rammstein's other albums), \\"Mutter\\" is heavy, but also very catchy and rhythmic. \\"Zwitter,\\" and \\"Rein raus\\" are fairly fast chuggers, and my personal favorite track here, \\"Links 234,\\" has a super catchy, toe-tapping rhythm.<br /><br />As said before, \\"Mutter\\" doesn't have another \\"Du Hast,\\" so it probably won't ever be as popular as \\"Sehnsucht.\\" But it sure should be! This album is brimming with potential and there isn't a single bad song on here. Rammstein may not be breaking down and musical walls, and this album shouldn't win over any non-fans, but it will definitely solidify and satisfy a strong fan base.
B0000399WI|5.0|I've been asked if this film is a true story because many people thought it was when it camer out. It's so beautifully written that it does seem like a true story, and i wish it was, but it's not i think. It's too perfect. And that old prison where they filmed this, is allegedly haunted, and the show ghosthunters went there to investiagte paranormal acitivy, and they had the props on display like the hole where andy crawled out, and the room where brooks committed suicide in. And the place actually turned out to have some activity. But back to the film. What i like most about this movie is it captures both sides of prison life, both the bad and good. I guess most people have this notion that prison is all about violence, rape, and assualting day and night. But there is also another side, which is loyalty, friendship, and believe it or not some good times, especially for lifers who come to get use to the place and make friends. The saddest part, well there are two, but it was extremely sad to me when they released brooks. You really understood why he felt the way that he did. No family, no friends, not much understanding of life on the outside in such times, because he was in prison for 50 years. And times change. Not only that, just imagine having to leave your friends, and the life you knew, and being a senior citizen. To me, that was so depressing, especially after he freed his bird who he took care of since it was a baby. I'm sure he felt very homesick to say the least after he was released because that was his home, his life for 50 years. It's like now what? A crap job, and live in some halfway house till the day he died, lonely, and afraid, and sad. That part has always been a tearjerker for me. And the second saddest part, is when the evil warden, had that kid shot because he had information that could free andy. That made me sick, and he had the nerve to talk about God and the bible, and what's right and wrong, and then he has a witness murdered in cold blood. Sadistic, hypocrit SOB. The acting is outstanding, especially tim robbins and morgan freeman. They had that chemistry you dont see too often in films. I can't say enough about this film, and the ending is the best ending to any movie in film history, when andy escapes, and has the information to take the wardens laundered money, and get him busted by the fbi at the same time. Vengence is always sweet. So once again, this is the best prison movie ever made.
B000AM4PBS|1.0|\\"Friends\\" was never a good show and not one of the ten seasons has made me laugh once. You would be wasting your money buying this set for $200+. Skip it.
B00005JNY4|5.0|Even though the story line is an old one the u/w photography <br /> <br />is sensational,we stayed until the final line of the credits. <br /> <br />We are SCUBA divers and were impressed with the u/w stuff.The <br /> <br />actors/actresses did a crediable job and were believable in  <br /> <br /> their .roles.
B000000Y27|5.0|<br />I hate technique for the sake of technique.  No worries here though.  On his breakout release (and still his most popular), Wes Montgomery demonstrated dazzling technique but always kept it in service of the melody.  This is one of the most consistently excellent, assured, and relentlessly listenable jazz albums of all time. <br /> <br />\\"Incredible Jazz Guitar\\" may seem an audacious title but one lesson will reveal that to just be truth in advertising.  Any fan of the electric guitar, whether a jazz fan or not, needs to own this CD.  Mr. Montgomery has a relaxed picking style that accomplishes the rare feat of being technically superb and highly accessible at the same time.   <br /> <br />Forty five years after its release, \\"Incredible Jazz Guitar\\" is bound to make a strong impression on any guitarist who hears it for the first time.  But it will move any fan of great music.
B00000K0DQ|3.0|I first saw \\"Dead Man Walking\\" on television several years ago, and I didn't like it very much at all. I recently re-watched it because a friend of mine had expressed an interest in seeing it and because I have been doing sort of an informal study of redemption in the arts.   <br /> I disagree with those who say that Dead Man Walking presents an objective view. Just look who is in front of and behind the camera: Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn- three of the Poster-People of the Hollywood Far-Left. The focus of the film is clearly Sister Helen Prejean, (the film is based upon her book of the same name.) Indeed, the best part about \\"Dead Man Walking\\" is watching her wander quite unwittingly into a storm of hate and all-consuming sadness when she started out merely wanting to give a dying man some comfort in his final days, regardless of the means and motive of his death.  <br />Still, because she is so obviously against Matthew Poncelet's execution she can definitely not be considered a neutral party. <br />  <br />It is certainly true that the victim's families are given a powerful voice, especially that of Clyde Percy, played with seething perfection by R. Lee Ermey. <br /> <br />While Sean Penn's performance, (like most of his work) is brilliant, I can say unequivocally that Matthew Poncelet remains a thoroughly dislikable human-being to the very end, he only disavows his Nazi beliefs when it becomes clear that they are a contributing factor to his execution.   Worse, his belated confession of already well-established guilt is the very definition of \\"too little, too late\\", this is only compounded when he says \\"I think killin' is wrong, whether it's me or y'all, or the government that's doin' it.\\" He follows that astoundingly hypocritical statement with an address to the victims, \\"I hope my death brings you some peace.\\"   Doesn't anyone remember that he is simply repeating Prejean's words, and that those words were prompted by Pocelet's defiant declarationthat he \\"had a few words for Clyde Percy\\".  Worse still is the presentation of the execution itself, the images of Poncelet's death are juxtaposed with images of his crime, which I am assuming (given the rest of the film, and the POVs of its creators) is meant to suggest some sort of perverse similarity between the two. It had the opposite effect on me, seeing those two events set side-by-side convinced me beyond doubt that the right course was taken. I really believe that if rape and double-murder, and a separate rape and attempted double-murder do not make you deserving of the death penalty then nothing will. <br />  <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is reinvented more R&B soulful album. Using the same chemistry of previous albums: Charmbracelet and Rainbow. She hit the stores with something totally freshed and getting back  her career (that wasn't lost by the way)  <br /> <br />1. It's Like That featuring Jermaine Dupree and Fatman Scoop 10/10 I'm unbelievable thrilled about this song. I love the beat and the lyric is really a hot tamale. The song was the 1st single and reached poorly on Billboard at N17. So what's the point? This song is a prelude for 2nd single and most fantastic song on this album. This song was made from JD's So So Def Stylin' and Atlanta bass did all. The remix is also recomendable. <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together 1.000/10 A true hit. I love the vocals and the song. Totally soulful hit. Reached N1 and make Mariah one of the most popular artists at 2005. The song was another joint hit of Jermaine Dupree and So So Def. He really got issues on it. Really good The remix is good. <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off - 10/10 Another JD big hit! This song was the 3rd cut and really got me trippin' on it. This song is relevant on the album and provide a new rythim on Mariah career making her sound perfect in a long time. The remix is one of a kind. <br /> <br />4. Mine Again 10/10 amazing! unspoken! this show Mariah is an amazing performer! Love the fact that this song is really original Mariah!  <br /> <br />5.  Say Something featuring Snoop Doog and Pharrel 10/10 - Originally 1st single until it was leaked. Then it was proposed as the 4th single but Get Your Number got his place. This song is really a hit song of the Neptunes but it ain't as good as JD collaboration. The Neptunes had some problem with Mariah I guess. The arrangement are good but sound so low and weak though Snoop make it real up The Neptunes make it sound like Gwen or Britney makin' it with a hugh voice. Object On That! <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night - 10/10 Anothe hit single and proposed to be the 1st cut until it faded away.The song is a really good Kanye hot style. The voice is really harmonious and catchy. Recomendable <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number featuring Jermaine Dupree a.k.a. Nelly  8/10 Fourth single. I love the song but it ain't so hot as the others. JD really got a Nelly issue. The song is really caughtivaty and succesfully bubble gum! But it doesn't make me feel good as previous tracks.  <br /> <br />8. One And Only featuring Twista - 10/10 Good song. Love the chorus and rap! Amazing Hook and most of all it's a love story on an R&B beat off da guetto style! Love the continue as So Lonely (One And Only Pt. 2) <br /> <br />9. Circles - 10/10 Good Rythim! Good Voice! Unforgettable Track! This is pure R&B and givin' it a Roberta Flack Style! My own perception is this is a good track maybe one of the best. <br /> <br />10. Your Girl - 8/10 Mariah low her vocal in a part and raise it to heaven! this song is a pure free R&B style catchy parts and givin' it a good style on it. Mariah did it fine the production low the skills and sofocate her voice under too many music projection. <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew 8/10 New ballad over all great. Unlike it first then get used to it. It's probably a filler but really amazing. <br /> <br />12. To The Floor featuring *REAL* NELLY 7.5/10 Nelly really him getting off a new NEPTUNE TRACK Good thing until The sound again make her sound phunny and let her voice out of touch! Nelly sounds weirdo also and Mariah looks like Mandy Moore makin' high notes. Not so good. <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride 10/10 This is a good one. Really lovely lyric and deep vocals Recomendable at all. <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird 10/10 A new Mariah gospel track, Amazing vocals and full soul of heart on it.  <br /> <br />15. Don't Forget About Us (New Single) 10/10 Better than anything Mariah make people cry on it. New style New MC gettin' crowd love what she do passionaly. <br /> <br />16. Secret Love (Bonus Track Japan) - 10/10 Hot Swizz Beat Song! Amazingly catchyand frustrating unbelievable. <br /> <br />17. Sprung (UK) 10/10 good lyric better than some songs on this album <br /> <br /> <br />
1594830819|4.0|This was my first Baldacci but it wont be my last.  Besides being a very sexy man he is also a wonderful thriller writer!  For some his plots and characters might be a bit complicated, but I loved the political intrigue and complex plotting.  The plot revolves around a group of four Washington DC men who are experts in some way but don't fit in with the DC culture.  They call themselfs the Camel Club.  The leader goes by the nickname \\"Oliver Stone\\".  The group has weekly meetings concerning different political conspiracies they believe are taking place and what they should do about them.  Then one night th Camel Club witness the execution of a CIA agent in the middle of the Potomac River.  This crew of misfits is suddenly in for more than they bargained for! a real live conspiracy.  The plot takes awhile to develop, but it is well worth paying attention to for the great payoff.
B000059XUP|1.0|This second in the popular CROW series is mean-spirited, ugly, and ultimately a vile tale of revenge.  Vincent Perez takes over the hero role, and he just doesn't have the presence or charisma to make us feel anything for him, in spite of the horrible way he and his young son were brutally murdered.  Director Tim Pope has managed to make this foggy, oppressive LA the ugliest one has ever seen the city.  The villains (including an over the top Iggy Pop and an underused Thomas Jane) are especially vile but even so, their deaths are staged so absurdly gruesome, one doesn't feel the empathy for Perez as much as we did with Brandon Lee in the first Crow.  Mia Kirshner is beautiful, but her character is wasted, and Richard Brooks as head villain Judah is simply not that strong of a screen presence to further villainize his character.  Too mean spirited and vile to be considered entertaining.
B0000025D0|5.0|<br />After \\"Born To Run\\" vaulted Bruce Springsteen to national stardom, \\"Darkness...\\" capitalized on that success and built on it.  This was an album of anthemic songs waiting to be screamed out with fists pumping by thousands in jammed arenas.  The lyrics are still dark but less Dylanesque than on previous albums and the music more muscular.  The E Street Band really comes into its own here.  Max Weinberg's drumming had never been this assured and powerful. <br /> <br />\\"Badlands\\" is a heck of a way to start the album.  Springsteen had never rocked this hard before.  The lyrics started a theme that would continue throughout the album, of being young, disenfranchised, and angry, but vowing to fight your way out of it.  Most importantly, the music provides the lyrics a sense of urgency and passion that really renders the song anthemic.  This has the effect of underscoring the song with a feeling of hope, rather than despair.   <br /> <br />\\"Adam Raised a Cain\\" then comes on with possibly even more fervor than \\"Badlands\\".  \\"Something in the Night\\" is so evocative you would swear Sringsteen is one of the people he's singing about.  Similarly, on \\"Racing in the Street\\", an absolutely stunning ballad of longing for something better, Springsteen is completely convincing in relating to the downtrodden without ever coming across as cliched or patronizing.   <br /> <br />\\"Promised Land\\" is just as ferocious and anthemic as \\"Badlands\\", \\"Streets of Fire\\" just as angry and vitriolic as \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\".  This is one of those albums that grabs hold of you from the start and never lets go until the final notes.   <br /> <br />\\"Darkness...\\" was the masterpiece that Springsteen's first three albums were leading up to.  Although he has produced a lot of excellent work since then, none have matched this.  This was his pinnacle.
1594200696|5.0|For the reviewer who pines for life as it was 50 years ago, actually in 1959, William Strunk Jr.'s Elements of Style, which had gone out of print at that point, was revised by a former student of Strunk's, E.B. White.  This 2005 revision takes nothing away from the book, but reconsiders the original from a design perspective.  As far as I'm concerned, the cloth cover, the 57 color illustrations, the high-quality printing, only add to the pure pleasure of reading or re-reading this book.
B0007OCG56|3.0|Spanglish was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni among others.  It is the story of a California family that hires a Mexican cleaning lady with no knowledge of English that uses her daughter as an interpreter.  The more time she spends with the family the more she finds out about the problems they are facing.  Consequently, she becomes fond of her employers and wishes to help them bridge their differences, until she falls in love with the man of the family and the woman of the family falls in love with her daughter....   <br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great, with the exception of Tea Leoni who does a wonderful job of portraying the psychotic wife), while the dialogues and the plot are just average.   <br />The characters are, overall, weak, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. the alcoholic mother in law and the two kids) <br />Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...   <br />Nevertheless, it should be noted that Paz Vega's potential to make it big in Hollywood is definitely there. <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.  <br />No masterpiece here... 3 Stars <br />
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This movie is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched.  It is well directed, great plot, easy to follow while retains its complexity. <br /> <br />Giving that this is a subtil movie, I didn't really feel like watching a subtil movie.  It's easy-to-read text and not too much. <br /> <br />If you can get over the annoying part in the first 5 min of the movie, you will enjoy it a great deal.  Maybe the actor acted so well that I found him annoying at the begining. <br /> <br />At the end, you can't help but feel bad for the guy and want the best for him. <br /> <br />Well delivered on all aspects.
B00004W221|5.0|Director David Anspaugh who brought us the brilliant HOOSIERS has another winner in this heartwarming true story of RUDY, a young man whose dream of playing for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish reached a heartfelt fruition in his last game as a senior.  Sean Astin was an inspired choice to play the title role; as he proved later in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, Astin is the kind of man who would be the kid brother or best friend to other men; or the shy, introverted boyfriend to a really nice girl.  Astin is also an actor who embellishes his roles with a rare intimacy and credibility that works especially well in a film like this.  He is ably supported by Jon Favreau as his rotund best friend; Charles S. Dutton who is marvelous as the maintenance man who serves as a surrogate coach/father to Rudy; and Lili Taylor as his girlfriend.  RUDY pushes all the right emotional buttons, but it is also a very upbeat and uplifting story of one young man's temerity and patience.
B000654Z2I|2.0|I'll have to dissent from the consensus view of this album as an essential classic and take the lumps that go with bucking critical mass.<br /><br />I know that it is heresy to point out the drawbacks of albums like \\"Tago Mago,\\" but I have to be honest.<br /><br />While it certainly is adventurous, and even original, it shares more ground with \\"musique concrete\\" than with the hallucinatory proto-funk that would emerge on the (in my opinion) less indulgent and far better-conceived \\"Ege Bamyasi.\\"<br /><br />Too often on \\"Tago Mago\\" it seems like someone hit record with a head full of acid but very little direction otherwise.  I DO like to listen to this, when I'm in the right mood -- there IS a good record buried in here somewhere.  As far as accessability and even musicality go however, pass on this one.  All its good elements are distilled more successfully on \\"Ege Bamyasi\\" (and the even more smoothed-out sonic blanket, \\"Future Days\\").  Going straight to \\"Ege Bamyasi\\" will spare you from the apoplectic sputtering and gurgling vocal exorcisms and poorly aimed keyboard tinkling that weigh down way too much of Tago Mago.
B00030590I|5.0|Hero, brings to the screen the story of a warrior who rids the realm of three assassins who threaten the emperor's life. The story gets more complicated as things are not as they seem in China... <br />The film combines romance, drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind! <br />Moreover, the fascinating culture and traditions of China are presented very well in the film. <br />The plot is excellent and opens a window into the mysterious Orient. <br />Furthermore, shot on location it provides for some amazing scenery.  <br />Needless to say, Jet Li, Tony Leung Chui Wai, Maggie Cheung, Ziyi Zhang, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100%!  Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again. <br />The setting, the dialogues, the music and the costumes are all wonderful! <br />Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth owning, yet alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History, and especially for Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts. <br />Strongly recommended along with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and The House of Flying Daggers, to those with a soft spot for all things Chinese. <br />
0920668372|4.0|You know who \\"crawls\\" into their baby's bedroom? A mother who has just sat through a hiccupy bedtime of tearful \\"no wanna sleep!\\"  <br /> <br />You crawl to stay under the radar of the crib rails, so that you can see if the kiddo is well and asleep before you begin your breathless wonder and adoration routine.  <br /> <br />While I admit, I rarely read this book to my little ones as I hate to broach the subject of mommy's passing on (my 5 year old already asks if she'll be an orphan) the book is a gem. My mom gave it to me, and one day, I'll give it to my children.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Another great album from Opeth. Its got a great mixture of death and progressive metal to it. Kind of reminds me of listening to a mixture of Dream Theater,Tool and death metal. Its one of those cds that makes you listen over an over again with all the changes in each song. If you liked any of their previous cd's then get this one. Well worth it.
0061015725|5.0|This was a great story.  I loved the visual that was drawn up in the words so that we could envision this creature coming after us.  It was fantastic.
B00003CY6M|5.0|An outstanding romantic comedy, Serendipity, brings to the screen the love story of two young people; an American man and a British woman who meet in NY by chance only to keep on bumping into each other before they make it work out.  It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.    John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.    The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!  In short, Serendipity is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!
B00009NH5W|5.0|If you like artists with mature songwriting and mature vocal and musical arrangements, this is definitely the album to check out.  Outside the realm of genre limitation, TTD just makes music, but he doesn't just perform different genres for versatility; For him, it comes completely from the heart.  It's easy to see that he has a genuine love for music in general.  TTD gets better and better with time.  Anyone who's a fan can attest to that.  Not a single bad song on the album.  This is all well-crafted, precisely thought-out, and well-executed music.  FANTASTIC ALBUM!
0064400557|5.0|I think that everyone should read Charlottes Web. It is such a sweet and simple story. I havent met a kid yet who hasnt loved this story. You will never forget the charectors in this book.
B0006L16N8|5.0|First and fore most, if you are after an album that is the same as A Rush of Blood to the Head, then you have gone in the wrong frame mind into this album... In my opinion, Parachutes was an incredible album, one of the best debut's albums ever, A rush of blood to the head, was a polished parachutes, and X & Y sees Coldplay evolve. This album is very different, but yet remarkably similar to A rush of blood to the head. Songs like Low, Twisted Logic, White Shadows and X & Y would have felt out of place on previous albums, but songs like Fix You, Speed of Sound, A message, What if?, Square one, would have felt right at home. When you look at it, its like a best of album i guess. <br /> <br />Now, you may have read many other critics on this website that say X & Y isnt as good as previous albums... but dont mistaken. If you are after a more mature Coldplay, a Coldplay with more emotion, a Coldplay that is more 'rockier' than previously, a more evolved Coldplay than you will absoutely love X & Y. Those who say that it isnt as good as previous albums, arent suggesting that X & Y is bad, its just that people are now starting to realise just how great A Rush of Blood to the Head is.  <br /> <br />Good music is good music, and this is definitely good music. Go buy the album, you wont be dissapointed.
0451527046|5.0|Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island is known and thought of as being a children's classic. And that's fair--the book is a great one for a young boy or girl; it's not too long, has wonderfully vibrant characters, and is filled with action and adventure. I mean, it has pirates! <br /> <br />But Treasure Island is also a book that can be read when you're older with no less fun or excitement. Also, if you've never read this classic, you'll learn by reading it exactly why it's such a big part of literary culture, why everyone seems to know at least a little bit about it. Long John Silver is one of the most enjoyable villains in all literature, Jim and his allies are all heroic and likable, and the action sequences are gripping. <br /> <br />In the particular edition that I recently read, there was an essay following the story that talked about how Stevenson and Treasure Island are not really respected in the academic community because Treasure Island is, at heart, just an adventure story. But let's not discount \\"just an adventure story\\"--great stories are really the reason why people continue to write books today, and Treasure Island is not \\"just an adventure story\\"--it is a *wonderful* adventure story that will thrill readers, young and old. Treasure Island is well worth the read for adults, and also a perfect choice for reading to your children.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|With shades of \\"Ed Wood\\", the deluxe edition of \\"Batman Begins\\" is also another recent recall. Rumour has it that due to some rights issues with the comic book included in the set, the whole she-bang is being discontinued and recalled, suggesting this set won't be re-released for some time, and minus the comic book. That said, those interested should act fast. The movie is near flawless as we all know, and this would make for a great collectors item for any Bat-fan.
B0000029DD|5.0|If a picture is worth a thousand words, then surely this album is simply indescribable.  I'm A Perfect Circle and Tool fan, because their music exploited angst.  This is the only album, however, that I could listen to over and over and over again in one sitting.  Someone said this would be their 'Island Album.'  Right now, I can't think of any other album that can possibly top this one either.    Listen to \\"Lover, You Should Have Come Over\\"; then listen to John Mayer's \\"St. Patrick's Day,\\" written a decade later.  You should realize the genius of Buckley then.  Listen to \\"Last Goodbye,\\" and realize what an incredible voice capable of 3.5 octaves sounds like.  If that doesn't convince you, sing along to \\"Eternal Life,\\" and the inevitable phenom known as death becomes trivial, almost inviting.  The whole album's so real, so genuine, so heartfelt, so soulful yet it's all rock at the basis of it all.  It's not shy pop, nor aggressive punk.  It's a simple yet sophisticated depiction of controlled screams of restrained torment.    I don't know how he does it, but it's as if Buckley was sitting here, knowing all too well about the emotions you try so hard to restrain.  And he stretches out his fingers, strums a simple chord, and invites you to sing along; because he's been there, too, so confused and repressed, yet filled with aspirations that you long to realize.    Knowing that Buckley is no longer with us to continue to inspire us, my only thought after every song in this album is,    there was a voice unkind in the back of my mind  saying if only....
B00019GG1M|5.0|Hello.  All I can say about this album is that it's the only CD that has gotten me through the hardest time in my life....when I was deployed in the army.  Someone sent it to me as a gift during the deployment and I absolutely fell in love with the album. <br />I love this album and you will too!! <br />Christina
B000286RKW|5.0|These are such cheesy extras. What's up with the music that plays when the menu is on the screen? What is that? Scorcese or a couple of the leads couldn't do a proper commentary? This movie deserves the Criterion treatment. Also, couldn't they get some older, more experienced directors to comment on it? I like Richard Linklater's movies, but come on. I heard Woody Allen loves Goodfellas and Brian DePalma called it the greatest film of the nineties. I know Goodfellas deserves more than this pathetic slipshod reissue.Wanna know the best thing about this \\"special edition\\"? The best thing is I don't have to turn the disc over anymore to watch the whole movie. The next best thing is that this edition has a cop/robber commentary with Henry Hill and Ed MacDonald, the DA who got him into the witness protection program and prosecuted Jimmy and Paulie. They do the commentary together. Hill and Macdonald have a history, so the conversation really flows. I have to admit it is a great extra.It's worth the price just to hear Henry's and Macdonald's comments on all the scenes, real life characters and actors in the film from both sides of the street. MacDonald also gives some good background on how the FBI went after all these guys.
B0007VZ9DK|3.0|After the excellent Goodfellas Scorcese, DeNiro and Pesci team up again for another crime movie. <br />Don't get your hopes up too much. 'Casino' is certainly not a bad movie but there are some points that don't work in it's advantage. <br /> <br />Length: The real cut is almost 3 hours long and a little too long. Especially since there are now real points of rest. There is almost always a monologue by DeNiro and Pesci (occasionaly someone else) or the characters talk. There is never a period of action or silence. Sometimes the talk is almost a parody of gangstermovies. <br /> <br />The music is good however, ranging from the 50s to 80s and very out there and part of the music. <br /> <br />The acting is ok. Pesci is the best, deNiro his usual self but never super like in Raging Bull. Sharon Stone got an oscar nomination for her part of the wife of deNiro who keeps sliding down and down. But it's not a superpart and there have to have been better roles that year. More than 4 anyway. <br /> <br />For the Scorcese fan this movie is ok. But it's long, a little too long and too fast so it might exhaust you. <br /> <br /> <br />
0804106304|5.0|So much praise has been heaped upon \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" that I doubt I could add anything else to entice would-be readers to get their hands on this book.  But I will say this: Tan's powerful, beautiful novel was one of several books that inspired me to become a writer.  What more can I say?
1556154844|5.0|This is an outstandingly good book about software construction techniques that lead to a sound, robust product. It starts with simple things like naming conventions, function layout and commenting methods, but covers the whole software development cycle of design, programming and quality assurance. Although it gives plenty of source code examples in several different programming languages, these are always short and easy to follow even for 'language foreigners'. Source code examples are only used to illustrate more general, important points, rather than specific implementation details. The author is careful not to force his personal style on you - which would be rather foolish considering the many 'religious' issues covered (naming conventions anyone? ;) ) - but presents his opinions supported by sound arguments that'll make even skeptics reconsider. The text is an easy read compared to more technical books and is covered with lots of very amusing short stories that highlight key points.  <br />This book will be a great aid in keeping your and your coworkers' mental health while programming in a team under a merciless deadline. <br />If you are at all serious about programming - buy this book!
B000007T1M|5.0|One of their BEST albums!!!! Had to buy it again cause' I lost my original one. Can't have that now. =)
0060836253|3.0|Even mediocre Gaiman is good reading, so by that analysis, this is a good book.  However, American Gods is not Neil Gaiman's best work.  Start with Season of Mists which features most of the same characters from American Gods in a similar plot.  Other good places to start if you've never read any Gaiman include Good Omens and/or Smoke & Mirrors (short fiction.)<br /><br />One thing about American Gods that amused me quite a bit was the fact that large chunks of it are set in my home state of Wisconsin.  It's hard to tell if Gaiman did field research here or if he got most of his information from an atlas and Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion.  Dairy cows, cranberries and the Packers are never mentioned, so that's a knock against authenticity, but the main character eats a pasty in northern Wisconsin so that makes up for things.<br /><br />I listened to this book on CD and so, a few remarks on that...  George Guidall does his customarily amazing job with the read.  Well articulated with great inflection, Guidall's voice has the texture of a cinematic voice over.  He does convincing accents for all the different gods in the story.<br /><br />Definitly worth a read/listen.  I just wouldn't put it at the top of my list.
0679422714|3.0|I'm a well-educated Chinese American with no personal experience with the subject matter.  I found the book to be well written with a lot of details about the regional customs and surroundings, which is what I'm interested in.  But frankly there is too much editorializing.  It's a very biased book.    <br /> <br />The author, Jung Chang, will quote stuff from Mao or his old chums, and then in the final sentence she paraphrases the quotes in a blatantly negative and biased way.  It's a little annoying, like she thinks the readers can't interpret the quotes themselves and that we're stupid enough to buy her biased re-interpretation wholesale.    <br /> <br />Chang's basically making a case that Mao was an ordinary opportunist who just happened to be in the right place at the right time and was propped up by the Russian Communists.  Well yes, to some extent it's true.  However, the guy must have had something going for him to get to where he got and to achieve what he achieved, whether or not one agrees with his motives and methods.   <br /> <br />Chang is literarily pushy and a bit conniving, a bit too interested in building her own case.   She and her husband are to be lauded for their dedication to what seems to be meticulous research and reporting.  However, Chang's aggressive revisionist and one-sided interpretations detract from the merits of their work.
B0007ZEO4G|4.0|As mentioned by many others , the expectations were heavy for Burn to be a bad record -this opinion being based primarily upon the absence of Ian Gillian.  However this was not the case at all as this represents some very solid playing and kept things moving for DP as well as heavy,blues based rock in general.  The title track is powerful and sucks you right in so the album takes little time to develop. For whatever reason, lots of people don't seem to realize that this track features both Coverdale and Hughes as lead singers which adds to what is already a musically solid track. Of course having two lead singers in a band is always a recipe for trouble since its well known that lead singers in general suffer from massive ego problems however, Coverdale was so young at this stage and new to the big leagues, that I'm sure he was more than happy to benefit from the presence of Hughes who had been gigging with Trapeze. Of course it didn't take long for ego wars to break out. <br /> <br />Blackmore's playing is great and the only thing I could say negative about it (and this is a small thing) is that its very dry and unaffected by even standard types of studio processing (reverb) but that was characteristic of his style and part of the reason that he is admired by most guitarists since he never hides behind trickery of any sort. He is proof that a strat through a Marshall is more than enough to get great tone. Mistreated is a great blues tune and gives us a great look at Coverdale's abilities so please make sure you give this one some attention. <br />Sail Away is also another vocally impressive track which has some  similarity (chords early in the song) to Blackmore's Rainbow \\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\" track.  <br /> <br />If you are into british rock at all then pick this one up. Its a keeper and for budding guitarists you would do well to sit down and cop these licks but its much more than just a guitar album.  <br />Very solid playing, great vocals, and proof thatjust because your lead singers quits doesn't mean thats the end of the story.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Most true blue fans know this show backwards and forwards. However there are new fans discovering this Jem of a Show everyday and here are a few reasons why you should invest in this series. First of all $200 dollars for all ten seasons is too good of a deal to pass up, not to mention the collectors box looks great. This show treated the sets as characters much like the bar in Cheers was a character in itself. The coffee shop (Central Perk) was a vivid, evolving, living set filled with color and art by well known New York artists. Friends' ongoing jokes and plot lines helped make its ten year run one big thread about six people and the lives they'd built. Friends was one of the finest thanks to the colorful detailed sets, the great A-list guest, the fantastic writing, the many catchphrases that has become a part of our everyday vocabulary, and the inspiring cast of six wonderful actors that as a group made something very special. Shows like this may never come around again. The situation comedy is now evolving into shows like Aressted Development, Desperate Houswives, and My Name Is Earl which are folowing the M*A*S*H format minus the laugh track. This show along with a few others such as Cheers, Seinfeld, Frasier,were tuly the pinnacal of the situation comedy. As it had been done since the days of The Honeymooners and I Love Lucy. The sitcom, with a set on a soundstage is becoming an extinct medium and until another show comes around to revive the medium, much as The Cosby Show did when it debuted. I think that Friends will be remembered as one of the last great situation comedies of all time.
B000005RTG|2.0|If you take an axe  , change the handle, then later change the blade, is it still the same axe ?  This is how I've always felt about Come Taste The Band. Coverdale and Hughes were brought in and did a great job on Burn but then Blackmore quit his own band to form Rainbow leaving us with a new configuration of DP that added  hotshot Tommy Bolin on guitar formerly of Zephyr and Billy Cobham. Sure Bolin was an ace guitarist on his own and he brought that style to DP with good results so none could ever suggest that he was trying to sound like Blackmore.  But despite Bolin's unique style there is something missing from this record. The songs had definite energy but they could have used lots more development , better bridges, and transitions which is something at which Blackmore was very good. I think the group was banking heavily on Bolin's playing and hoped that people wouldn't notice the merely average songs on this record. Tommy was good but he didn't bring in the compositional knowledge that Blackmore had. <br /> <br />Bolin was always the  \\"lead guy\\" and was encouraged to experiment and take extended solos (especially with Cobham) but even killer solo technique doesn't cover for average tunes. Perhaps if Bolin had had more experience as a song writer then things would have been different. Even in James Gang they extended songs with long jams and the compostions became more accommodating of that direction. I've always felt that Bolin was far better off with his own band playing things to showcase his guitar playing <br />and he did in fact do this but his untimely death capped that.  <br /> <br />Finally A bit of trivia here - Bolin used the Electro Harmonix Memory Man effect on this record which at that time was one of the coolest effects boxes you could find. So cool in fact that \\"The Edge\\" of U2 later based his whole sound on it. (Whether or not he was Bolin fan is unknown). Electro Harmonix also re-released the effect just a couple of years ago to bring it a whole new generation of guitarists.

0783225482|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable dark comedies ever made. It has witty dialogue, eye-popping special effects and computer graphics and a superb cast - Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis, Goldie Hahn and Isabella Rosselini. On DVD, it looks better than ever. It contains the Spanish-dubbed version of the film as well as the French-dubbed edition. It also features a featurette on the making of the movie and discussions among the lead actors. <br /> <br />obert Zemecki's 1992 dark comedy, Death Becomes Her, is a satirical surreal story that uses computer graphics, special effects and a superb script to tell the story of a mortician Earnest (Bruce Willis)who is caught in the middle of a bitter feud between two vain, catty women who have always stolen each other's boyfriend and contested their beauty. When Madelyn(Streep) discovers the secret to eternal youth - an expensive potion owned by a witch - Isabella Rossalini- she gets more than she bargained for when she is killed and now is an undead woman. As luck would have it, her rival Helen also took the potion and is also killed. The two must now set aside their enmity and rely on the mortiican to constantly beautify them. The movie is a classic but not very fondly remembered for some reason. I have always enjoyed it and have watched it several times on cable. I think this is Bruce Willi's greatest foray into comedy as is Goldie Hahns and Meryl Streep. A must have for fans of the leading actors who find themselves in a sticky situation. The story, funny and outrageous though it may be, is a satirical take on America's fatal obscession with beauty and undying youth. Women today get boob jobs, botox, and age-reducing products to maintain a semblance of youth. We all want to cheat death in our own way but it amounts to nothing because, naturally, you lose your soul and lose track of the more important things- just living a full happy life, like Ernest was able to do. He remarried and had kids. His life was complete while Helen andMadelyn must spend the rest of eternity with each other and making sure their bodies don't deteriorate. And that ending is hilarious.
6305252572|4.0|Of course the movie deserves 4 stars, however I wish I could say the same for the DVD. What does it take for DVD company to release each DVD enhanced for 16x9 TVs? Nothing!  <br /> <br />Recently I bought a SONY BRAVIA 32 INCH display and I have a collection of over 600 Dvds. I learned now about \\"Enhanced for 16x9 TVs\\" and how important it is, I did not care about it or even know about it since I own a standard TV, however all my Dvds are Region 1 and in widescreen, I never buy fullscreen Dvds. So I did an inventory on my collection and realized the following:  <br /> <br />Out of 600+ Dvds, 42 are NOT enhanced for 16x9 TVs and they really look horrible when I played them on my PC. Anyway, according to my inventory.  <br />THE FOLLOWING MOVIES / COMPANY HAVE FAILED TO PRODUCE ANAMORPHIC OR 16X9 WIDESCREEN and I hope that these company will release them in the near future so that we can enjoy them on our TVs. <br /> <br />MGM: <br /> <br />Runaway Train <br />Graduate <br />No Way Out <br />Prizzi's Honor <br />FX <br />Shallow Grave <br />Thief <br />House Of Games <br />Dead Man Walking <br />Misery <br />The Eye Of The Needle <br />Overboard <br /> <br />PARAMOUNT: <br /> <br />Private Parts <br />48 Hrs <br />Coming To America <br />Primal Fear <br />The Ghost And The Darkness <br />Breakdown <br /> <br />UNIVERSAL: <br /> <br />Day Of The Jackal <br />Psycho (AVAILABLE IN THE RECENT HITCHCOCK'S BOXSET AS ANAMORPHIC) <br />Vertigo (AVAILABLE IN THE RECENT HITCHCOCK'S BOXSET AS ANAMORPHIC) <br />The Game <br /> <br />FOX: <br /> <br />Abyss (I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT MY 2-DISC IS NOT ANAMORPHIC, NOR IS THE LATEST DIGIPACK EDITION) <br />Raising Arizona <br />The Edge <br />Great Expectations <br />Rising Sun <br />The Ref <br />Romancing The Stone <br />The Jewel Of The Nile <br /> <br />ARTISAN: <br /> <br />House Of The Spirits <br />The Last Seduction <br />The Last Emperor <br />The Eagle Has Landed <br />Bound <br /> <br />PS: PLEASE ARTISAN, INSTEAD OF RELEASING 'BASIC INSTINCT' FOR THE 4TH TIME, WHICH MOST HAVE ALMOST THE SAME SPECIFICATIONS, CONSIDER RELEASING SOME MORE INTERESTING MOVIES WITH PROPER ATTENTION SUCH AS THOSE MENTIONED ABOVE. <br /> <br />TOUCHSTONE / WALT DISNEY: <br /> <br />Ransom <br />What About Bob? <br /> <br />PS: IT IS A GREAT NEWS THAT TOUCHSTONE ARE RELEASING 'ENEMY OF THE STATE', CRIMSON TIDE' AND 'CON AIR' IN EXTENDED UNRATED EDITIONS ON MAY 16.

6305949980|5.0|Tim Burton's 90's classic \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" used state-of-the-art stop-motion animation/claymation and told the story of Jack Skellington, a bony skeleton King of Halloween Land who orders the kidnap of Santa Claus from Christmas Land in order that he delivers toys for Christmas for one year. The satire within the story can be appreciated by adults. It seems to criticize the commercialism of Christmas and in its twisted way, it works. It is also the story of Jack Skellington's dreams and he is seen as a kind of hero by the end of the movie. For its time, this movie was innovative. The creations - ghouls, goblis, skeletons, witches, vampires and other Halloween creatures- come to life vividly on screenand appear as human as the rest of us. The songs are very catchy. Who can forget Skellington belting out \\"What's this ?\\" and the chorus song \\"This Is Halloween\\". Tim Burton pulls all the stops and this bizarre film is nothing unusual for the bleak style that Burton's films are famous for (Edward Scissor Hands, etc). The only other similar stop-animation film that took Burton years to make is the recently released Corpse Bride, which unfortunately didnt do so well in theaters. It is still a good film but it lacks the depth, characterization and good storytelling that Nightmare has. I hope that when Corpse Bride is released on DVD, there will be mention of Nightmare Before Christmas.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|<br />I have to say up front that I am a massive Depeche Mode fan, thus this review could be a little bias but in all honesty this record is as good as anything they released in the late 80's and a touch below  \\"Violator\\" and \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\". Their last album, Exciter a lot of people wanted to like but it sounded as if the band couldn't be bothered with it and as a result a lot of the songs didn't sound complete. However with \\"Playing the Angel\\" Mode have lifted things up a notch and thanks to their producer Ben Hillier created a more darker, abrasive sound very reminiscent of their late eighties work. <br /> <br />The opening track, \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" literally blares out at you, much like \\"I Feel You\\" and gets the listener's attention immediately, setting the tone for the rest of the album. It has a catchy chorus which you expect from Depeche Mode and stomps along like a bull released in a china shop before ending  in a siren blasting, guitar smashing crescendo of sonic obliteration. <br /> <br />\\"John The Revelator\\", I don't really like the name of this song but this is definitely one of the strongest songs on the album, both lyrically and musically. Dave's voice is in top form, much like \\"Condemnation\\" and again there is a great chorus with a subversive bassline that purrs and flows under the lyrics beautifully. <br /> <br />The next track, \\"Suffer Well\\" was written by Gahan and fits in nicely here. I especially like the lyrics \\"An angel led me when I was blind - I said, take me back I've changed my mind\\" - when you put this in context of Gahan's past it is quite touching, showing a maturity to his songwriting. The chorus is a little bit too poppy for me and it definitely sounds mid to late eighties but doesn't distract too much from the song. <br /> <br />\\"The Sinner In Me\\" does what Mode does best. The lyrics are soaked in guilt, repression and a bit of existentialism for good measure, combined with a heavy slab of analogue synths anda dirty bassline which is impossible to scrub out of the recesses of your inner ear.  The guitar parts toward the end of the track are a nice touch, resulting in an experimental instrumental which  sounds eerily like the intro for \\"Mercy In You\\". <br /> <br />I think pretty much everybody has heard \\"Precious\\" by now, (a great track don't get me wrong) but it does feel a little bit out of place compared to the other songs on the album. It is not as dirty or raw as the rest of Playing the Angel,  although it does bubble along nicely in it's own melodical stratosphere ending with some chopping Gore-esque guitar licks towards the end of the track. In my opinion this is up there with \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" although I really disliked Sasha's remix of this, which is a shame if only things were like the old days when they remixed their own stuff..... <br /> <br />Ahh, now for me this is where things go pear shaped. The first track which Martin sings, \\"Macro\\" is just over the top, and I understand that he always does this, but I believe he could have done much better. I think he dropped the ball on Exciter too, but  previous efforts such as  \\"Judas\\", \\"Home\\" and \\"Blue Dress\\" were great! C'mon Mart you know you can do better! <br /> <br />\\"I Want it All\\" is really low key, I expected this to be a lot rockier but Dave soldiers on with this one and lyrically he does pull it off but this goes on for too long in my opinion and like he said on the DVD that comes with the album \\"it was amazing how some of the songs changed in the studio\\" - and this was one of them. <br /> <br />On the other hand \\"Nothing is Impossible\\" is fantastic and one of my favourites on the album. Another Dave track, \\"Nothing is Impossible\\" is laden with melodramatic vocals, gloomy guitar parts and chain rattling synths. In fact it kind of sounds like a Cure track circa Disintegration, and you need to listen to this on headphones as it bleeps and grinds its' way into your skull with a chorus that is repetitivelyhypnotic.   <br /> <br />\\"Introspectre\\" is a brief respite from vocals duties for the band and as most DM fans realise by now, every album has to have either an instrumental or an instrumental interlude, my personal favourites from a bygone era include the ending on \\"Blue Dress\\", \\"Pimph\\" and \\"Uselink\\" but there are plenty of others worthy of a mention. <br /> <br />\\"Damaged People\\" takes us straight back into Gore territory and I'm not sure if this is better or worse than \\"Macro\\". He definitely sings it differently and it doesn't go on as long, but it still sounds like a cliche. Am I being too hard on Martin here or do I need to listen to it some more? This was my first impression though, and I tend to stick with that even after listening to a record numerous times but I wasn't a huge fan of the Counterfeit 2 album either (there  were a couple of decent tracks) but if you play these songs to someone who has never heard of the band (or heard little of) expressions do range from disbelief to hitting the \\"stop\\" button immediately. <br /> <br />\\"Lilian\\" is a perfectly crafted piece of Mode pop and bounces along smoothly, although when Dave sings \\"Oh Lilian - Look what you've done\\" I can't help but stifle a little snigger. Reading into the lyrics one could assume that Martin is  talking about his marital problems but hey that is just one theory. Again, the analogue synths really shine on this track, proving that Ben Hillier was the right person for the job. <br /> <br />\\"The Darkest Star\\" meanders along at a slow pace and doesn't require too much active listening to appreciate it, but it is a good closure for an album from a band that has weathered the storm of the music industry for the last 25 years and still can pack stadiums the globe over. <br /> <br />On another note, the sleeve photography is brilliant with Anton Corbijn  once again displaying his unique talents for the visual aesthetic and the collage cover was also designed by him. Incidentally, there are two different sets of photographs  to accompany the album (one for the deluxe edition and one for the standard edition) so make sure you check out both of them. <br /> <br />I know this review is harsh in places but I wanted to be honest and constructive rather than say \\"it's fantastic\\". Overall this is a good album from a band that has endured through some tough times and there are not many other acts in the world today that could do what Depeche Mode have done over the years. <br /> <br />Dan
0671027387|4.0|This book Deception Point is full of excitement, suspense, and action also it has quite a few believable characters involved in the settings.<br /><br /> Rachel Sexton's father is in a fight with the president of the United States to become the president while at the same time he is trying to shut down NASA because he thinks it is a waste of time and money. Rachel is a little against her father also though because she despises him and does not really care much if he wins presidency or not.

She needs to call her office while she did that she was told that she urgently needs to come into the office. When she arrives she was told that the president of the United States wants to have a meeting with her and she is wondering why me?<br /><br /> Mean while she is whisked off in one of the fastest helicopter ever built the Pave Hawk. Mean while she thinks she is headed to the White House when all of the sudden she notices that she is heading in the total opposite directions. She asks the pilot where they are going and he replies to her that we are heading out to Wallops Island. Why? She said. Well we are heading out their because we are going to meet the president in a modified 747 where one of his offices were at the end of the runway. When she gets their and meets the president she is briefed that NASA has found something very valuable and rare in the Arctic. Later on in the story Rachel Sexton is finding herself in The middle of the Arctic tundra where she sees a large whit bubble shaped Dome. When she enters she was told by one of the scientist that there is a rare valuable object buried about 200 ft below the arctic ice that is some type of meteorite. After she was briefed by the other scientist she asks why is it so important that there is a meteorite buried 200 ft below ice here? She was shown three samples of the meteorite one of them was a shiny jet black stone. Which was a sample taken from another meteorite that landed about 2 years back.She was shown three samples of the meteorite one of them was a shiny jet black stone.

B00005JO0J|5.0|...and yet the U.S. movie-going public stayed away from \\"Serentiy\\" in droves. Frustrating, to say the least! This film is so well made that those of us who have seen it KNOW George Lucas squirmed while watching it. Everything Lucas failed to do with the final 3 (hell, 4)\\"Star Wars\\" films, Whedon achieved. First with the television show and followed up by this great film. Great individual characters, great plot, great drama, effortless humor. Nothing is forced, which cannot be said for Mr. Lucas' more recent work. <br />I know I'm not alone in hoping some network (Hello, Sci-Fi Channel?) will revive \\"Firefly\\" and a smart sudio will produce further feature films.
B00005M91K|4.0|an amazingly deft collage of scenery and agile cinematography that takes you through all extremes of our planet. excellent scenes include group mediation rituals and time lapse scenes in modern cities as well as an excellent score. the variety and scope is ambitious.
B000002A46|3.0|This album is definitely overrated.  It's good, but not great.  The vocals are definitely great, she sounds excellent.  Some of the songs are excellent such as \\"All I want for christmas is you\\", \\"O holy night\\".  But songs like \\"Silent Night\\" and \\"Joy to the World\\" are very weak.  Also her rendition of \\"Santa Claus is coming town\\" is very childish.  This is overall a very pop album, with no real depth and soul, except only on a few tracks.  Overall it's good, but it's definitely overrated.
B000002GK1|5.0|I can just push play! Over, and over, and over and over...
6305949980|5.0|An excellent film with an equally excellent score by Danny Elfman, I finally got around to picking this DVD up. The extras were great, although I don't understand why some companies seem to only have fullscreen versions of their theatrical trailers, as seen here. The only real problem with the DVD is the widescreen is apparently non-anamorphic, but this is only an issue if you have a widescreen tv. Defeinately worth getting despite this flaw.
B0000025T6|5.0|This is one of those albums where the power does not lie in volume, but in the lyrics. I'm a newcomer to The Boss and his music. I thought I'd might as well give Nebraska a shot, and I must say, as I was reading the lyrics along with the music, the emotions in The Boss's words hit you hard. The indifference of the character on the song Nebraska, who's about to be executed, saying \\"...and I killed everything in my path\\", haunts you with it's soft, almost eerie delivery. It's a perfect intro of what's to come in the next 40 minutes on the album. <br /> <br />These songs are all about people driven to desperation through tough times, wishing they had more, and never has Bruce passed on these stories more effectively. The wording of the lyrics is guaranteed to have you picturing the stories unfolding, the best example being \\"Highway Patrolman\\", a story that would make anyone feel pity for the main character.  <br /> <br />Musically, the songs are perfect in their demo quality style. The stories are really what the focus of this album is, and the emotions that come from these stories are where the impact of this album lies, the guitar and harmonica providing just the right texture for these songs, giving them a dusty, black and white feel.  <br /> <br />This album is my favorite Springsteen album because it is that rare album that hits you harder with just a guitar, harmonica, and lyrics, than any fully produced, full band album ever could.  <br /> <br />
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|This has to be the best album for an \\"old rocker\\" in a long, long time. Deep Purple's latest, \\"Rapture of the Deep,\\" is also a great disc. The Mighty Rearranger really grows on you after a couple listens. Good songs, fine lyrics, strong production. Nice stuff! Little stronger than the new Stones or Clapton albums.<br /><br />Highlights: Freedom Fries; Another Tribe; Takamba; Dancing in Heaven and All The King's Horses. Shine it all Around is the song you hear all the time on the radio, and that's not even one of the better songs on this collection. Go figure!<br /><br />Bravo Bob!...and dp
0780626966|5.0|The Nightmare On Elm Street Collection is a must-have DVD box set for all Freddy Krueger and horror fans. This set comes with 7 Nightmare films, another DVD called The Nightmare Series Encyclopedia, 2 pairs of 3-D glasses and a book called The Nightmare Is Alive.    Each movie is digital remastered, new remixed 5.1 surround sound and in widescreen.     The only problem is that they should've put a new commentary for A Nightmare On Elm Street and Wes Craven's New Nightmare, instead of using the laserdisc commentary. Also, Nightmare 2-6 should've had commentaries, too. Nightmare 5 is not presented in it's unrated version and the 3-D in Freddy's Dead needed to be in more 3-D.    Maybe soon, New Line Home Entertainment will release the Nightmare On Elm Street Collection for a second time with new commentaries, new sound, a unrated part 5, more remastered than it was before and a better 3-D look for Freddy's Dead.    If you don't own this DVD box set, get this and add it to your DVD collection.
B00000I8UE|5.0|\\"Traveling Miles\\" is Cassandra Wilson's tribute to Miles Davis-- Wilson selected seven songs associated with Davis (though only two were penned by him), augmented this with four originals.  The album is performed by and large by a core band-- bassist Lonnie Plaxico, guitarists Marvin Sewell and Kevin Breit and percussionist Jeffrey Haynes, along with a seemingly endless cast of guests-- bassist Dave Holland, trumpeter Olu Dara, alto saxophonist Steve Coleman, guitarists Pat Metheny, violinist Regina Carter, vibist Stefon Harris and percussionist Mino Cinelu all make appearances in some context or another. <br /> <br />What Wilson does with these musicians is create a stew of sort-- perculating jazz tradition and fusion with the acoustic, rootsy blues that would dominate the next several albums she did.  The results are stunning-- from the sultry and dark \\"Run the Voodoo Down\\" (with Olu Dara doing his best Miles impersonation) that opens and closes the album to a stripped bare and lovely rendition of Lauper's \\"Time After Time\\" (recorded by Davis on \\"You're Under Arrest\\" in 1985) to a frantic and bizarre take on Wayne Shorter's \\"E.S.P\\" ,intermingling fractured guitars and a bizarre solo by Carter.  Along the way, Wilson pours her heart into \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\" the way Davis poured his into his horn, eats up Marcus Miller's \\"Tutu\\" as the bleak \\"Resurrection Blues\\" and reminds us how much she can swing on an inventive take on Victor Feldman's \\"Seven Steps\\" (where pianist Eric Lewis does manage to slip in a \\"Salt Peanuts\\" quote when no one's looking....).  Throughout, Wilson's alto is sultry and edgy, dangerous and mysterious and exciting, warm and yet somehow brittle. <br /> <br />Bottom line-- this is a great album, a worthy tribute to a genius.  Wilson is not afraid to make the pieces her own.  Recommended.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Rush In Rio is the complete testament by the Three Stooges. <br /> <br />As many bands in rock history, they sometimes search for places where their music was never played live. This happened to Queen and Iron Maiden when they decided to visit South America, a place where rock music is not that popular as in other parts of the world, and as a coincidence had chosen Brazil to test this kind of public having fantastic results that remain in video or record nowadays.  <br /> <br />Rush was about to taste the energy and the productive in terms of audience and would enlarge the amount of great bands to play in those magical venues. The sound and energy of both band and people melts in the most punching live record ever released by the band.  <br /> <br />Peart's statement was that after Different Stages they would not release any other Live Album for the next 6 or 10 years, but the Rio experience was something those Canadians didn't overlook and made yet another tribute to that people and those Brazilian cities that have put their emotions for their beloved band. In emotional terms this one is the best live record released by Rush. <br /> <br />This is a killer set list and overall incredible musicianship brings this one above all the rest. A great balance between new and old is provided. there is nothing to be disappointed about with this masterpiece of live music. Too many highlights to name. <br />I've honestly never heard any other band sound so dynamic and powerful.  <br /> <br />This is wonderful! This is almost a religious experience.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is one of the best ablums ever!!!!.... out of the 18 songs, only 2 are just ok..... If I were stuck on an island with 50 albums, this would be there for sure!! <br /> <br />enjoy!
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm calls into question a certain notion of thinking most commonly used by \\"experts\\" of all stripes, decision makers in business, in marketing, in the military or in academia.  He draws out the limits of reducing thinking to just another form of technology, in which experts will substitute technology, i.e. reason, for other forms of experience, i.e. feeling, experience, passion.  The results are comic, especially in the first chapter concerning the forged Khourous, where technology supports wishful thinking.<br /><br />The implications are wide-ranging, i.e. poor military decisions supported by complex software, consumar marketing decisions supported by useless focus groups, prejudices supported by media influence, etc.<br /><br />Malcolm doesn't develop any normative rules for dealing with this zen-like moment of \\"thinking without thinking,\\" so don't look for many.  I suggest reading the book without \\"thinking\\" and accept the absurdity of never being certain about anything.
B000002H70|4.0|This album has some of the best songs ever,yet is filled with a lot of filler material.... I would say about 1/2 of the album is perfect... the other half leaves you wanting more....  There are several Cure albums like this....So great to listen to, but are not great.... \\"Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me\\" and \\"Wish\\" come to mind..... both which have great songs, and a lot of somewhat good songs..... If you want the best stuff check out \\"Pornography\\" and \\"The Head on the Door\\" <br /> <br />However, its a damn good album!!! <br /> <br />enjoy!
1401308201|1.0|The description on Amazon clearly states that the book contains the libretto as well as the spells used in the show. The book does not. I understand that the original intention was to include these things, but they were dropped at the last minute. The description of the book was misleading. If I just wanted a book with pictures from the show I would buy a program and save myself the money. I gave the book one star because it is not the book that was advertised. The pictures may be nice, but without the libretto the book is fluff.
B000002H2H|5.0|I just recently took the plunge into the legacy of Metallica and their glory days. I also listened to St. Anger and I wonder what went wrong. Why didn't Metallica go back to making albums like this? 8 tracks, usually more than 5 minutes long, heavy, meaningful, mildly creepy lyrics. You guys, James, Lars, and Kirk, bring back Newsted and make the Thrash Metal you used to do sooooo well! Enough of my stupid rant, this is what I like about Ride the Lightning.    Fight Fire with Fire 5/5: Starting with a 30-second accoustic intro, the song explodes with fast fills and flams from Lars, Long, complicated riffs from Kirk, dark tones by Cliff, and rhythm and somewhat high, chilling lyrics about Nuclear warfare. Songs like this are the reason I listen to these guys! This and Battery are PERFECT openers.    Ride the Lightning 5/5: REALLY freaky lyrics here about the Electric Chair. I get chills just looking at the lyrics for this song! It has riffs, ranging from fast, to REALLY fast, to slow, and back to fast. There is also an interesting ending. (lyrically)    For Whom the Bell Tolls 5/5: Lyrics are about some book. Another very good song.    Fade to Black 5/5: Somewhat soft, more chilling lyrics about suicide. (I don't know if anyone else noticed this, but almost every Metallica album has a softer track four) Just something to think about.    Trapped Under Ice 5/5: MORE weird lyrics about drowning under ice in a frozen lake. Another song I get chills (no pun intended) from looking at the lyrics. Good guitar work, especially the riff.    Escape 5/5: From my eyes, it's about some guy kidnapping another guy and torturing him. Very Heavy.    Creeping Death 5/5: This song's lyrics aren't exactly creepy, but they're about the Spirit that killed the Pharaoh's Son in Egypt.     Lamb's blood on a door,  I shall pass,  I'm Creeping Death    The Call of KTULU 5/5: Good instrumental. Good bass work.    In the end, buy this album to help Metallica realize that this is the stuff that really sells. Maybe, just maybe, They will understand and put out more albums like this one!    Enjoy!
0201485672|5.0|I recommend this as one of the must-haves for any software developer's library.  Easy to read, and--like so many of life's best practices--easy to do.  Even if you can't memorize the entire refactoring catalog, become familiar with the code-smells chart in the back of the book, then use the book as a reference.<br /><br />Many of the basic refactorings are now included in your favorite IDE.  But there are still choices to be made, and basic refactorings will inevitably expose more subtle code smells.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that refactoring brings some of the joy back into your career.
0805076476|5.0|After watching the movie about 8 thousand times, I finally decided the book would be worth reading.  It turned out to be evem more amazing than the movie. <br />  At the times the movie kind of dragged on and it became a chore to watch and keep up with the story.  With the book, everything is clear and it's fascinating from page 1 to the very end. <br />  Speaking of the end, the bland, typical movie ending you're probably used to seeing is changed.  I read the last chapter about three times because the original ending (the book came before the ending) is incredible and beats the movie ending by far. <br />  All in all, this is an excellent book for anyone who has, or hasn't, seen the movie.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|But I'll give it a shot. First, I'd like to address some complaints. It's a fair objection to suggest that maybe Omar went overboard with the production - like the naysayers, I also don't much like birds/crickets chirping for more than a few seconds. However, some of this is just plain false. Omar is NOT a bad guitarist - all accounts of this are hastily generalized, with nothing to back it up. and who cares if Cedric's lyrics are bonkers? The man can evoke, let him evoke. <br /> <br />anyways, i won't make any attempt to interpret this album - something about an orphan with weird Mexican ancestors and spiritual traditions or something. Still, it makes me feel like I've been placed in a real, compelling story, moreso than \\"De-Loused.\\" These boys can rain maggots on me any day.
0684824906|5.0|This is a banner year for presidential biographies : two of Theodore Roosevelt's retirement years (\\"The River of Doubt\\" by Candice Millard and \\"When Trumpets Call\\" by Patricia O'Toole), one of Andrew Jackson (\\"His Life and Times\\" by H.W. Brands) plus Joshua Shenk's study of depression in our 16th President (\\"Lincoln's Melancholy\\"). Now Doris Goodwin leaps back a century from her Kennedy and Johnson books with a view of the politics of the Civil War.    Though it is a long narrative (it is over 900+ with the footnotes), she is less interested in his role as commander-in-chief and more interested in Lincoln the master politician in a nation torn apart by seccession and slavery. His decision to keep his friends close and his political enemies closer by putting his rivals in his Cabinet was a crucial move in coopting his Republican rivals and keeping the party firmly in his control. Ms. Goodwin is a master storyteller, an excellent researcher who knows what to omit and her narrative is fun to read on a cold winter's night.
B00004Y6NM|4.0|Not a couple years before this CD, a friend of mine saw Clapton in concert and had this reaction- \\"It was okay, but he played too much blues and the show dragged on!\\" Just imagine- Clapton? Too much blues? While this friend wasn't entirely wrong- Clapton shows and CDs just before this CD seemed to lack a mix that provided direction and momentum. On the other hand, Clapton still put out great music. He just needed some direction. While I liked a lot of his 70s music, 80s radio play didn't cater to what seemed like \\"been there, done that,\\" Clapton music that was still being produced. Enter Phil Collins. Say what you want about Collins- hindsight in the 2000s has labeled him as a  Disneyesque-muzac retro for adults- in the early to late 80s he was a significant staple to hit music, be it solo, with Genesis, or as a producer of CDs like Clapton's \\"Behind the Sun,\\" and subsequent Clapton music (as well as other artists.) With this CD, Clapton instantly became a radio darling again. Collins put into Claptons CDs some direction and momentum. The succession of his songs on his CDs, as well as how he performed them live, had a more effective flow. He didn't abandon his old music, he just blended it more effectively and brought the flavor up to date. For the first time in years Clapton now had several songs that reached a widers audience with ubiquitous radio play. \\"She's Waiting, See What a Love Can Do,\\" and \\"Tangled in Love,\\" all are well produced, flavorful, power punching songs of varying appeal,  that included female harmonies in the background to accentuate Clapton's own strengths- a famililar formuala from the past, but with a more current feel. \\"Forever Man,\\" is another power packing Clapton vocal and guitar attack familiar from the \\"Motherless Children\\" league. The line-up of songs shows an acknowledgement by Clapton that he needed a make-over of sorts. And in the 80s, Collins had the Midas touch for producing music. Were it not for this CD, and \\"August,\\" to follow,Clapton would have faded into relative obscurity, which isn't to say no talent- that's always been there. He was simply in need of someone capable of producing him and taking what he had to offer talent-wise at this point and time, and surrounding him with great musicians and singers. Several songs contain a perfect balance of percussion that alone gives certain songs a feel that would be missed were it not present (\\"She's Waiting, Forever Man). If this CD didn't exist, Clapton isn't the 80s and 90s MTV darling he became. Again, that's not saying he wouldn't have still had anyting to offer, but the ubiquity many grew accustomed to would not have been nearly on the same scale. The genuine grief fans felt over the tragic death of his son through his grammy winning ballad may not have been as widespread. His following would largely have consisted of those who grew up at the same time his career evolved, and not necessarily the millions who now accepted him on an even larger scale since, with music subsequently produced on following CDs. This was a career turner for Clapton, and anyone can dig up info on his career and see where it was up until this CD, and where it went after it. People were no longer leaving his shows complaining, they were flocking to them making him one of the hardest tickets of the time. Collins opened up what had always been inside Clapton and Clapton took it from there. He produced quality music that may not necessarily have had the same impact of some of his classic stuff that established him in the first place, but it sure added breadth and depth to his catalog, making it harder to narrow down a songlist to please everyone when performing live- the complete opposite of the experience my friend had in his pre-\\"Behind The Sun,\\" days. A fabulous CD.
0393327655|1.0|This is the same tired argument Secularist have made against religion since the Enlightenment. The same thinking that produced Stalin, Mao, Pol pot, and a host of other `reasonable' people who rejected faith and attempted to reshape the world into one that sought the betterment of humanity through social engineering. Can anyone name a single major world figure, who rejected faith, that made the world a better place?<br /><br />This line of thinking is disproved both by the negative examples of those named above, and by any objective examination of history. Sure `people of faith' have done terrible things, but in doing them they were rejecting the fundamental principles they claimed to believe in. The truth lies in the fact that any institution that has truly advanced the cause of humanity, from the creating of Universities to the founding of hospitals, has done so from a foundation of faith.<br /><br />If you already reject faith, then I'm sure this book will help to stifle that quiet voice in the back of your mind that whispers, \\"but what if I'm wrong...\\" which could have been the authors own motivation for writing it.

B00005JNJV|4.0|I give this film a 4 star rating it is good but not great.    Movie gets off to a very slow start with the backstory of Batman.  Takes alot of time to get into it.  When they finally show Wayne becoming Batman and starting to battle is when this movie gets good.      If you are a batman fan you will love this movie becuase we finally get to see the backstory of batman.  Movie is slow going at first as I said but defintely worth a purchase if you are a batman fan or anyone who wants to see how batman came to be.

He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books!

B0001NBMBC|1.0|Every one who thinks this band is dextrous, musical, creative, or in any way intelligent must of just had an aneurysm.  These guys SUCK, their music is a tumult of high and/or drunk guys banging drums, smashing guitars/basses and screaming into microphones and than making millions, because all the little emo kids who, \\"have such a hard life\\" want to shock their parents and peers with their \\"satan worshipping music\\".  A five year old starting on electric violin is more musical than these deadbeats.  Their a herd of pessimistic dirtbags hand in hand with their flock of \\"maggots\\" who follow thier every step in crushing the metal genre from the face of the planet.  This band is a troope of sleezy wannabes who make \\"music\\" that makes me want to jump out a 100 story building with my feet cemented to the window sill and 300 pound weights tied to my wrists.

0380789035|2.0|This novel concerns a battle between the old gods of the old country, mainly from Norse mythology, and the new gods of internet, credit cards, and television. They are getting ready for a showdown, a battle to end the battles. In America, the old gods are dying and the new gods are taking over. Mr Wednesday (Wotan) enlists former convict Shadow to help him through the battle. Shadow doesn't quite know what he is getting into, but goes along since his wife died with his best friend in a car accident before he was released from prison.<br /><br />There are some asides in this book, short stories in their own right, philosophical meanderings about the death of the old gods and what this means. Ultimately, we are told that the individualistic streak in Americans, where everyone can pick and choose their own philosophy and creed, is what is causing the death of the old gods.<br /><br />There are many different directions to go with this. The idea of this novel are brilliant, and the meticulous research is obvious. Mr Gaiman did his homework here. But the problems are manifold. The ideas may be great, but Mr Gaiman doesn't go anywhere with them. The characters are very flat, and Shadow, as the lead, is about as dull as it gets; almost as if Mr Gaiman had decided on casting a literary Keanu Reeves for the part.<br /><br />The second major problem with the book is Mr Gaiman`s prose. As flat and uninteresting as the characters he draws, the style has the pretensions of being literary but doesn't come anywhere close. (See The Club Dumas, which has excellent style and a great story but was completely ignored by the fantasy community, and The Horned Man by James Lasdun, which will likewise be ignored.) His constant references to other writers and titles is forced and extremely annoying. It is far too self-conscious, a literary game of \\"look at me! I know who these writers are!\\" (An aside here; this type of thing seems to belong the fantasy, science fiction and horror genre more than anywhere else.) Mr Gaiman often uses his characters as mere mouthpieces for his holier-than-thou proselytizing, a device straight out of Heinlein. Mr Gaiman seems to want to be a literary writer and a great storyteller. Mainstream popular writers often feel that this is impossible, but the market is rife with novels that have tremendous style, timeless stories, and authors who do not put their egos in the reader's way.

0812548094|5.0|This was an outstanding book.  If you have read Wizards first rule and enjoyed it as much as I did, then you are probably frantically searching for the next one.  It definately fills in the missing parts and you get a better understanding of what the series is about.  This dramatic fantasy is the best I have ever read.  Granted, I have not read many fantasy books but this one definitely takes the cake.  You won't be able to put it down and it will be over before you know it. <br /> One thing that did it for me was the characters.  Unlike many fantasy books, Terry Goodkind creates realistic characters, if you can believe that.  It is easy relating to many of the characters and their personalities are unlike the norm.  For me it was easy to relate to Richard, but that's just because I think of myself as a hero.  OK but seriously, no matter who you are, there is at least one character that you can associate with.   <br /> Besides all that, Goodkind's writing is so captivating and so amazing, that all you can think about is getting home so you can continue reading.  I don't know how he does it but when I read his work it is like he is putting pictures in my mind.  His settings are so extraordinary, only your mind can comprehend them. <br /> Goodkind's style of writing hooks me because instead of writing the book chapter after chapter, he changes things up a bit.  Maybe you will be reading about Khalan and her adventures, and then all at once there you are reading about Richard.  You might not get to find out what happens for another two or three chapters.  But the suspense is what makes it good.  It wouldn't be nearly exciting if you found out things right away. <br />If you are looking to enhance you vocabulary this may not be the book for you.  However, he does not bore you whatsoever with low-key tone or lousy words.  If fantasy is your thing then I say you are obligated to read this book.  You won't be disappointed. <br />
B000A6T262|3.0|Ok you may disagree with me, but my gripe is not about the films which in terms of two disc appeal is a 5 star set. My problem lies with the fact that Paramount are trying palm this set off as a 'special' collectors edition! To me this typically implies that the way in which a box set is presented comes with some care 7 attention to detail.  No of which is obvious with this set!  The outer box of the set is made from thin cardboard the sort of which that would be used to make a ceral box.  Ok so its glossy and double folded but you can literally bend the whole box even when its full with the ten disc sets.  My second grip conerns the plastic boxes.  Gone are the nice double opening-kind that are avalible when you by the titles individually, instead they are replaced by a double width single opening-kind.  The wierd thing here is that the two discs are then stored on top of each other under clips that are so stiff that worry you will snap the disc in two evey time you remove one.  Bizzarly on the other side of the box is an empty space where normally a collectible inlay or booklet would lie.  Yet Paramount have decided (under twisted logic) to only put inlays in three out of the 10 films.  WTF? For me I am so sorely disapointed that I am returning the set as faulty as I feel that it is missing parts (i.e. the other 7 booklets).  I would also reccommend that if you have a multi-region player you invest in the region 2 box set avalible from amazon.co.uk at the end of the year.
B00005UJ96|5.0|all the Trees material is amazing and should be checked out by anybody interested in British folk-rock.  I just felt the need to counter the Jimmy Page-bashing by the other review here.  The Bert Jansch song they refer to was called 'Blackwaterside' and the Led Zeppelin instrumental 'Black Mountainside' -- which was performed live as White Summer - does indeed seem to copy Jansch note for note.  But not only was this years before the Trees recorded their own interpretation, the album credits are actually \\"Trad., arrangement by J.Page\\". And this is technically completely correct - it WAS a traditional tune, and the arrangement IS from Page.  The fact that he borrowed huge musical phrases and much of the dynamics from Jansch only means he knew good music when he heard it.  Page was actually very open about his taste for British folk-rock -- remember that Sandy Denny sang on Zeppelin IV -- and if Bert Jansch felt he had been unduly ripped off he could have taken legal action.  In fact, I have played Jansch's Blackwaterside for dozens of people and thus opened up a whole new audience for HIM when they realized what an influence he was on Page.  I think Jansch knew (and still knows) this and would probably THANK him for having borrowed so strongly from his work.  He and Davy Graham certainly haven't starved as a result of Zeppelin's success.
0679422714|2.0|I will leave the critical assessment of the factual contents of this book to those whose background and experience (e.g. some of the reviews by Chinese readers already extant here) provide the criteria for judgment I lack. However the point does need to be reinforced and amplified that the skewed and subjective tone of this tome reaches far, far beyond any biography in my personal reading history. <br /> <br />My criticism is of the abysmal level of writing, the stilted and simplistic vernacular, that results in a disconcerting and insulting composition style. There is clearly a problem  matching Ms. Chang's ardor for the topic and her research discipline with her rudimentary skill in her adopted language.  For this reader the woefully substandard syntax substantially detracts from the impact of the text; Ms. Chang would be well advised to acquaint herself with Justin Kaplin prior to exploring the biography genre again. She has proven here that disposing of style, grace and strong editorial oversight in the formulation of the English sentence can be catastrophic.
B000000OAL|5.0|I love every Queen album up through Jazz - even weaker disks like 'News of the World' are worthy. High points of thier career, obviously, were 'Sheer Heart Attack' and \\"Night at the Opera'.<br /><br />Yet today, when I play back the Queen catalog, of those first seven, one album stands out. One has all the energy Queen would ever show, without the weak spots, the songs featured on every other album that should have been left on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />This album - 'Queen', the self-titled debut, is Queen at thier very, very best. It is one of the three Queen albums I consider essential in any era rock collection (Sheer Heart Attack, A Night At The Opera, and this). Other queen albums can be passed up, but these are the three you must have. And of those three, this one is the rock masterpiece.
B0000009RX|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. It was when it was released in the days when dinosaurs and hippies tried to not bump into each other and it still is today. The sound on this album (CD) was/is absolutely unique even if the listener can catch whiffs of The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Alfred E. Newman and Varese. To Zappa absolutely nothing was sacred especially plastic people, phony hippies, the society that filled their heads with illusions and the moms and dads who stupidly watched it happen. We're Only In It For The Money is probably the most vicious and sarcastic musical document ever produced.  <br /> <br />What's there to live for...? Well there's crab infested self-obsessed plastic stoners, trigger happy cowboy cops, hairy orificed bluesy prisoners, indignant parents with no clue about why their kids are so unhappy they turn to dope, goo smeared girlies, beastly boyfriends, fans that play records backwards looking for secret messages, supposedly discorporating followers of secret corporate agendas, garage band aficionados with tri-chord delusions, paranoid sound engineers, cackling munchkins, 45rpm vinyl destruction, greenie smeared windows, blue flaming preteens, war inspired psychotics, congressional nazis, essential fluid science projects, liars and cheaters and people like you, lonely little girls, unabashed dancing naked fat folks, ugly minded citizens of a scab of a nation driven insane and unalive other people nervously laughing on cue to a joke they don't understand.  <br /> <br />This album is really good... you should go out and buy it!
B000A6T1JU|2.0|A note on my rating, I give 5 stars to the original version and only 2 to the director's cut.      First, general review:  The Warriors is a dystopia vision of a New York City sometime in the near future - a city overrun by innumerable, and often outlandish, gangs.  They're divided, disorganized, and often at each others throats until the leader of the largest gang in NY, Cyrus of the Riffs, comes up with a plan - he wants to unite all gangs under his banner and take control of the city in a mafioso type fashion.  All eyes point to a revolution until he is shot, and soon after that one of the gangs, the Warriors, is blamed for his death.  The situation turns into a flight for life as the Warriors race back to their home on Coney Island before the dozens of gangs manage to catch them first.    This movie at its heart is B-quality; bad dialogue, no-name actors (at least, at the time this was filmed), horribly inaccurate portrayal of the subway system, dumb fight scenes, and a far-out plot... this all adds up to a fantastically fun movie.        Now, if you're going to get this movie - do yourself a favor and watch the original untainted version.  The 'Ultimate Director's Cut' scrambles what was already a very tight film.      The new comic cut scenes make a movie that was fun to watch Because it took itself so seriously, it makes it seem very cheap, not to mention is slows down the pacing and screws up some of the scenes and lines.  The greater tie-in with the real events that this movie is loosely based upon is completely unnecessary.  Such a fact is fun to know in hindsight but does nothing for the movie itself.      The Director's Cut should've just made available interviews and deleted scenes (which it didn't even include all the deleted scenes).  Even adding back into the movie some deleted scenes would've been acceptable - but not adding in the comic-book scene transition.  They pulled a Lucas, taking something that was special and cutting it off at the knees inan attempt to rewrite history and 'improve' the final product.  Disappointing.      EDIT:   I managed to see many of the cast from this movie last fall at Chiller Theater (2006), each of them I asked which version of The Warriors they liked more.  All of them responded the original version.  BTW, if you ever get a chance to meet Dorsey Wright (Cleon) go for it - the guy is freakin' awesome - ask him about how he was cut from a larger role in the film ;)
B00005JN0T|4.0|Here's what I thought it would be like:    In a Star Trek/Data-like move we are supposed to feel like a robot is somehow another form of life deserving all the respect of something between a German Shepherd and a human.  Chaos ensues with their new found sentience and humanity longs for the simple good ol' days.  Either that or we are supposed to walk away looking for life in \\"Sonny's\\" ancestors like  toasters and TV remotes.    I was only about a third right.    Troughout the movie, robots remain little more than high tech toasters, devoid of life.  Clearly, society in this movie has not yet gone over the same cliff as Star Trek.  Even though the Lieutenant already started pining for the good ol' days when \\"humans killed humans.\\"  He had the attitude that made me half-expect him to challenge Spooner. . .    \\"Shoot Spooner!\\" I could hear him say, \\"Why don't you arrest the hair-dryer for falling into the bathtub and killing Mrs. Higgins?\\"    That would have been something he would say.    Spooner is made to feel just how ridiculous he is compared to the rest of the world when he tackles a robot for what he thinks is a purse snatching.  As it turns out, it was running TO its owner not away from her with her inhaler she forgot at home.  Everyone around him gives him a look as if asking, \\"What's your problem, man?\\"  The robot gets up and is about as polite as Sebastian Cabot in \\"Family Affair\\" in an almost annoying way. . .    \\"Sorry for the misunderstaning, sir.\\"    The robots are too good to be true.    This is all a great setup for the big challenge of the movie.  Dr. Lanning, the godfather of robots, kills himself.  The suicide seems obvious to everyone except Spooner.  He needs to find the clues that Lanning possibly left behind then convince the world that he is right about his suspicions over Sonny's involvment in Lanning's death.    There are some very deftly played out conflicts here.  Emotion vs. logic is a worn out war in Hollywood with emotion winning every time.  \\"I Robot\\" recognizes that and avoids the usual cliches.  Brains (Calvin) vs. gut instincts (Spooner) is another good conflict.  She is all intellect whereas he is more balanced.    Spooner:  You are the dumbest smart person I've ever met!  Calvin:  And YOU are the dumbest dumb person I've ever met!    There's a little comedy there and it works well.      But the three laws of robotics also come in conflict with each other.  This is especially well handled.  Chaos comes not from robot emotions but from the logical adherence to the three laws.  Humans are war-like therefore they must be destroyed to protect humanity--clearly a bug in the program!  What is a society to do when free will is in conflict with security?  It's not a new plot twist but it's well presented.  Very interesting!    The ending is exciting while not being intellectually insulting.  Dr. Lanning's death is solved.  Robots are still robots but there is just a hint of freindship between Sonny and Spooner.  Humanity and its creations evolve and advance.    This movie has made me want to read Asimov.  I've heard nothing but good things about him so now it's time to find out why.
B000068TPN|4.0|As I watched the progression of the battle in this movie, I felt a true sense of anxiety.  This is one of those films that really take you in - and when it's over, you snap out of it and realize where you've been for the past hour and a half.  Wow! <br /> <br />The acting, the story and the battles are all so stirring.  Mel Gibson plays this weighty role wonderfully.  Supporting roles by Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot and Chris Klein also help to express the amazing courage these soldiers possessed.  Very moving. <br /> <br />Making a movie about such important and sensitive subject matter must be unbelievably daunting.  This movie both entertained me and disturbed me more than any war-themed movie I'd ever seen.  That is precisely why I know it was done successfully.  This film will take you as close as most of us will ever get to war, thank God.
B000AL730O|4.0|This is a pretty good Paul McCartney album.  It's fairly consistant throughout which is a departure from the usual McCartney fare.  There are four outstanding tracks on here 'Jenny Wren', 'English Tea', 'Too Much Rain' and 'Vanity Fair' any of which stack up nicely to any of Paul's work(yes, even his Beatles stuff).  The rest of the album is good with only a couple of clunkers at the end 'This Never Happened Before' and the 'People Get Ready' ripoff 'Anyway.'  The lack of faster numbers means that there's not much to jump out and excite the listener right away, but it does reward with repeat listenings and generally the lyrics are much better than past efforts..hey, he tried at least this time!   <br /> <br />For the folks who continuosly are disappointed that Paul doesn't write songs like he did with the Beatles...folks wake up, it's not 1965 anymore.  It's time for people to realize what a universal treasure Paul McCartney is, what he's done and hopefully what he'll continue to do to make the world a little brighter place to live in.  I know I'll continue to support and enjoy his music whenever he chooses to create it.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite <br />-Pretty good with a bow-staff. <br />-Artist - just one of his skills. <br />-Wears moon boots at all time. <br />-Loves tater tots to the point that he will put reserves of them in his pocket, unwrapped, for nutritional fuel as he may later need it during class. <br />-Learns and perfectly executes killer dance moves to ultimately become one hell of an interpretive dancer. <br />-Does whatever he feels like doing, gosh. <br /> <br />Kip: Napoleon's Brother <br />-32 years of age, currently living at home with his grandmother. <br />-Talks to babes on the internet all day (grandma pays the hourly fees for his chatting). <br />-Training to be a cage-fighter. <br />-Becomes TO'd when you hold out on him with the full-body shot. <br />-Finds his soulmate, Lafawnda, on the internet, falls deeply in love and gets married.  Kip writes a deep and beautiful song that he performs at the wedding ceremony. <br /> <br />Uncle Rico: Napoleon's Uncle <br />-Stuck in 1982, with delusions of grandeur about the pro football career that he believes could have been. <br />-Almost-sidearm, ultra fast, slightly feminine throwing style.  Uncle Rico videotapes himself dropping back and passing into a field of what may be described as unfulfilled promise and potential. <br />-Lives in a van. <br />-Becomes a tupperware salesman. <br /> <br />Pedro: Napoleon's new best friend at school <br />-Is the only kid in class with a full moustache.  <br />-Not much of a speaker. <br />-Doesn't smile much. <br />-Rides a sweet Sledgehammer bicycle on which he can get like 3 feet of air. <br />-Builds cakes as ice breakers for girls he wants to get to know. He's good with the ladies. <br />-Cuts off all his hair one day when he realizes that it is what is making him hot. <br />-Runs for class president. The platform: Vote for Pedro and all of your wildest dreams will come true. <br /> <br />Deb: Napoleon's friend and female interest <br />-Her mom goes to college. <br />-Headsthe \\"Portraits by Deb\\" photography company. <br />-Drinks 2% milk cuz she thinks she's fat, although she could drink whole milk. <br /> <br />This movie contains an unreal number of quotable lines, all delivered with deadpan styling.  <br /> <br />The film basically chronicles a short period in Napoleon's life during which he meets a new best friend whom he helps during a class-presidential running. During this same period, he meets a shy girl from school that he becomes close to and develops an interest in. His brother, Kip, meets a woman online that he believes is his soulmate. He gets married. Napoleon's Uncle Rico steps in to keep an eye on things when his grandmother is injured in an ATV accident at the sand dunes. Uncle Rico and Kip begin selling tupperware to make some sweet moolah.  <br />The storyline is obviously not what engages you. It is the characters and their means of interaction. These interactions are unique and interesting, spurring some of the funniest ideas and lines of dialogue I have heard. It takes a certain sense of humor to appreciate this film. Most parents won't \\"get it\\", but there is no denying Napoleon Dynamite.  <br /> <br />This is an independent movie phenomenon! I highly recommend it.
0425152251|4.0|I would have never bought this book on my own, but it was a requirement of a philosophy course I took in college.  In fact I beleive this is the main book we used to learn about philosophy, (maybe we used another with it, but this was our main book). <br /> <br />A very good read, there is so much history and information about philosophy packed into this book in novel form, you will not only enjoy it, but maybe you will learn something new. <br /> <br />I will say that if you are trying to pay attention and learn about philosophy, there are some parts you may have to read twice to understand it, but that is not because of the author, Jostein Gaarder, but that there is so much to learn about philosophy and names to remember. <br /> <br />Overall I am glad we used this book instead of some regular textbook, we learned and relaxed with this read.
B000002B1M|5.0|People lend so much street credibility to the Illmatic CD - which it no doubt deserves.  Yet \\"It Was Written\\" was an equally impressive album for the time it was released.  To me, this is ALMOST as much a classic as Illmatic was. <br /> <br />Starting with \\"The Message\\", this album is a journey into the mind of one of the most prolific lyricists hip hop has ever known.  <br />\\"Street Dreams\\" samples the same song sampled for countless hip hop tracks (most notably 2Pac for All Eyez On Me). No other has done it so well.  <br />\\"I Gave You Power\\" is a DJ Premier track. Classic Primo. An extremely catchy loop used to classic Primo drumwork. Nas tells the story of a gun (from the gun's vantage point), which is an interesting and creative concept that makes for a dope track. <br />\\"Affirmative Action\\", with the original Firm ensemble (with Cormega), is the world's official introduction to the Firm (then Nas, AZ, Foxy and Cormega - which became Nas, AZ, Foxy and Nature). This is a great track from beginning to end, with no weak point. Tight beat, great opening from AZ to Mega Montana straight through to the extended finish by Foxy Brown. <br /> <br />\\"Take It In Blood\\", \\"Shootouts\\", \\"If I Ruled The World\\" and \\"Silent Murder\\" (Bonus Track) were all notable additions to the album. <br /> <br />As far as hip hop albums go, this is almost as good as it gets. A solid contribution to the game by Nas. If you love hip hop, you own this album.
1401301363|2.0|There's no doubt that this is a gorgeous book.  Unfortunately, I think it's better for your coffee table than your kitchen.  While there are beautiful pictures (lots of Nigella) and several great recipes, the book didn't seem very useful to me.  I bought and loved \\"How to be a Domestic Goddess\\", so, I got this book from the library to check it out, thinking it would be somewhat the same.  I have to say I was dissapointed.  I only found 4 usable recipes in the whole book.   (Granted, I am not a gourmet chef by any means, but I do consider myself to be a lover of great food and a Good cook.) While there are some nice recipes and lots of great photos this book is a more of a \\"pretty to look at\\" picture book than a hard core recipe resource.
0740748475|4.0|This is a treat for all Calvin fans like myself. I caught on Watterson only about five years back and since then I've always picked up the hard-cover books every chance I got. This collection is the complete compendium of all the Calvin and Hobbes strips published by Watterson that no true-to-the-bones fan can pass up on! <br />The strips in the books are arranged by date of publication, unlike the previous books. Each page carries the original publication dates of the strips on that page. True to form, the black and white strips are interspersed with full colour pages i.e. the sunday pages. Having the scripts laid out by time is great because one can see how the characters, themes and plots developed over the course of the years. Book 1 carries a great introduction by Watterson where he shares his opinions and experiences, the early history and hardships that he endured. I found this a very fitting start to the collection and it gave me more insights into the creator's mind. Watterson is a very frank person and Calvin and Hobbes are his true avtars.  <br />The downside is that the books are very unwieldy; the 3 books with the dust jacket are difficult to carry around and it's ofcourse cumbersome to lie anywhere with even a single of these. The paper quality is good, but the overall finish leaves more to be desired. I also think it would have been great if the author had scattered commentaries and tidbits of information throughout the strips. An index at the end that cross-referenced strips based on either the plot or jokes would have been great so that you could easily find a particular strip that you read long back. Oh well... <br />Despite the cons, we should feel lucky to have this collection.
B00004STOZ|5.0|Keith Jarrett is incredibly gifted both as a painist and as a harpsichordist.  That he chose the harpsichord for his rendition of the Golberg Variations suggests that he found it capable of rendering a closer approximation of his ideal interpretation of these works.  Hearing it is indeed a great joy!
B00005RFAI|5.0|This album is fantastic, there isn't one song on it that I don't like. I'm a very big fan of pink and have been for ages, it was the song Family Portrait that got me interested in her, I loved it the first time I heard it. This is by far one of the best albums I've ever brought and listened to. \\"IT'S QUALITY\\"
B0007ZIYM4|5.0|As is quoted in the liner notes, \\"A wrong note played with the right intention is much to be preferred to the right note played with no soul\\" pretty much sums up what this album is all about.  The intent, obvious from the first note, is Passion and great quantities of it. <br /> <br />If the listener is one who, above all prefers precision and accuracy, look elsewhere.  If, however one craves soul and passion in a spirited performance, this recording will bring much pleasure, with many repeated listenings being inevitable. <br /> <br />Jansen's account is easily the most exciting performance I've yet heard of these much loved favorites. <br /> <br />Any moment wasted trying to decide whether to buy this album or not is another moment not basking in it's wonderful wash of sound.
B00000K0DV|5.0|If you're reading this review it probably means you're a fan of this genre and are looking for something nasty. Good for you. I haven't seen the full movie, I don't think I ever will, not my cup of tea.<br /><br />However, since you're here, I'll tell you a little story: this movie was playing on a tv at \\"exit\\", a punk club in chicago, back in '89, I caught 'the scene' out of the corner of my eye and immediately puked in my mouth. I had to sit down and have a glass of water. I wish I could wipe the memory from my brain. The end.<br /><br />Now, I can't think of a better endorsement of this film for a gorehound:<br /><br />\\"See 'The New York Ripper', it'll make you puke in your mouth!\\"<br /><br />And yet, here I am, after a long search to find out what the hell I saw back then. I can't tell you why, it's not like I'll ever watch it, and in a way, if I did, I imagine it may not do my memory of it justice, because when I think of it, I think it may be the most nasty thing I've ever seen. I'd hate to spoil that.<br /><br />But hey, you might like it, so I'll give it five stars, because you're here and you know you're gonna buy it anyway.<br /><br />BTW, the only other film that made me puke in my mouth is 'the grim reaper', but you probably already own that.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000002OCP|4.0|I bought this lp in 1968,(for $1.77) It was in the bargain bins at JC PENNY. I was 14, and this was my introduction to muddy.  OK I am very happy they released this on cd. It brings back a lot of fond memories. A lot of people slammed this album but I think it rocks. The sound quality of the cd is very good, but they edited out the cat screaming at the start of \\"tom cat\\" Anyway dont expect a traditional muddy waters album, but this is a lot of fun with the fuzz guitar, and driving drums. Now maybe they will release \\"after the rain\\" marshall chess's other cadet concept muddy waters album.
B000B0WO0I|5.0|Simply Red's new album is a fantastic blend of their older hits reinterpreted and including a new song (Perfect Love) in two versions. While the album title suggests that the songs have been \\"simplified\\", it might be true for the arrangements but the vocal performance of Mick Hucknall shines as on the original recordings (all of the songs were recorded in 2005). A great album for next year would be an \\"amplified\\" remix album, maybe it will happen! My favorite song is the stripped down version of Your Mirror and the Latin-flavored \\"Something Got Me Started\\".
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|If you don't love this movie i hope god strikes you down with a mighty blow. that being said, i doubt there will be any deaths because this movie is pure greatness. Think of your favorite thing in the whole world covered in chocolate and this movie still tops it. mind blowing everything. well worth the money. actually...you should buy like 8 just because!
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|Contrary to belief and contrary what every hardcore-gamers and \\"gore fest obsessed\\" moviegoers like to say, \\"Resident Evil\\" is an excellent \\"prelude\\" to the very source martial it is playing off of. (What many people do not realize, is that the decision to make Resident Evil different from the games was made by Constantin Film and Capcom and not by Paul W.S. Anderson).       I found Resident Evil incredibly hard four years ago to watch. Horror movies aren't my forte, therefore I never bothered to watch this. But to my great surprise - the movie wasn't that bad. And while it still holds the fear-factor for me, I can watch the movie now without worrying about frayed nerves afterward.                               The movie starts out slow placed with a disembodied narrator before switching to the main event in which the storyline will be taking place. From there the movie introduces the female protagonist, Alice Parks who awakens with no memory whatsoever. She wanders around the elaborate mansion with no clue about the surrounding things within the environment around her. And before she is able to get her head straight she is jumped by a \\"Cop\\" by the name of Matt Addison (\\"The Crow: Salvation\\"'s Eric Mabius), who is apprehended by several Commandos who swiftly invade the mansion demanding a report from the amnesiac Alice.         From there the Umbrella Commandos head down into a secret facility, \\"The Hive,\\" dragging along with them Alice and a handcuffed Matt. They also meet yet another amnesiac, Spencer Parks, whom they found upon making their way to the hive. As the movie progresses things start to go wrong when they shut down the RED QUEEN super computer.      The movie shows off what it does best, and that is the walking dead. And the utterly creepy thing about the undead in this movie, is that they're not creatures from another dimension, but former humans all killed for a senseless purpose, their bodies reanimated for one purpose: Feeding on the livinginhabitants (however, how they tell living from dead apart continues to be a mystery to me). This increases the creepy factor just a little bit more than usual. The acting (Spanning from minor to major, and undead) is amazing, never wooden or unrealistic for a moment.         This move had major talent for a cast of characters. Milla Jovovich's character Alice before \\"Apocalypse\\" is more relatable and much more likable, in the first movie than she was in the sequel which helped me understand her rigid and less feminine personality in the second movie. Broadway talens Martin Crewes, and James Purefoy (Spencer Parks) play out their small roles to the extent of their obvious screen talent, but Crewes' character (Chad Kaplan) turns out to be the more likable out of the two through out the movie. Colin Salmon (famous for his role in the 3 of the 1997-1999-2002 Jame Bond movies) plays the leading commando 'One' with his usual leader demeanor and atmopshere used in the James Bond films but with an American accent and more lines. Eric Mabius, famous for playing in 'odd-ball roles' in the usual \\"R\\" rated movies, turns out to be more believable as an actor in this movie than he has in previous roles. He plays out his character the cop with charm and actual humanity.             Michelle Rodriguez plays her usual \\"tough-gal\\" character (via \\"SWAT\\" and \\"GIRL FIGHT\\" among others) by the name of Rain Ocampo in this movie. Her equal balance of actual personality and granite type character plays off nicely with the character J.D (Pasquale Aleardi). The movie manages to be gruesome and bloody without crossing the \\"overkill\\" line (via all the other horror movies afterward, including the George A. Ramano movie remakes), it maintains the usual \\"jumpy scenes\\" common in a horror/action movie. And oddly enough, the music (done by the highly disagreed upon Marilyn Manson) suits this movie well, although there is a particular scene in which it begins to sound like a thousand bees buzzing inyour ears. It plays off electronic/techo/rock tempo quite nicely for the movie without crossing the line also.           Now as for the CGI animation for the Lickers and the schematic of the Hive: Its the best done for this kind of movie. Though at times the Licker does seem out of place in some scenes(he appears to come off the background instead of blending in with it), it otherwise flawlessly blends within the film. The Hive Schematic was usual 3D animation, its never painful to the eyes and it works well with what its got.        The Special features for the \\"DELUXE EDITION\\" reaches beyond the \\"SPECIAL EDITION\\" DVD, while still maintaining its Windscreen, subtitle, and language selection. The following which are:     1): Alternate ending with director Paul Anderson's video introduction  2): Clip compilation: Resident Evil: Apocalypse  3): Commentary by cast & filmmakers  4): Visual effects commentary  5): Costumes featurette  6): Featurette: Playing Dead: Resident Evil From Game to Screen. The list goes on.         All in all, this movie still scares me (slightly) still. However, I cannot deny its a cool movie I'd be willing to watch just for the scare. Paul W.S. Anderson did a good job directing and writing this movie. The acting is great from all the actors. The storyline is not hard to figure out but its great for this kind of movie and an absolute plus is that its not a complete carbon-copy/import/retelling of the game. It does a good job using references, atmosphere and locals of the game. Lastly, this movie is much longer and better than its sequel.----- [a 5 out of 5]
B000AU1NYW|5.0|I couldn't wait until I could get my hands on this album. Been tiered of listening to most of the so called music of today's generation (with some exception of-course) and when I finally got it, which is over 10 days now, I have not been able to stop listening to it. This album really grows on you and if you are fan, then it is even more of a treat. I have two kids, 14 and 9 and they have turned into a fan. They sing along and they tell me that it's grown on them.<br /><br />So, if you are thinking about it, I'd say go for it. Listen to it at least two or three times by yourself and turn it up loud. This will be an album that you'll listen to for a long time to come and make some really go memories (hopefully)
B000B2YQX4|2.0|Is this the band that brought us such marvels as Stripped, Blasphemous Rumours, Personal Jesus or Strange Love? The band that made such an impact on the 80's & virtually revolutionized pop music with albums like Black Celebration, Violator or Music For The Masses? I don't Think So...Those albums were almost perfect, every one better than the other until it reached a Climax (music for the masses, violator or Ultra), & then tragedy struck...i think it was when the band's main musician & programmer Alan Wilder left, to form Recoil. And i Think the guys lost their way, although i think ULTRA was one of their best albums to date, but then came such rubbish as Exciter(or the confusing Songs Of Faith & Devotion)At the time, I tought it was the time to say goodbye, to retire, the time to put a logical & unavoidable THE END for Depeche Mode, they had nothing more to offer, the magic was gone.  <br />Four years later, BOOM ! here they come again, i first heard the new album briefly in a record store, & thought it was Ok, better than Exciter...and bought it two days later...And at this very moment,i feel quite dissapointed with it, this is not the kind of album that i expected from DM, it sounds too predictable, simple, common, nothing magnificent or surprising, not to say creative, like previous gems on DM's History...the songs sound good, but there's something missing & unsatisfying for an old die hard fan like me & forgive me but, Damaged People is almost a Clone of Jesus Superstar's \\"I don't know how to love him\\" by Ivonne Elliman, IT really SUCKS!!, not the kind of song that one expects from the great Martin Gore. Macro another intent of being Avant Garde & Darkie, sounds curious almost like My Monument from the 2nd album by DM...but no it fails terribly a waste of time & space !!. the songs written by Dave Gahan are Ok, but let's see if he improves himself as  songwritter in future releases. Songs like Lillian, , The darkest Star, Suffer Well, or I want It All, sound ok,for a band of DM clones like Camouflage or Cause & Effect, but not for Depeche Mode. <br />Maybe for those who are new to the Modes, this may be their greatest album to date, but for old \\"sinth pop\\" fan like me, that grew with them, it's a mayor dissapointment, specially when other 80's acts, like New Order, Gary Numan or Soft Cell (like good wines do)have become more interesting \\"as time goes by\\".
078322933X|4.0|This movie is crazy good.  Marky Mark plays such an excellent psycho and Reese Whitherspoon does a great job of playing the innocent/rebel teen.  The suspense keeps building and building in this thriller for a dramatic ending.  An excellent movie and an excellent movie to own.
1401308201|5.0|This book is incredible!!!!! although it doesn't have the full liberattto, it is still amazing!!!the pictures have amazing resolution. i've always wanted to see wicked on broadway (i saw it in Los Angeles) and this book made me feel like i was there!! i also loved the account of each of the original broadway characters. it was wonderful to read about kristin chenoweth and idina menzel, whom are my favorite actresses!! thank you david cote and joan marcus for the wonderful pictures. i love this book!!!!
B000063UR1|1.0|This movie is unimaginably terrible.  Overacting, underacting, a very thin plot with no development, poorly edited, and overall just plain sucky.  The worst part is once you see the end of the movie you start questioning the whole reason for the movie to even have a reason for being made.  Nothing is accomplished, nothing is resolved.  This is just a bad, bad movie.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|This is Robert Plant's best solo album. We find the former voice of Led Zeppelin finding his sound for the first time. The funny thing is some of the songs sound like Zeppelin quality and sound better than Zeppelin's last few albums. Plant shows he doesn't need Jimmy Page to make a classic rock album. Favorites include Another Tribe, Shine It All Around, Tin Pan Valley, All The Kings Horses, Takamba, Dancing In Heaven, Let The Four Winds Blow, and Mighty Rearranger. Highly Highly Recommended.
0380729407|2.0|This novel is a coming-of-age tale of two thirteen-year-old boys, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade. A carnival arrives at their small town during October, the wrong time of the year for a carnival. Soon, it is apparent that this is no ordinary carnival. There is a maze of mirrors that drowns people with their fears about themselves, a tempting carousel that can both increase and decrease age, and a multitude of freaks that have fallen victim to these fears and temptations. The leader of the carnival is Mr. Dark, the Illustrated Man. Charles Halloway, Will Halloway's father, becomes the hero of the tale because he finds away to defeat the freaks: smiling and laughter. The freaks feed off of negative energy, so a laugh can render them useless and even dead. <br /> <br />The novel started out rather slowly. The beginning discourse was intriguing, but it just didn't hold my interest through a large section. The freaks and the supernatural events were hard to believe at first. They seemed to be too easily accepted in the fabric of the story when they were first introduced. The author spends a lot of time letting Charles Halloway talk. There were times when I just wanted him to shut up and do whatever it was he needed to do. <br /> <br />Despite the fact that Charles Halloway talked too much, he made a lot of interesting observations. There are beautiful passages in the book. I copied some out to remember them. I liked it that the main temptation, the carousel, played on the fear of death, the most common fear in anyone. <br /> <br />I have mixed feelings on whether I like this book or not. I give it a 2 1/2 out of 5.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Having been an owner of every one of the seasons from when they were first released on DVD, my initial reaction was anger.  But as with any product it gets better over time, and for that I commend HBO for making a DVD set that will stand the test of time.  The original product contains flimsy cases made of plastic, all but one of mine are in pieces from use, I plan on trying to make my own case for the show.  <br />   For the people who have the money or haven't invested in the show yet, I think this is a great set and wonderful value.  I only wish I could have waited to see the show in retrospect.  I did however have the advantage of seeing the show multiple times over even before this was released.
1400032717|4.0|Had difficulty at first following Christopher's way of thinking, but soon caught on.  The family seemed real, like people you know.  Enjoyed the subtle intrigue of Christopher's \\"detective\\" work, especially the surprises that come out of it.  An interesting novel with an unusual point of view that works surprisingly well.  Recommended.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|This is THE Batman movie that fans have been waiting to see. Christian Bale stars as Bruce Wayne, coming to grips with tragedy that befalls him by searching for life's meaning. It's a quest that will eventually lead him to become the masked vigilante Batman, who hides in the shadows dispelling his brand of justice. As this is the origin of Batman, there is a lot of setup, or in other words: There is a lot of story. It's not a slam bang, no time for air action film. It takes it's time allowing the viewer to understand the point of Wayne, why he would do what he does. A great supporting cast, of course, always helps and here we have Liam Neeson as Wayne's mentor Ducard, Morgan Freeman as Lucias Fox, a man who can just about invent anything, Michael Cain as trusted butler Alfred, and Cillian Murphy who absolutely steals the movie as Dr. Jonathan Crane. Props go to Christopher Nolan who has created a very believable Gotham City and a new look Batmobile which embarks on one of the best car chases ever captured on film. A little warning to parents: There are some very scary scenes throughout, so be advised. For everyone else, a great time to be had!!
B000008CSN|5.0|Words fail me,. . . almost. This is one of the ballsiest, bluseiest, rockingest albums ever. Duane Allman was a guitar GOD. At this point in his life Gregg Allman was the grittiest white blues singer I had ever heard. These tracks are pure gold and this maybe the BEST live album ever!<br /><br />Every cut is good but Stateboro Blues still blows me away and I had never heard anything like Whipping Post before or still to this day. This was the band at it's best and sadly it never came close again.
B00005JNQA|4.0|I found this movie to be done very well. There was a lot of suspense and made you think about what was happening. If you want a movie that leaves you with a good message at the end then do not miss this one.
B00006AW2P|4.0|The first US stones release blew me away. I was still getting into the Beatles when along came the Stones and turned my world upside down and started me on my appreciation of blues music.<br /><br />This first album was the first step. It was great then and it is still great now!
B0001ENY6M|4.0|great music just wish the songs were longer. the sound equalization is good too.
B000003BDY|5.0|This is a great example of why I became such a big fan of the Stones. This was the best album of the British invasion period. I submit that the first five Stones US albums were the best work they ever did, this was Brian Jones' Rolling Stones at their best.<br /><br />Brian was the heart and soul of the Stones and as good as they were/are they have never been better.<br /><br />2120 South Michigan Ave.(the address of Chess Records) was thier only instrumental and it sizzles. Way to go Nanker Phelge. Where have you gone?
B000002ADT|5.0|You can logically make the argument that improvisational music peaked in the fifties,thanks to 'Kind of Blue',which-recorded in March and April,1959- is a testament that the decade saved the best for last.It would've been nice to get  Red Garland into this;but Bill Evans is brilliant=as is 'Trane, Cannonball Adderley James Cobb on drums,Paul Chambers on bass-and Wynton Kelly, ,on piano for 'Freddy Freeloader.My only complaint is that these cats didn't stay together for at least another century;they were indispensible.
B000002J03|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY.....AN EXCELLENT SUPERB ALBUM. LED ZEPPELIN 2 KICKS ASS BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0009VRHLK|1.0|I heard that the original cut of the film featured Gallo washing a van in real time. Imagine that kind of movie, only with the eventful 'van washing' sequence removed. What's left amounts to: shots of the highway set to folk music, vince gallo riding a motorcycle, vince gallo visiting a pet shop, laughable scenes between vince gallo and some women, and the infamous and graphic ending. Keep in mind that the highway shots appear between all other sequences. <br /> <br />Firstly, I really didn't mind those highway bits - at first. In general I liked the music in this movie and the highway shots were fairly nice, but they might work better projected onto a wall in your house while you're doing something else. Something like the film equivalent of ambient music. <br /> <br />Secondly, the movie is excrutiatingly boring. I can't stress that enough. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate long movies, or subtle ones, but this is too much. You can only watch Vince Gallo bury his face in his hands so many times... <br /> <br />Thirdly, no matter what you read by Roger Ebert, the ending IS graphic and excessive. I'm not a prude and I think Tipper Gore is an idiot - but I did not need to see Chloe Sevigny give Vince full service. It doesn't serve the 'plot' either. <br /> <br />Lastly, once you see the ending (in which Vince Gallo's acting is a bit whiny and weak), the rest of the film makes sense and you ALMOST want to forgive it. You can ALMOST say that the movie has a point to it. Then you remember the agony that was the last hour and a half of your life and decide that you hate 'the Brown Bunny'.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|Ok I didn't see the original of this, so this is based completely on this version.  I saw this in the movies, and about half the way through, i knew i would own this movie.  Personally, not a huge fan of Sandler or Rock, but they are excellent in this movie.  It is very funny and touching at times.  Get a group of friends over, pop some popcorn, and sit down and watch a great movie that will have everyone laughing.
630460288X|5.0|I'm just gonna go ahead and say it - 'Demolition Man' is the best action movie of all time. It's got everything you want - explosions, humour, violence, Taco Bell, a cameo by Jesse Ventura and killer performances by Stallone and Snipes. You WILL feel the need to speak like the citizens of San Angeles after the movie is over. \\"What's your boggle?\\", \\"Fellow Greetings\\", \\"Joy-Joy Feelings\\", \\"Be Well\\" - ALL will be used by you after seeing this film. <br /> <br />Snipes kills me in this movie. His best delivered lines are: <br /> <br />\\"It's like two for the price of one!\\" and, <br /> <br />\\"Put another log on the fire!\\"
B000055ZDT|5.0|I can definately say after a month of listening to this disc, there is not ONE bad track on this album, seriously. \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\" is an exception, since it's a 40 second jam, so you can't exactly rate it. But every song on here screams with heavy, melodic, passionate doom music. <br /> <br />Amazing music, one of my favorite albums. Up there with \\"OK Computer\\" (Radiohead) and \\"Animals\\"(Pink Floyd).
0307276902|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book after all the \\"buzz\\" that was out there on it. I do admire James for his comitment to get clean and stay that way for 13 years. The book itself was just not a great read for me. I think if you have not gone through something like this it is hard for you to relate to it thus it was a slow read for me presonally. I would still recomened it to anyone suffering from addiction issues though.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Robot Hive is cool and intelligent with some great in-your-face guitar work. Definitely rocks.
B00080ZG10|4.0|It seems like filmmakers run into trouble when creating movies about someone's life. The problem that many filmmakers run into is the editing of their films. It is difficult to edit movies that are based on fictional matter, let alone a real person. Audience members tend to forget that many movies get edited from four or five hours to two. This done to please the audience. With that understanding, one dares to think of how long \\"The Aviator\\" was when it was originally finished. This movie is long.  <br /> <br />The first hour of the movie was slow. The first hour was necessary. As with most movies you want to understand the development of a character. However, people with Attention Deficit Disorder may want to be this warning in notice. The first hour really isn't that interesting.  <br /> <br />The last two hours of the film will make most viewers glad they stuck out the first one. It is within the last two hours of the film that bring the reality of history into a movie like atmosphere. Ironically, it appears as if there is a correlation within the plot of the movie and Martin Scorsese's making of the film. This was obviously and expensive film to produce. The main character within \\"The Aviator\\" was known for his extreme budgeting. It is with the glamour and glitz of this film that viewers will understand the glamour and glitz that the main character lived in. While there was obviously brilliance in the making of this film, one must understand who a film is being made for. In this case we have a long commercial film that many viewers simply won't grasp. It is with excess length that this film looses it strength. <br />
B000001FGG|5.0|\\"Wheels of Fire\\" is Cream's best album. The follow-up to \\"Disraeli Gears\\", this offering reveals Cream at the peak of their studio and live powers.  Their songwriting chops had improved significantly since \\"Disreali\\", and songs like \\"Those Were the Days\\", \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" and \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\" were like nothing they had ever written or recorded previously. On the original album release, this was a double LP, with record one being the studio album and record two being a live album recorded at the Fillmore. \\"Wheels\\" seduces the listener with a great mix of Classical Rock, Psychedelic Power Pop Rock, Blues Rock and Instrumental Music. Great instrumentation on the studio cuts like Glockenspiel and Cornet and incredible improv on the live side make this one of the decade's (60's) great works. I recently heard Clapton say that when he heard the solos in \\"Crossroads\\" on the live side of the record, he winced at how bad he thought that they were. Don't believe it. Those two solos are still among the greatest live improvs dedicated to vinyl in all of rock history(Others that comes to mind are Jimi Hendrix's solos in \\"Little Wing\\" off of the \\"Hendrix in the West\\" release and Duane Allman's final solos in \\"Mountain Jam\\" on \\"The Allman Bros. Live at the Fillmore East.\\" A must for 60's music lovers and truly a record of the era.
B00008OLIC|3.0|Nice job on this CD reissue - that is if you initially liked this lp when it first came out in 1989. Myself, I never was all that crazy about this (corporate) Motley Crue release. I mean to me 'Dr. Feelgood' was simply too commercial. Three way-over played tracks which are \\"Don't Go Away Mad\\", \\"Same 'Ol Situation\\" and the over-rated title cut \\"Dr. Feelgood\\". However all is not lost - as this Hip-O pressing gives you six (6) added bonus cuts. Believe that I actually like those extra tunes more than I do the actual album itself, including the demos for \\"Without You\\", the semi-rocking \\"Kickstart My Heart\\" and a tune that I had completely forgot about \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\". Maybe there's hope yet.
1401206905|5.0|My original rating for the story is actually 4 stars. But with all the awsome extras thrown into this stylish hard cover graphic novel it's hard to give it 4. The writing in this batman book is exceptional, Frank Miller realy does it again in the batman series. As for the art, the style is a little retro, but still impressive.<br /><br />This one is certainly worth buying, but if you want absolutely brilliant batman books, go for The dark knight returns, arkham asylum, and the long halloween. I reccomend this one in anyone's graphic novel collection, especialy if you like or LOVE batman.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|I am someone who grew up in the 80's and loved the classic gorey films such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I Spit on Your Grave, Friday the 13th just to name but a few.  I seen the underground and the commercial ones. If I wasn't at my local independant theatre on weekends watching a horror and martial arts double feature I was renting them from my local shop that carried all the underground stuff you could think of. I lived and breathed horror films. My mother thought I was nuts. Then in the mid 90's censorship hit hard and the gore in horror films ran dry.  Then unfortunately so did the brains of most directors.  Special effects took over for story lines and soon there was nothing to think about.  When SAW came in to theatres I skipped it, not wanting to believe the hype. Seeing the posters for pt 2 everyday going to work got me intrigued.  Then I saw this dvd which was on sale and it came with a free movie ticket for part 2 so I figured how could I go wrong.  <br />Let me tell you.... I am so sorry that I missed this in theatres.  It is hard to shock me.  I seen it all but RARE is the movie that makes me comment out loud, drop my jaw and not want to move in fear of missing something.  SAW did it.  This is an incredible film.  Intense visualization, good acting, good amount of gore in consideration of how much is censored now a days and finally something to make you think as well. Jigsaw is definitely a killer worth the ranks of Jason, Freddy and Leatherface!  Buy this movie without a thought.  Plus there is a free ticket for part 2 which EXPIRES on Dec 9th.  How can you go wrong?
0689865384|5.0|I loved this book so much I couldn't put it down! At first I thought it was a weird title and that the title was a little odd but it was worth it. I love how Westerfeld shows our society and how we're divided even though there is no special area for the pretty and the ugly. I mean it really taps into society's idea of pretty and ugly.
B00030590I|5.0|In 2002, Yimou Zhang directed the Chinese martial-arts film entitled \\"Hero\\", or \\"Ying Xiong\\" in transliterated Mandarin Chinese.  Released theatrically in the U.S. in 2004, the film's story centers around three assassins, a warrior and a king who are experts with martial arts in pre-unified China.  Each of the assassins are from the kingdom of Zhao and want to kill the king (Daoming Chen) of the neighboring kingdom known as Qin. As the film begins, the king of Qin has requested a visit from a nameless warrior (Jet Li) who claims to have defeated the assassins.  The nameless warrior enters a great empty hall and is told to sit about 50 paces from the king to tell his story.  The king sits on a raised platform. In front of the platform and separating him from the rest of the great hall are a hundred or more flickering oil-filled lamps shaped like small soldiers.  As the nameless soldier begins to tell his story about how he defeated the assassins, the film flashes back to a Zhao village with a massive Qin army approaching.  Inside the Zhao village is a school of calligraphy in which the assassins have come to live: Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Moon (Ziyi Zhang, who played the pivotal character of Jen Yu in the 2000 film \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\").  In this first version of the story with all of the Zhao people wearing red, the Qin army opens fire with a massive number of arrows shot from very long bows.  The arrows begin to destroy the village and the calligraphy school.  The assassins escape the onslaught, but are encountered by the nameless warrior who successfully defeats them.  Returning to the king of Qin's great hall, the king is suspicious of the nameless warrior's story and proceeds to tell what he believes really happened.  In this second version of the nameless warrior's battle with the three assassins, they all wear blue and a beautiful battle scene unfolds over a lake with floating choreography reminiscent of the 2000 film \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\".  Returning again to the king of Qin's great hall, the king becomes suspicious of the warrior's true intensions as the flickering oil lamps blow in a particular direction to warn the king.  It is here the final and more honest telling of the story begins with the three assassins and the nameless warrior all wearing white.  Here, Broken Sword explains why several years earlier he did not kill the king of Qin when he and Flying Snow had the opportunity to do so.  During this explanation the film flashes back several more years to the king of Qin's great hall, which is filled with green drapes.  With Broken Sword and Flying Snow each wearing green and taking on the king's massive army, Broken Sword engages in a personal battle with the king; but makes a surprising choice.  Here, at last, the full meaning of the story becomes clear as time shifts back to the present for a highly emotional ending. <br /> <br />With a combination of exquisite uses of color, beautiful cinematography, superb martial arts choreography and a complex story, \\"Hero\\" is a wonderful film to watch.  If you enjoyed films such as the 2000 \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" or the 2004 \\"The House of Flying Daggers\\" (in which Ziyi Zhang also starred), you will probably enjoy \\"Hero\\".  What is important to remember with \\"Hero\\" is the historical context for the film: the first emperor of China was the king of the kingdom of Qin, who successfully and brutally conquered the other former Chinese kingdoms to unify China. Other memorable characters in the film include Sky (Donnie Yen), the scholar (Liu Zhong Yuan), the old servant (Zheng Tia Yong), the general (Chang Xiao Yang) and the commander (Zhang Ya Kun).  Overall, I rate the 2002 film \\"Hero\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.
B0000029DD|5.0|i have millions of loving words to say about jeff buckley and this album, but ill make it short: this is the best album of all time..ageless beauty
B000002KB8|5.0|This is a great album.  What makes this great is that Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Bill were very motivated and hungary to get where they need to be.  What better than start off with this classic album.  I love old and NU metal, but if you are a metal fan you have to have this in your collection.  If you don't it is incomplete.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK computer is the sgt. pepper of my generation ; i consider it as Radioheads masterpiece. <br />This album deserves nothing less than 5 stars
B000002GJH|5.0|I originally bought this album in early 1991 long before Nirvana released Nevermind and Pearl Jam released Ten. I was then and still am now a huge fan of Chris Cornell. I loved Soundgarden then and bought anything that Cornell was involved in. Mother Love Bone was a favorite as well. When I initially listened to this album I had some songs that were my favorites but was not initially a fan of the whole album. After listening to the album several times there were songs that initially didn't pop out that I liked. This is a great album from start to finish. Hunger Strike of course became a hit almost a year after it was released because of the popularity of the Seattle bands at that time. Their are some other true gems on this album Call Me A Dog is a great song for Cornell to unleash his powerful voice. Times of Trouble still gives me chills to hear it now. That song is followed by two great songs that may not appear to be that great until you listen to them a few times but Wooden Jesus and Your Saviour are classics in my book. Cornell was going threw some very troubling issues at that particular time when these songs were written and recorded because he wrote a lot of songs during that time about faith. He also had the two songs on Soungarden's Badmotorfinger album, Jesus Christ Pose and Holy Water, that used religious imagery as well. If you don't have this album buy it and if you do have it pull it out once in a while and remind yourself how good this album is.
B0000039QP|4.0|After you're Ready To Die you want to see Life After Death as did The Notorious B.I.G. for the sophomore album title.  They put together 14 tracks of its original version and made an edited release of it.  This one starts off with the funky guitar licks of \\"Hypnotize\\".  Notorious has a fierce rapid fire flow to compete with the featured artist Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on \\"Notorious Thugs\\".  The mainstream, R&B feel of \\"I Love The Dough\\" featuring Jay-Z & Angela Winbush, made it apparent how to get it and what to do once you have it.  An excerpt of Schooly D.'s \\"P.S.K.\\" was done in a short rhyme interlude on \\"B.I.G. Interlude\\".  Biggie then reminisces over the death of friends on \\"Miss U\\".  Coming out with fellow Bad Boy mates on \\"Mo Money Mo Problems\\" featuring Puff Daddy & Mase they flow with their status and what comes along with success.  \\"Playa Hater\\" is a song where he 'sings' the entire song with the phrase \\"...you've been robbed...\\"  He gives step by step instructions on hustling with \\"Ten Commandments\\".  Bragging on his sexual prowess and endeavors, \\"Nasty Boy\\" is an up-tempo tune.  Giving hope and dreams a reality sense he shows that \\"Sky's The Limit\\".  The Brooklyn emcee gives it up to the West Coast state of California as he flows over a West Coast swing track on \\"Going Back To Cali\\".  It seems as he saw death approaching and his destiny as he claims \\"You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)\\".  R. Kelly helps on the R&B tune of no longer being laid back but insisting on the evening.  A shorter version of the original release, but is missing the unedited lyrics.  R.I.P.
B0000017CA|5.0|Possibly one of the best albums I've ever listened to.  However, Acid Bath is certainly an acquired taste.  Brilliantly and beautifully dark and melodic, every song on The Kite String Pops brings something powerful to the table.  The  band's own style varies, more or less, from song to song with lighter melodies like The Bones of Baby Dolls, and Scream of the Butterfly, and then deathmetal masterpieces like The God Machine and Toubabo Koomi. <br /> <br />I won't rate every individual song, Acid Bath is one of those bands that everyone will have a different favorite.  I will tell you my two personal favorites on this disc are Cheap Vodka and Bones of Baby Dolls.  All of Dax Riggs's lyrics are written by an unmistakable lyrical style that has its roots in various death metal bands, but also strangely in Leonard Cohen, T-Rex, and the Beatles.  The blend of moody lyrical styles with Dax Riggs's own darkness produces something truly unique. <br /> <br />I have heard criticisms of the use of instruments in Acid Bath.  I disagree with these, personally, as clearly the drummer is very talented as is demonstrated in many  of the songs obviously showcasing him.  Mike and Sammy are brilliant guitarists, both of them, with different flares and flavors of darkness...  Sammy more deathmetal, and Mike more expert at melodic and smooth dark guitar riffs.  Audie, may he rest in peace, used a heavy pick when playing bass, which produced a unique and mysterious, mechanical sound that could only work so well with Acid Bath's music.  Plus, you want credibility?  These guys lived in Swamps south of New Orleans, in houses on stilts where walking outside meant looking out for alligators.  That is just badass. <br /> <br />In short, I won't allow my bias to slip through and declare that Acid Bath is the best band of all time, that's a mistake to say.  However, I will say that in my opinion, they are a great band, and one of my very favorites for their unique grindcore/darkwave/deathmetal/hardcore/swamp rock style.  I recomend a look-see at Acid Bath, and if you don't like it after hearing the album a few times, fine, put away and save it for a rainy day.  The more you hear it, the more you'll one day grow to love it.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|How come this film (A star is born) is not available in England? Why doesn't it have subtitles for the deaf? <br />It is a one time fabulous film, but as I'm very hard of hearing, I like to have subtitles so I don't miss anything or upset the neighbours.  <br />
B00005JNQA|1.0|This might have been the first movie filmed inside the UN, but one can only hope that UN is not as stupid as the movie portrays it to be. The security checks were twisted. On the one hand, the entire UN building was evacuated because of a faulty metal detector and on the other hand, when it was known that a killer was in the building, security simply allowed the conference to continue. Sydney Pollack is a very intelligent individual, but here he lost his head once he realized he could film inside the UN.<br />Overall, I think the movie was pointless as it simply highlighted what we already knew. A lot of innocent people are being killed in Africa. A better alternative would be to watch the Lord of War. In there, at least, they make a mockery of what's happening in Africa.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|These guys know how to rock, but on the flipside they can also throwdown a good ballad...highly recomended for those of you who like that gloomy-themed genre      Notable Tracks:  -Blackout  -Sing For Absolution  -Hysteria  -Falling Away With You  -Thoughts Of A Dying Athiest
B00001OH80|5.0|This album is totally cocaine inspired music of 80-s. Performed with BIG style. Bowie is still perfect on this CD. Iggy's \\"Tonight\\" is wonderful white reggae and other covers is very weird too. Collector's must have. For the first time you may be little bored and disapointed, but please listen to the album again! And you feel yourself like 80-s top-manager from advertising agency in his new Ferrari and Rolex watches and nose full of snow.
0307276902|1.0|The only thing that amazed me about this book was the author's purported memory of his life during a protracted addiction period. It has been my experience that most severe addict's(yes that includes alcoholics) memory of actual events is substantially lacking. It is incomprehensible for most other addicts to believe that another addict, with such problems as  the author, can recall his addicted period of life with any degree of accuracy. Those that have experienced the torment of 'blackouts' will assuredly attest to this. If you don't know how you woke up where you did, how can you tell us how you got there? While 'high' on any of the drugs(yes, alcohol is one) mentioned the thought of such a memory is ludicrous. Regardless of my own personal experience, my opinion is derived from speaking with thousands of other addicts. While his story of his recovery may be accurate, the events leading to it are certainly to be held in question. There are few, if any, people in the early stages of detoxification that can recall with any certainty what happened to them while undergoing that process. This is particularly true of the type of addict the author claims to be.   <br />    I have always found it suspect when someone tells of their addiction and then receives such huge accolades and sums of money for doing so, just what was the motive? God bless him for remaining sober for all these years and more power to those that find help by reading his story BUT that is all it is, another story. A great piece of non-fiction, I think not. A decent novel perhaps.
B00005JKED|5.0|From the first 5 minutes till the last minute, I was shocked and gripped at what Alonzo woz forcing Hoyt to do by crossing the fine line of law and justice. I also thought Snoop Dogg's performance woz funny but too short, I really thought Dr. Dre's was excellent he needs an Oscar too. Eva Mendas looks and presence was sexy and lingering. This is the only movie she's nude in.
B000059XUP|5.0|Being as this is my first online review of any film, I thought that it would be fitting to review one of my favorite films of all time...  The Crow \\"City Of Angels\\".  To those \\"fans\\" that continue to slam this film, I offer you this question... \\"would you feel the same about this movie if Brandon Lee had played \\"Ashe\\" instead of Vincent Perez\\"?  I feel Mr. Perez gave the performance of a lifetime with this film (I am a major fan of all of his other work as well).  We get the dark and dirty of the first film, while seeing more of the myth this time around with Mr. Perez.  \\"Ashe\\" is a man that everyone knows can feel his own pain...  I mean who doesn't want to know more about how this comes about, who is choosen to come back, who completes there \\"mission\\", and who doesn't?  I mean does every \\"crow\\" get the job done or do some fail (as offered in the novel of this film)?  Being a major fan of this series, I know I am going to catch it for this next comment, but I would rate \\"City Of Angels\\" as the best of the series, with \\"Salvation\\" right behind it, and then the first \\"Crow\\", with \\"Wicked Prayer\\" bringing up the rear.  I know most will not agree with me, but then again that is why I get to write \\"my\\" review and not theirs.  \\"To know in your heart that love can conquer all, there is more power in that, than we could ever know\\"...  long live \\"The Crow\\".
B0000A7W14|5.0|Cuba Gooding Jr.'s best film he ever been in. The power of the film has yet to be matched as most modern interpretations of street life prove to be violent stylizations. While Singleton has taken a couple missteps along the way, this film still stands up rather well by todays standards. The motives and actions appear realistic, especially Doughboy's thirst for revenge. A good film, which not only helped improved Laurence Fishburne's career, but introduced us to Gooding Jr.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I will watch any 3 1/2 hour Bob Dylan documentary.<br /><br />I will watch anything directed by Marty Scorsese.<br /><br />Although Dylan proves himself to be the ultimate fibber, I am fascinated by anything that comes out of his mouth while talking or singing. He's been blowing smoke up everyone's behind since 1962 and I can't respect him more for doing so. Short of Axl Rose, I can't think of anyone who has sabotaged his career more and more, over and over, just to mess with us. But in Bob's case, each time he comes out looking more like a genius, while Axl looks for rent money.<br /><br />Bob Dylan will never give a straight answer. We all know that. So, why do we sit for 3 1/2 hours waiting for one? For the same reason we'd sit for 8 1/2 hours for one. If we got one, we'd quit waitin'.
B000007T1M|5.0|The heaviest, surrealist and best System Of A Down album ever!  On this album they easily trod the line between being serious and downright crazy!  The guitar riffs were so original and had more in common with Anthrax than Korn.  Although there were some very good nu metal bands in the nu metal bands in the 90's they were overlookeed because of the poor quality of some of the pick leaders (Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit.)  While sending out messages like contempories RATM they did it in their own unique way.   <br />If you found Mezmerize too soft this album is perfect for you.  The heavy riffs on \\"suite pee\\" and \\"Sugar!\\" made this album appealing to the thrash set as well as the nu metal crew.  While the more ethereal \\"Spiders\\" made this album commercial enough to be noticed.  The musicianship is so tight.   <br />Verdict;  If you thought the later SOAD were to soft, I would advise this album.
0345404475|5.0|This novel was written during the era when artificial intelligence research was built on the premise that there is some other element of human consciousness that sets our intelligence apart from the sterile calculations of the banks of computers.  In this novel, Phillip Dick chooses empathy as that other quality. <br /> <br />Science, if not science fiction, has since progressed.  The question of whether human intelligence expresses some ethereal other quality that can never be achieved by machines has been left to the philosophers and theologians.  Machines have beaten grandmasters at chess, and humans have eschewed the \\"soul\\" question in order to make use of the cognitive functions of which computers are indisputably capable. <br /> <br />In many ways, DADoES anticipated this day.  While operating on the assumption that there is some essential difference between human and android intelligence, Mr. Dick systematically minimizes that difference through the course of the novel.  Instead, what emerges is a world in which humans cling to an ever-diminishing distinction between themselves and their android counterparts in order to justify humans' treatment of the androids.   <br /> <br />As the distinctions between the humans and androids crumble, what is left is a world not dissimilar to the ugly episodes of civilizations last 500 or so years.  Androids do the dirty work, are strictly controlled, and are hunted down and killed if they escape.  The only justification for this treatment of androids is that there is some essential difference between us and them.  I think I have heard that story somewhere before.
6305882592|5.0|This is a mind-expanding movie from the era in which mind-expansion was actually considered desirable. Many social issues are addressed in this movie, while it keeps the watcher amused with terrific comedy.  <br /> <br />The story revolves around Harold, a rather lost youth on the verge of manhood, who has developed an obsession with death. He finds himself frequently at odds with the typical ideals of our society, as personified by his materialistic and rather aloof mother, a zealously patriotic uncle, and the girls his mother expects him to date. At a funeral, he meets Maude, an elderly woman who seems to share his interest in death, but who exhibits a surprisingly vigorous outlook on life. The director symbolically foreshadows this by showing Maude carrying a bright yellow umbrella like a flower amidst the field of black umbrellas at the funeral. Harold falls in love with the lively Maude, and I expect most viewers will, as well. The inimitable, unforgettable Maude is played wonderfully by Ruth Gordon, and Bud Cort also delivers an excellent performance as Harold. Much of the music in the film is that of Cat Stevens. <br /> <br />I give this movie my very highest recommendation. I found it both thought-provoking and hilarious when I first saw it in the early seventies, and it has remained one of my favorites for many years now. I promise you'll never view May-December romances quite the same after seeing this movie.
B00000478B|5.0|I give this set five stars because it exhaustively catalogues much of the studio work of one of Jazz's greatest artists.  The liner notes provide thorough insight into the the happenings at each session presented, along with many well-known biographical facts about Bird.  The result the most appropriate biography that the man could ever have hoped for, complete with samplings of his music at each stage of his career. <br /> <br />The reason that I say \\"not for everyone\\" is that this set contains a huuuuge number of outtakes and false starts.  There are about three or four discs in the set that could be put in your disc player at a party.  The remainder of the discs require very attentive and precise listening.  (Some may say that about all of Parker's music, but the reality is that some people like jazz for ambience more than for focused listening.) <br /> <br />I appreciate all of the outtakes because I use this set, along with my Omnibook and Real Book, as a source of inspiration for my musical development.  In that sense, the differences between the tracks that Mr. Parker selected and those that gathered dust on the studio shelf is quite elucidating.  By listening to the successive tracks in their chronological order, one can gain significant insight into the the musical thinking of one of jazz's giants. <br /> <br />If you are an aspiring jazz musician, or if you just happen to like a rigorous listening experience, then this set is for you.  If you want a lot of good Parker to put in the mix for your next cocktail hour, buy ten of his studio releases for roughly the same cost.
B000051Y0G|5.0|WOW, what memories this album brings back. The Very Best voice in the Industry has to this day never gotten her just rewards. I admire Cyndi very much, she always stayed true to her heart and made the music she wanted to, not what the record company's wanted her to make in order to sell mega records. She stayed true to her heart and sure, some of her albums did not sell to well. But, geez, do people listen to the words of all those songs she sings, they are so wonderful. Now Cyndi is on a comeback with the \\"at last\\" cd and now the Body electric, everyone \\"BUY IT\\" and let's get out there to see her in concert, she puts on an absolutely awesome show, i know, i go to them. This album is a classic, with some bonus stuff on it, purfect to have and just so nice to listen to, we will all feel young again. Just look at CYNDI on the new album cover, she looks absolutely amazing.  JUST BUY THIS ONE AND BUY THE BODY ACOUSTIC ON NOV 8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frank
B000B0WODA|5.0|Among the gradually over-populating space that is the brit pop/mild rock/indie scene, Franz Ferdinand stands out like a sore thumb. Overseas and home bands such as the Kasiser Chiefs, The Killers, The Magic Numbers, perhaps even the mighty Oasis or Coldplay simply cannot reproduce or overpower the catchy guitar rifts, beats and the drum metronome that define this simple yet effective band. It sounds out like a foghorn on a lonely channel - in a good way. <br /> <br />The only way to follow up the smash self titled debut \\"Franz Ferdinand\\" (a Mercury Prize Winner) was to deliver something of the same impecible standard, perhaps even surpassing it. That is what \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" is. <br /> <br />The Franz delives something fresh, something different to the rest of the bunch but whilst doing so, keeps in touch with the roots of that indie pop/rock scene. The opening track takes you off course of what the album is about, but the album certainly delivers the unexpected. No doubt that once you have read this review you have heard the wickedly addictive \\"Do You Want To\\" and that it has made you want to go out and buy, or download the rest of this splendid album. <br /> <br />Tracks like \\"Van Tango\\" and \\"Well That Was Easy\\" keep it out of touch of the rest of the following pack - a sharp, steady drum/bass line and the addictive vocals of lead singer Alex Kapranos & co perfectly echo what this band is all about - but the others get it going in the way that should be soon called \\"The Franz Way\\" <br /> <br />It's open to discussion whether or not this is better than the debut, but if it's just as good, than it is a success -  and I believe it is better. One thing to put in your stocking this Christmas is \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\"... and you won't regret it
0062502182|5.0|I have read this book almost three years back. But the same fresh feeling that one gets after reading any good book is still there in my mind. This book is for dreamers, not obviously for those who are day-dreamers. This is one of the few fictions i have read; otherwise i enjoy more of non-fiction, mostly philosophy and art.  Some how as i was reading this book i started relating it to \\"Jonathan Livingston seagull\\" .When \\"The alchemist would make you  feel how beautiful it is  to be  ambitious or dreamer, Jonathan Livingston seagull will  make you realize how beautiful its going be when you forget everything but you and the work that you love. Its not something to do with concentration...in fact its very ordinary word for the status of this book, it is a state of meditation where when you are flying (that's what seagull do here) you would reach such a state where you disappear but only flying remains. In other words you and the flying becomes one.Its more of an ecstatic state. <br />Many times for our problems we might be having solutions just right next us, but we would have to work a long way to reach the solution . Though once we find the solution that's so simple to discover, but the process that we under go is more beautiful than the solution itself.  That's all about this book \\"The alchemist\\" <br />When i was arguing with my wife about this book saying that this is a book of fiction, then she rightly said 'no, it's a philosophy that put into a fiction'. <br />One should read this book first and then \\"Jonathan Livingston seagull\\" because Jonathan Livingston seagull starts where \\"The alchemist ends\\"(not literally, but its true as far as philosophy of these books are concerned). <br />
B00008PX8P|5.0|There's not much about this set that I can say that hasn't already been said. It sticks with you, and multiple viewings do not wear away the grand majesty that is Led Zeppelin. The bonus footage is great on top of the concerts, the MSG stuff is the weakest on the DVD, but considering it was at the end of their 72 US tour you can't really complain too much that Plant sounds like his voice has had enough. There may be too many versions of \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" but then again, can you really have too many versions of \\"Dazed and Confused?\\" <br /> <br />This set will blow you away. Buy it. Now. If they double the price, still buy it. If they require that you give up your firstborn to view it, think it over, then buy it.
B000AY74OG|5.0|My six year old daughter and I loved it. We laughed thru out with the other kids and parents in the audience. I loved the penquin's more than she did, but most parents I spoke to felt the same way. Chris rock was great as was ben stiller and the rest of the cast. This wasn't the best ever of the new kids animation's out in the past few years but its one the best. My daughter talked about it for days afterwards to anyone who would listen. We even went to see it again the next weekend. She's never done that before and I've been talking her to the movies since she was three. We have all the stuffed animals and a few posters in her room. I'll defitently be adding this to our dvd collection.  <br /> <br />Highly recommmend this one for all kids.. and big kids too. IE: Single Dad's like me!! If your a parent and you didn't like this, then you probaly weren't raised watching Bugs Bunny cartoons...and you don't have a good sense of humor.. <br /> <br />We even went to our local Zoo so she could see the same animal's there as in the movie. I sang the song \\"I like to move it move it\\" at the monkey cage and I had my daughter sing along too!! We had a blast..  <br /> <br />Buy this.. You won't be sorry..
B00097DX3U|5.0|This album, is, oh, amazing! This follow-up to 2002's self-titled debut does not dissapoint. In general, the songs sound less forced,  more natural and congealed. Before, the pieces were awesome, but they didn't quite fit. Now the puzzle is about as complete as it can be. These guys are great and I hope that they keep turning out music like this, even if it takes another 3 or 4 years like this time around! The music just feels right. Tom Morello's guitar work does get a bit annoying at times, but in its abrasiveness often lies its charm. <br /> <br />Buy this album. Or steal it. Whatever it takes.
0316096199|4.0|\\"Lucky\\" is a recounting of the rape of Alice Sebold, who was a freshman at Syracuse University when she was raped.  It is a graphic, detailed account of the rape itself, as well as her life in the days and months after the event.  Sebold is faced with speaking with her family, professors, and friends about the event, and carrying on relationships with others, while still carrying the fact she was raped.  \\"Lucky\\" shows a rarity among rape victims, as Alice Sebold pursues the case and rapist, trying to get him off the streets and in jail.  \\"Lucky\\" is an extremly detailed, interesting book that paints the realistic story of the rape of a young woman and the changes in her life afterwards.  Strongly recommended by me, but also, a slight warning for those who may be a bit disturbed by the graphic details of the rape.
B00006RU5B|4.0|In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and it was good. On the eighth day, he created Audioslave. And it was good. And there was much rejoicing in the land.    Ok, this band is not quite of biblical proportions, but they're only a step or two below. With the exception of a few sub-par tracks (thats why this a 4-starrer and not a fiver) this is great first try. \\"Cochise,\\" \\"Show Me How to Live,\\" \\"Exploder,\\" \\"Shine On,\\" \\"I Am the Highway,\\" the parade of awesome tracks is seemingly endless. That said, things at times feel funny, like Cornell and the band aren't quite together on everything, but that's forgivable. However, there's an alternate cut of \\"I Am the Highway\\" floating around that is markedly better than the one that ended up on the album. But my complaints are generally few and minor.    Things would be more solid the second time around, but their brightest moments to date came in this slightly more scattershot, but very good, album.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|As a kid, I read more than a few Batman stories/adventures and agree that Batman is a dark, brooding and ominous figure to be feared by many.  That is his magic, so to speak.  But this is only a movie ladies and gentle-people!  Rather than burn good brain cells trying to analyze his character/persona, I merely suggest that you purchase the disk and decide for yourself whether the movie is worthy of the praise/disdain heaped upon it by others.  I paid money to see it (and was willing to pay to see it again!).  Buy the disk and enjoy it!  I know I do!  Five stars...
B00008OWZC|4.0|I have a hard time giving the Zep less than 4 stars for just about anything. Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice collection, but its somewhat lacking, especially after seeing the DVD set that was released at about the same time. Now that stuff is amazing. The stuff on the CD is just a notch below generally, Page and Plant hit more wrong notes here than on the DVD. Nevertheless, Led Zeppelin live is an experience that is, well, worth experiencing. If you really want to hear some great live material, get the DVD (skip over the MSG show) and you will be blown away. Buy this after you buy the DVD, if you find yourself needing more live Zep, but this CD set falls a little bit short of being essential.
B00062RCBW|5.0|I am STUNNED that this show is nearing its 20th anniversary.  Just in the past couple of months, I have been catching up on the old episodes; although I remember being thrilled by the show when it was first on the air, TV has gained so much in sophistication since then that I expected to have only a nostalgic interest in most of the shows.  To my delighted surprise, TNG stands up as fresh and invigorating TV even now.  Aided greatly by masterful performances by Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner, the show found its way past its uneven first two seasons, when it tried too hard to walk in the footsteps of the original series; then, in the third season, the show finds its characters and its voice and comes alive.  The pace is slower than on great current-day shows such as \\"Alias\\" and \\"Veronica Mars,\\" but that's the way TV was, then -- also, I find it sort of refreshing to see them taking so much time to just revel in small moments among the crew.  The third, fourth and fifth seasons of TNG are about as good as TV gets; though the last two years weren't as strong, there are still some knockout episodes, including one of the greatest series finales ever.   I can't afford this whole set, but if I ever win the lottery, this goes on my shelf.   <br /> <br />Top 10 Episodes: <br /> <br />1) \\"Best of Both Worlds,\\" parts one and two <br />2) \\"Sarek\\" <br />3) \\"Sins of the Father\\" <br />4) \\"Family\\" <br />5) \\"Chain of Command,\\" parts one and two <br />6) \\"Lower Decks\\" <br />7) \\"Hollow Pursuits\\" <br />8) \\"The First Duty\\" <br />9) \\"Parallels\\" <br />10) \\"Frame of Mind\\"
B000084T18|4.0|before you even think about listening to this album, forget anything you know about 50 cent. yes, he talks WAY too much to the press and is in over his head thinking he's better than kanye and ghostface, but all biases aside \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" is damn good. if albums like \\"...36 Chambers\\" and \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\" happen to be some of your favorites in their respective genres, you'll enjoy this piece of work. <br /> <br />the production on this album is great. dr. dre, eminem and sha money xl all fine tune this album to fit perfectly with 50's voice. but then again, what else would you expect from an album on shady/aftermath? <br /> <br />lyrically 50 cent can be really strong (\\"Many Men\\" especially) or get lazy and fall short (\\"P.I.M.P.\\"). fortunately, his flow and the production can usually help him out when he shows up weak. guest starring eminem and tony yayo (both of them drop sick verses) on \\"Don't Push Me\\" also makes up for his lackluster lyrics and flow on that appear on that track. <br /> <br />but even with its downsides, \\"Get Rich\\" is a strong first album that leaves 50 with a solid 4 star rating. the top tracks are: \\"Patiently Waiting\\", \\"Many Men\\", \\"High All the Time\\", \\"If I Can't\\", \\"21 Questions\\" and \\"Wanksta\\". that's six 5-star tracks with 7-8 solid songs and the rest that could have been left out.
B00006BTCA|5.0|In terms of sheer quality and attention to detail, Turn On The Bright Lights is one of the finest albums ever made. Supposedly, everyone seems to think that Interpol are nothing more than Joy Division clones. Far from the truth. Yes, you could list Joy Division as one of their major influences, but listen again. Does it really sound the exact same way? For one thing, Interpol, despite still being drenched in sorrow and heartbreak, is more fun, and sleeker than any Joy Division album. I know some people will kill me for saying this, but for my money, with some albums more albums better than Antics and on par with TOTBL, they will be even better than Joy Division. For some reason, there isn't so much controversy based around Good Charlotte! Let's face it, Interpol is the best new band to emerge since 2000. Everything is so desperate, so futile, and so yearning on this album that it fills the listener with sorrow. From the desperate chords of \\"Untitled\\", to the tear-filled vocals of \\"Leif Erickson\\", to the amped-up, yet almost distant chords of \\"Say Hello To The Angels\\", nothing speaks originality like \\"Turn On The Bright Lights\\". I have no problem saying that this is one of the top ten best albums I have ever heard, and the public needs to give it a chance.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a book that should be read by everyone as a young adult.  In fact, it should be read several times throughout your life to remind you of what's really important.  It is a story of love and loss, lessons taught and lessons learned.   <br />In this book Mitch Albom, a successful sports columist, makes contact with his former college professor who is now dying from ALS.  When Albom was in college, Morrie Schwartz was his favorite teacher.  Not only did he teach him in the classroom, he taught him important lessons about life outside the classroom. <br />Because of this, Albom really thought he had his priorites in order and his life planned out.  At Albom's graduation, Morrie said to him, \\"Mitch, you are one of the good ones. Will you stay in touch?\\"  Without hesitation, Album answered, \\"Of course.\\" As Mitch's career began to take off, the cares and concerns of life got in the way, and Mitch lost touch with his old mentor. Sixteen years later, when Mitch was watching Ted Koppel's Nightline on TV and he heard the words,\\"Who is Morrie Schwartz?\\" and his life would change forever. <br />Mitch began to visit Morrie on Tuesday, sharing stories from the past, gaining wisdom for the future, and facing the pain of a slow death.  The vital lessons Mitch learned from this dying man were recorded.  These lessons are important reading for people all over the world.
B000069AUI|5.0|Scientist is one of my fav songs ever. I think a few more albums by them. Ill be saying there one of the best bands ever.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I can't find this film moving in any degree. It is disturbingly graphic but not in an entertaining way (e.g. Pulp Fiction) or in a way that shakes the viewer's consciousness (e.g. the Grey Zone). Instead it presents a deeply dogmatic and outdated view of the final days of Jesus.  I am non religious yet I have seen films that opened the minds of viewers on the subject of Jesus from The Last Temptation of Christ to The Gospel According to Saint Matthew to Jesus of Montreal. What we have here instead is Mel Gibson's Birth of a Nation with a disturbing ideology that was savagely and appropriately lampooned on South Park's \\"The Passion of the Jew\\" (kudos to Blockbuster for putting the two titles for rent next to each other).
0862641438|5.0|Hey grown-ups, this book is for you too! Take a vacation from the stress of grown-up life and remind yourself of what you once knew as a child.

B00000F6FN|5.0|This is among the most effective horror movies (specifically of the witch-coven genre) ever made, thanks to skillful handling of suspense, some excellent acting, effective sets, and an appropriately maddening soundtrack. There are holes in the story and it's in no way believable, but it's such ghastly fun one hardly minds. Some of the blood-red photography is a bit much, but all in all this Italian film (well dubbed into English) is an irresistible piece of fright-mongering, leagues ahead of most of its American counterparts. I am not even a horror-movie junkie, but this highly atmospheric number has lingered in my memories... it's just wonderfully creepy and weird and unsettling!
B000002UB6|5.0|How come everone thinks the album is so bad. Its not the best but I still think its really good.  <br />Two of us - is good but I think it could've been better <br />Dig a Pony - Great Song <br />Across the Universe - I still love this song after listening to it a thousand times <br />I me mine - Kinda long but I still like it <br />Dig it - Short but good <br />Let it be - One of my favorites <br />Maggie mae - I don't know what people like about this song. I can't stand it <br />I've got a feeling - I love how this song starts <br />One after 909 - Really fast for a beatles song, but it's really good <br />The Long and Winding Road - I don't like this song too much. It's to slow for me <br />For you blue - This song needs much more credit <br />Get Back - My favorite from the album <br /> <br />Overall this is defiantly one of my favorite beatles albums. If you don't have this buy it now. <br />Recommended Beatles Albums: <br />Revolver <br />Magical Mystery Tour <br />Abbey Road
0030839939|3.0|The coverage in this book is quite complete for a survey of the field, however it is presented in a way that makes it very difficult to assimilate.  If you have a choice, go for Kittel's book instead (or in addition if you've chosen solid state as your specialty already).
B000002BQK|5.0|I'm Janets man and even I've never even given her first seven albums five stars in a row. The only thing is she dosent use her voice to the full extent anymore and that's all it's lacking. The best songs are Honey, Breakdown, and ofcourse Butterfly.

B00005R5G9|1.0|C'est le mot qui me convient le mieux pour donner une apprciation sur ce film . Comdie plaisante et prvisible des annes 80 que l'on oublie presque instantanment aprs l'avoir vue . A recommander aux amateurs de bluettes sentimentales mais les autres risquent de rester sur leur faim !
B0000028P8|5.0|Man, well she's not like the rest when she's live she's live she sounds exactly the same. And the I'll Be there duet was just great. I strongly recomend this album.
B0009UC810|4.0|If you have the Blue Brothers, Collectors Edition that came out in 2000, then you already have the extended edition of the movie that is on this title.  The difference being that the extras are different. <br /> <br />If you are a true Blue Brothers fan, then you won't mind getting this edition to add to your collection but if you have the other copy then you might be able to save yourself some $$.
B000002AVF|5.0|once again, you go girl. this in my opinion is not as good as the first four but its still a really good album.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I'm just writing this review to offset all of the stupid trolls that don't even like Slipknot giving them 1 star just to piss people off. <br /> <br />As far as the album, true, it's not as heavy as the other two but it shows a new side of Slipknot that's very exciting and interesting.  I can't wait for the new album next year.  They're supposedly going to start recording in January 2006 once they finish off the tour.  If The Subliminal Verses is any indication of Slipknot's future we have a lot to look forward to.
B0007N1AI6|2.0|Very slowish in most parts, uninspired lyrics, and quite Ozzfest friendly (obviously to appeal to the new generation \\"metalheads\\" that waltz around town sporting AC/DC shirts they bought at Target). More in the same vein as the Ripper albums, which were very forgettable. Looks like Painkiller was truly the last of the finest.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I'm not going to go into too much detail covering the album because you can read other people's reviews for that.  What I will say is that this album is phenomenal, both the hard and soft albums.  Ten years down the road, when you ask a music critic what the best work of the Foo was during their career they will be hard pressed not to choose this album.  If you aren't sure whether or not you want to buy this album, just read everyone's reviews on here.  They are consistently receiving 4.5-5 stars for the music itself.  The ONLY reason people are not giving this album a 5 is because of the copyright mess (which is simple to get around).  Believe me, this album is worth every penny and more that you would spend on it.   <br /> <br />Highlights <br />Hard Disc - Best Of You, DOA, Resolve, End Over End <br />Soft Disc - What If I Do?, Miracle, Another Round, On The Mend <br /> <br />Please pay no attention to the poor reviews because they are purely due to the copyright issues, NOT THE ALBUM ITSELF!
B00006I53S|4.0|I've been using it for about 5 months now. Other than a bit of wobble, which I notice mostly when hiking on rugged terrain but not on normal walking around, the lens is pretty solid. (The Canon EW-78BII lens hood is great but contributes to the end wobble.) It is on the heavy side (mine is attached to the 20D) and after an hour or so of hand-holding it, my elbows start to twinge. On the plus side, the range is great. I love close-ups and the macro is fantastic and gets in almost as close as a similar lens on my film EOS 620 WITH a macro extender. The depth of field at the full macro is almost nonexistent, which I guess is to be expected, so the slightest variation in distance is the difference between getting it and missing it. Not easy to do handheld with a lens of this heft, so for this kind of work, a tripod and remote are essential. But, for a relatively inexpensive cost, this lens can produce some tremendous close-ups and still pull back for a nice broad landscape. Definitely a good choice for amateurs and semi-pros.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Leon: The Professional is a splendid thriller with some of the best acting in a while. It has Luc Besson (The Fifth Element) giving his directorial debut and Natalie Portman making her actorial debut. First off, let me tell you that it isn't an action movie like Blockbuster says it is. No, it's a touching drama that can turn into an action movie or thriller in an instant.  <br />It has Jean Reno staring as Leon, a hitman, the best of his kind. He lives in an apartment building and his room is accross from little Mathilda (Natalie Portman), a 12 year old girl who is abused by her parents. That is soon to change though. An insane killer cop (Gary Oldman) literally whipes out her whole family because of some drugs. Mathilda is devastated..not for her parents but for her little brother. She moves in with Leon and they bond. Leon teaches her how to \\"clean\\" (kill people) and she teaches him how to read, cook, etc.. These moments are the best..the interaction between Leon and her. Splendid to watch.  <br />The movie is a sad tale of love and war..a wonderful thriller...or drama..or action... <br />The acting is amazing notably by Gary Oldman who steals the show. He is in my opinion the best secondary actor of all time and his savage attitude and his darkly comic moments add so much to this movie.  <br />The score is fantastic with a great beath that goes along with the flow of the movie. Now for the end. The ending is awesome packing action a plenty and for guys, it's just really cool. The last part with the plant is touching and a great conclusion and this movie is a definite success..and one of my faves. So, please watch this genius movie with everything be it drama, comedy, action, suspense and a GENIUS cast.
B000AOJ9X0|4.0|You're darn right I got this blues CD.<br /><br />But I totally agree. I got off the ship on the last few CDs from him.<br /><br />I'm a huge blues fan, and I shout out my props to the old delta guys, but that style of sparse picking is not my forte.<br /><br />I like guys like Luther Allison, and Magic Sam before him, who define the electric Chicago blues style, as an example.<br /><br />That said, the All Music Guide (my music bible) dissed the new CD somewhat, for Guy reaching for the stars \\"Buddy's buddies\\"; naming Santana, Keith Richard, John Mayer, and a few odd luminaries who grace several tracks.<br /><br />That didn't stop me from enjoying this.<br /><br />The first 3 cuts knocked me out. Guy does a stellar Curtis Mayfield falsetto on the opener, takes on \\"Wicked\\" Wilson Pickett's' \\"99 & a 1/2 Just Won't Do\\" with gusto, and sings a winner of his own on the 3rd cut. I liked them all very much, and e-mailed my posse immediately to tell them to stop what they were doing and get a copy.<br /><br />I'd rate the next 5 or 6 cuts with a litle less excitement but they all sounded good. The AMG knocks Carlos Santana's involvement on the CD because it sounds like...wait for it... a Santana song. Fair enough. John Fogerty was unsuccessfully sued for sounding like CCR once too. Fogerty won the case, mind you.<br /><br />I like the CD. Many folks would like to see Buddy just record a CD with his touring band and get back to what he did on the late 80's thru the mid 90's (Feels Like Rain, Damn Right, etc.), but the trend these days (i.e. Santana, B.B. King 80th B-Day, Les Paul & Friends, Herbie Hancock's new one) is to load up a legend with a star studded arsenal of guests. By the way, Clapton is omnipresent these days, isn't he?<br /><br />I also liked:<br /><br />Somebody's Sleeping in my Bed<br /><br />On a Saturday Night<br /><br />Cut You Loose<br /><br />Treat your self to this CD, I give it to opposable thumbs up!!!
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I'll give Donnie Darkko credit for his character's challenge to the status quo of school, family and friends. There's even some humor in it. Then there's his interesting ideas about time travel but after that his character becomes such a s*** head and the movie takes a dive. You're better off renting it, rather than owing it.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I bought the VHS of this in 98 or 99, and watched it many times between then and now.  I have waited patiently for the DVD, and at long last here it comes!  If you like PF, you will LOVE this concert.  I can hardly wait for the extras that are on it.  The reviewer who said the concert sucks is no PF fan. This is the best  concert footage of PF out there, even better than Pompeii, and  the extras alone promise to be at least as good as THE MAKING OF DSOTM DVD.  I'm farming out the kids and inviting friends over for the weekend of December 17th!<br />((Now that I have had it since last July (2006) it is a great dvd, but doesn't match the pre sale hype.  If you like the Floyd, you'll like this DVD))
B00005JO0J|3.0|I've watched Firefly, the series this movie was based off of. I even have two copies of the boxed set (one for backup). I've also corrupted a few friends with it... <br /> <br />But when I saw this movie, my heart was broken. <br /> <br />The mystery of Book's real identity before he became a Shepherd is never expanded on. Too much is revealed about the Reavers, and in my opinion the movie focused too much on them. The show was about getting a job, getting paid, mixed with some thought evoking scenarios, which the movie touched on - especially with the crew's regard to River, - but I was hoping for a direct continuation of where the show left off, not several years down the road when the characters have darken and come down to live or die (too much of the latter). <br /> <br />It's sad to see it take such a downward spiral (along with Whedon's other favorites Buffy and Angel). The mix of dark, humor , and ingeneous plot twists is still there from the original series, and I do appreciate that, but if I were to watch it again, I'd stop right after Mal rescues Inara, and picture the rest of it myself. <br /> <br />My advice: see it in the theater or rent it, then decide. <br /> <br />If you happen to be one of those people who likes watching characters die and everything coming down to the nitty-gritty, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br />Personally, I'll stick to my Firefly.
B000002JSJ|2.0|When reading the other reviews of this album, I was quite surprised at how many people gave it a high rating- especially the amount that gave it 5 stars. Even though I am a big fan of Led Zeppelin's music and like practically every song on all of their previous albums, I have to say that Presence approaches being awful. Even the reviews that have rated this album poorly have cited Achilles Last Stand and Nobody's Fault But Mine as standouts. Neither Achilles nor Nobody's Fault But Mine even nearly approaches the incredible heights LZ reached with their earlier songs. Achilles is a fairly decent song, but it is just way too long. Don't get me wrong, I'm not the impatient type who's not willing to listen to a long epic song. For example, I love the 11-minute song In My Time of Dying on the album Physical Graffiti. However, I can't stand it when songs are artificially made long for the sole purpose of trying to pass something off as an epic song. I agree with one reviewer who said that this song should be 4 or 5 minutes shorter because of its repetitive nature. But, again, Achilles has its moments and some PARTS of it are genuinely good, but all in all it is too long and repetitive.  On the other hand, I completely disagree with those who say that Nobody's Fault But Mine is a standout. While it is kind of cool the way Robert Plant says \\"nobody's fault but mine,\\" the rest of the song is subpar. When he vocalizes with the guitar over and over and over, it annoys me to no end.  I think its awesome when he vocalizes with Page's guitar-playing on other LZ songs, but here it just sounds tacky and is, again, repetitive. However, as bad as Nobody's Fault But Mine is, the rest of the songs on the album are even worse. In fact, theyre so bad that theyre not worth reviewing. Just suffice it to say that they suck. A friend of mine once said that Tea for One was ok, though I'll have to somewhat disagree with him on that, too. Again, its just too damn long. Also, I have to admit that I'm a sucker for the blues epic, but even to me its apparent that this song is rather formulaic. I'm surprised nobody's mentioned that this song sounds uncannily similar to Since I've Been Loving You on Led Zeppelin 3.    In conclusion, NONE of the songs on this album are great. The only reason why I do not regret buying it is that I wanted to have all of their studio albums. I thought about just giving this album 2 stars, but I felt kind of guilty and decided on the moderate merits of Achilles Last Stand that it deserved a 2.5. This is one of the two albums I would buy last in the LZ collection- Coda is the other one.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|Alright... long time Death Cab fan here (and no, that doesn't mean Transatlantacism).  Let me say before you read this review that I simply love everything that this band and/or Ben does.  This album, however, did not at all live up to the expectations that I had for a follow up to Transatlanticism. <br /> <br />And no, I don't think they \\"sold out\\".  Quit whining. <br /> <br />This album is a bit of a departure for the band, and I see it as a failed experiment of sorts.  It is lacking the winding, twisting, elaborate guitar work that (for me) really makes their music complete... the guitars are, in many of these songs, replaced with cheesy-ish synths and electric pianos.  Lyrically, Gibbard is still pretty top-notch, but a few of the songs (Soul Meets Body, Someday You Will Be Loved, What Sarah Said) are a little cheesier than normal, and almost delve into lame \\"describe-a-sad-situation\\" songs rather than his normal \\"use-unbelievable-imagery-and-metaphors-to-make-you-depressed\\" songs.  Hell, the whole album has a bit of cheese to it.  I feel like a few of the songs had the potential to be amazing, but the band (as a previous reviewer said) seemed a bit restrained... I'm thinking of Summer Skin and Brothers in particular here.   <br /> <br />This album is good... really good in fact.  If you heard this album without ever hearing Death Cab before, most likely you would say \\"oh, my\\" and buy four copies.  I guess I just had the bar set a bit too high after Transatlanticism.   <br /> <br />When it comes down to it, if you are not familiar with Death Cab, buy We Have the Facts or Transatlanticism before you buy this album.  But make sure that you buy this album, eventually.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|'Once Was Not' hasn't received as much hype as I might've anticipated.  Though their stock has declined in recent years, Cryptopsy still have two of the most revered DM albums of the 90's, and are reunited with their long gone, much loved vocalist.  Personally, I never much cared about the whole Disalvo-Lord Worm issue, but I was still pretty excited for this album.  And I wasn't disappointed, and I, for one, think that 'Once Was Not' is superior to either 'None So Vile' or 'Whisper Supremacy', and is definitely one of the best albums of the year.<br /><br />I've always had unusual taste when it came to production on modern albums, and this tendency comes out again here.  So, while a great many people seem very down on the production on this album, I think it's excellent.  It's sufficiently clear while still being dense and suffocating, giving it a very slight black metalish flavor, and I like the punchy, immediate drum sound. (The drum sound is cheaper sounding than on most modern albums, but I don't much are for the overproduced, overly thick drum sound you often get nowadays.)  Yeah, it doesn't have as much low-end as you'd usually want with a DM album, but the middle is powerful enough that I don't think it matter much.<br /><br />Again, I differ with common opinion, as I was never particularly in love with Lord Worm's vocals, yet I think that his performance here is better than before.  He's moved to a more midranged growl, as opposed to his ultra-low growl from before. (I've always disliked the ultra-bassy growlers, so I suppose Lord Worm's earlier performances deserve some credit for being any good at all.)  Still, I don't find him particularly extraordinary, but he's more than serviceable.  He does write some of the more interesting DM lyrics around, not that that kinda thing matters much.<br /><br />In the end, the things which separated Cryptopsy from the pack remain: stronger dynamics and riffwriting, an occasional sense for melody, more genuine energy emotion.  Overall, the sound is nothing particularly new, but they throw in a few unexpected things, like some samples and synths, a nice classical guitar intro, some spoken word sections, a easterny jam kinda thing towards the end and just a few other melodic little non sequitirs thrown in here or there.  This stuff isn't prominent enough to throw the integrity of the album into question, not by a long shot.  But it does spice things up some, making this album not seem overlong at nearly 50 minutes.  Most DM bands couldn't dream of making an album this length that didn't get real boring at some point.<br /><br />The songs are consistently strong, though it's occasionally a bit tough to describe them specifically, as is often the case with DM.  After the pretty, evocative intro we're treated to 'In the Kingdom...', a fine old piece of Cryptopsy style devastation and technical precision.  Auburn is the lone guitarist now, but he fills in just fine, and Mournier reminds us why he's the best drummer in DM.  He's as wild and unpredictable as ever, a great relief from the average DM drummer.  Oddly enough, the most interesting tracks are at the end.  The twin epics 'Keeping the Cadaver Dogs Busy' and 'Angelskingarden' are probably the two best tracks, adding in nice shreds of melody over the aural devastation.  The former has a fun, very short jazzy intro and an actually recognizable chorus, while the latter has a stunning, melodic solo over top of some synth work.  'The Pestilence that Walketh in Darkness' is another risky, controversial track, but I think it works, combining some  spoken word parts, clean guitar and more straightforward, vaguely melodic riffing along side your typical Cryptopsy stuff.  The closer, 'Endless Cemetery' ramps up the melodicism even more, with another gorgeous solo and some melodeathy harmonizing, all without sissifying the song too much, as actual melodeath bands often do.<br /><br />Anyway, that's it.

B000A88EVE|5.0|PLEASE NOTE: THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN FOR THE CRITERION DVD NOT FOR THE REISSUE BY LIONSGATE ON BLU-RAY AND DVD. AMAZON HAS PUT THIS REVIEW WITH THE LATEST REISSUE.<br /><br />It was an odd year. 1976 saw the release of Logan's Run with its occasionally heavy handed parable about the youth culture, Ralph Bakshi's Wizards gathered steam at the box office and included a trailer for some movie called Star Wars. Along came Nicolas Roeg with his arthouse science fiction epic and totally mystified everyone. David Bowie is perfect as the alien in this classic science fiction film. He's left his arid, dying planet and come to Earth in hopes that some of &#34;his&#34; inventions could create enough capital so that he can take resources from our planet to save his.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Bowie's character pretends to be human all too well--he's sucked into the very flaws that cripple humanity. He becomes a victim of our culture rather than master of it. Roeg's film is fragmented and spooky (particularly the scene where Candy Clark discovers that Bowie's character has various attachments to make him seem human). The visually unsettling photography and editing help bring an edge to the film. Roeg manages to fuse science fiction to his European art sensibilities very well. In fact, Man is probably Roeg's most powerful film outside of Don't Look Now his gothic take on the horror film.<br /><br />I'll get to the point about the difference between the excellent Anchor Bay release and the Criterion release. Both studios had released this film for the first time (there was a previous Fox-Lorber bare bones edition). The Criterion edition looks sharper with better clarity and richer color than the Anchor Bay edition. Detail is better on the Criterion edition and there appears that the Anchor Bay release wasn't digitally restored as the colors are a bit muted and faded in some sequences. Both feature the full length European cut that Roeg intended for the US market as well. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound mix for the Anchor Bay is superior to the 2.0 original soundtrack on the Criterion. The entire sound system is used nicely but keep in mind this was never meant to sound as aggressive as the 5.1 ES (or 6.1) releases of more recent movies.<br /><br />As to the extras, both have excellent extras. The Anchor Bay features a short documentary &#34;Watching the Alien&#34; (a great play on words related to one of Bowie's songs as well as the film), the original theatrical trailer, TV spots, talent bios, a good poster and still gallery as well as Paul Mayersberg's original screenplay in DVD-ROM format. All of these are great extras to be sure and are included on the second disc which allows for a higher bit rate for the movie and, hence, very good video as well. A note about the packaging--Anchor Bay's edition of the movie was fine but came in a very flimsy case with a slip over sleeve. When you took that off the movie and extras disc were held by flimsy plastic holder. The exterior had an image from the original poster and there was a short booklet included as well discussing the film. While normally I could care less about packaging it does bug me when it's as poorly designed as this one which seems like a compromise between an Amray (hard plastic) and snapcase (what Warner used until recently for all their releases). It doesn't stand up to wear and tear well and the discs could potential fall out.<br /><br />Criterion's transfer is a new, restored high definition digital transfer supervised by Roeg (which explains the color corrections compared to the Anchor Bay edition which was pulled from restored negatives but done three years before). The audio commentary isn't new but is from 1992 (I believe it may be the same one on the original Criterion laserdisc release) and features Roeg and star David Bowie recorded together and Buck Henry recorded on his own. The commentary track is exceptional but that will only matter if commentary tracks are important to you. Some folks never listen to them and never take more than a cursory look at the extras. The second disc includes excellent audio interviews with May Routh who designed the costumes and production designer Brian Eatwell. There's another audio interview with author Walter Tevis recorded in 1984 in which Tevis discusses his novel and the film. There's some great stills, behind-the-scenes photos dominate these and were taken by David James. This section features an introduction by James. The trailers are included as is Tevis' original novel. Finally there's a 28 page critical essay by Graham Fuller about the film and an appreciation of novelist Tevis by another novelist Jack Matthews.  Criterion's packaging has the movie in a hard Amray two disc holder and, in turn, within a cardboard cover that houses the movie and the novel. It's very nice and will stand up a better to wear and tear.<br /><br />Both versions have their strong points. If you purchased the Anchor Bay edition and are satisfied with the exceptional transfer, then you may not want to purchase this new set. The crisper, sharper images and richer colors for the Criterion is the strong selling point while the audio 5.1 on the Anchor Bay has nice presence and sounds better than the audio mix for the Criterion edition. The extras for both are quite good although the commentary track gives the Criterion edition the edge in my mind. The image quality and color are better on the Criterion Edition of &#34;Man&#34; but the Anchor Bay remixed sound has the edge for audio. If you don't have the Anchor Bay or are looking to upgrade to a better looking picture, the Criterion is the stronger of the two. Criterion wins by a nose due to the extra featurettes and audio commentary as well as the Roeg supervised transfer.never take more than a cursory look at the extras.

B0000062GK|5.0|This album took me awhile to get into, but it really is fantastic.  None of the songs have lyrics, it's all about the electric guitar.  Some of the songs jam, and some are more mellow, beautiful peices.  There are a couple duds that I never listen to (namely, \\"Trundrumbalind\\" and \\"Raspberry Delta Jam-V\\", and \\"Up In The Sky\\" I also usually skip), but the rest of the songs are fantastic.  \\"Train Of Angels\\" is the best of the bunch, along with \\"Love Thing\\" (gorgeous).  \\"Time\\" is also a fantastic, dreamy track, \\"A Piece Of Liquid\\" is relaxing and sounds like something you'd listen to in the caribbean before it goes into some cool \\"night-time-sounding\\" soloing.  It's impossible not to tap your feet during \\"Psycho Monkey\\" or \\"House Full Of Bullets\\",and I love the awesome playing at 1:40 in \\"Secret Prayer\\".  \\"With Jupiter In Mind\\" and \\"Crystal Planet\\" are great space-themed rockers, and \\"Lights Of Heaven\\" is one of Joe's best.     If you only buy ONE Satriani album, I first and formost recommend The Electric Anthology and Surfing With The Alien, but then I also recommend you pick up Crystal Planet, and Time Machine (not the most consistent album, but there are some here that you simply can't miss).
0711225176|4.0|I bought this book as a gift for a Mucha fan.  It's a great price for such a beautiful hardcover book.  The high quality glossy pages vividly exhibit the many prints and photographs represented.  There is also ample and varied biographical information about Alphonse Mucha's life and career.  It's a great book for any art-nuveau fan.
B00005JNQA|4.0|Nicole Kidman plays a United Nations interpreter who overhears a plot to assassinate a dictator from her native country in Africa, where her family was brutally murdered.  Sean Penn is the CIA agent assigned to the case.  At first, he doubts Kidman's story and he subjects her to a lie detector test.  The U.S. security agencies are determined that an assassination will not take place on U.S. soil, but it is difficult to tell the good guys (or in Kidman's case, girls) from the bad ones.  This is a well-done movie with plenty of political intrigue and a growing relationship and mutual sharing of grief between Kidman and Penn.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I thought this movie was fantastic!  The story was great,and the acting was incredible, especially from Haley Joel Osment!  With 9 out of 10 movies being garbage nowadays, this was a real pleasant surprise.  It's a very sad movie, but it's so well made, and the acting all around is sensational! In my opinion, Haley is one of, if not the best child actor I've ever seen!  Don't listen to the bad reviews.  This movie is a real gem you won't soon forget!
0743454537|4.0|Jodi Picoult writes books about current and relevant topics.  This one is about a young girl named Anna whose parents genetically engineered her so that she could serve as a donor for her older sister Kate, who suffers from a rare form of leukemia.  Anna goes to a lawyer requesting medical emancipation from her parents so that she does not have to donate a kidney to her sister.  The first 3/4 of the book is masterfully written with well-drawn characters whose point of view is presented in alternating chapters.  Each point of view is certainly understandable; from Sara, the mother, who will do anything to save her daughter Kate, to Jesse, the brother, who is on a rebellious path of self-destruction in response to the guilt and anger he feels because of his sister's illness.  The ethical questions that this poses are certainly something that society will have to deal with as long as genetic engineering is allowed to occur.  The book is very believable to this point and would certainly rate 5 stars except for the unfortunate double twist in the plot at the end.
B000002U82|5.0|Okay, I've said some pretty harsh things about Pink Floyd (and this album) in the past. But I'm willing to take them all back. But am I doing this as a play to earn precious \\"helpful\\" votes? Hell, no. My opinion is mine, and what others think of it doesn't matter to me. My musical tastes have expanded since I last reviewed (and listened to) The Dark Side of the Moon. I've gained an appreciation for experimentation in music.<br /><br />Is The Dark Side of the Moon my favorite album? No. I STILL can't get into Any Color You Like, and don't think I ever will. But there are plenty of great songs on this album. Money was the big hit, and a song I've always loved. Great bassline, awesome guitar and sax solos, and fantastic anti-corporate lyrics. Classic stuff. I've also always liked the dreamy Us and Them, particularly the sax and antiwar lyrics. Time is another winner, with more great guitar and enraged wordplay. But there are some highlights outside of those three hits. The cinematic closer Eclipse; pseudo-Syd Barrett tribute (and pseudo title track) Brain Damage, which deals with insanity; The Great Gig in the Sky and Speak to Me/Breathe. This album has an excellent flow, pretty much one long song. And the constant sound effects (clocks ticking at the start of Time; cash register kicking off Money; flights being announced during On the Run) are brilliant. Great stuff, though it took me awhile to realize it.<br /><br />Also recommended: Piper at the Gates of Dawn and Wish You Were Here.
B000002OX7|5.0|The first time I heard this album I was hooked for life . <br />I only found out later the songs were connected thematically , but that doesn't concern me to be honest , as I listen to the album for the songs , each standing on their own . <br /> <br />You don't need the extra songs , but the remastering was welcome , as this music pushes your speakers . A song will have delicate piano work by Nicky Hopkins which may then turn into a full on rock groove .  <br /> <br />There is both fine acoustic and electric guitar work by Pete . John's bass was very well recorded and holds things together . Keith's drums will push the songs into your memory . <br />Roger's singing is without equal - honest , touching and exciting . <br /> <br />Not to mention the fine three part harmonies by Pete , John and Roger . <br /> <br />What an album ! <br /> <br />I play this on the road a lot - but be warned . <br />It is explosive at times and makes you go faster . <br />Buy and hear not only a classic , but an enjoyable record that is affecting and human - forever . <br />I will always love it - I hope you get a chance to listen to and enjoy it .
B0009S4IHY|5.0|For the most part, I like my martial arts films to be as realistic as possible, but I have no problem taking a walk on the cinematic wild side, especially when the special effects are as impressive as those in this film.  Kung Fu Hustle can't be compared to any other single movie or genre.  Regardless of its excesses, the martial arts action in the film is something to behold.  Underneath all of the comedy and over-the-top visual delights (and it can be almost cartoonish at times), there's also a seriousness to the film.  It's all about good vs. evil, self-realization, and stepping up to meet your destiny.  And, as much as I hate to say it, I thought the ending was quite sweet.  The extraordinary special effects dominate the film and any viewer's discussion of it, but don't let that fool you into thinking there isn't a substantive story behind all of the flash.<br /><br />The toughest hombres around are the members of the Two Axe Gang; put a Japanese face on John Dillinger, give him a pair of axes, and you've the old-time mobster look and feel of these guys down.  They usually leave the slum areas alone, but Pig Sty Alley, run by a seemingly wimpy landlord and the toughest landlady you'd ever want to meet, ends up in the gang's crosshairs thanks to a couple of bad guy wannabes (and perpetual screwups) trying to insinuate themselves into the gang.  Sing (Stephen Chow) desperately wants to be a bad guy, having paid a price as a child for trying to live up to his destiny (a rather questionable one, at that) of bringing peace to the world.  The landlady's mean attitude isn't enough to hold off untold dozens of axe-wielding gangsters, but the town is saved by three kung fu masters who had moved there in search of a peaceful life.  Rest assured there are repercussions, as the Two Axe Gang brings in some of the world's most deadly killers to exact revenge - starting with a pair of musicians with a unique, decidedly deadly playing style.  Later, they have Sing engineer a breakout of the Beast, the deadliest killer of them all.  He doesn't look like much, but the Beast is an almost unstoppable force.  The only person who can possibly take him on with any chance of success is a natural-born, kung fu genius - and those are pretty darn rare.<br /><br />The special effects of the many fight scenes go way beyond the kind of wire work seen in, say, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and also out-Matrix The Matrix; on occasion, you'll see stuff right out of Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  Does this make the movie too goofy for its own good?  Somehow, it really doesn't.  If you're going to go to the extreme with your action, you might as well go all the way - and that is most certainly what Kung Fu Hustle does.  From a chase right out of Road Runner cartoons to the perfectly ridiculous Toad Style of fighting perfected by the Beast, you'll laugh - but you'll also be in awe at how well the scenes play.<br /><br />Basically, Kung Fu Hustle is just a complete hoot of a movie.  As writer, director, and star, Stephen Chow has produced a pure winner capable of entertaining fans across a range of genres.  Even he cannot steal the limelight from Leung Siu Lung, however, as this landlady, with a cigarette perpetually hanging out of her mouth, truly roars - both literally and figuratively.f the Beast, the deadliest killer of them all.

B000002I2I|5.0|Even though the Doors' first album was a fine start , they did have a tendency to go off the deep end in their next few albums . This album is very similar to the early Beatles albums , not in musical style , but in presenting short sharp songs . <br /> <br />For this reason , it is one of my favourite albums . <br />There are quite a few different textures , including rock , blues and jazz . <br />Highly recommended for those who like their music straight up . If you are new to the Doors , I would suggest you start with their first album , then try this and LA WOMAN .
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This two-disc set is a great collection.  As others have noted, the first disc is more lively and fast-paced, while the second is full of ballads and slow-paced songs.  The first disc naturally captured my ear more quickly than the 2nd due to the stronger beats.  While at first I found the 2nd one to be a bit on the dull side, it certainly has grown on me and now I think I enjoy it more than the 1st: it seems to have more \\"soul\\" to it and more skilled.  Basically the two discs are a perfect ying-yang if you ask me.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|After about a month with the new cd I realised how much I really didn't like it. Lots of it is repetitive and annoying. There are only a few good songs, and they're all being ruined thanks to the radio. The first and second albums are the only worth listening to. Thank you radio, for producing disposable music.
B000002HEP|5.0|This album is the essence of simple hard, riff-heavy rock, call it stoner rock if you will - whatever genre - this will raise the hairs on the back of your neck, in a style only the rock gods in the olden days could. This was my first Kyuss album and remains my favourite after going through their discography (which, isn't really much of a feat, it is tragically small). The album's structure is of three pieces, each containing at least three songs, almost creating a medley. At first this structure frustrated me, it wasn't that accessible if I wanted to listen to a part of each long piece, but overall it creates a flow to the album, almost giving it three movements each representing different ideas and all musically diverse.<br /><br />The first piece kicks of with \\"Gardenia\\" through a powerful muddy, down-tuned riff which progresses through different variations until Garcia's vocals kick in. His voice is brutally raw yet melodic at the same time. I've read some reviewers complaining about his lack of variation, but to me his voice is just perfect, complementing the heavy old-school guitars. \\"Gardenia\\" is a mighty opening blow, full of crunching riffs that engulf the listener in a thick haze of distortion. \\"Asteroid\\" is a superb instrumental, something Kyuss like to throw into the albums. It's somewhat progressive in style, built around a simple theme with some mighty crescendos thanks to Homme's advanced song structuring and mighty guitar tone.<br /><br />\\"Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoopa\\" and \\"100 degrees\\" are typical Kyuss rockers, again combining great riffs and melodies. \\"Space Cadet\\" then follows halfway through piece two, and what a tremendous surprise it is, an utterly beautiful moving ballad. The guitar playing is amongst the finest on the album and Garcia's vocals are, I would argue, diverse to the usual delivery - soft and tender. The piece washes over in its seven-minute entirety almost too quickly, fortunately though it leads into my other favourite of the album, the driving \\"Demon Cleaner\\". On this one Garcia's vocals have a dreamy aspect to them, recalling the tripped out desert feel. Along with Homme's relentless riffing, this song is simply stunning.<br /><br />Piece three is probably my least favourite out of the three, but is still a thundering tour-de-force of riffs and melodies. \\"Odyssey\\" is one of the most aggressive, confrontational pieces on the album, highlighted by Garcia's overwhelming delivery, launching himself into the lines `once you return from the belly of the beast/ you're never quite the same'. \\"Whitewater\\" is a fine way to close the album, a personal highlight for me. It slowly builds to a monumental riff.<br /><br />This album is quite simply powerful, 'listen without distraction' it says in the liner notes, I wouldn't worry about that, this is truly engulfing stuff. For fans of old school rock and metal, and fans of metal in general, try this band immediately.ng \\"Demon Cleaner\\".

B000BT97AO|5.0|(This is based on the theatrical release of MirrorMask which is currently in theaters, 10/30/05)<br /><br />With a little help from Neil Gaiman's masterful writing, and Dave McKean's able artistry and direction, the Jim Henson Company makes a fantasy-filled return to the silver screen.<br /><br />I was a big fan of The Labyrinth and, even more so, The Dark Crystal in the `80's. The excellent puppetry work combined with human characters was a novel idea, far beyond Sesame Street, and formatted more for the adult who has a kid's mentality. I was curious to see how The Henson Company might have advanced in the intervening years, and I wasn't disappointed. Gone are the puppets (to the chagrin of some) and in their place are CGI screens that boggle the mind - a living tapestry that slowly trundles by.<br /><br />Creating screen shots that mimic a painter's canvas, this movie is pure eye-candy (think Alice In Wonderland meets Van Gogh). Although the opening few minutes felt more TV-esque than magical, they were quickly whisked away by the sumptuous middle and ending of the film.<br /><br />The story: Helena, a teenage circus performer along with her mother and father, is having the usual surges of defiance. She doesn't want to be in the circus anymore, and she and her mother have a heated argument in which Helena wishes her mother dead. And during the evenings performance under the big top, Joanne, Helena's mother, collapses and falls into a coma. It is quickly discovered that she has something seriously wrong with her (although it's never defined, a brain tumor is easily surmised). Helena is riddled with guilt over her nasty words and falls asleep one night, and wakes up in a world of muted colors and magical creatures. Giant stone beings, masked love-interests, idiot cat-sphinxes, and a growing darkness that threatens to envelope this alternate world.<br /><br />As Helena moves her way through this strange land, we begin to understand that she isn't asleep nor dreaming. This is real. But she's traded places with another, less likable Helena who is destroying her life back in the \\"normal\\" world. Helena sees this \\"other her\\" through the drawings she's done that decorate her bedroom wall. She looks through sketched windows, watching helplessly as the \\"bad\\" Helena argues with her father, makes out with a boy on her bed, and generally wreaks havoc.<br /><br />It is soon discovered that the reason the world the good Helena now inhabits is falling into darkness is because of the imbalance created by the trading of places by the two Helenas, and our heroine has to find something called the MirrorMask to help set things right. The search is a puzzling heroes journey that pulls her deeper and closer to a wickedly dark queen. Helena struggles with growing up and becoming a stronger person as she walks, runs, and flies through this surreal landscape, trying to get back to her family and, most importantly, to her mother's sickbed.<br /><br />This is a great movie for adults to take their teens to. It'll give them something to discuss as their children grow and have to face the muted colors of adulthood.<br /><br />[The film is now playing in limited release at many art theaters and comes highly recommended]nor dreaming.

B000002JPA|3.0|I've really tried with this album, but every time I listen it just thwacks me in the face with its massive 80's perm. Quite simply this album is becoming dated.<br /><br />As for the music, well, the general sound of it is horribly clich&eacute;d of 80's rock, the Bon Jovi guitar sound and dull, thuddy, synth-like drums. Not to mention a rather too melodramatic performance on...well...every song by LaBrie, I really don't mind his vocals on latter releases, but here he just sounds like a hippo is viciously churning his nuts into small shards of micro-testes.<br /><br />Granted there are some high points, the musicianship is, despite sounding like musical gore, flooring in places, the ability is certainly there. For me they only really put that ability into solid sounding music in latter releases, peaking with `Scenes From A Memory'. `Pull Me Under' is not half bad; given a freshener and an updated sound it would probably be one of DT's finest songs. `Take The Time' starts promising, but just wanders around and has a rather cringing chorus. `Metropolis Part 1' is the standout, in that I can listen to it without wincing, and deservedly got the sequel in `Scenes...'. Aside from that, the rest of the album is full of nasty, cheese-ridden songs that despite the obvious musicianship, just fall on their faces.<br /><br />I'm probably being extremely harsh here, I just feel DT are capable of wondrous music at times, and this isn't it.

B00003CX5P|5.0|I don't understand why fans always seem to cut down this movie as much as they do. I have been a fan for many years and have never had a problem with this film at all. In fact, I've seen this movie many times, last time was two days ago, and the movie is as fresh as it was when I saw it the first day in theaters. The story really has matured and has taken on a serious storyline. Anakin turning evil after all is a serious topic.<br /><br />The movie is very well done with incredible special effects, the CGI characters do not bother me at all and I feel you can get more emotion out of a CGI character than you can with a puppet any day. Those who deny this are just fooling themselves. Could you imagine them trying to flap Watto's wings if he were a muppet? He never would have flown if he were because it would have been very difficult to do. I praise the decision to use CGI in this film; some scenes are very beautiful because of it.<br /><br />The storyline is great. I loved the new characters; I don't think we will ever forget about Darth Maul and Qui-Gon, both very interesting characters.<br /><br />The musical score to this film is the best. \\"Duel of the Fates\\", the song it plays when Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are fighting Maul, is one of the best original pieces of music I have heard in years.<br /><br />Overall, this film is underrated and will gain more respect as the years go by. It's worth seeing by all. Why I say that the DVD version is better is that it has more scenes in the movie that aren't on the VHS version for some reason. So to get more out of the movie, it's better to go with the DVD, not to mention all of the bonus features which are always excellent
B000002KDO|4.0|Sabbath made it well known that they were masters of their instruments when this album was released.  This being their third album, they showed a dark side to them.  While there isn't much on this record that is as dark as, say the song Black Sabbath, there is something of the overall mood that comes across as dark.  Maybe it's the sound of the production, the guitars, the riffs and Ozzy's haunting and original vocals.  Classic Sabbath songs such as Sweet leaf and Children of the Grave are the most well known of the bunch, but the album is a pleasure to listen to from start to finish.  After Forever has a classic riff that makes its mark on the record.  It's definitely a great CD to add to your collection.  The only downside is that it isn't as good as Paranoid and that the Instrumentals are not as good as some of their others such as Rat Salad (again from paranoid).  This is one of the great Sabbath records and I feel that anything Ozzy did while spending time in Black Sabbath is great.  It's their golden era.  It's the classic Sabbath.  It's elemental, it's beautiful, it's mystic, it's heavy, it's relaxing, and it is all that is Metal.  Definitely a must have if you are looking for talented musicians, the only reason I don't give this five stars is because it isn't as good as Paranoid or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and the two instrumentals are a little weak, other than that it is perfect.  Hoped this helped.

1857989384|5.0|This is a wonderful and highly original novel about a mentally challenged man named Charlie who wanted to be smart. One day, his wish was granted. A group of scientists selected him for an experimental operation that raised his intelligence to genius level. Suddenly, Charlie found himself transformed, and life, as he knew it, changed.<br /><br />His story is told entirely through Charlie's eyes and perceptions in the form of progress reports. The reader actually sees the change in Charlie take place, as his progress reports become more complex, well written, and filled with the angst of personal discovery and growth, as well as with his gradual awareness of his amazing and accelerated intellectual development.<br /><br />The progress reports are a wonderful contrivance for facilitating the story, and the reader is one with Charlie on his voyage of self-discovery. What happens to Charlie in the long run is profoundly moving and thought provoking. It is no wonder that this author was the recipient of the Nebula Award, which is given by the Science Fiction Writers of America for having written the Best Novel of the Year. This is definitely a book well worth reading.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I must say this edition of the titanic is a VAST improvment over the last horrid dvd release. The picture and sound have been greatly improved, the dts track is amazing! as is the 5.1 dolby digital track. The picture quality is some of the best I have ever seen when paired with a HDTV. The movie is spread across 2 disks while this may bother some it does not bother me. The extras are nice, while not spectacular they do the job well. It would have been nice for the deleted scenes to have been added into the movie as a special edition much like aliens and the abyss but like james cameron said he thinks this is the best possible cut of the film. If your any kind of a movie buff then you should pick this up without any thought.

B00006JJ51|5.0|I would like to start off by saying that this album changed the way rap records were made forever. A lot of rappers after N.W.A tried to copy their concepts and ideas and even glorified many of the things they talked about. If you want the real thing listen to this album..If you're into \\"50 Cent\\",\\"Nelly\\", and \\"Lil Jon\\" you probably won't enjoy this and it'll probably blow your skull out..This is gangsta rap at its finest. On the short list of greatest rap albums of all time, its easily in the top 5 and will be until the end of time..Every song has something fresh and good about it and every rapper in the group has his own unique style..Although Eazy E is probably the worst member cause he didnt write his own lyrics, he still is very enjoyable to listen to. <br /> <br />1.\\"Straight Outta Compton\\" 10/10- great song to start the album off with.Ice Cube is the star of this 1. <br />Fav Line:\\"Heres a murder rap to keep ya dancin, <br />with a crime record like Charles Manson\\" <br /> <br />2.\\"F--- The Police\\" 10/10- my favorite song on this album. The song that got them famous.. <br /> <br />3.\\"Gangsta Gangsta\\" 10/10- again Ice Cube steals the show..The beat is so good. <br /> <br />4.\\"If It ain't Ruff\\" 9/10- MC Ren's solo..makes you wonder why his solo career didn't take off like the other members' did. <br /> <br />5.\\"Parental Discretion Iz Advised\\" 8.5/10- orginal, I must say. <br /> <br />6.\\"8 ball(remix) 9/10-samples and beats are classic. <br /> <br />7.\\"Something like that\\" 9/10- Shows why Dre was the most intregal part of this group. <br /> <br />8.\\"Express Yourself\\" 10/10- the only song on here with no cursing and one of the most powerful songs on this album. <br /> <br />9.\\"Compton's In the House(remix)\\"- 10/10- classic <br /> <br />10.\\"i Aint the one\\"- 10/10: Ice Cube tears it up here telling how he won't get used by any women <br /> <br />11.\\"Dopeman(remix)\\" 9/10: Hook must be listened to <br /> <br />12.\\"Quiet On tha set\\" 8.5/10 <br /> <br />13.Something 2 dance 2: 9/10- beat is really catchy..good samples and good way to end this album <br /> <br />14.\\"Express Yourself(extended mix)\\" 9/10- I prefer the orginal <br /> <br />15.Bonus Beats 8/10- unecessary <br /> <br />16.\\"Straight Outta Compton(extended mix)\\" 9/10- I prefer the orginal. <br /> <br />17.\\"A B---- is a B----\\" 10/10- was on their 1st album <br /> <br />You need to listen to every song to truley appreciate it...
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I revel at the fact that DM's albums are never hugely commercial. Never overplayed or overexposed. PTA is another prime example. For a band that consistently puts out original records with a huge catalog of songs that I can replay and never tire of, is a real testament to why their dynamic chemistry works. Even in the post Alan Wilder era, their music continues to evolve and mature. For example, Dave's songwriting contribution of tracks \\"Suffer Well\\", \\"I Want it All\\" and \\"Nothing is Impossible\\" shows that they're willing venture down different avenues and take risks. Unique love songs with beautiful harmonies, consistent religious imagery and undertones and synth/guitar blends that can't be matched. <br /> <br />Granted I don't usually love every single track, I would hate a record that was void of Martin's solos or lacked a mixture of songs that didn't showcase the range in Dave's voice. The best thing about their music is I grow to love and appreciate these songs even years later. I doubt I will grow weary of PTA anytime soon. Considering it's been 4 years since Exciter, they're not a band to cut records for the the sake of mass consumption. I'm happy that not everyone will fall over themselves for DM's music. I can take quiet enjoyment in listening to their music and understanding why they've continued to exist over the last 25 years.  <br />
B000067IZ3|5.0|This fascinating, all-star look at the world of illegal drugs loosely weaves several stories together, showing drug dealers, buyers, and those who work to stop the drugs.

The script emphasizes character development and I really got caught up in the stories. Each vignette is compelling and memorable, and the script wisely leaves each story unresolved. \\"Traffic\\" won four Academy Awards, including Best Director for Steven Soderbergh.  This is a serious, thought-provoking film.<br /><br />Kona
B0009UC7H0|5.0|The movie is really good, fast paced, great Civil War battle(could have been longer with a minting scene, good music, but it could have been extended in many scenes, the Kitty plane crash was cutout while seemingly unimportant(it is in the deleted scenes tho) in the movies should be added into extended release. The boat chase should have had multiple angles and close ups of the boat crashes. Scene changes are too rapid. A blending of scene changes would create a more enjoyable and fluid viewing especially the beautiful desert scenes. It's good that the Director Breck Eisner, son of the evil ex-disney warlord Micheal Eisner, makes a go of it big time. I am looking forward to the Sahara extended edition.  <br />The Kingdom of Heaven movie has the same problems with cut short scenes, but I understand the extended version is due 1st Quarter 2006 which will correct the short falls.
B000AJJNOK|1.0|I can't wait to the ghetto thugged out black man goes out of style. I haven't seen a real black man since my grandfathers generation and believe me his generation knew about real struggles. This generation raps about struggles that are only self inflicted and self inflammed. They can't even define the word REAL yet they use it in all of their songs. The glorification that 50 Cent and other ignorant fools like him give to \\"The Hood\\" is disgusting. So you are from the ghetto, woopty f******g doo! You don't live in the ghetto anymore! So why are you singing that same damn song? Just because something is real it doesn't mean that it's worth rapping about. Real is pimples on the face of a thirteen year old. Who wants to rap about that? Real is diarrhea in the depends of a senior citizen. Still it's disgusting and who wants to hear about it, let alone rap about it. That's the way I feel about rappers like 50 Cent. So if you sleep with lots of women, so if you don't give them money, so if you have orgies, so, you use to sell dope,(well you should probably still be in jail) so if you were shot fifty times (you survived just to torture us with bad music). Still it's disgusting and I don't want to hear about it. America's making dumb illiterate fools like this rich. They have nothing to offer anyone. Now young people, stop buying this sh*t and listening to it in your cars as you ride down the street. I can't tell you how many times I've driven down the street and heard young white kids listening to this sh*t. You guys are the ones putting money in these fools pocket. Most black people don't buy this crap because we know it's stupid and listening to this crap doesn't make you look cool. And shame on you parents who allow your children to ride around and sit in their rooms listening to this sh*t. 'Nuf said.
B00002SWEM|5.0|I just bougth not one but two of these DVDs, one for me and one for a very good friend of mine that knows and truly appreciates this music. <br />This is a dream come true for these great musicians. It is particularly touching after knowing that Ibrahim Ferrer has just passed away two months ago, but he didn't leave us without great records of his unique and magnificent voice. <br />If you love Cuban music, don't hesitate, buy it. <br />--Jorge
B000AL730O|1.0|Simply put, this is one of the five worst albums/CD's I've ever heard and I've listened to well over five thousand of them. I'm a 40 year Beatles fan and am not at all anti-McCartney. This \\"music\\" is bland, lifeless and duller than a speech by Dick Cheney. After reading all the glowing pre-release hoopla, I was literally stunned by how weak this music is.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed, this album brings some very repetitive beats and sometimes lyrics. This LP also lacks any real meaning, most of the songs have no points at all. But as always there are some good points on this album. <br /> <br />Notable Tracks <br /> <br />\\"Git Up\\":  <br />Eminem starts this song with some very fast rhyme that will make you have to hit the Play button again on your MP3 player. Swifty then hits the next verse very well, delivering more fast paced well woven rhymes. The final verse is even better than the first two with Kuniva bringing some tight lyrics, perhaps one of his best verses ever. Despite Eminems great verse and chorus Kuniva brings it on this track. <br />Best Performance: Kuniva <br /> <br />\\"6 In the Mornin'\\": <br />This song starts off excellent, Eminem brings a heavy first verse that leads into a solid catchy chorus. Swifty brings the next verse which is also very good, the flow is great in this verse. Kuniva brings yet another short but fantastic verse here, try to play this verse and catch every word the first time, you won't. Kon Artis takes the last verse, this verse starts off strong but dies off at the end. Em kills his first verse and follows it up with a great chorus. <br />Best Performance: Eminem <br /> <br />\\"How Come\\": <br />Once again Eminem rips the first verse with an emotional dedication to his fellow members of D12 at first, then it goes into them changing. Kon Artis hits the next verse with an attack with some tight rhymes this is a great Kon Artis verse. Proof really brings a great verse hear talking about his old friends who have gotten resentful because he was \\"just actin' out the part he was thrown.\\" Proof shines on this one. <br />Best Performance: Proof <br /> <br />\\"American Psycho II\\": <br />A nice chorus starts off this song delivered by B-Real. Swift takes the first verse with some fast paced rhymes and hateful lyrics this is a great opener. Kuniva brings the next verse, verygood lyrics but the flow is a little off, not the best Kuniva verse. Bizzare brings the next verse, with the normal sick and disturbing lyrics, but this is actually one of Bizzares best verses. The last verse is the best, Eminem brings the best series of lyrics and flow on the album. Eminem owns this one. <br />Best Performance: Eminem <br /> <br />Other Good Ones: <br />40 oz. <br />My Band <br /> <br />-Kyle Walker

B000002MM8|4.0|I love dead can dance.  The combination of Lisa gerrard's hauntingly beautiful vocals (which I've heard described as kind of like diamanda galas' except pleasant) and a truly amazing variety of instruments.  \\"Yulunga\\" showcases lisa's true abilities, and I am just now beginning to appreciate brendan perry's vocals in songs like \\"the ubiquitous mr. lovegrove\\".  I will never understand why people claim this music is \\"gothic\\" or even dark.  The lyrics are usually uplifting, and in some cases the music comes pretty damn close to lounge music.  Whether you're into instrumental, world, or just looking for music thats a little different from the standard, I would recommend any of DCD's albums.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I am a regular attending Catholic every week unless something comes up. I saw this movie in the theaters on Easter Sunday orginally planned for Good Friday. Yes this movie is grusome and sad. But this is what Jesus has done for us Christians. It is very powerful, I admit I had to look away at some points because it was to much for me. It made me feel stronger in my beliefs in him. I have read reviews of this movie all over the web. This movie is not for children. Though I do strongly believe that this movie is true to what happened. Yeah the last 12 hours of his life were not pretty but he did that for us. He knew that too. I just strongly believe that this movie well have a specail place in my memory due to seeing it on that Sunday. Believe what you want but this is what I believe in, if your anything else I still support you but I just don't believe in the same things as you do. But that is what makes religion so amazing, it is diverse. So for the people that gave negatives, I don't understand. If your giving negatives because it is too grusome, will I unfortunately believe this is the way the dealt with people in those days. I can just remember this story every Easter, or even Lent. Sometimes makes me cry and makes me thank the higher power for what they have given to me in my life. I have brothers, sisters, grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, parents, and etc. I am also thankful for all of the gifts I have been given and all of my challenges I have had in life because this allows me to grow as a person.  <br /> <br />So people please just bare in mind, Jesus knew what he was doing for us(christains) and if he didn't would the christian religion exsist? There is one thing to note Jesus was correct in, that there would be opposition in that area, what do you know history shows this happened. Okay enough on this subject.
0312966199|5.0|This book is a great collection of stories by and about a Yorkshire veterinarian. If you can get over some of the assignments he has which may make you squeemish, the stories are really really enjoyable and his verbal sketches of people in the small towns are insightful. Overall a fun book that will make you laugh (and is easy to read in bits and pieces when you have time!).
0385338686|2.0|I really enjoyed the Shopaholic series, for the most part, so I was excited when I saw that Sophie Kinsella had another book out and hurried to purchase it in hardcover.  However, I was really disapointed.  While most chick lit books suffer from being predictable, this one was EXTREMELY predictable and just felt like it had no \\"meat\\" in the middle.  To me the tone and voice of this book made it feel too similar to the Shopaholic series.  Don't get me wrong, I love chick lit and don't take it too seriously, but I think other authors like Jane Green have done a better job at writing several books with a similar tone, but in different, unique voices.  I like that Kinsella took on the character of a successful, headstrong woman, however I hated where it ended up.
0684800713|5.0|The Sun Also Rises, published in 1926, is a novel that makes us think about the sense of despair and disenchantment which followed the First World War, but also reflects on the meaning of life. Hemingway depicts these people in the novel as expatriates living in Paris and are members of what Gertrude Stein called the \\"lost generation.\\" The material for the novel resulted from a journey Hemingway made with his first wife, Hadley Richardson, and several friends to Pamplona, Spain, in 1925. <br /> <br />What is most powerful in this story, is Hemingway's use of language. Hemingway's prose, particularly his unadorned sentences, understated dialogue and lean description was revolutionary when The Sun Also Rises was first published. And his idiosyncratic spare prose is still fresh today. Indeed Hemingway was one of the most copied styles of the twentieth century too. In fact, Hemingway went on to win the Nobel Prize in 1954 for his narrative and influential prose style. <br /> <br />To read The Sun Also Rises, will let you experience what it was like in Paris and Spain for the generation after the First World War. Moreover, this novel will give you a sense of their disillusionment and hope that were lived by the expatriate community. Recommended. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00097A5HW|5.0|If you like Shakira for Pies Descalzos and Donde you might love this album in a different explosive way. This isn't a Laundry Service prototype (the one that was marked for pop beat up songs and soft rock ballads) that all we know. This album is composed by more mature sound and even ellegant if we comparte to previous records.  <br /> <br />1. En Tus Pupilas - 10/10 This is a lovely love song with incrustation of soft rock and ellegance weird lyric. En Tus Pupilas reflect the powerful lyrical that Shakira lost in her Laundry chapter. Deepness get over it.  <br /> <br />2. La Pared 10/10 - Metaphoric song with rock heavy way out in the back and grunge vocals, the song is pretty interesting until you hear the back sound on the chorus and feel so overwhelmed this song is plenty great but the fact it's almost an incomplete message with almost unfinished lyric. You minght not get the song if you think it once.  <br /> <br />3. La Tortura - 10/10 Official 1st single and maybe the only one who would be considered commercial type on it. It's a mix of flamenco style and soft vallenato. Shows a very weak lyric and sassy moves on the video. Though the sound is excited and her voice matches on Alejandro's it's not part of the album. It's totally different from the album but still keep the hotness! <br /> <br />4. Obtener Un Si - 10/10 Judy Garland meets Bossa Nova. The song is a filter of Shakira's strong voice and material of true artist. The song is kind of funny and lyrical simple but still fits with the rest of the songs perfectly. <br /> <br />5. Dia Especial - 10/10 Considered the 2nd single but it was only airplay on South America Radios for 1 week until the record decided to change the single to No. This song is truly a hit single and provides more mature singing and lyric. Totally evolution- <br /> <br />6. Escondite Ingles - 10/10 Might be kind of punk but made a hugh strong song. This song is fun and lyrically poor but keep the joint and emotion in all the song. <br/> <br />7. No - 10/10 2nd official single and flopped on radios and charts! Maybe it wasn't the most indicated single to be released but it's a A+ SONG.  <br /> <br />8. Las de la Intuicion - 10/10 Amazing superchick power on it! Reference to gils as intuited kind. The most surprise on the song it's the keep on strong part of the song. <br /> <br />9. Dia de Enero - 10/10 Weak but still gettin' some original touch. Another filter of Shaki's voice and keeping lyrically strong dedicated to sweetheart's Antonio. <br /> <br />10. Lo Imprescindible -10/10 Provides the high light on this album and bring dark sound to the album underground style.  <br /> <br />11. La Pared (Piano Versions)10/10 Better than regular version <br /> <br />12. La Tortura (Reggeaton Remix) * 5/10 The weak on this album. Sound phunny and stupid. Don't like this one should be on a single not on this album.
B0000524CY|5.0|William Friedkin in my eyes has directed and made the most horrific horror film of all time. I remember it being released in 1973, people were pickiting our local theater which just caused more people to see it. I was to young, I was only 7, but did see it on HBO years later. Wish I would have waited a few more years, I had nightmares way to often, to the point where I found myself in Mom and Dads bed. Simple story of a young girl overcome by demonic possesion, and the toll it takes on the mother and the priests who are performing the exorcism. I do own this dvd but I refuse to watch it without some company, and I'm 38 now. The demonic voice of Reagan,(Linda Blair), over my eight Polk speakers in DTS sound is enough to raise the hair on your neck. How they managed to get away with the crucifix scene without a cut from the M.P.A.A. blows me away. The most disturbing scene ever, in any film. I could do without the newly added \\"nervous disorder\\" scene in the hospital, but the \\"spiderwalk\\" scene is chilling, and should have been in the original cut. And how about that score? Tubular bells just freaks me out. A wonderful directed, edited, scored, acted film. The best horror film ever. How Linda Blair can even sleep today, astonishes me. Dick Smith was the makeup artist, I believe Max Von Sydow, head priest, was only in his 40s at the time, look at him now, he looks exactley like his aged makeup, incredible. Tom Savini, fx God learned from Mr. Smith. Damn, do I love movies.
B000002J09|4.0|If you're new to Zeppelin and you've never heard this album, the first thing that you probably want to know is, \\"Does this album live up to its legendary reputation\\"?  The answer to that question is really yes and no.  The first half of this album is truly 5 star worthy and is as good as the album's legendary reputation would lead you to believe.  The second half though doesn't bode so well, which is why this is really only a 4 star album at best.  You're likely to hear very few songs that rock as hard as the metal riff driven \\"Black Dog\\", and the lively and infectious \\"Rock & Roll\\"'s title fits the song perfectly.  The mythical \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" is another outstanding track.  This song should go down in the record books as the greatest use of a mandolin ever on a rock record.  I've read lots of reviews saying that \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is good but overplayed.  Personally, I hadn't heard the song much until I bought this album about a year ago, and I can tell you that this 8 minute long, literally slow to mid-tempo rocker has all sorts of dynamics that keep things interesting throughout, and musically, is really QUITE an acheivement.  Unfortunately though, this album falls flat after \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".  \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" and \\"Four Sticks\\" are both heavy electric blues riff driven numbers (\\"Misty...\\" mixes the guitar riff with the same riff played on a synthesizer, which I'm sure was considered pretty avante-garde at the time), with oh-so-Zeppelin timing signatures on both.  But, I couldn't describe either song as great.  \\"Four Sticks\\" has different elements thrown in that add a little variety (an acoustic guitar led transition; a fuzzy kazoo lead on another one), but none of it really breaks the song's monotony.  \\"Going to California\\" like \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" makes use of a mandolin (though not as prominently), and has no percussion, but that is where the similarities end because \\"...Evermore\\" is TRULY outstanding and \\"...California\\" just isn't verygood at all.  \\"When the levee breaks\\" is basically Zeppelin's attempt at a really bluesy Funk number.  This song has potential in there somewhere, but that same monotonous riff played over and over in that same key starts to really test both my patience and my sanity after the first minute or so.  Maybe if they played the riff in different keys in an ascending/descending fashion, and threw in some more interesting transitions, the song wouldn't be so insanely monotonous, but as it stands, it doesn't quite cut it.  So overall, this album is really uneven.  If I were to consider the first four songs only, this really would be one of the greatest albums that I've ever heard, but unfortunately, the second half drags the album down.  But, the classic moments throughout the first half still make this a strong effort and a worthy purchase.
B00000255F|5.0|In 1975 Bruce Springsteen sat in relative obscurity. On the east coast, he and his band had reached local legendary status for nightly shows lasting longer than \\"Titanic\\". But the first two albums didn't capture the public's imagination at the time. It's hard to believe in retrospect, but the sales of 1973's \\"Greetings from Asbury Park NJ\\" and \\"The Wild The Innocent And the E Street Shuffle\\" were embarassingly low (in his revelatory Rolling Stone review of this album, Greil Marcus called them \\"you have to see them live\\" albums). With his career in the balance (he may not have survived another commerical flop) the classic \\"Born to Run\\" appeared. And thus begins the story familiar to millions of fans.<br /><br />So what happened? What changed on \\"Born to Run\\"? For one thing, this album doesn't try to only capture the band's famous live sound. It was recorded with the recording studio in mind. In other words, Springsteen left the live sound to the clubs and theaters and starting thinking about recording for an audience that hadn't, or couldn't, experience the live shows at the time. Overdubs and studio tricks abounded to create the sound that still feels full and new today. Apparently the title track contains a dozen or so guitar tracks. Springsteen had discovered the studio (and finally given the budget to do so). And soon the public would discover him. 1975 changed everything for Springsteen and the E-Street Band.<br /><br />Springteen's main appeal lies in his passion and \\"Born to Run\\" contains it in droves. From the opening piano rolls of \\"Thunder Road\\" to Springsteen's explosive \\"from the diaphragm with a catapult\\" vocals, past the stunning \\"Night\\", \\"Backstreets\\", the title track, and the sprawling fantastic closer \\"Jungleland\\" the album never lets up. Mostly for its raw uninhibited passion it remains one of the best classic rock albums ever recorded.<br /><br />Thematically, the album speaks of dark shadowy streets, fast cars that offer redemption, and a sense of homelessness and lives with shaky foundations on the balance. Though the album has sold millions, its lyrics reverberate anything but a \\"popular\\" or \\"happy go lucky\\" view of the world. It explores a murkier side of life that Springsteen has made all his own. More of this perspective would emerge on the follow up albums \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\", \\"The River\\", and \\"Nebraska\\". The ride begins here (and to some extent on his previous albums) and some thirty years later it's still a ride well worth getting on.nse of homelessness and lives with shaky foundations on the balance.

6305546789|5.0|Halloween is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made.  It's got atmosphere, great creepy music, camera angles, lighting and shadows.  But the true essence of Halloween is MICHAEL MYERS.  His creepy, pale, white mask still sends shivers down my spine.<br /><br />I'm going to go about my review a little differently than most.<br /><br />I've been reading thru alot of the reviews about Halloween and was reading with interest the reviewers who gave Halloween a low rating or said they didn't like it at all (sorry to hear that).  I came across many people saying the same things about the movie.  I'd like to comment on some of those things.<br /><br />First, to the people that say there is no plot or the plot is dumb.  What you should really do after watching Halloween is rent Halloween 2.  That should clear up the mystery of why Michael Myers is after Laurie Strode.  Personally, I think they should have stopped after making Halloween 2, but that's another story.  The plot of Halloween is suspense/buildup.  Some people say the movie is boring or slow.  The first part of Halloween isn't boring, it's suspenseful.  You know Michael Myers has escaped, he's back in Haddonfield, and he's been popping up around town.  He's also been following Laurie around.  You know something's going to happen between the two eventually, but you don't know what or when.  It's that buildup to later on that night.<br /><br />As for the people that don't like Halloween because there is hardly any blood/gore, what can I say?  If your idea of a horror movie means it has to have lots of gore, then Halloween will disappoint in that respect.  Me personally, I don't mind blood, gore, and special effects, but they aren't needed to make a movie SCARY.  Halloween was scary without having to show blood and guts.  Also, there wasn't a big body count in the original Halloween.  Again, not needed.  Halloween relies on scaring the viewer, not trying to gross them out like many other horror films do.  Nothing against people that enjoy those movies, just saying it's not needed in my opinion.<br /><br />Now for those of you that say Michael Myers isn't scary or isn't as cool as Freddy, Jason (one of my favorites, by the way), I think your wrong there as well.  Some people say he's just a guy in a mask, not a deformed, supernatural killer like Freddy or others.  Well, that is exactly what makes him all the more scarier!  I'm sorry, a wise-cracking killer who comes to you in your dreams like Freddy, just isn't as scary to me.  Michael Myers on the other hand... He's a person who escapes from a mental institute, puts on a mask, and carries a large butcher knife.  That's a little more realistic to me than Freddy coming back from the dead.  Michael Myers doesn't talk, or run which adds to his eerie persona.  When I watch Halloween, I don't even see Michael Myers as a person, but rather as a dark figure wearing a pale mask.  It's almost like he's not a human, just this evil, scary thing.  And yet from the story you know he is a human, not super natural, not a zombie, just a person, which makes him really scary.  It's like, this isn't really that far fetched, this could happen.<br /><br />I also think not knowing a lot about Michael or why he is doing what he is doing, adds mystery to the story.  Just trying to figure out why he is the way he is and what he's all about is part of the reason Halloween is so good.  Throughout the movie Dr. Loomis explains to the sheriff all about his experience with Michael Myers at the institute.  About how he is purely and simply evil, and about how Dr. Loomis is the only one who  knows who or what Michael Myers really is.  Good stuff.  All you know is that Michael is a mental patient who is \\"the most dangerous patient he's ever observed\\" (quoted from the TV version of the movie). And he is.  Once Michael starts killing towards the end of the movie, you realize there is a little more to him than meets the eye or to what you thought up to that point in the movie.  He's just a man (or evil thing) but he's seems to be quite a bit stronger than an average man.  You'll see what I mean after watching the kill scene in the kitchen.  He also seems to be able to take quite a bit more punishment than an average man could. Just look at his numerous encounters with Laurie and the climax with Dr. Loomis.  And yet he's just a man (or not, according to Dr. Loomis).  It's just all of these things that keep you wondering about Michael Myers. The movie doesn't really try to explain these things, which is good.<br /><br />So, that's about all I have to say, I could go on but I think I've said enough for now. Keep an open mind about the things I've said, and go out and rent Halloween.  Watch out for Michael appearing out of the darkness and don't be too afraid when Laurie goes upstairs to the bedroom and finds... Sorry, go rent it!to that point in the movie.  He's just a man (or evil thing) but he's seems to be quite a bit stronger than an average man.  You'll see what I mean after watching the kill scene in the kitchen.  He also seems to be able to take quite a bit more punishment than an average man could. Just look at his numerous encounters with Laurie and the climax with Dr. Loomis.  And yet he's just a man (or not, according to Dr. Loomis).  It's just all of these things that keep you wondering about Michael Myers.

0671722905|4.0|A tempest is defined as a violent storm. In his play, Shakespeare uses tempests as elements of power. The play begins with a crew at sea, caught in the midst of a terrible thunderstorm. The shipwrecked crew foreshadows figurative storms that later occur amidst the characters of The Tempest. Among them, storms erupt over authority, revenge, acceptance, and love.<br /><br />[I weep] at mine unworthiness, that dare not offer<br /><br />What I desire to give, and much less take<br /><br />What I shall die to want. But this is trifling,<br /><br />And all the more it seeks to hide itself<br /><br />The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning,<br /><br />And prompt me, plain and holy innocence.<br /><br />I am your wife, if you will marry me.<br /><br />If not, I'll die your maid. To be your fellow<br /><br />You may deny me, but I'll be your servant<br /><br />Whether you will or no (III.i.77-86).<br /><br />The quote above is a poignant illustration of a tempest in the heart. As Miranda expresses her love for Ferdinand, we see some of Shakespeare's finest poetry. Shakespeare's true genius is expressed when he uses verse to capture emotions of the heart-the true sailor lost in a tempest at sea.
B000002L7G|5.0|Dire Straits Brothers in Arms is one of my favorite albums. I love pretty much every song here, and together the CD presents a long, well designed story.<br /><br />You start with \\"So Far Away\\", the easily understandable lament of anybody who has been away from their loved one. It gets right at the heart of the emotion, with the same thoughts running around and around in your mind, unable to be shaken free.<br /><br />Next comes the super-classic, super-popular Money for Nothing. I can still instantly remember the video, with its then-amazing computer animation. Sting makes fun of his \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\" melody in the background - a song about a teacher trying to resist his attraction to a young female student - by calling out \\"I Want My MTV!\\" The whole song is a big spoof of consumer culture (including that MTV reference) and the lyrics were taken from actual snippets of conversation that Mark Knopfler had heard people saying. We may take the sexy-MTV-world for granted in modern times, but back when this was released, it seemed a perfect apt commentary on the big-boobs-fancy-houses world that MTV was putting out.<br /><br />Walk of Life is a straightforward \\"walking song\\", something to listen to as you head out for a walk around your neighborhood. It's about getting through life as best you can, and doing the best with what you have. I find it very inspirational.<br /><br />Your Latest Trick gets more into deeper emotions. With the more sultry sound, it ponders why relationships don't always go smoothly. I'm sure we can all relate to that! Not only is the song really meaningful for anyone who's been hurt, but I just love the lyrics. \\"Most of the taxis, and most of the whores, are only taking calls in cash.\\" It gives you a visceral mental image.<br /><br />Next comes one of my real favorites, \\"Why Worry\\". Talk about the perfect song to play when you're feeling low. Just put a log on the fire, sit back with a glass of port, and listen to this one play. The guitar work is gorgeous, and Mark's soothing voice really does help make it feel like things will get better.<br /><br />Every song in his is gorgeous, right up until the incredibly powerful and poignant Brothers in Arms. Whether you're for war or against it, you have to appreciate the things that our soldiers go through, and the great appreciation we should have for them in doing it.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.uitar work is gorgeous, and Mark's soothing voice really does help make it feel like things will get better.<br /><br />Every song in his is gorgeous, right up until the incredibly powerful and poignant Brothers in Arms.

B0002BO0AS|5.0|From so much headbanging! the musicians of Unearth have definitely brought back what heavy metal is supposed to sound like. From the first track,to the Final closure, Vocalist Trevor Phipps and crew deliver a barrage of stop start riffs, insane soloing, and thrashing double bass beats. TRevor Phipps may well be one the best NWoAHM vocalists I've heard. Sure, he may follow the trend of vocal styles of most other metalcore bands, I have never heard a vocalist of his genre( other than Adam Jones of KSE) get so into his music. THe melting solos could only be played by none other than Ken Susi, while the tearing riffs and thumping bass flow smoothly with the music. Now, down to the album itself. IT was mixed and produced by Adam Dutkiewitz(of Killswitch Engage fame) so you know it is pure metalcore. it is however, surprisingly melodic, with a few mellow introdructions and musical interludes. This album may become your favorite, or maybe it will just become another addition to your Cd collection. I recommend this if you are a fan of any type of metal. IF you havent heard the sounds of the Underground movement, what are you waiting for?! Why are still reading this? Go and buy this CD!
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Anthony Minghella tackles a tough subject.  The Civil War can be a hard topic of interest.  If it's not done right, you'll lose your audience.  Luckily, he uses the right material for his project.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Charles Frazier, Minghella's screenplay does well in describing the way life was during the mid-1800's.  Many loved ones wrote letters to their husbands, sons and friends in such passionate detail.  It's as true today as much as it was back then.<br /><br />There are one or two deep holes in this film, but the plot changes very quickly and keeps our attention going by displaying some great performances.  Philip Semour Hoffmann gives a great performance as the wanted reverend.  Natalie Portman gives a short, but effective job as the long-suffering widow.  But it's Renee Zellweger who stands out with the best acting job in this movie.  A well deserved Oscar as Ruby, the drifter who helps Ada (Nicole Kidman) hold together the farm duing the troubled times.<br /><br />Though I haven't read the novel, this film stands out on it's own as a very good, romantic Civil War epic.  Not on the level as \\"Gone With The Wind\\", but still an entertaining and powerful film.  Recommended!
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Sadly the subtitles are so bad as to distract heavily from the movie. I really could not enjoy it at all. There is even a petition online for a version with English dubbing or better subtitles.
B000000OTU|5.0|Aerosmith already had done Greatest Hits releases, but Big Ones in 1994 caught them up with some of their latest tunes. How much you like this CD depends on how much you liked the band's music in that era. Some people thought it was great. Others hated any change from the raw-rocking sounds of the \\"younger Aerosmith\\" back in the 70s.<br /><br />I have to admit that while I really love the Aerosmith of the 70s, I also thought that the Aerosmith of the 80s-90s was fantastic as well. Bands all change. You can look at most bands (let's say the Beatles) and track how their music evolved and changed as the band members themselves grew and matured. It seems unfair to me for any observer to say to a band, \\"You should keep playing the same way the rest of your life, because I enjoy it\\".<br /><br />Start with \\"Love in an Elevator\\". I *love* that song! It's not full of deep meaning, it's not full of angst. It's bursting with great, lustful energy. Surely all of us have had that hormone-driven rush, where we just want to grab our partner in an elevator and have some fun! I love the rhythms, too.<br /><br />Move on to \\"Rag Doll\\". Another song I love. She's a hot ticket, \\"never see ya leaving by the back door\\". Another great song for dancing around the living room to, enjoying life. Go right into \\"Dude Looks Like a Lady\\". I think this song is hilarious! C'mon, can anyone who listens to songs like \\"Octopus's Secret Garden\\" start to complain that all songs must be serious? Or do people who don't like Dude also frown on other \\"non serious\\" songs?<br /><br />We get some serious songs in here, if that's what you're into. \\"Janie's Got a Gun\\" won a lot of acclaim when it was released, for addressing the pain and torment felt by sexually abused kids. That's not something you find in most rocker's music collections.<br /><br />I really appreciate all the songs in this collection. Are they as great as \\"Dream On\\"? I really find it's hard to compare songs like that. Dream On was an epic song about reaching your goals. Janie's Got a Gun was a serious look into a tragic situation. Surely both can exist in the world and be meaningful in their own way.<br /><br />Some critics love to bash this CD as being all inferior work. I really have to say, it depends on how open your mind is about music. If you have only a certain style of song you enjoy, and this isn't it, then you won't enjoy it. If you're open to a range, which includes both social commentary and poppy-dancing-fun, then you might be very pleasantly surprised with what you get here. I can only say that I really enjoy listening to this CD.about reaching your goals. Janie's Got a Gun was a serious look into a tragic situation.

B000B5UL7G|4.0|Robbie has not grown much lyrically - but he has definitely grown as a person in Intensive Care. Most of the songs on this  album are about the hard times he's gone through, as opposed to earlier releases like Life Thru A Lens, that were lighter, mood-wise. Although this is relatively more serious, Robbie still dishes out his usual cheeky self in tracks like \\"Spread Your Wings\\", \\"Your Gay Friend\\" and \\"Make Me Pure\\". <br /> <br />Not as strong as I've Been Expecting You, but an enjoyable listen nevertheless.
B0006L16N8|5.0|There are folks hearing a lot of U2 influences within Colplay, and there are some... but this band is no clone of U2, and you really only hear a small amount of it...and it is all good.<br /><br />This cd is pure listening pleasure.  I really like all the songs.  I think the song 'Fix You' is a great song, and was sorta suprised to hear it as a single.<br /><br />If you enjoy some really emotional lyrics mixed with guitar and moody soundscapes.. I would give this group a listen to.<br /><br />After listening to this CD, I went out and purchased the other material as well.. the Sudden Rush and Parachutes.. they are also very good.<br /><br />Have fun
0307276902|4.0|How sad that I later found out that this book was a sham!  James Frey should be ashamed of the way he used the memoir genre to sell books and make money on false pretenses!  I am disgusted by this current new information about the lies in the book.  It ruins the credibility of the author since most of the story is untrue!  Many say it does not matter because he helped people.  UGH!  It is lies - true help comes from real stories and a need to be honest and responsible!!!  I initially gave the book 4 stars and raved about it.  James Frey should at the very least donate some of his huge profits to treatment centers for alcoholism and do some good with the profits that he earned through duping the readers of this story!     This was my initial review: I was hesitant to buy this book initially because I had read that it was sometimes hard to handle the content.  I would have missed a great book!!  This story is so amazing that even though I have not been an addict it affected me in many ways.  It is more than a story about addiction - it is about trust, family, love and friendships.  It is about having the staying power to live within the moment and struggling through the wait for your life to turn around.  It truly is applicable to many life circumstances...
B000002U82|5.0|I listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon constantly when I was a teenager. Now that I'm an adult, I still find the album very meaningful. It's amazing to remember that this group of songs was released in 1973, and is still incredibly popular today. It is music that endures.<br /><br />It's funny that some people label this as \\"druggie music\\" just because it's got a slow tempo and has incredibly complex music. I know MANY people who do not do drugs and who enjoy this CD. I also know people who DO smoke pot and listen to this. One is not a requisite for the other. It just means that in this world, there are a group of people who smoke, and one who do not. Both groups love this CD. Surely we aren't saying that pot smokers are the only ones who can appreciate a slow song without feeling ADHD angst about the speed.<br /><br />We start with Speak To Me / Breathe, which begins with what sounds to me like whirring helicopter blades and a cry. I get a sense of someone in a war zone, hearing the choppers go overhead and then being left all alone again, wondering just what is going to happen to him. \\"Breathe in the air - don't be afraid to care\\". I just love everything about this song - the lyrics, the wistful quality of the melody, the various references to literature (run Rabbit run) and to other songs.<br /><br />Next we slide into On the Run. The looping melodies draw you in, like watching a kaleidoscope. But it's not a happy world - again, the sounds to me sound war-like at times, and slightly threatening at others. You're bunkered down, paying attention to every noise, hearing the laughter and machinery from nearby.<br /><br />This brings us to Time. \\"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day\\". Who can NOT relate to this song? With the amount of time we all spend in lines, in classrooms, in stuffy office rooms, it can many times feel like 99% of our time is wasted on things we don't want to do. For some it's a trap that is never escaped.<br /><br />The Great Gig in the Sky makes some people embarassed - it is a pretty straightforward ode to sex. It's surprising that in our modern times we can talk about pretty much every other natural thing a body does, but we can't talk about the all-encompassing pleasure of a strong physical relationship with another person. This song is meaningful to just about any person out there, no matter what language they speak, with no lyrics needed.<br /><br />Money is a *great* song and really talks about what money has become in our society. \\"new car, caviar, four star daydream - think I'll buy me a football team.\\" What ever happened to wanting happiness and enough food to eat? In modern times we judge life by the number of cars we have and the size of our garage.<br /><br />\\"Us and Them\\" is very insightful about the nature of war, as you might expect for a song written in the era of the Vietnam War. It's just as meaningful in any decade in history. \\"Me and you - and who knows which is which, and who is who\\". The smooth rhythms of the song encourage you to think about what's being said. \\"'Forward!' he cried from the rear, and the front rank died.\\"<br /><br />All the songs here have that same meaningfulness, the same thoughtful quality of lyrics, the same care in crafting the melodies. Yes, this isn't a CD full of songs about dancing around at high speed with a cocktail in your hand. It's not a boppy-poppy easy to understand selection. However, if you've got the ability to focus for a full CD length of songs, and really pay attention to what is being said, you'll really find some incredibly powerful messages in here.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.at Gig in the Sky makes some people embarassed - it is a pretty straightforward ode to sex.

B000002G87|5.0|Apparently at some point after hearing The Band's gem, \\"Music From Big Pink\\", Eric Clapton decided to put the English blooze days behind him and this album is the result.  This is the lightning fast British blues guitarist, self-made from the B.B. King school of elegant, eloquent expression, playing Southern country folk rock blues (you can't pin any single label on it), with a band of the finest players around, including the messianic Duane Allman (himself the American answer to Jimmy Page).  If you don't know about this album, just stop reading right now and GET IT!!!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Sometimes the most creative years are the later years. Simply the best album since Violator, recapturing the classic optimistic darkness of Depeche Mode while avoiding the trap of recycled redundancy.  David Gahan's contribution is the strongest it has ever been.  This album could have easily surpassed Violator if Alan Wildner had returned to enhance the beat and production.  The sharpness of album is slightly dulled by Martin Gore's compulsive need to include his vocals on two out of place tracks. Overall this album will surpass the expectations of the most critical Depeche Mode fan.  Depeche Mode is alive, well and definitely not retro.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Enter the castlevania of insane asylums: void of residents but riveting with the psychotic energies they left behind.  Is it really the asbestos that needs removed or the lingering personalities of Mary Hobbs which seem to manifest themselves within the minds of the Hazmet employees hired to do a job that should be second priority due to the more pressing matter of craziness abound.  The pieces of the puzzle are apparant but the picture doesn't become clear until the very end; twisted yet complete.  As everything falls into place it becomes obvious that what we are left with is more skewed than the initial bewilderment inherent while viewing. <br />  <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road was an instant classic for the Beatles, with every song offering up something unique and enjoyable for its listeners. It's just as wonderful today!<br /><br />So much has been written about the Beatles career that it's hard to think back to when this was first released. Abbey Road ended up being the last studio recorded album the band would ever put out. From our modern day perspective, we can look at this album as the final culimination of the years of skill and interpersonal understanding these four men developed.<br /><br />The result is simply awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Come Together has a great, jazzy rhythm and has fun lyrics as well. \\"Hold you in his arms - yeah, you can feel his disease\\". From there you go into one of my favorite slow tunes of all time - \\"Something\\". It isn't sappy or silly - it really gets that fluttery sense in your stomach when you see your loved one across the room. \\"Something in her smile that knows that I don't need no other lover\\". Perfect for listening to by a fire with your darling.<br /><br />Then we hop into Maxwell's Silver Hammer. What a classic, bizarre song! You've got a psychopath wandering around, bashing people on the head with a hammer, and the sound is so light and friendly! Oh! Darling switches back into emotion, with a plea to be appreciated. Every person has some insecurities in love, and this song screams them out. \\"When you told me you didn't need me any more - well you know that I nearly broke down and cried!\\"<br /><br />Zap back into the fun and silly. Talk about an emotional roller-coaser! \\"I'd like to be ... under the sea ... in an Octopuss's garden, in the shade\\". I'm sure every one of my friends knows this song by heart. It's great for singing out loud as you cruise down the road. A true feel-happy song.<br /><br />You could go on about every song in this collection. Every single one stands out for its music, its lyrics, its feel. The harmonies are awesome. The song \\"feel\\" on each one is unique and enjoyable. No matter what your mood, it seems that you could find a song in here to suit you. \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" gets you going again when you're feeling down. \\"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\\" has that storytelling boppiness to it.<br /><br />A must have for every collection!joyable.

B000A78Z82|4.0|This would be the result. Haunting melodies recorded on lo-fi sounding machines. Bossa Nova picking with spanish lyrics. This album has a little bit for everyone. Not as stripped down as rejoicing in the hands and nino rojo, but still sounds under produced, as if he had recorded the songs with robert johnson on guitar somewhere in Texas in the 1930's. Banhardt's voice is still that high pitched warble, which may be hard for new listeners. Over all this album, although not being my personal favorite, is definatly his most accomplished. Laced with sparse instrumentation as apossed to no instrumentaion. If you have never heard Mr. Banhardt, start with this album and go backwards.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|Some the worst singers I've heard. Both male and female voices are jerky, uneven, out of tune... No melodies, bad instruments. A complete failure.
B000AARKOO|2.0|Somewhere in this grandiose picture there is a story that yearned to be told, but Ridley Scott's KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is overwhelmed by its own epic sweep and lack of sharply defined characterizations.  Scott has a way with epic battle scenes and he does extremely well in graphically displaying the brutality of these so-called \\"holy\\" wars.  Orlando Bloom who has used his boyish good looks to favorable benefit in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN still seems too immature to be the stalwart hero the movie calls for.  His performance is not impassioned enough and he gets lost in the grand shuffle.  The rest of the cast isn't given much meat either:  Eva Green seems lost in her role as the lovestruck and vengeful queen; Liam Neeson does his mentor role again (see BATMAN BEGINS for example), but doesn't have enough screen time to make a lasting impression.  The script bounces back and forth so much we're never quite sure whose fighting who and why.  Edward Norton in an uncredited role as the leper king does manage to bring a touch of humanity to his role but he too doesn't have a lot of screen time.  Beautifully filmed and heroic in scope, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is one of those misfires, like HEAVEN'S GATE, that suffers from its extravagance.
B000002UJQ|1.0|I was lent the entire Radiohead discography. I hardly kept about 10 songs which are indeed quite good : \\"Sail to the moon\\", \\"Nice dream\\", \\"Creep\\"... but the rest is a proper disaster. I was appalled by the live stuff : the guy just cannot sing properly unless he is backed by studio effects. He just has no voice, just a dismal creaking off-key whine that just make ears cringe. But apparently not everyone has ears. No to mention very poor melodies for most songs.  The fact this band is so popular is not very encouraging. Creaking off-key whine lovers...
B000AADYRQ|1.0|Why are all the icons of my teenage years catering to convalescents?
B00003CWNR|1.0|I tried to watch this movie,but could not get past Michael Caine's dismal New England accent...or attempt at such accent. It sounded like a New England accent marinated in British overnight. Caine's accent would flucuate between a very labored attempt at New England and in mid-sentence revert back to British. Took me right out of the picture. Puts Caine in league with other very, very BAD accent attempts: <br /> <br />1. Tom Hanks' attempt at Harvard Preppie lock-jaw in an old forgotten movie, and Russian in The Terminal <br /> <br />2. Angelie Jolie in Alexander. Where the heck was she supposed to be from?? <br /> <br />3. Brad Pitt's hilarious Ebonics in Meet Joe Black and fair attempt at German in Seven Years In Tibet. <br /> <br />And some others I can't think of now. <br /> <br />If Michael Caine had been the Big Man he'd have called Haley Joel to the stage that night and given him the Oscar that Caine had mistakenly gotten. Caine's work is not that great and I can't believe he's gotten two (TWO!) Oscars! <br /> <br />If I watch this movie again, I will fast forward through Michael Caine's scenes.
0064400018|5.0|Little House in the Big Woods has always had a special place in my heart. This was the first book that I ever read on my own. Because of this book I now love to read. You will fall in love with Laura and her family. You should read it.
6301697707|5.0|This movie was a deliberate throwback to the sf/monster movies of the 1950's -right down to its setting in the desert <br />The omens were not propitious as the writing team of Steven S Wilson and Brent Maddock had given us such relative dreck as Short Circuit and batteries not included .This time they got it right -and how - delivering a dry land Jaws with pace wit and elan to spare . <br />Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward play Val and Earl ;2 down at heel cowboys who live a hand to mouth existence as odd job men around the small towm of Perfection ,population 15 .The town is besieged by mysterious underground creatures -giant worms boring through the earth at enormous speeds .Their first victims are a power repair man and a road repair crew .Earl and Val ,aided by the obligatory brainy but beautiful scientist Rhonda ( Finn Carter) join up with a survivalist family(more sympathetically depicted than usual in such movies)and do battle against the giant worm like things  <br />The effects are excellent ,belying the low budget and one shot early on in the movie where a road workers' drill gets entangled with the head of one of the creatures is especially satisfying  <br /> <br />Great script and solid performances help make this a small scale ,intelligent monster movie that satisfies on every level making its commercial failure at the time all the more sad
B00005KHEU|4.0|That honour has to go to \\"Time\\" in my opinion but still this album is very strong on its own merits.  For one thing, this has been remastered by Jeff Lynne himself with 3 extra tracks and liner notes also written by Jeff plus the lyrics as well.  I actually hate \\"Don't...Down\\" but \\"Last Train...\\" is one of my all-time favourite tracks ever.  By the way, \\"...Horace Wimp\\" isn't as bad as all that and it has some interesting musical ideas and was always meant to be a kind of musical joke so don't take it so seriously.  All the other tracks are good working examples of good songwriting and melody irrespective of genre and even disco, done tastefully is good music.  Recommended.
1400043662|4.0|\\"Kafka on the Shore\\" is an incredibly clever book. Those not familiar with Japanese Literature will find this to be a very good place to start. The characters are likeable and difficult to forget. The one complaint that I have with it is that the book seems cautious of its own brilliance and presents its resolutions to bluntly to show a proper amount of trust towards the readers abilities.
B000B0WODA|2.0|Franz Ferdinand's debut album had songs truly unique, but this new album is just a rock remix of old Herman's Hermits songs with slightly different lyrics.
B00005JNDZ|1.0|Audiences who enjoyed \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" (2001) had the good sense to avoid this unnecessary follow-up. \\"The Edge of Reason\\" is a cynical \\"romantic comedy\\" with no laughs, poignancy or motivation. Another pathetic example of Hollywood's creative bankruptcy.
B000002BBY|5.0|I really like this album, but it's definitely an album I'd put in my top ten. This is the kind of album that you listen to when you're driving, or commuting to school or something. I mean, these songs have incredible hooks, but there is no a lot of depth to them at all, and becuase they are so hooky, it's really easy to get tired of these songs fast. And though it is an awesome album, it is certainly not on par with Revolver, or Sgt. Peppers... because those albums are timeless and never get tiring, but Morning Glory can.  <br /> <br />Now, if you're looking for rock, it's here! Hello, Roll With It, Some Might Say, and Morning Glory are perfect for the car. On the softer side of things, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Hey Now, She's Electric, and Cast No Shadow are very pleasent songs, just try not and listen to them too much, or the next time you hear WOnderwall on the radio, you'll find yourself thinking \\"ohhh god not again....\\" Champagne Supernova is a good song too, but at the same time, it is filled over the top with hooks, so watch out.  <br /> <br />It's an amazing album, but don't listen to it too often. Don't Believe The Truth is Oasis at their best, and I'd say it's the better album to go to.
B00006IUL6|4.0|Al Pacino plays the morally conflicted police officer with some secrets who is doing his best to help solve a murder in Alaska during the long days of summer when the sun never sets.  <br />The white landscape and the gray mental clarity from his insomnia make this an interesting psychological morality tale. <br /> <br />Patrick J.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|This movie was different, as in it's more dug into the past of Bruce Wayne. Which I loved, since Batman was becoming very one dimensional in the other movies. Emotion is the key to this film. We learn how Bruce becomes Batman, and HOW he earned his MIRACULOUS combat training! Christian Bale is extremely beautiful, and very sincere as Bruce Wayne. It doen't hurt that his chiseled body looks good if, it was drenched in wipped cream and cherries. <br />This is the best Batman movie I have ever saw!
B0006Z2LCE|4.0|Let me preface this by saying one thing.   If you have 1993's \\"The Donna Summer Anthology\\", hold on to that, but if you don't, run, don't walk, to the store to get this. <br /> <br />Donna Summer has been showered countless hits collections in her career.   However, Gold is only the second to even attempt at covering a broader range of her career than the disco period and the biggest of the 80's pop and 90's dance hits. <br /> <br />The two discs work perfectly.  Disc one exclusively covers the Casablanca disco phase where Donna was on top of the world.   Disc two starts right at 1980, where Donna had signed to Geffen and was going through a change, both spiritually and musically.   I am one who loves both periods. <br /> <br />In the late 1970's, Donna was a disco superstar, the one artist who was able to give The Bee Gees a run for their money in America.  From early sexual works such as Love To Love You Baby and Four Seasons Of Love to edgy electronic classics such as Once Upon A Time and Bad Girls, Donna and Giorgio Moroder carved out a special niche in pop music for them.  She was sexy and had a wonderful voice, he was a studio whiz.  The music was fantastic and turned Donna into a true icon. <br /> <br />After the disco backlash hit, Donna was one of the few artists to survive with a career after radio blacklisted the genre by successfully reinventing her image.   After marrying Brooklyn Dreams meber Bruce Sudano, Donna turned to religion and chose to better herself.   Granted, it was a turn that alienated some of her gay fanbase because it's hard for some people to think of \\"Christian\\" without homophobia, but I have no doubt that Donna is innocent of the claims laid against her. <br /> <br />The 1980's were a time of experimenting for Donna, from a Pat Benatar style rock album (The Wanderer) to a soulful Quincy Jones production (Donna Summer) to straight-ahead pop albums (She Works Hard For The Money), Donna showed true diversity, from doing everything from hard rock to gospel on an album, she started losing fans.  It was to such an extent that David Geffen shelved Donna's 1981 \\"I'm A Rainbow\\" for 15 years, because the album was a total potpourri of genres.  Needless to say, the music was still phenomenal despite what sales tell you.  More recently, she has enjoyed the occasional one-off dance hit from newly recorded cuts that make it onto soundtracks, live albums and greatest hits packages. <br /> <br />This collection is a fine representation of Donna's long and fruitful career, and as she is finally working on a new album (let's hope this time it's for real), this is only the beginning of another period of memorable moments.
B0000024JA|4.0|This is one of my favorite Wu Tang albums next to GZA Liquid Swords Enter the 36 Chambers and a host of others to numerous to list here. This was the album that first got me hooked on the Wu Tang sound. Soud wise this is dark futuristic and grimy Concept Hiphop It is pointless to try and pin down what style this is because with every release Rza Never ceases to amaze with his off the wall prodution style that is decades ahead of its time and this album was no exception. Needless to say this record has a very original Style and sound that was absent from many of the Hiphop groups of that era. The recording quality is what I love most about this record it sounds like it was recorded inside someones closet and it really gives it that raw as ---- feel. The lyrics are abstract and dark and fit in well with the grimey futuristic production. This was a dope effort from meth definitely his best. A 4 MIC Classic

B000002JS6|5.0|Whether fronted by Bon Scott or Brian Johnson, AC/DC has always been about unapologetic, testosterone-driven rock.  This was their first album after Scott's death, but their pure vision of direct, guitar-driven aggression survived.  I loved it when it first came out back when I was in high school, and I still love it now after not listening to it for many years.  Standout tracks include \\"Back in Black,\\" \\"Hell's Bells,\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long.\\"

0345409671|5.0|In this volume, the weightiest and best of the Vampire Chronicles to this point, Lestat finally encounters the supreme beings of the Universe--God, the Devil, and the Angels.  Memnoch escorts Lestat throughout the divine provinces and time itself as he explains his complicated relationship with God and humanity.  Rice's take on the situation understandably upsets many religious readers, but if you can open yourself to her point of view, you will be treated to a fascinating journey that largely reconciles the presence of evil and injustice in a world created by a supposedly omnipotent and benevolent being.  Vampire fans may also be disappointed by the way in which Lestat recedes into the background for major portions of the novel, but I felt that Memnoch was worthy of taking the spotlight.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Kirk, Spock, and McCoy travel across the Great Barrier to find God, and realize the Cosmic Truth is that they have each other. No glasnost, no perestroika, no bloated allegories about US-Soviet Cold War relations, no Scotty calling Gorkon's daughter \\"a Klingon bitch\\" and no Kirk bellowing, \\"Let them die!\\" No, unlike the dark and final voyage of the original Enterprise crew, we have a simple story of the trials of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy's friendship, the reaffirmation of which, to me, is an emotional highpoint in the series, ranking up there with the Death of Spock, the Death of David, and the finale of VI. Jerry Goldsmith's score is moving, Shatner's direction is terse, particularly during the shuttlecraft crash sequence, and the final campfire scene is the perfect send-off to a series whose heart has always been these three friends. It felt like a real episode. It felt like Star Trek.
0385338686|5.0|This book was the first I had ever read by Sophie Kinsella and it sent me back to the store looking for more.   <br /> <br />Samantha gets a wake up call when she makes the \\"error\\" of her career and finds herself with a bad headache and a new job the next morning as a housekeeper. The thing is, she can't cook or clean or do laundry.  In steps the gardener Nathaniel and his wonderful mother Iris to teach her how to cook.  The characters in the book are soooooo rich, be it Iris, Nathaniel or Samantha's employers Trish and Ed.  Toward the end there is a bit of a mystery thrown in and as she goes delving to find the answer to the mystery the book just gets better.  Towards the end of the book you are not sure which way Samantha is going and it changes a time or two but at the finale it all seems to work out well.  This was a \\"I can't put this book down right now\\" for me and when I was done I found myself lonely for the characters and wanting more.  So off I went to the book store to find another SK book.  This is an enjoyable, funny, wonderful read about how life can take us down different paths which at first seem wrong but then come back around to being the best thing that ever happened to us.  ENJOY!!!!!!
0689853637|4.0|The first line of `A Winter's Tale: An Original Pop-up Journey' reads, \\"Each morning I stand in the new fallen snow and watch as the world awakes around me,\\" which is a metaphor for this entire, short, wonderful book in which the pop-up art \\"awakes\\" from the sparkling, virginal snow on each page.<br /><br />There are six pop-up's in `A Winter's Tale...,' each more complex and detailed than the one that preceded.  A great owl gives way to a den of foxes.  Nearby, an old bear stands near a waterfall not far from a family of deer frolicking in a meadow.  Finally, a moose walks through a swamp near a little house nestled in a winter wonderland.  There is some magic in that little house.<br /><br />Comparisons of `A Winter's Tale...' to Robert Sabuda's concurrent release, `Encyclopedia Prehistoria: Dinosaurs' are inevitable.  While the pop-up art in the latter are more detailed and even a bit more interesting than in the former, `A Winter's Tale...' is a concise, warm story perfect for a cold winter night.  Not by mistake, certainly, `A Winter's Tale...' does not refer to any particular seasonal holidays and is therefore non-denominational.  Thus, the title is a wonderful and special gift for almost any child.  Pop-up art of this quality is delicate, and a retail price tag of $26.95 makes `A Winter's Tale...' more than just an after-thought of a gift, however.  Still, `A Winter's Tale...' will almost certainly be an heirloom book, and is very worth the price of admission.
B00006RCNW|5.0|It is my loss that I don't spend more time looking at what is on TV other than news, commentary, sports and an occaisional special. I was facing knee replacement surgery a little over a month ago and wondering how I would use the down time I would have while recuperating. Little did I know what I was in for when my son, knowing I would have some time on my hands gave me the above DVD saying, \\"I think you might like this and I know you won't forget it.\\" He never spoke truer words. <br /> <br />To say I was drawn into the world created by this show would be an understatement. At first you say to yourself, \\"this is too over the top to be real\\", but before long you are totally invested in the various personalities and situations. There is little point in my detailing what others have already done very well. However, if you are a fan or crime stories and police procedurals, all I can say that there is none better. I was delighted to find that the series I watched was the first year of the show and that there are more out there. I'm on my way to get them. <br />
0684833395|5.0|There are times while reading this novel where you don't know whether to laugh out loud, cry tears of sympathy, or shake and tremble in fear.     Just like war, this novel packs in a full on attack of emotional chaos. The confusion of being in a war time setting is layed on realy thick, and is the only novel that I think has really captured the fear, insanity and hilarity of the men in action.     This novel is a humourous look at a horrendous subject. Some may not agree with everything that is said or inteneded, but the impact of the story is to strong to deny. Much like memories of war, this book will leave a print in your soul.
B000001E18|3.0|Maybe all that time with Brian Eno made U2 decide they should emulate David Bowie in Berlin. Maybe \\"The Fly' in Bono's character bag got the better of him. Whatever the case may be, \\"Zooropa\\" is the most outside the station CD in the U2 library.<br /><br />The band completely flys off the track from the very first song. The title track fades slowly in with found radio/TV noise (a remnant from the Popmart tour, one supposes) before turning in a tossed salad mish-mosh of a lyric. Lines like \\"be all that you can be\\" and \\"eat to stay slimmer\\" sound like the Bowie trick of tearing out phrases and just assembling them at random. But instead of having any meaningful things to say, the first half of \\"Zooropa\\" reads like Bono just tore the headline banners from magazine adverts and pinched them together. (The more explosive second stage is far more interesting.) For a band known for its cutting lyrics, frankly, it feels like a cheat.<br /><br />For that matter, so did the album's first single, the techno-rap \\"Numb.\\" If you've ever seen U2 in concert, you'd know that The Edge offers a lot to the band's vocals. You'd never guess that from \\"Numb.\\" It made for an interesting contrast to the band's usual charismatic crusader singing, but the electronic filtering on Edge's voice, again, seemed a bit odd.<br /><br />Their are some really good songs on \\"Zooropa,\\" saving the album from falling below my 3-stars-for-average rating. Both \\"Stay\\" and \\"The First Time\\" are classic U2 material. Bono's falsetto in \\"Lemon\\" made it a classic club track. The album closer, \\"The Wanderer,\\" took an even greater chance by bringing in Johnny Cash (who was on the cusp of his \\"American Recordings\\" comeback at the time) to add his preacher baritone to U2's tale of a man seeking redemption. As far out as \\"Zooropa\\" was for the band, moving that far left of center brought an otherwise unfabulous album to a genius close.<br /><br />I have always maintained the \\"Zooropa's\\" main flaw was that it didn't seem like a finished album. Coming out relatively quickly after \\"Achtung Baby\\" and the band's reinventing itself for a new decade, songs like \\"Babyface\\" \\"Numb\\" and \\"Dirty Day\\" had an air of incompleteness about them. Sort of like the band just dumped off tracks at the studio and told Eno, Flood, et al., to finish up a disc so they could get back on with touring. While U2 may have really wanted \\"Zooropa\\" to be their \\"Lodger-to-Heroes-to-Low,\\" it falls short of the mark and barely holds a candle to their finest work.'t seem like a finished album.

B0007Y4TVU|4.0|This was my first SOAD musical experience. This CD brought out \\"what the\\" F is this about initially. But after listening to the entire CD, I asked myself; \\"What did I just listen to?\\"  Then I played it again. And again! Now I am constantly playing it.<br /><br />  \\"Mezmerize\\" intros with \\"Soldier Side\\" then blast off with \\"B.Y.O.B\\" (Bring your own bombs) and asks the question \\"Why do they always send the poor?\\"  \\"Revenga\\" rivals in \\"Bleeding in a sink.\\" And \\"Cigaro\\" references the hugest member of the band I think.<br /><br />\\"Radio/Video\\" spooks the look and listen. \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\" bends the mind into a trip of epic proportion. \\"Violent Pornography\\" means everybody does something and then dances. Right?  \\"Question!\\" contains sweet berries ready to eat. \\"Sad Statue\\" drowns our sad country lyrically. \\"Old School Hollywood\\" and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" joins a long list of this city of dysfunction. Enough said!<br /><br />  \\"Mezmerize\\" crosses many genres and whips them into a highly unique blend of anti-messages with liquid sound not categorized. Serj Tankian (Vocals, Guitar) and Daron Malakian (Vocals, Keyboards) blend harmonized vocals and vocal note distortion not seen since Bobby McFerrin. Shavo Odadjian (Bass) and John Dolmayan (Drums) round out this cast of trendsetters.<br /><br />  Take this magnificent journey into sound satisfaction and lyrical message brainwashing. Join the fresh fruits from experienced musicians at the height of experimentation. Do not miss out on this opportunity! Purchase this CD before part two is thrust upon you.

B0007IPBD6|4.0|I like Damion Rice's music a great deal.  He's one of my favorite artists.  I listen to \\"O\\" at least once a week.  This album contains 4 songs from that album plus 4 other other songs.  I like Lisa Hannigan, but the song \\"Then Go\\" is too dark for me.  Her version of \\"Silent Night\\" is tuneful, but seems misplaced on this CD.  Her harmonies with Damion are phenomenol and I'm sure she'd do great on a solo album but her songs on this album don't fit what I expected.  The version of \\"Volcano\\" on this CD is the best song on the album and probably a bit freer and better than the version on \\"O\\" (though both are outstanding).   <br /> <br />If you want to buy just one Damion Rice CD, don't spend the big bucks on this CD.  Buy \\"O\\".

1573223085|5.0|The subtitle of Pink's latest thought-provoking work is \\"moving from the information age to the conceptual age.\\" This shift, this transformation, will drive the future of work, education and training, employment opportunities and locations, and what we value as a society.  <br /> <br />As a futurist, I saw the movement that this book addresses, but I didn't know quite how to describe it. For years, we have emphasized the importance of left-brain activities. Logic and literal path thinking have dominated our lives, while creativity and conceptual thinking-and acting-have been given less importance. American education has shifted to more left-brain training, at the expense of cultivating the artistic, the holistic strengths.  <br />The education in other countries, notably India and China, concentrates on rote, mechanical, and structured learning. Procedure. This is the problem, so this is the answer. <br />Thousands and thousands of graduates, at various levels of schooling, are very well prepared to perform routine tasks with high proficiency...and at relatively low income. The types of jobs that rely on the strengths associated with the left side of the brain will go to these countries for economic reasons, leaving Americans who lack right-brain skill development in the lurch.  <br /> <br />Daniel Pink explains the shift well in the first part of his book. After the instructional first chapter, he explains how abundance, Asia, and automation are driving opportunity in America toward the right brain strengths. This next phase of our lives is well-presented in the chapter on High Concept, High Touch. In Part Two, the reader learns more about what the author believes are the principal aspects of style that will become most prevalent, most influential, in the success of the future. <br /> <br />We learn about six senses: design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning. Pink explains each of these elements, then presents a \\"portfolio\\" at the end of each chapter. Here the reader will find a collection of tools, exercises, and additional reading which the author feels will be helpful to the reader's grasp of his concept. Frankly, the six that Pink has selected are nowhere near complete. The list of senses, of lenses through which to view the future and one's integration with the future, will be somewhat different for each of us. As we move further into the conceptual age, we'll identify more and more primary concerns that will join this initial list. The transformation is in process; more will surface over time. This list is a fine place to start.  <br /> <br />Notes and an index supplement this book nicely. This volume will stimulate your thinking and send you to the resources to continue your exploration. You'll almost feel motivated by a personal relationship with the author, although he doesn't let you too close. Throughout the book, Pink shares personal stories and perspectives that reveal the inner Man, yet stop just short of vulnerability. An interesting metaphor to opening a topic, opening an action process, and seeking to stimulate minds to take this work and carry forward into the future. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.  <br /> <br />Roger E.

B00005JNJV|5.0|I've been avoiding much of Holleywood's latest productions due to so many predictable stories, politically-driven plots, and mediocre acting so I did not catch this one in theatres. I probably would not even have rented it if my son had not begged me to do so. I am sooooo glad now that I've seen it. I'm blown away... this is not only the best Batman movie out there but one of the top five best action/adventure movies I've ever seen!! I bought a copy through Amazon before even finishing the DVD.<br /><br />Batman has always been one of my favorite superheros but one that has rarely been well captured on screen. He's basically a regular, more-or-less everyday guy who works out a lot and has some cool gadgets; sort of brooding James Bond in a mask and cape. This movie starts out by showing how he learned and perfected his martial arts skills. It really captures the soul of the Dark Knight. Christian Bale is a perfect choice to play this character. I can't say enough positive things about this approach, it's exactly how I have always pictured the character.<br /><br />The pacing nears perfection, the action is gripping and extremely well choreographed, the acting is top rate, the writing is fantastic, and the cinematography is outstanding. Rarely is a known story done so originally and well. I love the depth of the characters, the splashes of humor, and the low-key but everpresent moral undertones. It's neither preachy nor over the top. And, despite the fact that we all have a pretty good idea of the plot it is surprisingly original. Oh, and it's got Liam Neesan with a sword too; what more could you want ;-)<br /><br />I am also very impressed with how they show Gotham being very much like any large US city today yet demonstrate in a realistic and believable manner how a masked superhero and fantastic villians can fit in that context. I really hope this cast/crew/director hook-up again for a sequal as the calling card at the end perhaps suggests.<br /><br />Fantastic; heartily recommended!eartily recommended!
B000068TPN|5.0|This is a movie that gets to the heart of the early days of the Vietnam War. Mel Gibson,Sam Elliott, Greg Kinnear and Madeleine Stowe presented first rate performances in one of the violent battles of Vietnam. Graphic, powerful, true to life can be summarize this movie just before Gibson presented the Passion of the Christ. If you want a true perspective of this war, then be sure and watch We Were Soldiers!
B000007MVD|5.0|Every time I stumble across this set in the used bin of a record store, a little piece of my mind is blown. <br /> <br />Hey, I've had to sell off pieces of my CD collection for quick cash before, too, but I see the Beatles BBC almost every time I go through record store used bins, and that's something I do quite frequently.  You may note, too, that there are more than 100 used copies for sale right here on Amazon. <br /> <br />What the hell?  This is such a fine, happy little set of sounds that I'm amazed at how little respect it gets.  Dozens upon dozens of raw, in-the-studio performances from a prime Beatle period: 1962-65; and a set list that burns through material that includes lots from the Beatles catalogue, plus R&B, Chuck Berry tunes, girl group songs, rockabilly and skewed cuts like \\"The Honeymoon Theme\\" and Johnny Burnette's \\"Lonesome Tears in My Eyes,\\" my favorite track on the album. <br /> <br />My only complaint about the songlist: There's a huge chunk of the material from the great \\"Beatles For Sale,\\" but no \\"Baby's in Black\\"?   <br /> <br />But that's balanced out by lots of goofy, good-humored banter by the guys and BBC presenters Tony Hall, Brian Matthews and more.  By all accounts, Beatlemania was a drag but based on this it certainly doesn't sound like it.  These guys are playing great and having a blast.
0783240236|5.0|If you remember seeing this movie at your theatre or on television a long time ago then you should have this DVD in your collection! It is still one of Hitchcock's masterpieces after 42 years. It has a quiet beginning but picks up the pace later on. Good entertainment!!
B000AP04L0|5.0|Mundane trivialities have a significant importance in many people's lives, as they have sunk into an existence where an income is more important than happiness.  The unhappiness often begins with everyday routines such as getting back and forth from work while spending the majority of their time at a job where they are miserable.  This suburban look on existentialism might be something that many can connect with, as everyday begins with the apprehension of the annoying alarm clock's sound and the irritating traffic congestions.  Meanwhile, the people tend to complain about the mind-numbing dreadfulness of their existence, as they do nothing to create a change for themselves.  A resulting factor is that they have entrapped themselves in the corporate establishment where their desire of objects is larger than the yearning for happiness. Mike Judge's film Office Space takes on the corporate induced melancholy through the eyes of a worn-out office worker Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) who takes matters in his own hands.<br /><br />The comical humor in the initial scene presents the notion of the large number of people who commute back and forth to work.  Coming from Chicago, I can relate to the long and difficult ventures through the crammed highways, which also gets to Peter and his coworkers.  This sequence also suggests how many people actually undergo the everyday torment of making a living, maybe with a job that they hate.  Whether people hate their job, or not, the film encapsulates the essence of the frustration that comes with the occupational travel.  In addition, Judge shows that he understands the accumulation of frustration, as the journey to work spills over into the working day when the workers vent their anger on uncooperative fax machines and annoyance of repetitive sound.  If the problems were not enough with frustration and boredom, the bosses, here Bill Lundberg (Gary Cole), breathes down necks with overtime and better quality production.  One of the frequent behaviors that helps Peter and his friends manage their frustration is to wish their lives away by desiring for time to move faster, which could hasten time to the returning commute home.<br /><br />The negative professional life that Peter possesses influences his personal and social life, as he returns home depleted after the emotional and psychological stress of his job.  It even affects his sleeping pattern, as nightmares about work haunt him.  The stress continues to increase as Initech, the company that he works for, has decided to downsize and his girlfriend has arranged for them to see a hypnotherapist to help deal with their relationship.  However, amidst the hypnosis of Peter, that is supposed to help him feel more blissful, the therapist suffers from a heart attack.  Peter remains within the peaceful ignorance of what is happening in his life, as he decides to sleep through the weekend and not go to work without feeling guilt, anguish, or any other kind of negative emotional response that would cause stress.<br /><br />The aftermath of not showing up at work for the weekend overtime begins to mount, and with the notion of the downsizing in the back of the mind, his future might seem dark in regards to employment and economy.  However, in his mental state of happiness he finds strength to take control of his own life, which takes his life on a number of unexpected turns.  If the corporate America experienced an overwhelming number of people undergoing hypnosis similar to Peter's, it would drastically affect the national economy.  With this in mind, the film provides an interesting thought in regards to personal happiness and the commercial industry's desire to control people's pleasure with what people need for financial profits.<br /><br />Office Space presents a truly remarkable societal comedy that reflects on the average person's place in society in the shadow of socioeconomic status.  It does so with a heavy dose of comic relief, as it portrays a wide range of interesting characters such as the flair wearing waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), the closet tough guy Michael Bolton (David Herman), and the enterprising Samir (Ajay Naidu).  Then there is the muttering Milton (Stephen Root) who the company has laid off, but never informed.  These characters all provide an essential part of the story, as they help mirror different elements of the society.  The film also provides an empowering perspective of how some people find a way to dig themselves out of their own miserable existence when things look awful.  Altogether, every aspect of the story such as the score, cast, and story accentuates the terrific comedy that blends societal issues with dry everyday humor in a bellyaching manner.t portrays a wide range of interesting characters such as the flair wearing waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), the closet tough guy Michael Bolton (David Herman), and the enterprising Samir (Ajay Naidu).

B000059QY3|3.0|This production of la traviata could have been close to historic but the fact of having Mr. Lopardo as Alfredo Germont, lows considerably the level of this presentation. Gheorghiu sings and acts in a superb level, Nucci as allways is a very correct baritone, and Solti conduction is near to wonderfull. The Stage production is made with good taste. Conclussion: It is not a bad idea to buy this Traviata, although Alfredo is not close to what he should be.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Life is chaos.  At any given time, multiple events take place throughout the world that could affect any given individual within the period from now until an unset moment sometime in the future.  A myriad of different occurrences could happen at any given time, and how a person reacts to one of these events will determine the direction of the person's life.  Thus, the individual possesses some power to steer their own life depending on how they act on the event in life.  However, these events are distilled into a few sure incidents that will certainly happen to us all and a few predetermined occurrences emerge such as conception, aging, and death.  Aging people accumulate experiences that they either assimilate or alter to fit their view of life, usually in a pleasant and comfortable manner.  The Coen Brother's existential comedy The Big Lebowski introduces the audience to a protagonist, Jeffrey Lebowski a.k.a. The Dude (Jeff Bridges), who merely allows life to pull him in whatever direction it wants, as long as he can visit the local bowling alley, sip on his White Russians, and enjoy the freedom of no responsibilities.<br /><br />A thoughtful opening displays the parched environment outside Los Angeles while panning forward until it presents a nightly overview of the smoggy city.  The camera follows lonely drifting tumbleweed, which suggestively brings the mind to the external forces that operate within the universe.  Simultaneously, the Stranger's (Sam Elliott) voice presents a prologue that succeeds to be exceptionally vague in its explanation to why this is a pertinent tale (but it is significant as it affects us all - life that is.)  The dry tumbleweed eventually reaches the Pacific Ocean, which analogously provides the notion of the cyclical pattern of life, as the Stranger informs the viewer about when and where the story begins.<br /><br />The story begins in a supermarket dairy aisle where the Dude, dressed in a bathrobe and slippers, stumbles to find some half-and-half for his White Russians.  Untroubled by his existence he returns home after this late night visit to the store, but to his astonishment discovers that two thugs are waiting for him.  One of these witless ruffians brutalizes him with the help of a toilet while the other urinates on his rug before they realize that that they got the wrong man.  They are looking for the millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski whom they intended to extort, as this turned out to be a case of mistaken identity.  Nonetheless, the Dude expresses his irritation about the urine on his rug to his bowling buddies, the bipolar and anxiously edgy Vietnam vet Walter (John Goodman) and the timid and verbally abused Donny (Steve Buscemi).  Walter suggests that the Dude should visit the Mr. Lebowski and explain to him that he owns him a new rug because someone soiled his rug due to him having the same name.<br /><br />The visit with Mr. Lebowski steers the Dude on a path unlike his character, as he has to act on the events taking place in his life and be responsible for his actions.  At the same time, he tries to be himself, lax and calm, while neglecting life (he even calls himself the Dude, which might be an allusion to that he tries to reduce his own existence to nothingness.)  However, the series of events that he triggered by requesting a new rug is set into action and numerous dubious characters begin to enter his previously calm life.  The story snowballs into a potpourri of intriguing characters such as viscously bowling pederast Jesus (John Turturro), the manipulative trophy wife Bunny (Tara Reid), and the artistic stepdaughter (Julianne Moore).  All these characters provide windows of opportunity for the Dude.  Yet nothing seems to motivate the Dude to strive for an accomplishment, as he merely allows the people around him to maneuver his existence.  There are a couple of scenes when Walter's over-sensitive presence enhances the cinematic moment, as he thrusts his demandingly selfish perspective on life toward others including the Dude and Donny.<br /><br />The Big Lebowski is an over the top comedy with frequent displays of symbolism in regards to existential philosophy.  The symbolism emerges mostly through the different characters and their actions, but it also evolves throughout the films visual expression such as the tumbleweed rolling down the Pacific beach.  However, the story of the Dude also provides interesting implications to the invisible force of social interaction and the dynamic consequence of initial action, which brings the mind to the butterfly effect and chaos theory.  The chaos pattern is noticeable throughout the film in the mise-en-scene, story line, dream sequence, and the behavior of some characters.  The film also touches on static features of life such as conception, aging, and death while cinematically remaining aware of the human factor by introducing nihilism, moral values, and religion among many other facets.  The multilayered tale that the Coen Brothers expose exhibits colorful and cerebral writing that together with a brilliant cast accentuates the film's many angles and thoughts.  The Big Lebowski truly is a cinematic gem that radiates humor, wisdom, and aptitude with a progressing (it gets better each time I see it) and remarkable intensity, which will not drift into some unused space of the brain.<br /><br />The Coen Brother's who frequently work together to show that it is possible to make an artistically dense film with much humor and suspense that keeps a large number of audience members' attention from the beginning to the end.  Here in the Big Lebowski the Coen's succeed to submit a cinematic experience untouched by the corporate movie industry, which stands outside the formulaic approach often used to capture viewer's attention.  Not only do they make a unique film, they also conceive a visual experience that continues to unravel new ideas and concepts after the initial viewing.  In a sense, the film allows the viewer to reach out and build on the film themselves with their own knowledge and wisdom, which permits the audience to increase their own understanding of the world and its many secrets.

1400034205|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time.  I've read it several times and seen both movie versions.  In fact, it was the unusual, but excellent 1984 Bill Murray portrayal of Larry which made this book known to me in the first place.  Here is the story of several characters, some likable and some not, in the post World War I era.  Larry, a happy, go-lucky twenty-something pilot (in the movie he's an ambulance driver) returns from the war distraught and disturbed.  Before the war he was engaged to Isabel and was going to return and work in his soon to be father in-law's office as stock-broker with his war volunteer buddy Gray.  His friends and connections back home would provide him with a secure and comfortable future and he had it made.  But unlike some modern day college graduate who's spent their education earning a pre-fab, slam-dunk business degree so as to quickly land a high-paying job, launching themselves into the American dream of yuppy-land, Larry takes a left turn.  To Isabel, his friends and family it seems like a wrong turn.  To others he will come to meet, Larry has avoided a certain car wreck.<br /><br />What makes \\"The Razor's Edge\\" a classic is that you as a reader get to decide for yourself the wisdom of each character's decisions.  Somerset Maugham definitely focuses a lot on wealthy, class-oriented Eliot, who seems to be closest in personality to the author himself; but it's obvious too, that a character like Larry was both scarry and intriguing to him.  At times it seems like Maugham is mocking Larry, but in others there is a begrudging respect and admiration for him.  This ambiguity creates a unique reading experience, especially for those who've read a biography of Maugham (I recommend Ted Morgan's biography).<br /><br />From Eliot the likable snob, to Larry, Gray, Sophie, and Isabel each character is mostly \\"rounded\\" (see E.M. Forster's \\"Aspects of the Novel\\" for round & flat characters):  they are interesting, realistic, and true to form - all the way to the end.  As a writer that's not easy to pull off in convincing fashion.  One character not represented in either movie version is Suzanne, an artist who Larry spends some time with in Marseille; while she is drawn more flatly than the other main characters, I enjoyed this obscure aspect of Larry's life in much the same way that great movies are sometimes reincarnted as \\"director's cuts\\" with intriguing facets of a film previously edited out; it's like you're seeing a new dimension of something you previously thought complete.  In any event, there are also plenty of interesting minor charcters like Kosti (Larry's mining partner in Germany) and his Indian guide (who's name escapes me) who both get Larry to think in new ways about people and life.<br /><br />The transistions from pre-war Chicago and its suburbs, to Paris, Germany, the Indian Himalayas, and back to Paris are fascinating.  Through his own accounts with a good friend of Eliot's (Maugham himself is a character in the book) in various Parisian cafes and restaurants (many of which can & should be visited today in Montparnasse or throughout Paris so as to get a true flavor of the novel) Larry talks about his adventures.  He is the quintessential seeker and bohemian.  What he's after is fulfillment and self-knowledge (or is it really salvation?) - something he would hardly be able to have time to find in any depth on the path he was on before.  While he predictably loses Isabel (who has her own legitimate needs and reasons for pursuing her own ambitions & desires) to Gray, Larry gains intangible, unquantifiable (and for some like Eliot or the author, questionable) benefits through his experiences.  He works in low-paying, crummy jobs in order to live in Paris where he reads a lot, hangs out in cafes and restaurants, enjoys the nightlife and lives a lifestyle he finds invigorating.  Later we find him working in a coal mine in Germany.  There he meets an every-day kind of guy miner named Kosti who tells him about his travels to India, and recommends reading the Upanishads.  \\"But you won't find answers in a book; you'll have to go there.\\"  Larry is hooked.  Upon arrival he visits the Elephanta cave in Bombay and has a sort of vision.  He finds his way to Varanasi, where he stays on the boat of a man who asks him why he worked in a coal mine, and Larry responds, \\"To make money to come here\\".  And his Indian host replies something like, \\"that was the reason, but what was the intention? For work without meaning is an empty motion.\\"  We see that Larry's education has reached a new plateau, and eventually we find him in a Buddhist monastery where he stays for a visit.  (I seem to recall a visit at a Christian monastery too, perhaps earlier while he was in Germany, but I saw the movie version more recently and that scene's left out too).  Anyhow, Larry learns that it's easy to be a philospher on a mountain-top (Nietzsche's \\"Zarathustra\\") and that he must return to society.  He must get \\"dirty\\" again and grovel with the people.  In fact, one of the first things we find him doing is helping he friend Gray recover from a mental breakdown following the stock market crash and his father's apparant suicide.  Yes, he's also lost his fiance, for which he's remorseful, but she wouldn't come with him on his journey.  But the career prospects which he'll never have again are gladly sacraficed in the name of being several steps closer to the salvation he truly thirsts for than he'd ever be had he not gone down this path.  A path which beckons many, but has few takers.  A path that is \\"as thin and difficult to traverse as the razor's ege.\\"<br /><br />Choices are more abundant and confusing nowadays . . . it's harder and harder to say no to some job we'll obviously hate when we need the money.  Or think we need the money.  In any event, these are the types of universal personal choices Somerset Maugham captures so well here (not without his own ambiguous criticisms and opinions if you read closely enough too), and which are difficult.  Life's choices are never easy, and there are both long term and short term consequences of all decisions, the implications of which may not be known for many years.  Sophie had some bad luck, but also made destructive choices that perhaps, she couldn't help making.  Fate & karma versus individual empowerment and choice:  these are interesting (unanswerable in my opinion) dilemmas underlaying this novel.  Larry looks for answers - does he really find any?  In the end, as in real life, no one's really \\"better\\" than anyone else, and each has achieved success in some degree.  They have gotten what they wanted.  And I can't think of a better way to end this review other than to say that I would like you to give my favorite novel of all time a try.  Namaste!<br /><br />And by the way, if you like this novel you may want to try \\"The Moon & Sixpence\\", which was written earlier, and covers a very similar theme, where Paul Gauguin is the subject.vels to India, and recommends reading the Upanishads.  \\"But you won't find answers in a book; you'll have to go there.\\"  Larry is hooked.

B000B2YQX4|4.0|Expectations unmet always result in an unfavorable album review.  At first, I was disappointed.  I wanted a whole album full of Precious-styled songs.  That wasn't the case.  A lot of the songs seemed simplistic, musically speaking, and almost rough to the ear.  They weren't completely absorbing me or making me feel deep emotions like Violator, Songs of Faith and Devotion, and Ultra, to name some more recent albums.  I felt as if the music wasn't as deep and rich, with the arrangements not as lush and full and effective as they used to be.  I'd even compare them to much older songs like \\"The Sun and the Rainfall\\" and \\"Blasphemous Rumors\\" and almost feel cheated.  But nonetheless, this album has really grown on me and sounds much better today than it did almost two weeks ago.  For some reason, the rough sound to my ear has greatly minimized, and the songs have taken on a rich and edgy life of ther own.  Many negative reviews on this album have been written prematurely in my opinion.  One can't write a completely accurate review the same day or two the album comes out after only a listen or two.  This album is almost like a finely-aged wine, where the longer you listen, the better it becomes (the case with a lot of albums).  I tend to find that I get less tired of the albums that have to grow on me, versus the ones that are immediately accessible (those get older faster).  Precious is of course a standout, along with, surprisingly, two Gahan-penned tracks:  \\"Suffer Well\\" and \\"I Want It All.\\"  \\"I Want It All\\" is the slowest song on the album, but very captivating and smooth, while maintaining a dark edge.  That's the essence of Depeche Mode.  Edge.  Edge, edge, edge.  \\"The Darkest Star\\" gets better and better as the long closer to the album, and \\"Lilian\\" is probably one of the more instantly infectious tunes.  \\"John the Revelator\\" has gotten very addictive, despite my not liking it at all at first.  And \\"A Pain that I'm Used To\\" is a pretty good, semi-fast paced opener.  \\"Macro\\" and \\"Damaged People\\" are the two Gore-sung tracks.  They're okay, and \\"Macro\\" has become very infectious, but both are nothing close to the vein of \\"The Things You Said\\" or \\"One Caress.\\"  I should also mention that anyone who gives this album 5 stars is not truly using this scale effectively.  I mean, you can't have Black Celebration and Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion ranked 5, and Playing the Angel ranked 5 too.  It's not as good, period.  It's good...it's getting better everyday to me...growing on me immensely...but still, it's not in the same class as those other albums.  Everyone has to admit that.  All that aside, this album should be looked at alone, by itself.  It's darned better than most crud being quickly produced these days...and much better than most new bands trying to get in on the genre's \\"comeback.\\"  There's only room for one Gahan and one Depeche Mode, and this album has reaffirmed that they're keeping it for quite some time to come..  \\"Macro\\" and \\"Damaged People\\" are the two Gore-sung tracks.

B000A3XYZA|5.0|This is one of the best Handel opera stagings I have seen, very modern and artistically daring. William Christie and his orchestra are great, and the singers are really outstanding, especially Antonacci in the title role, and the two countertenors. Rodelinda is becoming very popular these days, and hopefully we will soon see  more new producitons of this opera, but I think this one is set to become a classic. A must see for anyone interested in the glories of Baroque opera, and brillantly performed Handel.
B0000027RL|5.0|1991 was a pivotal turning point in rock. With the release of Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" the rules changed overnight. Seattle Washington served as a beacon for what was cool in modern rock.<br /><br />1991 saw the release of many classic albums from the Seattle movement. These albums include Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" Soundgarden's \\"Badmoterfinger,\\" Mudhoney's \\"All Good Boys Deserve Fudge,\\" and of course, Pearl Jam's \\"Ten.\\"<br /><br />Of these releases, \\"Ten\\" was the most radio friendly and commercial. The band received some criticism for this, most notably from Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. While \\"Nevermind\\" was the breakthrough that brought alternative rock and grunge to the mainstream, it was \\"Ten\\" that gave the movement its mass popularity.<br /><br />Pearl Jam's music does have some trappings of grunge; distorted fuzzy guitars, dark brooding lyrics; but there is a clear element of classic rock in their music. It should be noted that \\"Ten\\" actually has less of a \\"grunge\\" sound than Pearl Jam's later work. While many grunge bands paid tribute to Iggy and the Stooges, Black Flag, and Black Sabbath, Pearl Jam was influenced by such arena rock bands as Aerosmith, Jimi Hendrix, and Led Zeppelin. Although \\"Ten\\" can be pigeonholed as being a \\"grunge\\" album, its roots are embedded in late 60s and 70s arena rock.<br /><br />Pearl Jam benefited from the fact that two of its members Stone Gossard (guitar) and Jeff Ament (bass) had been playing together for years in the legendary Seattle bands Green River, and then Mother Love Bone. The debut is thus simultaneously a product of a seasoned artist, and a fresh new band. The duel lead guitars of Gossard and Mike Mccready compliment each other well and provide instrumental firepower that is passionate and intense, yet never flashy or self-indulgent. Ament and Dave Krusen (drums) provide an able and exciting rhythm section.<br /><br />Singer Eddie Vedder fit the band, and the scene overall like a glove. Much like Cobain, his honest, downbeat lyrics and tortured delivery served as sharp contrast to the processed cheese of the late 80s and early 90s. While many frontmen of the mid-to-late 90s disingenuously emulated his style (Scott Stapp, Gavin Rosedale), Vedder's persona was authentic and found a generation that was very receptive.<br /><br />\\"Ten\\" is basically a greatest hits album, in of itself. Boasting three hit singles (\\"Even Flow,\\" \\"Alive,\\" and \\"Jeremy\\") many of the other tracks served as radio staples i.e., \\"Why Go,\\" \\"Black.\\" Even the songs that weren't hits are still spectacular. This makes \\"Ten\\" a flawless classic.<br /><br />\\"Ten\\" stars out with the intense \\"Once,\\" in which Vedder really sounds like he is loosing his mind and wants his control back. The opening riff of \\"Even Flow\\" is about as catchy, well known, and memorable as Led Zeppelin's \\"Black Dog\\" and is one of the best singles of the early 90s. The brooding, mid-tempo \\"Alive\\" was perhaps the album's biggest hit. The forceful \\"Why Go\\" takes its cue from \\"Once,\\" but is aimed outward rather than inward. \\"Black\\" slows the album down a notch, without loosing momentum. This is probably my personal favorite song on the album, with its tormented delivery, atmospheric riff, and haunting background vocals. \\"Jeremy,\\" is another mid-tempo depressing song. It is somewhat similar to \\"Black\\" but is different enough to make it equally exciting. The mood swings slightly upward for the epic, majestic \\"Oceans.\\" \\"Porch,\\" with its infectious hook is one of the album's more underrated rockers. The album moves into the morose \\"Garden,\\" another great song which keeps up the momentum. \\"Deep\\" is the only song that I sometimes skip over. It's good, but not quite up-to-par with the rest of the album. The magnificent \\"Release\\" is breathtaking and epic, yet never self-indulgent. It is the perfect way to conclude the album.<br /><br />\\"Ten\\" served as a blueprint for many bands of the post-grunge era. Indeed, Creed should be paying royalty checks to Pearl Jam every time they sell an album. \\"Ten,\\" however, remains head-and-shoulders above its imitators and is a true modern day classic.<br /><br />While every Pearl Jam release is worth owning, \\"Ten\\" remains their best album. In terms of well crafted, memorable songs with great hooks and earnest lyrics, few albums can compete with \\"Ten.\\"-shoulders above its imitators and is a true modern day classic.

B000A7DVY0|5.0|This movie is very personal to me.  The Coen Brothers have always been a favorite of my family and The Dude looks, acts, and talks exactly like my dead father.<br /><br />That said, my high score for this film is not just because I like it, but because it's excellent.  I'm going to save the usual great directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and humor (all of which it has) and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times I watch it.<br /><br />First of all, the dialog specifically.  Move over, Tarantino and Kevin Smith, you have been owned.  This dialog is faster, wittier, more real, and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible.  Was the dialog even written down?  Most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each other's direction and they are talking about whatever they want to, and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep re-emerging later, characters go off on regular tangents (and I'm not just talking about the Vietnam War, either), and the actors never, ever fall out of character.  It's amazing to behold.<br /><br />Secondly, the storyline's general arch.  Many conversations I've had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back.  In fact, the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way The Dude ends up worse off than he was before, but then again he's happier and the status quo has returned, so it's still contained brilliantly.  The thing is that the Coen brothers tend to write very character-driven plots, where the character's personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations.  Furthermore, it's not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless, like a lot of lesser character-driven plots: it all ties together and is contained beautifully.  This movie could not have ended any other way.<br /><br />Finally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack.  Honestly, this the role John Goodman was born to do, and of course he did it brilliantly.  Not only can I not imagine anyone else doing it, I can't imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting Dude.  Together with Donnie, the three make a relationship so much more real than almost ever shown on screen.<br /><br />And now we FINALLY, FINALLY have a three-disc special edition of the brilliance.  This was long overdue.  I loved my other copy because I love movies more than extras, but man is it good to know that this has been given some more treatment.  Now we have all the more materials to use to love this work of art better than ever before!<br /><br />--PolarisDiBay. <br /> <br />Finally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack.

1400032717|3.0|I need to read this book again.  I didn't think it was bad, but just didn't think it was that great and yet everyone raves about it.  I saw Dave Barry recommend this book and author on the Today Show and between admiring Dave Barry's writing and also because I have a son with high functioning autims I could't wait to get the book.   Maybe I read it too quickly because as I say while I thought it was good I did not think it was great.  I am going to give it another chance as I am \\"curious\\" why everyone thinks it is so fantastic.
B00005R24K|4.0|Even though I own this movie on DVD, I had to catch it on a special midnight screening last night so that I could finally see it in all it's big-screen, publicly squeamish glory.<br /><br />I'm not saying it needs it, but on the big screen this film is so much more obviously amazing.  The crazy angles and tracking shots are very involving and basically disallow the viewer from not getting trapped into its story.<br /><br />Especially nice about this movie is its fun.  The makers obviously never wanted to let up, so it just delves right in and never stops.  Not only does it not matter that a lot of the events in this film are unexplained, most of the time nobody thinks even to point that out.  The movie is so true to it's own desire to just immerse and never come out for breath that it is wonderfully self-secure.  It only gives a few tidbits of why things are happening to give the audience some foundation so as not to just float away in a random haze of chaos.<br /><br />On a smaller screen, the effects don't seem very special, but on a wide-screen, they are quite good and still very fun.  The entire movie is by no means the greatest horror film in existence, but everything in it is good and just as good as it needs to be.<br /><br />I'd say all horror fans should see it, but especially if there's a showing in an independant theatre nearby.  Then buy the DVD anyways because how else can you say you own a film where a woman gets raped by a tree?<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B000929AJQ|3.0|What can I say, big NIN fan, so hey I can't bash this CD and give it 1 or 2 stars like some other people.  I agree with the reviewer who said he dosn't understand where the hatred for this album comes, because it's not a bad effort.  However, I also agree with the reviewer that said that great art usually comes from pain, because now that Trent is sober there seems to be some of that old fire lacking from his sound.  Some of these songs are a bit tedious are boring and i have to skip them.  But don't get me wrong, the other half of the songs are really good... but I used to be able to listen to NIN all the way through.  Now having to skip a few tracks made me decide to write this review and give this one 3 stars.  Not bad, not great.  Unless you're a big NIN fan you might want to think of picking up Pretty Hate Machine or the Downward Spiral instead.
B00004XONN|5.0|I remember when I first listened to \\"Kid A\\" five years ago. I just wasn't ready for it. I had to hear much, much, much more music... Back then, it was highly experimental material that many of us were not ready to digest, a blend of prog with electronica that was just beginning to brew. It was clear that it was a step up for Thom Yorke and the band, but until you see it from a \\"safe\\" distance, it's not obvious HOW MUCH of a step up it is for music at large.<br /><br />It wasn't just that they incorporated a brass section during \\"The National Anthem\\" or managed to pull off a some rather hypnotic tracks through it. Or how the upbeat was balanced against the the  melancholic as the tracks progressed. Or even the hidden booklet anti-Tony Blair propaganda under the plastic that holds the CD. Though all of this individually would make an album stand out as clever, the fact that it all came together so seamlessly, in such an impeccable way, to culminate with the brilliant \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" puts them in a spot where only a few legendary bands will ever be: the place where sound pioneers delve and explore, to bring back what they've discovered, for everyone else to take the next step.
B000002R48|5.0|Ah, Dream Theater. My favorite band of all time. This is their debut album. This is possibly the best debut album of all time! This is also their only album that has Charlie Dominici on vocals. I still think James LaBrie is better, but Charlie ain't bad either. I say he sounds like a mix of Geddy Lee (Rush) and Bruce Dickinson (hope I don't have to ell you who he is from), with emphasis on Lee. You also have killer guitar solos from THE John Petrucci, great drumming from Mike Portnoy, great bass from John Myung, and great solos from keyboard virtuoso Kevin Moore. It's still amazing that the band members were only, at most, 25 when they did this album! My only complaint is the production: It sucks. I even have the remastered version and the sound sucks. I he that the record company soon actually REMASTERS it and not REISSUES it. Otherwie, this is a landmark debut album.<br /><br />The songs-<br /><br />1. A Fortune In Lies- From the opening drums, you'll know you're in one hell of a roller coaster! A great song, Charlie sounds a lot like Geddy Lee here. 5/5<br /><br />2. Status Seeker- Great song. 5/5<br /><br />3. Ytse Jam- Arguably the band's most well-known instrumental. The bass solo, before the drum solo, is AMAZING! 5/5<br /><br />4. The Killing Hand-  The longest song on the album, at almost 9 minutes, and the band's first epic. this is my thrid favorite on the album. 5/5<br /><br />5. Light Fuse And Get Away- 5/5<br /><br />6. Afterlife- 5/5<br /><br />7. The Ones Who Help To Set The Sun- Possibly the heaviest song on the album. Has an erie intro, then a keyboard riff, then goes into chugging riffs. My second favorite on the album. 6/5<br /><br />8. Only A Matter Of Time- THE best song on the album! The keyboard solo at the beginning is alone worth this album's purchase! It's very catchy. It is also the album's namesake \\"When dream and day unite tonight,\\" is where this album got its name. 10/5<br /><br />So, there you go. IMHO, the best debut album ever. This isn't the best place for ne wfans to start - that's what \\"Images & Words\\" is for.st debut album ever. This isn't the best place for ne wfans to start - that's what \\"Images & Words\\" is for.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A few months a ago, I had hardly even heard of \\"Firefly\\". I dimly recalled it being on Fox a few years ago and having been canceled. I even more dimly recalled from reading SF news sources online that there was a movie (Serenity) on the way and a series of comics in the works. But, I'm usually home on Fridays, and what the heck, SciFi channel was showing the series right before Stargate: SG1, one of the few TV shows I watch regularly anymore. So I tuned in. <br /> <br />Within 9 weeks, I was completely addicted. Within nine weeks, I had spent half of one of my paychecks on Firefly/Serentity merchendise and dragged my parents to a showing of the film (which we all ended up enjoying immensely). Within 10 weeks and after having gotten a copy of the box set and seeing the original 2-part pilot episode (which I had previously missed), I had decided to buy even more stuff and make my Christmas list - both of the soundtracks, books on it, name it - filled out mostly by Firefly/Serenity stuff. And today I decided to buy more copies of the box set that I already own just so that I can share this rare gem of a show. I've never gotten so addicted to or so obsessed with a show this quickly. Never. <br /> <br />It's just THAT good.  <br /> <br />I can't think of anybody who wouldn't enjoy this show on at least some level. <br /> <br />Hardcore SF fans will love it for the attention to detail - there's no sound in space, the vast human culture that went out into the universe speaks quite a bit of Chinese, and all sorts of other nifty, subtle touchs. Engineers would probably love the ships, including the homely-in-a-beatiful-sort-of-way Serenity herself, the Firefly class ship whose design is geniusly practical (and her rear lights up something gorgeous, too). Film students or film junkies will love it for the unusual, wonderful camera work, brilliant acting, great special effects, and fantastic use of both beautiful, earthy music and poignant moments of dead silence. Fans of westerns will love the feel of the show and theme of the show, which is that of a western in space (some planets our heroes go to even have horses and saloons, and the crew of Serenity's robbed trains before). Horror fans will fall in love with the damn scary Reavers, cannibalistic madmen who terrorize even the toughest of men just by their name being overheard. Fans of Joss Whedon's work (such as Buffy or Angel) will recognize the fantastically snappy dialogue and wonderful, unpredictable combination of drama, action and comedy. <br /> <br />Everybody else will love it for any and all of the above reasons, and because it's just a really great show. The cast is wonderful, the action is thrilling, the comedic parts wonderfully funny, the music and effects work is great, and the dialogue is... well, just fantastic, there's no other way to describe it. I have no idea how Fox could bring themselves to end this show before its run was complete; they had the perfect SF show fall right into their laps, and they just... abandoned it. Thank goodness for DVD and for Universal for picking the series up for at very least one very good film. <br /> <br />If you liked Serenity, you'll love Firefly. Heck, if you love anything from good horror to good science fiction to great writing to... well, trust me when I say, in all liklihood, if you enjoy breathing, you're going to enjoy this show.  <br /> <br />To boot, the DVDs also have some great extras; I haven't checked out the final disc, where most of the extras like Alan Tudyk (Wash)'s audition tape or the deleted scenes or gag reel are, but over half the series (eight episodes, counting the two-part series pilot) has audio commentaries on it, and having just finished watching the first one (for the pilot episode, also called \\"Serenity\\") with Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion (Mal Reynolds), I can verify that that one is both informative and incredibly fun. It pointed out a lot of the little details that I missed, and Joss and Nathan areboth just flat-out funny to begin with. Joss has two other commentaries on here, and Nathan one other commentary, so that's four (the commentary for the \\"Serenity\\" episodes is all one commentary) episode commentaries that are automatically good ... though having watched the commentary that Jane Espensen, one of the writers, did for an episode on the season 3 Buffy box set, I'm sure that the commentary she has on here is equally interesting and entertaining, too. And that there is most of the commentaries on here, though most of the others have actors on them and actors on average tend to be fun and interesting on commentaries in my experience, so I look forward to those as well. <br /> <br />All in all, this set is a great buy, and I doubt anyone will regret it.  <br /> <br />Stay shiny, folks! <br /> <br />
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|This is the best CD Nightwish I have at the moment. I own two other albums- Angels Fall First and Oceanborn- and while those two have bright spots, they do not compare to the sound of Once. A part of that is because of the use of the symphony. I feel that Nightwish incorporated the symphony in their pieces very nicely. The outcomes of this orchestration are different for each song- let's face it folks, nothing could compare with the epic Ghost Love Score- however even at the ablum's weakest points nothing sounds horrible. There are issues here and there with the composition, but nothing that deters me much from liking the album.<br /><br />The tracks that stuck out for me are Dark Chest of Wonders, Wish I Had an Angel, Nemo, Ghost Love Score, and Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan. Dark Chest starts the album off with lots of energy and a good melody to boot. Wish I Had an Angel is heavy with the beat- something that I particularly like. It seems to driven by the lust and betrayal portrayed in the lyrics. Nemo has a very beautiful piano theme matched with an enchanting melodic line. Kuolema too has a beautiful sound and the Finnish doesn't throw me off like it did for others. I would say something about Ghost Love Score, but it looks like other people have beaten me to what I would have said.<br /><br />I hope this trend continues!
B000002U94|5.0|Bob is simply one of the best rock and roll singers of all time. Kid Rock said Bob was the \\"baddest mother f@#*er on the planet\\".<br /><br />Well in terms of rock and roll, I agree. I've seen him live and this album is the next best thing.<br /><br />I love live albums but some folks can pull them off and some can't. This guy has done it more than once and I think he's even better live than in the studio. He's a rocker's rocker and he kicks ass.<br /><br />I don't know what the future holds for this Rock and Roll Hall of Famer but his legacy is secure if he never does anything else.<br /><br />There have been some great live rock and roll albums but this is one of the best.

George Harrison wrote with Delaney.(He was Mysterio.)<br /><br />Bonnie was simply the best white R & B singer ever and maybe one of the best of any color.<br /><br />The fact that more peolple on't know these two is a mystery to me.<br /><br />If you do know them, you know how fortunate we were to have the precious few albums they did. This is one of the best.<br /><br />Don't stop here though. Try them all and you'll be asking yourself; why doesn't everybody know these guys??????

B0000019HU|5.0|I recently went record shopping during a 5 day stretch cuz I've needed to update some of the \\"old\\" stuff since that Spin magazine about the 100 greatest albums from '85 to now came out.  I already had most of the albums on that repetitive list but there a few from bands I already had records of but not that specific one and so on.  One of the most intriguing albums was Spiderland so I sampled some of it at the record store.  Only six songs for $17.99?  No, I thought, I'll just buy some Ween records.  Then about two days later I flipped through it in the used cds pile and decided I'd have to give it a go.  So, it has been a week and twenty purchased albums later and I can't get this one out of my head.  It slowly sticks with you and leaves a scar of intensity on the final track's build up to that emotionally naked lyric being shouted \\"I miss you!\\"  I've gone back and played this record four or five times while I'm in my apartment doing dishes or something and each time I'm so floored after its over that I wait for about thirty minutes and just think about it before I do anything else.  I love the cover of this album.  It's four guys swimming in a lake somewhere and it looks like they are all in their own dimensions cuz this is nothing like I've ever heard before.  I think this album should have at least replaced Pavement (most overrated band ever) or Public Enemy on the list of greatest albums in the top 10.  It is very amazing.

B00004I9VE|4.0|Every since he was a little boy, he's lived his life on on stage, on camera and in front of the worlds collective eyes. He dreamed about recording a legendary album. He succeeded. What more can be said about the accomplishments of Michael Jackson, that have been left unsaid? The man has thrilled the world for well over forty years, sold millions, become wealthy and through his music has been able to live out a fantasy life. <br /> <br />But this review is about Thriller the album and I will speak on that. It seems every generation (twenty) years or so an artists catches the world absolutely sleeping and pulls our collective conscience in with their social commentary put on vinyl, CD, or tape. Thriller is the biggest selling album of all time (60 million copies) and still selling as of today's count. If I could find a word to describe that kind of a feat, I would readily use it but, I justt cannot. Humans do not sell records, at least not to that degree. No artist in music history has ever had a solo album come near that monstrous, totally unbelievable sales count. This album skyrocketed Michael Jackson into an orbit I don't think another musician will ever reach. Before Thriller, in terms of popularity I would say Elvis was the most popular musician of all time. But, I think its become abundantly clear when you sell 300 million records as a solo artists and have the abillity to sell out arenas in both Indian, and New York City on three consecutive nights. That is impact. Not to mention 12 golden statues sitting in Europe right now reverring Jacksons image. Its safe to say he was larger than life, no entertainer has had more impact on the art of music overall than Michael Jackson. It was the first time an African-american REALLY achieved ultra cross-over and transatlantic success. Michael Jackson is the most worshipped and reverred musical artists that has ever lived. White kids bought and cried over his album (Both men and women). He won 8 grammy awards, defied thelaws of physics with the Moonwalk on Motown 25th anniversay special. <br /> <br />I like to call Jackson the \\"Jackie Robinson\\" of the MTV generation because he came along at a time where MTV was in its infant stages, and were all Jim Crow about playing black artists. This album made it OK for future artists to have a chance on the once white predominated channel. Prince, Madonna, Usher, everyone is still doing the same numbers Jackson did in terms of video. His creative genuis has sparked something, nobody in music had seen before. Sure, as we sit back now and watch music videos as they are, we are hardly impressed because everyone is moderately speaking still doing the same thing. But in the 1980's, music videos with stories and plots were unheard of. Some would say a lot of things led to the unfathomable, success Thriller had, good PR, marketing, MTV (just coming out), and Quincy Jones and Michael Jacksons just musical chemistry. All of this is correct and all of this created an album of such magnitude, in which is highly likely we'll never see anything like it again. Do I feel Thriller will be outsold eventually? It has been the biggest selling album since 1985 when it went into the world records. Thats twenty years. I think another record may come close due to over population. But seeing how we have so many music download programs that we didnt have in the 80's, I dont think Thriller will ever be surpassed. <br /> <br />Its been twenty years since Jackson became a legend. Where's the next biggest musical act on the planet at? <br /> <br /> <br />
0446677450|1.0|I also do not get why so many people love this book.  He does not appear to do anything in his book that he recommends.  Just becuase you are reach does not mean you know how to get there.  Would you read a book, 'How I Won the Lottery, You Can Win Too?'
0142004235|4.0|East of Eden is the story of three generations of the Trask family who live, love and farm in the Salinas valley in Northern California.  What is amazing about this book is that the plot sequences progress like a daytime soap opera.  It's got affairs, shootings, family betrayal and more.  The writing is of such high quality the story never feel melodramtic. The weight and implications of people's actions will pull at your every emotion without ever felling over the top.  The characters are complex in the sense that they grow over the course of the book and are surprisingly unpredictable if you are able to experience this book without much prior knowledge.  This is one of those rare \\"classics\\" that could actually be considered a \\"beach book\\" as it can be a serious page turner. <br /> <br />East of Eden really shows off the range of Steinbeck's abilities as an author.  Usually various works by any \\"classic\\" have a similar feel, theme and writing style.  While this may be somewhat true for Steinbeck, East of Eden is really of a different nature than the social commentaries Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath.  Because of this, the book has a wider appeal and this is one that anyone looking to read some great literature should pick up. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  A must read by anyone in who is looking for an engrossing and well written book.  It is long so its not for those who shy away from \\"projects\\".
B00005JMJG|5.0|We really don't see what goes on in a person's mind.  This is the closest we get to what a person is thinking.  Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is bold and innovative.  It may leave many people confused and bewildered. But it makes sense for everything that happens when you want to get rid of someone's memories.<br /><br />Jim Carrey has proven he's not just a funny man.  He can be a serious actor worthy of Oscar consideration.  Kate Winslet is marvelous as Clementine, the girl who undergoes the procedure to erase memories of Joel.  This movie is happy, charming and unforgetable.
B0000A1RJI|3.0|I am a huge pirates fan, i mean a seriously obsessed fan, and even with that i thought the soundtrack to the movie was a huge disappointment. Basically its the same thing repeated over and over again. In all honesty it does not have the right to bare the same name as the movie.
B000A7DVY0|5.0|Considering the amount of swearing in this movie, I can't imagine there are a lot of fellow Christians out there that would agree with me on the fact that this is possibly the most humorous movie ever made!<br /><br />There is a reason why most things in life that have a cult following - have cult followings: And I don't even have to investigate into whether this movie has one - as I know it has to. And I know this despite the fact that I only know one person, besides myself, that appreciates it at all!<br /><br />Personally, I do wish that you could buy this movie with a mute over the \\"cuss\\" words, as I would like to show it to all my friends and family (a circle of people that couldn't take a quarter the amount of swearing). And \\"yes\\", I know, I can feel you all cringing over such a thought, because I know, the cussing is part of what makes these characters so funny. Not because cussing is funny in it self; but because these guys are so dysfunctional that they don't even notice that it is a negative trait. And because of this, I wouldn't want to have a filtered version where they say something different instead. That would be highly reducing. Just provide a muting option so that someone like myself can still see them swear but doesn't have to hear it.<br /><br />I love this movie probably for the same reason all of \\"The Dude's\\" followers love it; because true humor is in irony and in character, not situation. The depth of character in this film is unsurpassed, and I won't go into it as it is obvious and already commented on by everyone else.<br /><br />Part of the irony is in the plot (as much as I hear people say that there isn't one). You have this whole mystery that we as an audience are, every once in a while, trying to figure out, all the while \\"The Dude\\" (the first person perspective in this movie) is coming to his own conclusions (which may or may not be correct). The irony being that it is usually through this perspective that we form ours.<br /><br />Regardless, it is all tied up in the end.<br /><br />I don't know... It is pretty difficult to surmise this movie in a commentary. You just have to get around someone who gets it and throw a line out at them. \\"Look, I don't roll on Shombus Dude,\\" or how about the way \\"The Shesus\\" goes to tell the neighborhood that he is a child - you know what - and the scene cuts just as he opens his mouth in front of this huge guy with murder written across his face.<br /><br />Priceless!<br /><br />It was this movie that got me hooked on the Coen brothers' movies. I have seen half a dozen of them so far. Most of them are great, although I can't say that any of them are as good as this one.<br /><br />Since the day I saw the movie in the theatre, \\"The Dude\\" has been my alias. The unfortunate reality, however, is that most of the people that witness this alias of mine only understand the previous Neanderthalic - stigmatic usage of the term \\"Dude,\\" as in the \\"Bill & Ted's\\" type of reference. But then, I just have to remember how \\"The Dude\\" would react to such a misunderstanding... He wouldn't care at all.<br /><br />As a great man once said, \\"The Dude abides!\\"<br /><br />Aaronin the end. <br />I don't know... It is pretty difficult to surmise this movie in a commentary.

But then, I just have to remember how \\"The Dude\\" would react to such a misunderstanding... He wouldn't care at all. <br />As a great man once said, \\"The Dude abides!\\" <br /> <br />Aaron
B000B0WODA|4.0|4 and a half stars for this excellent album. I got it the day it came out, and have listened to it almost every day since. The most notable difference between this album and the first one is that the guitars crunch heavily. I you like that, like I do, you'll love this album. <br /> <br />The Fallen is an excellent opener, with great lyrics. I especially like Franz's attack of those who hate others and claim to do it \\"in Jesus' name\\". Way to go Franz. Next is the now familiar Do You Want To, the catchy first single that won't get out of my head. With a start like this, the album simply can't fail. <br /> <br />This Boy has perhaps the catchiest line of the whole CD, and possibly the catchiest line from any Franz song. If you're not yelling \\"I want a car!\\" while you listen to this while driving down the street, there must be something seriously wrong with you.  <br /> <br />The album has other excellent songs, like the short but perfect Evil And A Heathen, or the changing tempos of That Was Easy, but one of the best things about You Could Have It So Much Better is the ballads. Eleanor Put Your Boots On is a beautiful piano ballad, something  would never have thought that Franz was capable of, but the pull it off wonderfully. A lot of people have been saying \\"Beatles-eque\\", and with good reason. the song could have easily been a Beatles song. My grandmother, who has loved The Beatles since the Ed Sullivan Show appearance, actually thought this was a Beatles song when she heard it. <br /> <br />The other ballad, Fade Together, has a haunting chorus that is also comparable to the Beatles. Franz has with these two ballads done something I never thought they were capable of. <br /> <br />I left off a half star for this album, because even though it's pretty short, it seems to drag on once you get towards the end. Nonetheless, it's a great album and well worth the money. Sophomore slump? Yeah right.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I will not buy this cd ever due to the fact it is copy protected, infact I will download it and share it to anyone who asks just to spite the company who produced the cd.
B000002LOE|4.0|This is not my fav rem cd. However its still realy good. Ive been into rem since fables of the reconstruction which is my fav of theres. I love just about everything they do. This has some cheesy moments on it. But overall still a great cd.
0767802470|5.0|It has been a long time since I was able to watch such intense movie again and really it is one of the best .You feel yourself as a part of the crew in this journey ,maybe not very diferent of the real ones that the german u-boats started in the war. <br />Excelent movie.
B000268QB2|5.0|Im glad good music is getting appreciated. This is good talented music. Coldplay mixed with a-ha. I realy like this album. Its the kind of album youre parents would like heck may'be even you're gramma.
B00079FUI6|2.0|LOVE the show, but the quality of the DVDs is poor. Many glitches! Cleaned them and it helped a little. Not impressed with the quality!
B000002UWL|5.0|Behavior is my fav from them. I love the less  disco sound on this one. Some of there stuff is to diso for me. This is a elctro pop gem. Every synth fanatic should own this.
B00005JL78|2.0|\\"Minority Report\\" is a glossy, glimmery, gossamer, ultimately empty little flick: use it as a pretty screen saver on your 65\\" Plasma HDTV while you're waiting to watch a better film. It's the cinematic equivalent of Japanese food: looks nice, smells nice, goes down easy, and 15 minutes later you'll be hungry again.<br /><br />There is, however, a slight catch.<br /><br />Like uber-Filmmeister Steven Spielberg's other mega-flop \\"A.I.\\", \\"Minority Report\\" has already been done better, faster, smarter, and wiser: see \\"Blade Runner\\" for the soul-crushing dilemma of whether it's moral to use a machine to do things no human would do, or even \\"Kafka\\" for an incisive study into the guts of a society that would judge a victim guilty before a crime even occurs.<br /><br />So why give this pretty, shiny, happy, but empty movie even two stars? Because it has a singularly impressive, very nasty sick joke, played (best of all) on Tom Cruise.<br /><br />At one point in the flick, Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise) goes to a black-market eyeball surgeon for a little much-needed wetware transplant. I love Peter Stormare: I usually relish his insanity, and in \\"Minority Report\\" he's in top form. That alone earns the flick gets one star.<br /><br />One extra star goes for the rotten ham sandwich in the refrigerator. Dr. Eddie leaves some milk and a fresh sandwich for his patient when he ultimately comes to his senses, then scoots: Cruise wakes up hours later, mostly blind, and staggers to the fridge for a little late night snack.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Cruise, Dr. Eddie isn't a very tidy housekeeper.<br /><br />See, there's a bottle of curdled milk and a rotten ham sandwich (evidently intended for an earlier patient), in close proximity to the fresh stuff. Moral: before eating the unidentified and sight-unseen ham sandwich in the underground surgeon's refrigerator, always do a smell-test.<br /><br />Where were we? Ah yes: the soul-crushing ethical dilemma is the new Department of Pre-Crime with its Amazing Young Men (and Woman) in their Psycho-tropic Fluid Machine, who can aid law enforcement in tracking down crime before it actually occurs! Call John Ashcroft!<br /><br />But wait a minute---you're not here to spend two hours wrestling with a soul-crushing moral and ethical dilemma concerning civil rights and free will, are you? Naw, man---you're here to see Tom Cruise and high-tech shiny things!<br /><br />And in that department \\"Minority Report\\" fulfills in spades. It's what would happen if \\"Crate & Barrel\\" had a movie for a twin sister.<br /><br />Tom Cruise does is spot-on in his one-note role as the obsessive Pre-Crime honcho Jon Anderton, and fingers those psych-profiles like a pro. Samantha Morton (Agatha) is spot-on in her one-note role as the pool-bound female psy-op, and proves girls just wanna have fun.<br /><br />Colin Farrel (Detective Witwer) is spot-on in his one-note role as the obsessive detective. Max Von Sydow (Director Burgess) is spot-on in his one-note role as the cackling founder of Pre-Crime with a deep dark secret (and a ridiculous plot twist). Neal McDonough (Officer Fletcher), as usual, gets no respect in his role as a tough-as-nails soldier, but does get a wild ride up to the top of the city with Tom Cruise, which is more than most can say. The futuristic Lexus Mark-12 is spot-on in its one-note role as the futuristic Lexus Mark-12.<br /><br />Again, it looks really pretty on a high-end plasma TV, and it's got Pete Stormare and a rotten ham-sandwich. You could do worse with your two hours.<br /><br />JSGing ethical dilemma is the new Department of Pre-Crime with its Amazing Young Men (and Woman) in their Psycho-tropic Fluid Machine, who can aid law enforcement in tracking down crime before it actually occurs!

B000001OAA|4.0|I love the mix of dance & rock. This is garbages best album hands down.
0689835604|5.0|our one year old loves this book to an astonishing degree, most books don't do much for her but with this one she laughs, pulls down the flaps, etc. - she just plain loves it!
B0006399FS|4.0|Not as good as past. They still shine more than most groups. I will always buy there albums. Alot of it is the nastalgia factor. However they still make some pretty dang good music.
B00004XMV6|4.0|I once met a man who was exactly like John. Right down to the evenly spaced crisp white shirts in his wardrobe.  You know what I did ? I escaped through the window. I think Elizabeth should have done the same. I couldn't believe in their relationship beyond the 9 1/2 weeks, they'd have had nothing to talk about. Still having said that, I do like it.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Probably the six d's of inner turbulence was the last album where DT really put some serious effort to be a little distinctive about the riffs, lyrics and ...well, everything else. Octavarium isn't terribly bad after a few listen, but it's nowhere near the other DT albums (except TOT).. When you first listen to the whole album, not a single song seemed never heard before.. DT never was rich in lyrics, but I think they are getting worse everyday..\\"I walk beside you\\" ..a 10 yrs kid can write this in the bathroom in like 5 mins.. <br /> <br />For some real good Progressive rock, try Porcupine Tree. \\"Deadwing\\", \\"In Absentia\\" or any of their earlier albums.. DT is getting boring, if they don't do something in their next album, the end is near.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|The better treatment of a well acomplished movie of which 1/3 was made purely out of special effects has got my 4 star rating. This movie tied the 1950 classic, All About Eve, starring Anne Baxter and Betty Davis, for 14 Academy Awards nominations; tying Ben Hur with the receiving of 11 Academy Awards let alone. The movie in itself would deserve a five star rating, and while the first DVD release of the movie was basically of only the film alone, this 3-disc Collecter's Edition still does not live up to expectations nor the respect it deserves.    The digitally transferring of the film itself does appear to be of a higher quality than previously seen. The bonus features serve the movie well in accompaniment, while giving away most, if not all, the secrets of how the movie and special effects were put into play. However, some of the bonus features' qualities are not at all satisfying. For example, Celine Dion's music video to the film seems like an old analog playback of a VHS tape in the VCR recording a TV show with bad rabbit-ear reception. The sound is not as superior as the film either and for a song and video as such, the fan deserves to receive better than what's put together in this box set. For the price, it is well worth the money, but still, the box set appears, with the extensive lack of quality in its bonus features, to be almost as cheap as the first DVD release.
B0009IW88A|5.0|I suppose that if Danny Elfman's more broadly sketched score is your cup of tea, this might not appeal to you.  This is a brooding score that defies any attempt to create a 'hook' or 'leitmotif' that says 'Batman', 'Sgt. Gordon', or 'Scarecrow'.  However, like chocolate, this score is hard, dark, and very good.
0684135051|5.0|Even though Elizabeth Zimmermann is no longer among us, she left us this very wonderful and opinionated (in a good way) book about knitting. What a lady. I highly recommend this book for knitters of all levels.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This movie is fun to watch for the whole family. The dragon is the best character of the movie. The story is cute and makes sense! Everyboyd can watch the movie. A lot of adult humor is included that the kids won't even understand!
B00005OWIU|5.0|When the film version of J.K. Rowling's first book about the young wizard named Harry Potter was first released in theaters in 2001, I had not yet read any of the books, so I was not yet familiar with the story or its characters.  As the lights dimmed in the local theater and the previews for upcoming attractions ended, an enchanting melody began to fill the theater as an elderly Professor Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris, 1930-2002) walked along the suburban street known as Privet Drive.  He took out what looked like a lighter and magically turned off each of the streetlamps throughout the neighborhood before approaching a darkened house.  A cat magically transformed back into the human Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and joins Professor Dumbledore before a light shines in skies above from a flying motorcycle ridden by Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).  Hagrid carried with him a 1-year old baby named Harry Potter and handed him to Professor Dumbledore who placed him at the front door of the darkened house with a hand-written note to the home's occupants, for the child is the lone survivor of a deadly attack from a dark wizard named Lord Voldemort and the house where Harry was left is that of his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw), Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling).  As the film continued to unfold, the wonderful music written by veteran composer John Williams added to the magic of J.K. Rowling's wonderful story and helped to bring her magical world of wizards, witches and Hogwarts to life.  Not surprisingly, John Williams received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Music for the marvelous music that he composed for \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\".  Some of my personal favorite overtures used in the film include \\"Diagon Alley and The Gringotts Vault\\", \\"Entry into the Great Hall and The Banquet\\", \\"Christmas at Hogwarts\\", \\"The Invisibility Cloak and The Library Scene\\" and the closing credits with \\"Harry's Wondrous World\\". <br /> <br />Overall, I rate the wonderful & unforgettable soundtrack for the 2001 film of \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  I also highly recommend the soundtracks for the film's sequels: the 2002 \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" and the 2004 \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\".  I can't wait to hear what composer John Williams has written for the upcoming release of the 2005 film \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\".
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I listened to Iron Maiden for the first time in 1988 during their Seventh Son Tour. I was hooked instantly and over the years saw them 4 times in concert... buying their previous albums from Number of the Beast onwards in a never ending trip haha... well that was then and they started to wane in the 90's and hit rock bottom with Blaze (no offense dude)... I stopped listening to them even thoough people would tell me that Brave New World was a comeback album... I was in Paris in fall 2003, and decided to check them out in concert and also bought Dance of Death. WOW! When i heard Montsegur, DoD, and Paschendale, I was very impressed... the concert was great and indeed they have made a comeback since reuniting for Brave New World... Kudos to you Maiden and Maiden fans... Yes ladies and gentlemen they are for real!
B000B5XOYI|4.0|The first four Batman movies have been rereleased in this new box set that is worth the money if your a fan of them. For those who complained that Warner Bros. released these two disc specail editions to make more money, you must be unaware that when DVDs first came out in 1997 the idea of specail features hadn't really caught on yet. The first four Batman films were among those first released. <br /> <br />These new versions not only include new making-of documentaries, but some vintage trailers and music videos as well. They also have DTS tracks and commentary tracks by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher that go well with the new transfers of the films. And they have subtitles in English, French, and Spanish for the movies only. <br /> <br />My favorites are Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\", though I also really like Schumacher's \\"Batman Forever\\"  Only his \\"Batman and Robin\\" seem to be a weak link in the series, though it's maybe not quite as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. <br /> <br />But hey, three out of fours not bad.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Serenity takes the series Firefly to the next level and without the constraints of television censorship a grittier, darker and far more graphically violent universe is the result. Although it's a science fiction genre the movie like the series before, is a bit of a western in space which isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />Serenity expands on much of the premises of the series filling out the foundation of the Reivers and bringing River's character to it's fullest extent. The storyline is excellent, with Mal, his crew and his passengers conducting shady dealings like payroll heists but, true to their pasts idealists as well.<br /><br />The movie is great fun and certainly one of the best science fiction films of the last few years. Now only if Farscape could emulate the same jump from series to the big screen.
B000AA305M|3.0|My friend introduced me to David Gray a few years back and tried to convince me he was going to be as big as Dave Matthews. While Gray has never achieved that kind of following, he has shown an ability to churn out interesting records with some really nice songs from time to time. The same holds true here. Slow Motion doesn't have any just killer cuts like \\"Babylon\\" from previous records, but the latest installment includes some nice entries like The One I Love, Lately, Hospital Food and Now and Always..There are some misses here too, but all in all another positive effort. A bit more subdued than previous efforts..hence the title Slow Motion...but try to stick with Gray..he seems to find the mark just often enough to keep a loyal fan base
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is the way it should be: an ordinary man who rises above tragedy and his own guilt and fear to become something more. A legend.  An icon.  The Batman.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" does not flinch for a moment in its portrayal of the origins of the Dark Knight.  We do not even see the Batman we know until the film is half over.  What we see first is Bruce Wayne, his tragic childhood and the burdens he carries as an adult, and finally the choices he makes that turn him into a symbol for hope in the face of dark times and evil people.  This is how we come to understand how a man can become so driven, so focused, so honed and balanced, like a weapon always prepared to strike. The first act of \\"Batman Begins\\" shows us not only his physical training, but his mental and spiritual rigor as well. We come to understand the man beneath the mask, before he ever puts the mask on.<br /><br />And then, when he does finally don the familiar cowl and cape, it is so much more powerful, so much more bellievable than it ever has been before.  We see a man who understands what the nature of fear is, and for the rest of the film he uses it against his enemies, the criminals who are tearing his city apart, and those who threaten to tear it down completely.  Because as much as \\"Batman Begins\\" is about the creation of the legend that is Batman, it is also about fear.  Coming to understand one's fears, to face them down, and finally to use them as tools.  Bruce Wayne understands this when he puts on the mask and the cape, and one of his foes understands it as well.  The nature of fear forms the subtext and undercurrent of this powerful film.<br /><br />And what a film it is.  The casting is ideal, from Christian Bale as the best Bruce Wayne/Batman dichotomy to ever grace the screen, to Gary Oldman as the perfect Sergeant (soon to be Commissioner?) Gordon, to Liam Neeson as...well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.  The direction of Christopher Nolan captures with crystal clarity, and for the first time on screen, the dual aspects of the Batman character -- the man, and the hero.  The musical score, a unique partnership of Hans Zimmer's dramatic style and James Newton Howard's understated themes, suits the film beautifully, carrying the dramatic aspects while avoiding the use of a catchy theme.  The story is well-paced, with a good blend of finely-tuned character development and high-octane action to keep it interesting, leading up to a pulse-pounding conclusion that will leave you breathless.<br /><br />I'm inescapably reminded of \\"Unbreakable,\\" the only other film I can think of which takes the concept of a comic-book hero and deals with it in a real-world context.  Both films share a grounding in reality, a hope that things can be better than they are, and an emotional center which should resonate in even the most cynical heart.  Chances are good that if you like \\"Unbreakable,\\" you'll like \\"Batman Begins,\\" and vice-versa.<br /><br />At last, you can forget Joel Schumacher's Batman flops, and you can even lay aside Tim Burton's efforts at bringing the Batman to the screen. Finally, in \\"Batman Begins,\\" we have a film that treats the Batman as he should be treated -- a complex character who is both legend and man, who looks his fear in the eye and brings a new understanding of fear to his enemies, who buries himself inside a cocoon built of his own doubts, fears, and guilt but emerges as a changed man, free to fly above darkened streets.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is certainly one of the best comic-book movies ever made, primarily because it treats the subject seriously and honestly, but more than that, it is a challenging film that confronts the subject of fear and the nature of heroism head-on.  Here is where we see that being a hero doesn't mean having special powers or abilities...a hero is defined by the choices he makes, and by the actions he takes.<br /><br />Truly, a brilliant film.d for the first time on screen, the dual aspects of the Batman character -- the man, and the hero.

B00003CX9E|1.0|The worst film of all time would be Plan 9 from Outer Space. Even Citizen Kane is more boring than Plan 9, tt doesn't mean that it's worse. It's just one of those films people feel that they waste their time watching it.
6305291446|4.0|Welcome to Halloween III: H20. Lots of blood and suspense and a great storyline that stays true to the first two movies in the series. Michael is p***ed off! You would be too if you spent most of your life just waiting to off the rest of your family. <br /> <br />Let me try to clear up two concerns I've seen mentioned in other reviews:  <br />1. LL Cool J's security guard character isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. This is probably intentional, rather than just a plot device. Have you ever seen some of the security guards who work for private companies?  <br />2. After watching Resurrection, I couldn't seem to remember any of the pivotal scene that explains Michael's return. That is because NONE of that sequence is shown in H20. OK, so maybe we were cheated a little in this movie. But from our heroine's point of view, which is where the drama and suspense come from, she was not aware of what had happened inside after her confrontation with Michael. And if you watch carefully, he does not try to attack her during the ambulance sequences. Additionally, he does not move like the shape - this can be seen by his reactions when he sits up on the road and when he sees the ambulance rolling down the hill towards him. Anyway, I can see how the writers did this intentionally and I give them credit for it. <br /> <br />My only gripe is the lack of more bonus material on the DVD. I guess I'll have to pick up the special 25 year edition of the original Halloween now...
B00005JNJV|3.0|Just saw the much-touted Batman Begins, but sad to say, it still disappoints, like all comic book based superhero movies...  Yes it's one of the better comic book superhero movies, but definitely not a masterpiece of any shape or form.  Let's just say it's as good as any comic book superhero movie is ever going to be, but that's not saying much...  The problem is with the source material, comic books (especially American ones) are simply too juvenile, absurd and unimaginative to base any good movie upon.  However hard the film-makers try to make comic book movies look respectable, at the end the best they can do is to mask the basic flaws of the source material and make the movie look a bit less juvenile, absurd and unimaginative, but only a bit...    It's a sad fact that American obsession with comic books is fueling the Hollywood craze to make them into mega-buck movies, while other much more deserved material is left to gather dust.  e.g. Why aren't we seeing more movies based on sci-fi masterpieces by Asimov, Clarke, Brin, Bear and the like?  One page in any of these novels contains more intelligence, correct science, mind-opening ideas and grand action than all the comic book movies combined.  Yet movie versions of Asimov's Foundation, or Clarke's Rama, or Brin's Uplift saga, or Bear's Eon, are still nowhere to be seen on Hollywood's horizon...    Perhaps America is simply not ready for such intelligent movie material... but perhaps, just perhaps, America is ready but Hollywood isn't...
B00002E233|5.0|I have ordered this DVD and can't wait for it to arrive. Finally that arch-hack and mogul-flunky Renny Harlin has inadvertantly managed to entertain us by producing the very worst science-fiction/horror movie since the days of Ed Wood whilst delivering an engaging scenario and superb production design (I won't say these were wasted; far from it!). <br /> <br />I can't wait to wince again as Samuel L. Jackson (HOW THE HELL did they manage to convince him to co-comment this with Harlan?), an actor who I revere, struggles with unquestionably the very worst dialogue and direction of his career, while pretty Saffron Burrows lolls about in her underwear giving wood a bad name. <br /> <br />This is a jewel of a movie, that rare concoction that happens only accasionally, where a bad movie becomes so bad that it is an essential DVD item. Highly recommended.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is what storytelling at it's finest.  Just about everything else in Hollywood is the same, old, canned stuff.  Name another movie with better storytelling. <br /> <br />So to anyone who does not rate this movie 5 stars, I can no longer trust your other reviews.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|This movie is far less bad than I feared. <br /> <br />It is still little else than fluff.  <br /> <br />When watching this, even the most devoted phan must realise too much of the songs in POTO goes on without anything actually happening... I don't know whether the director or the dramaturg is to blame, but the actors don't have anything to do during such endless songas songs as the title tune, Music Of The Night and Wishing You Were somehow Here Again. During Think Of Me, at least the character of Roul is introduced, while little else is going on. <br /> <br />Happily such musical scenes like Notes/Prima Donna work very good in this adaption! <br /> <br />One thing one cannot help but notice when watching the extra material to this DVD, is the utter and complete lack of any mentioning of the text! -this is really baffling and striking. The musical does suffer from some weird and unfortunate dramaturgic flaws and awkward lyrics. This is not discussed at all! Instead Andrew Lloyd Webber and the rest of the creative crew (except the lyricists and book writers) discuss such lame things as the number of musicians in the orchestra (!), the sexyness of the cast and the angles of the falling chandelier. <br /> <br />This does nothing to silence the misconception that musicals are shallow and only about empty spectacle. <br /> <br />I will nevertheless recommend watching this movie, if only for the afore mentioned Notes/Prima Donna scene, which works wonderfully!
B000B7HZXM|5.0|I've never been a big Rod Stewart fan, but I always admire a person who can put together the body of work he has over so many years. Today my opinion of Stewart changed from being a casual fan to wishing he would come near here so I could hear him live in concert.  <br /> <br />His new set of CD's which he calls THE GREAT AMERICAN SONGBOOK has allowed him to move into some styles of music that he has never explored before. His 4th CD in that set; THANKS FOR THE MEMORY is one of the finest albums that I have purchased in many years.  <br /> <br />Take a look at the selections on the CD and if you enjoy that style of music this one is fantastic. Stewart and all his guest musicians do a fantastic job! On a scale of 1-5 I'd give this one 6 Stars!!!!  <br />
B000AADYYO|5.0|...but Opeth get the extra star simply for being the band to produce the incredible masterpieces Blackwater Park, Still Life, and Damnation.<br /><br />Yes, I know it means I'm not as &#34;cool&#34; as all of Opeth's OTHER fans to say that I would easily equate such works of perfection with Damnation, but that's ok. ;)<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong: this album is absolutely phenomenal. The reason that I could never give this album, per se, a full 5 star review is because of that EVIL synthesizer that has virtually ruined the whole album for me. Thankfully, I was able to get over it after forcing myself to endure its cheesiness 4-5 times in a row - although it came damn close to driving me up the wall, initially. I shudder just to think about how such a perfect band could ever include that horrible synth on this record. But thankfully, it doesn't permeate the entire record.<br /><br />I could never give ANYTHING Opeth produces less than 5 stars because of the aforementioned works, alone. Those records were so perfect in every way imaginable - I would literally deem them &#34;life-changing&#34; works.&#34;<br /><br />Opeth is an amazing group that has generally evolved for the better with every release (damn you, synth!!! *shakes her fist*), and while metal has always been dominant among my musical tastes, I'm most definitely not your stereotypical death metal fan (i.e. you'd never guess that I'm such an Opeth fan if you saw me walking down the street.)<br /><br />Overall, the album is melodically gorgeous, but lyrically, I've never thought Opeth were an even mediocre band (I'm not a fan of the *omg-I'm-leik-so-dark-and-depressed!* lyrics which have always seemed so over-the-top to me). The music outshines everything else about the band by far, and I'd highly recommend it to any metal or rock fan.<br /><br />UPDATE: I so retract my review and and bow my head in shame - I have fallen IN LOVE with this album in its entirety, and seeing them on this tour counts among my BEST experiences EVER.

B00005RFAI|5.0|The album is pretty good as her first album but it's a little bit different though. But she still has that souful, R&B tunes in here with some rock.<br /><br />1. M!ssundaztood- I love this song. I like how she sings...it sounds like she's singing it with pride. 5/5<br /><br />2. Don't Let Me Get Me- P!nk released this as a second single. I love this song. I can relate to it. 5/5<br /><br />3. Just Like A Pill- She did a good job on this song. 5/5<br /><br />4. Get The Party Started- the song that started it all! It's a great dance/club music. 5/5<br /><br />5. Respect- I don't really like this song that much. It's kinda annoying. 2/5<br /><br />6. 18 Wheeler- I absolutely love the lyrics and the tune. it shows that P!nk is still standing no matter how many times they tried to put her down. 5/5<br /><br />7. Family Portrait- I love this song. She shows more emotion to this song. It talks about how P!nk longs for a perfect family and how she dealt with her parents' divorce. 5/5<br /><br />8. Misery- She and Steven Tyler sounded great together. I love it. 5/5<br /><br />9. Dear Diary- I like this song. 5/5<br /><br />10. Eventually- nice, easygoing song to listen to. Perhaps when I'm sad. 5/5<br /><br />11. Lonely Girl- Ohhh, I love this song. I can kinda relate to it. It's no good to be lonely. 5/5<br /><br />12. Numb- Pretty good. I like the drum beats. 4/5<br /><br />13. Gone to California-I could definately relate to this song. I always wanted to go there because I thought the grass is always greener on the other side. 5/5<br /><br />14. My Vietnam- P!nk shows a patriotic side. I love it. 5/5<br /><br />I think that this album is her best one next to her first. She's a very talented and unique singer who's doesn't care what people think or say. I admire her for that. Definately recommend this album for other P!nk fans!
0156027321|4.0|This is one of the best books I've read.  Unfortunately, it gets a bit long-winded in the middle, but how much action can you have while stranded in a rowboat in the middle of the Pacific.  It is well worth pushing through, though, as the end takes an amazingly unexpected twist, which almost mahes you want to go back and read the whole thing over again.  All-in-all, a fantastic piece of work.
0780021967|5.0|First of all, \\"The 39 Steps\\" has nothing to do with stairs!  Alfred Hitchcock wouldn't be so pedestrian to entitle one of his (I'd say, greatest) films thusly.  Our lead herein, Robert Donat (like you, no doubt now) would certainly like to know what they are too, but to tell you would give way the climax.  I will say that, like many Hitchcock films, what is being pursued is less signficant than the quest involved itself. Nevertheless, the ending of this film is great fun; wonderfully choreographed (yes, choreographed:), and as dramatically suspenseful as Hitchcock can get. It's most memorable, to boot.  So, where does that leave us, herein? If you have seen and liked \\"North by Northwest\\" you ought to enjoy this film; as it is similar in spirit and very much akin (albeit in black and white) to that rather more popular escapade of Hitchcock's that climaxes on Mount Rushmore.  If you are unfamiliar with this latter film, but have enjoyed \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\", \\"To Catch a Thief\\", and/or \\"Strangers on a Train\\" then I can also confidently predict you will relish \\"The 39 Steps\\" too.  Finally, if you haven't seen any of the above may I ask what your excuse is?  You can't be a celluloid fanatic without being familiar with the likes of Hitchcock (as well as Ford, Wilder, Capra, Kurosawa, et al.).  Granted, you may not be a film fanatic, of course; in which case still have a look at \\"The 39 Steps\\" and one other of the above.  Then, on the odd chance, if neither appeals to you at least you can be familiar with this famous director's style and you can chalk it up to a cultural experience having watched them. Aside: I'm of the school that most films are best watched in the dark, especially black and white ones such as this fine film.  P.S. The audio commentary track on this Criterion DVD is rather descriptive to the point of being superficial; BUT, having persevered through it I'm glad that I did.  It did add something to my appreciation to the film, notwithstanding the feeling that I could almost have done a better job myself.  And that's not as contradictory a statement as it may seem. I hope this review has been of some help to you. Cheers!feeling that I could almost have done a better job myself.  And that's not as contradictory a statement as it may seem.

B0009SS00A|1.0|This book combines a mediocre thriller, an average mystery, a delusional romance and a terrible computer security assessment all in one barely readable, bloated package. I'm glad Dan Brown is now fat and wealthy from \\"the Da Vinci code,\\" because clearly he needs a different job than \\"writer.\\" There are numerous technical errors in the book, poor descriptions of computer security and coding, and other illusions that I might expect from a TV afterschool special but not from a bestselling author. Brown should pay attention to Crichton and Gibson before doing this again. I would not recommend this book to anyone (unless they had a paperless outhouse).
B000002UJQ|5.0|this album is nothing short of perfect. As stated in previous reviews, it takes a couple or more listens to get properly affirmed in your mind... but trust me when I tell you this album is the best album I've ever bought (and i have over 300 in my collection!!) it was also recently voted No.1 in a \\"100 greatest albums of all time\\" chart by the UK's Channel 4.
0553804367|3.0|A great introduction to the history of modern science, focusing on the \\"metaphysical\\" aspects of quantum physics and relativity, this book is an engaging read. I like Hawking's ability to explain with simple examples the complex proofs he discusses; it's reminiscent of Douglas R. Hofstadter (Godel, Escher, Bach) if he had a vigorous editor. I like the overall narrative voice and how, through the tumult of ideas he describes, Hawking keeps focus on the most important aspects of each question. However, the book seems unfinished, in that it presents some basic ideas, then goes over recent scientific history and demonstrates why it has not found a conclusion, then trails off into biographical data. Hawking's most salient comment is that art and philosophy have abandoned science in their pursuit of truth, but perhaps it's time to re-inject some philosophy into the science, and pick a theoretical basis even if we're not sure of its mechanics. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any diligent reader.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|Jameson Thottam ... A trip down memory lane with Willy WOnka <br /> <br />Did I just see a movie? Or did I eat so much sugar that I went on a trip through the brain of a psychotic eight year old child?  <br /> <br />Storyline: Jameson Thottam <br />Let's open with the general storyline for the people who haven't happened to read the book or see the original film.  <br /> <br />Charlie bucket is dirt poor. He and his family live in a small shack on the outskirts of town and the only thing he has to look foreward to each year, is one bar of chocolate on his birthday. It is truly pitiful, poor kid. So when he hears of a contest awarding five children the chance to tour the mysterious chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka himself, Charlie decides he wants to win.  <br /> <br />After all five golden tickets are discovered in bars of Wonka's chocolate, and through some miracle that only happens in the land of movies, Charlie gets one too, the story takes off.  <br /> <br />The kids tour the factory alongside Wonka with the promise of a huge reward at the end for only one of them. As we watch the truly loathesome kiddies spit, fight, bicker, gorge, chew their cud and tumble headfirst down garbage chutes, we wonder why Wonka bothered in the first place.  <br /> <br />Analysis: Jameson Luke Thottam <br />As predictable as it is, I won't give away who...if anyone...wins the contest. I will however, tell you that Tim Burton tried far too hard to insert a meaningful life lesson into a movie that clearly has no meaning what-so-ever.  <br /> <br />New Version COre: Jameson Thottam <br />The new version has the same core as the original movie, and seems to stay truer to the book. However, it adds something a little more. Willy Wonka has regular flashbacks, a la war vet., about his childhood. I believe it is meant to make us understand why he is the way he is, and why he does the things he does. I couldn't follow this at all and just ended up wondering why Wonka thinks that beingdenied a few sweets here and there makes his childhood traumatic.  <br /> <br />Ooompa Oopsy: Jameson Thottam <br />The Oompa Loompas were played by the same man. He was incredibly odd looking and sounded hilarious. I would have liked to have seen the original songs revamped for the new film, instead of the writers just coming up with whole new ones.  <br /> <br />Shallow but Thanks to Johnny: Jameson L. Thottam <br />It's a bit shallow overall. Johnny Depp was brilliant as Willy Wonka, though he reeked a little of Michael Jackson, but no harm, no foul. Annasophia Robb, for some reason, really caught my attention as the gum chewing Violet Baureguard. The other three children were forgettable, and Charlie was horribly drippy and cute. I couldn't stand how unbearably sweet he was. I know his character was meant to be considerate, but come on, he's a 10 year old boy!  <br /> <br />The colours, songs, dances, and strange CG work on the faces of the children, made the movie resemble a cartoon.  <br /> <br />Final Comments...Jameson Thottam <br />Rent the original and watch it first. If you don't enjoy it...don't bother going to see this one. If you do enjoy it, you'll probably enjoy this one far less, but may as well give it a go. <br /> <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam <br />
0385335482|4.0|Have you ever taken shopping to the extreme? For Becky Bloomwood, that is just her everyday life. In Confessions of a Shopaholic, Becky has a stressful life on the inside.

Trying to avoid the fact that she doesn't have enough money to pay for everything she has bought, she tries to hide the bills around her house. Looking at the bills, reading off everything she has bought, she feels all her purchases were necessary.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone. It was one of the best books I have read in a long time. The plot is straightforward and is easy to follow.  <br />
0316172324|5.0|Jameson Luke Thottam: Discussion of Blink <br /> <br />Malcolm Gladwell had a runaway success with The Tipping Point a few years back - telling the story of how small changes in perception, marketing and even speech could make a significant impact upon outcomes. Kind of like a series of small causes cascading into a big effect. I really enjoyed his first book, so when Blink! was released and I was given it for free as part of a leadership training course I eagerly blazed through it the very next day on the way home. Big disappointment, rather like going to watch the Orchestra and all the musicians do is warm up and never play anything.  <br /> <br />Premise of Book...Jameson L. Thottam <br />The premise of the book is that we observe the world, or rather the events and people/things it contains, using a concept called thin-slicing. Meaning the process of snap, or gut-feel, decisions based upon very thin slices of data which we piece together into a whole by heuristically filling in the gaps. What you get out of this book is a better understanding of why your brain (and gut) process data in this manner when you are data or information deprived.  <br /> <br />Entertainment Value...Jameson Thottam <br />The book itself is mildly entertaining, and focuses around a dozen anecdotes - several of which are repeated ad nauseam throughout the book as self-proving facts. There is very little hard evidence or scientific fact to support Gladwell's conclusions - to the point where I felt some simple research could come up with a dozen counter-stories about bad decisions made due to \\"thin-slicing\\". However, that said, you cannot disprove or write-off his conclusions either - so keeping an open mind about the whole issue (or waiting for fatter slices of research?) is probably the best mindset to have after finishing the book.  <br /> <br />Most Interesting: Jameson L. Thottam <br />The most interesting snippet for me, not even a story, revolves around how in 1977 Dick Morris met the 31 year-old governor of Arkansas - a young fella named Bill Clinton. Morris explained how you could use peoples instantaneous gut reactions towards media to manipulate polls and change positions. And we all know where that got us.  <br /> <br />Final Summary: Jameson Luke Thottam <br />The interesting philosophical question is how often we unwittingly allow our gut reactions, thin-sliced or not, to influence how we react to people and events. Primal caveman had to decide pretty quickly whether it was fight or flight. In my job I can tell within 30 seconds whether one of our product demonstrations is going to hit the mark. At home I size up my teenage daughters boyfriend in less than 15 seconds. As a soccer coach I can watch a player from 80 yards and predict whether he/she will make or miss a penalty kick just by how they approach the ball.Blink will make you more conscious of when you are doing this, but not necessarily why.  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam <br />

B00005JNX0|5.0|Madagascar is a funny, hip and all around great movie.  Dreamworks Animation release before that Shark Tale wasn't all to great as it went into hip hop rap type thing, and I hope animated movies don't jump ship like Shark Tale.  But Madagascar is a great movie.  My five year old son wanted to see this, so he dragged me along, and I wasn't expecting too much, but to tell you the truth, I enjoyed almost as much as he did, and he LOVED it.  We had to go get Madagascar stuffed animals the next day.  The voices are great, they fit their characters perfect.  Unlike Shark Tale, Martin Scorcese as a blowfish?  David Schwimmer fits Melman perfectly, and Jada Pinkett Smith voices Gloria the Hippo with style.  Ali G is great as King Julian, Cedric The Entertainer is great as Maurice and of coarse, Andy Ritcher provides a cute little voice for Mort, the little cute lemur. Here's the story: <br /> <br />Four friends living in the central park zoo, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty The Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the Giraff (David Schwimmer)live a carefree life.  On Marty's 10th birthday, he finds out the penguins, who steal every scene their in, are digging to Antarctica, the wild.  Marty decidedes he wants to go to the wild. So one night he escapes.  Alex, Gloria and Melman know he's heading to Grand Central Station to get a train to Cennaticut.  So they go after him, only to be crated up in boxes, and put on route to Africa.  But when those crazy penguins hijack the ship, the four friends fall overboard and wash up on the shore of Madagascar.  When meeting a bunch of partying lemurs, Alex freaks out, while Marty is happy that their in the wild.  The lemurs live life in partying and in worrying, as the dreaded Fossa attack them and rip them limb from lumb as quoted by King Julian.  So they want Alex to protect them, as the Fossa are frightened of Alex, but King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohan aka Ali G)'s sidekick Maurice (Cedric The Entertainer) disagrees with the plan.  Without food though, Alex's instinct is getting the better of him, and Marty may be on the menu for food. <br /> <br />It may not have much of a plot, but not many kids movies do.  But, it's a great movie like Shrek and all of Pixar's movies, and provides kids with goofy gags and adults with adult humor that flies right over the kids heads, which make it perfect for adults and kids a like.

B000002UAI|3.0|Released in the UK in Dec '64 BFS is at first a puzzling album. After the Beatles excellent previous release, AHDN, why go back to recording some cover versions of old songs, and a couple of pretty ropey ones at that? 1964 was a hectic year for the Beatles. Their first world tour, including their groundbreaking first US visit and the promotion of AHDN, probably left them feeling shattered, and with the, by now, obligatory Xmas album to release, the Beatles had to come up with an album in a hurry. That seems to be one likely explanation. However, fortunately  the 8 Lennon/McCartney tracks (of 14) on BFS are mainly well up to the standard expected of them. Of the remaining 6 covers, 4 of them could be regarded as fillers and little else.<br /><br />Running through the album, it kicks off in fine style with 3 cracking Lennon songs. There is the brilliant opener 'No reply', with powerful acoustic guitar chords and an angry Lennon vocal. Then follows 'I'm a loser' - more up tempo with a slight C&W tinge and a bit of Lennon harmonica thrown in between the chorus. Good strong song. 'Baby's in black' is much slower and has full Beatle vocal harmonies throughout. Three dark songs indeed, but in the A+ category. Then we come to the first cover, 'Rock & Roll music'. This is really a very ordinary rock'n'roll song with  Lennon trying to sound enthusiastic, but failing to make it that interesting. Then comes a McCartney tune, 'I'll follow the sun'. This is a pleasant enough wistful little ballad written 2 years earlier, but not sounding dated despite this. We then arrive at the most curious song on the album, 'Mr. Moonlight'. Why the Beatles chose to do a cover of such a mediocre tune suggests what a rushed job BFS must have been. There is an awful little organ solo in the middle of it too. Another cover follows; 'Kansas city (here I come)'. An improvement on 'Mr. Moonlight', but just about anything would be. Still nothing special by Beatles standards.<br /><br />The second half begins with '8 days a week', a good Lennon/McCartney number, but not a great one. Back to the cover versions again, but easily the best one here with 'Words of love'. This time the Beatles do an excellent job, and manage to make it sound better than the Buddy Holly original. We then come to 'Every little thing', a strong mid-tempo Lennon song, but rather short. Then another cover song by Carl Perkins, 'Honey don't', with Ringo doing lead vocals. Another boring song and filler. Then Lennon takes over vocals again with 'I don't want to spoil the party', another of his melancholy songs.  It's pleasant enough, but not his best on here. We come to the last of the Beatles tracks 'What you're doing' with McCartney on vocals. This is the weakest of the Lennon/McCartney tunes included, and one of their least memorable. Only interesting feature is George Harrison's electric 12 string guitar, which he had begun to use on the last album, AHDN. The final cut on the British version of BFS is 'Everybody's trying to be my baby', the second Carl Perkins tune, but a much better track than the first one. George Harrison takes over vocals, and this track also has some tasty guitar playing by him as well. A good uplifting end to an album which I have to say rather disappoints overall.days a week', a good Lennon/McCartney number, but not a great one.

B000002H33|5.0|I remember the day I got MASTER OF PUPPETS as though it were yesterday. I had purchased 'The Black Album' about a month before, after far too many years of putting it off, and while I loved it immensely, I remained a little hesitant to buy any of Metallica's older, heavier material (prior to 'The Black Album' I had not in the slightest been a fan of metal). Nevertheless, after constantly reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews from both critics and fans, plus listening to a few song samples, I decided that I really ought to try MASTER. <br /> <br />Leaving the store with prize in hand, I hopped into my car and pointed it toward the mountains, then slid the CD into the player. Immediately, I was greeted, not with heavy, crunching guitars, but an acoustic, Spanish sounding melody. What the heck? I listened on, and the melody proceeded. Just as I was about to pull the CD to make sure I'd gotten the right one, the acoustic guitars were abruptly replaced by electric. The song built, growing heavier until, just as it reached the breaking point, it took off, smashing through the boundaries, as it were. \\"Battery\\" was here to stay, and so was this album. <br /> <br />I tell that story, because I can think of no better way to describe how powerful and immediate the impact MASTER OF PUPPETS made on me was. I rarely have the pleasure of listening to an album that surprises me throughout. This was one of them. From the intro of \\"Battery\\" to the abrupt change of pace in the middle of the title track, and the transition from ballad to thrasher in \\"Sanitarium,\\" this is a twisting and complex album, full of surprises. <br /> <br />But it's not just the surprises that earn this album the title of masterpiece. There's a grand sense of the epic in MASTER OF PUPPETS. Metallica has crafted something much bigger than a collection of songs. Nearly every song on here goes through one or more transitions as it progresses. Taken individually, tracks like \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Orion\\" are almost miniature suites in and of themselves, with their multiple sections. But, while virtually every track on here is great, the individual songs still pale in comparison to the quality of the album as a whole. Taken from start to finish, MASTER OF PUPPETS really is like a symphony on heavy metal instruments; the individual tracks are like movements, flowing effortlessly into one another. <br /> <br />Overall, I cannot feel justified in giving this album any less than five stars. I was not the first non-metal fan to be enthralled with (and eventually converted by) this album and I likely won't be the last. The innovativeness, level of musician ship, and flow of this album combine to create a masterpiece of the genre. If you haven't heard it, give it a try. It may not be your all time favorite album, but it certainly is an enjoyable one, even if, like me, you aren't the biggest metal-head in the world.
B000002KHH|5.0|I've been a Sabbath fan longer than you've been alive.  Black Sabbath didn't just play heavy metal, they created the entire genre.  Everyone else followed.  Meanwhile, Sabbath forged ahead, deepening with Master of Reality, Volume 4, and Sabotage.  Awesome.  But back to Paranoid -- did you know that the original intended title of the album was War Pigs?  Absolutely true.  But the powers-that-be didn't allow it, so at the last minute they had to change it to Paranoid. <br /> <br />This album is a tour-de-force of heavy metal.  No frills and no complexity, it is all about forceful riffs, interplay between Iommi's guitar and Butler's bass, strong drums from Bill Ward, and Ozzy Osbourne blasting it out.  No subtlety at all.  Which is what we all love about it.  Crank it up and enjoy!
B00005JNEI|5.0|I am amazed at how many bad reviews this movie got. All you people who just afraid to listen to what Moore has to say. You people are afraid to feel emotion, to have compassion. <br /> <br />I do not care what your bias is or what Moore's bias is (becasue yes I know he has one... that is how you make a f***ing documentary) because if you were not disturbed by the uncut images of war and death and hate in this film, you do not deserve to vote. And as a matter of fact, you are the people who should be on the front lines. If you are ignorant enough and full of such detest for human life that you cannot take in what this movie has to say, you are not an American in my eyes.  <br /> <br />Our Founding Fathers wanted a country of love and prosperity, peace and happiness. And most importantly, of intelligence and freedom. It was founded on the principle that we shall all accept one another for who we are and what we believe in, not to hate and try to destroy one another. Yes, our Fathers fought a war. But they fought that war for our freedom. And don't any of you try to hand me this crap that we are fighting for freedom now. If you did not appreciate this movie and feel that way about the war, you just are not paying attention. <br /> <br />And for who ever it was that was talking about film editing and how he made pieces of the film look as if they were one, uncut piece, but in actuality, he manipulated the footage to just look that way so he could show only what he wanted to show: You are Stupid. And I HIGHLY doubt you went back and watched this film THAT carefully to notice such things. That remark is not only incorrect, but marks you as ignorant an unwilling to just accept some of the atrocities of life. <br /> <br />Please, America, if you are truely patriotic, you will listen and see just what this film is talking about; this is patriotism at its finest. Grantid, you must take everything Michael Moore says with a grain of salt; of course he is going to be biased, because, as I said, that is how you make a documentary. <br /> <br />Of course, you could look at my review and disregard it entierly, as I openly admit to hating the curent government and everything about it. And since I feel that way, then this is just a stupid liberal trying to play mind-tricks in order to get you to listen to what I have to say. However, if you believe that, then you have a very sad misconception of what liberalism is. And I am sorry yu have to ruin this once wonderful country of ours. But I still love you.

The Lemon Song-5/5-\\"Squeeze me baby until the juice runs down my leg.\\" What a great line. This is one of the coolest Zeppelin songs. <br />4. Thank You-5/5-Guitar is great. <br />5. Heartbreaker-5/5-Robert Plant's voice sounds cool on this song. <br />6. Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)-5/5-One of my favorite songs by Zeppelin. Very catchy. <br />7. Ramble On-5/5-Next to \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" this is probably my favorite Led Zeppelin song. The chorus is awesome, drums in the beginning are great. The song is of course based on the Lord of the Rings. <br />8. Moby Dick-5/5-An instrumental. John Bonham's drumming shines on it. <br />9. Bring It on Home-5/5-Don't know what's going on in the beginning of the song, but other than that. It's a great song. <br />A
B000053VAF|1.0|This movie just isn't funny.  Technically it is a comedy, however it does not deserve to be classified as such.  Just as reality tv is called reality tv, that doesn't make it real, in fact it is fake.  George Carlin and Chris Rock were good but they couldn't hold this one up as atlas held up the world.  For one thing, George Carlin had a small cameo in the beginning, but if he were in the entire movie it would have been much better.  George Carlin also had a small appearance in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, by you guessed it, Kevin Smith.  George Carlin also had a small cameo appearance in Scary Movie 3 which is very funny by the way, and not made by Kevin Smith.  The only Kevin Smith flicks worth watching are Jay and Silent Bob and Clerks.  Stay away from Dogma and Chasing Amy, actually douse them with gasoline and light them on fire if you get the chance.  Then urinate the fire out, and do it again.  I've done that before, it can really lift your spirits and make you feel better after seeing a lousy movie.
B000A5044C|4.0|By now, all readers should have a good idea of what this movie is all about, an observation of how four siblings (same mother but different fathers) carried on living when they were all but forgotten by their mother.  Whilst some viewers might think that the mother was self-centred and callous, thinking of her own pursuit of happiness, this movie pointed straight to the social issues that Japan is facing right now.  True, Japan is an industrialised nation and it has a high standard of living.  Nonetheless, it doesn't imply that the Japanese's quality of life is moving on-par with the standard.  Rather, people are slaving away and minding their own business or that people are verging towards extremism.  It's ultimately survival of the fittest and everyone is there fending for themselves.  Viewers shall see for themselves the superficial politeness that Japanese is known for in this movie.  One would think that the neighbours of those siblings would have noticed of their unkempt appearances and them hanging around when they should be attending schools but they were pretty much left to their own devices.  Then, there's the character of Saki, a senior high school student that befriended the four siblings.  She's been regarded as an 'outsider' by her peers and as a result, she's hanging around in the park to kill time and giving her parents the impression that she's still going to school.  Shouldn't the parents play their part in knowing their own children intimately and caring for their emotional well-being instead of simply catering for their physical well-being?  Thus, many cases of 'hikikomori' situation in Japan where children tend to lose themselves in their own room for years...On top of that, there's Saki again dating older business man to make money for the four siblings.  Remember, everything we saw in this movie was based upon true events!  Overall, this is an unforced movie that slowly unfolds itself and gradually, we get to empathise with the siblings and the plight that they were in.  The theme song in the end really striked it to the core of the matter, that there wasn't really a light at the end of the tunnel and people like those children were really the lost souls or abandoned souls of Japan.  Could those four children and Saki, and even their mother (played by You, a J-Pop singer) represent the fate of the delinquent and rebellious youngsters of modern-day Japan and is there a future for them under the new Koizumi government?  Thus, the movie ending with an open-ended format.  Lest Japan forget...Unforgettable experience and outstanding performances from all cast.  Highly recommended and not to be missed.  Not much extra in DVD but simply subtitle.

B00005JMYI|3.0|Will Ferrell has a real knack for playing clueless goofballs - in this case a conceited San Diego news anchor, circa 1977 - and he pretty much carries the movie. Christina Applegate handles the lead female role admirably, and she has matured into a real beauty, which makes it all the more enjoyable to watch her onscreen. The story line is thin, to say the least, but there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments. Worth watching if you want some light entertainment and don't mind some bad language and constant sexual innuendo.
B000002H2H|5.0|Reading through the reviews on Ride the Lightning, I noticed someone asked if this Metallica album would be appropriate for a 13-year-old to listen to. Someone else answered with a yes, stating that it is ok because the album contains no vulgar language and lacks a parental advisory sticker. <br /> <br />When judging the appropriateness of an album, one must not just take into account vulgar language. One must also examine the content of the lyrics. That being said, this is a very dark album that deals with things like nuclear war, capitol punishment, and suicide. <br /> <br />One must be a very mature 13-year-old to understand this music. A less mature adolescent could certainly enjoy this album, as the guitar solos and riffs are incredible, and the drumming is outstanding. Hetfield's vocals wouldn't impress university professors, but I personally feel that they fit the styling of the album perfectly. <br /> <br />Going back to my original point, I think that yes, this album would probably be ok for a 13-year-old. However, much younger than that, and you are stepping on thin ice. (pardon the pun). <br /> <br />Aside from all that, this is by far one of the best metal CDs I have ever heard. If only Metallica would grow their hair back out and go back to the 5+ minute songs...
B00000JJQK|5.0|\\"Pet Sounds\\" is one of those albums that occasionally is released that has a Jekyll/Hyde existence. Many people either hated it or didn't understand it, while those who saw the evolution of rock into art realized that this album was helping direct that evolution. As always in everything from movies to books, the difference between art and entertainment became a huge factor in the album's initial commercial lack of success.<br /><br />There was nothing like \\"Pet Sounds\\" when it came out. Furthermore, the music was very different from what The Beach Boys had done previously. A recipe for commercial disaster. Long time fans of \\"Barbara Ann\\" and \\"Surfing U.S.A.\\" wondered what these songs were all about. This stuff just wasn't The Beach Boys they knew. Little did most fans know that The Beach Boys they knew never were The Beach Boys they thought they knew.<br /><br />It wasn't until many years later that the complex relationships and creative conflicts between the members of the group were brought to light, and the discovery that Brian Wilson in particular wanted the group to grow in a more mature direction. \\"Pet Sounds\\" was a very long step in that direction.<br /><br />We look back on \\"Pet Sounds\\" from our next millenium perspective and want to say, \\"What's the big deal?\\" It was a very big deal in 1966. \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" sparked a whole new revolution in rock music the effect of which can never be fully understood or estimated. These albums were the sound of rock music growing up. However, \\"Pet Sounds\\" was too alien for the typical public taste at the time, and it flopped.<br /><br />But, other musicians loved it; particularly The Beatles. John and Paul recognized the roots of something great, and were strongly influenced by it. Many other rock and pop musicians have pointed to \\"Pet Sounds\\" as being a big influence on their music. \\"Pet Sounds\\" was music as art. \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" while also striving for art, also managed to be commercially successful. However, there are songs from \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" which followed well the artistic path of \\"Pet Sounds\\" that had their own detractors. Unfortunately not everyone understands art.<br /><br />Listening today, \\"Pet Sounds\\" is somewhat dated. However, listen to it over and over, and you realize that the music is well done. From our perspective we can look back over 25+ years of rock music and realize that \\"Pet Sounds\\" was ahead of its time. In all the hysteria of The Beatles, \\"Pet Sounds\\" got lost.<br /><br />\\"Pet Sounds\\" is great rock because of what it was when it was released, and who it influenced.<br /><br />Beyond the influence, there are some really great songs on this CD. \\"Sloop John B.\\" is one of my favorite Beach Boys songs. \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\\" \\"That's Not Me,\\" \\"I Know There's an Answer,\\" \\"God Only Knows,\\" \\"Caroline No\\"...all very good to great songs. Admittedly somewhat mellow, but beautiful.<br /><br />Should you buy this album? Well, depends on what you like. \\"Pet Sounds\\" refuses to fit into a nice niche. It's not like what The Beach Boys did before it. It is mellow, but it's not a perfect fit into pop music. If you've heard at least 3 or 4 of the songs above, and like them, then you'll like the rest of the CD. If you haven't heard very much of the CD, then either download samples or borrow a copy. I, on the other hand, may need to purchase another copy, because I think the laser diode is knocking too many molecules off my copy, I play it so much.<br /><br />Note that this album has been reissued and remastered and thus this particular version is now the \\"old\\" version.

B00005UJOK|5.0|30+ years ago \\"Paranoid\\" was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world, the second album for Black Sabbath after their debut album \\"Black Sabbath\\". The late 60s and early 70s were a great time for experimentation, and rock was heading all over the place as various groups pushed the limits of what rock could be and where it could lead.<br /><br />Paranoid remains a good album after 30+ years, a remarkable feat. \\"War Pigs\\" and \\"Iron Man\\" are considered primers for metal music, which we called hard rock in those ancient days, with a very basic bass, lead guitar, and drums sound, and the gritty, earthy voice of the Oz-man.<br /><br />Of course some parents and many religious leaders pounced on the group's name and some of their lyrics. On the other hand, the current-day version of these same people complain that Harry Potter promotes witchcraft.<br /><br />The lyrics in this album are mild, almost mainstream by today's standards. Furthermore, the lyrics are not all that breakthrough or novel, but when the lyrics are coupled with the music and Ozzy's voice, you have what was in 1971 a breakthrough album that sold very well, in spite of nearly zero radio play (except on the infamous, but not really, underground FM stations).<br /><br />What else is on this album? \\"Planet Caravan\\" is a spacey tune that is a psychedelic rock holdover from the late 60s. I enjoy this song with its synthesized voice and mellow mood. \\"Electric Funeral\\" is another hard rocker in the vein of \\"War Pigs\\" and \\"Iron Man.\\" The transition in this song is solid hard rock, bridging a relatively slow beginning to a brief lead guitar solo that takes off into a screamer...and then back to the slow beat of the intro. Ozzy is nearly singing a dirge at the beginning and end of the song, but that's also the point of the song.<br /><br />\\"Hand of Doom\\" starts with the bass, adding drums and then Ozzy's voice. After the intro the lead guitar thrusts into the song and Ozzy starts putting himself into the song. The song switches back and forth between the bass/drums/mellow Oz to heavy bass, lead guitar, drums and Ozzy's full voice. Then the song suddenly changes so that it's almost like a completely different song, another hard rocker that may be the most metal song on the CD. Then about two minutes from the end of the song the speed slows down in a reprise of the beginning. By the way, this song is about drugs; the images are not positive.<br /><br />Next you've got \\"Rat Salad.\\" This song is an instrumental, the excellent drum work (turn up the bass!) setting you up for the last song.<br /><br />I love \\"Fairies Wear Boots.\\" I realize the lyrics are borderline corny, but on the other hand here's Ozzy singing about somebody who's clearly having a trip (chemically induced). Fortunately for many of us, the song is all the trip we need and the chemistry set is not required. This song is fun and good and has excellent riffs and bass.<br /><br />Music has changed a lot in 30 years. But some things remain the same. This album is one of them. I hope I enjoy it 30 years from now as much as I enjoy it today.<br /><br />This album is a Japanese version and others exist.

B00001QEE6|2.0|This unforgettable movie of the Disney's factory is perfectly restored as for image and sound. But for those that we saw it when we were children in its spanish version, we have met with the surprise that, for this occasion, the dubbing to Spanish has been carried out again. Regrettable! The current actors that lend their voice to the movie, are very far from the quality of those Mexicans of the years 50's. Some words have even been changed, losing all its favour. Those beloved actors of 1955, put the soul in their diction. Those of now, they recite as if they are reading a book. In short, that for those that we had liked to hear it in same spanish of 50's, the movie has lost all its charm. Why Disney have had to change the original dubbing? On the other hand, in the VHS previous version, the Spanish version was the original of 1955.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|Words could never do this album justice, so I'll skip the prentense.  We are extremely lucky to have a band like Sigur Ros currently making music, and their live show is a life affirming experience.  One of the best albums of 2005, which has been an especially strong year for music.
B000002J09|5.0|Since rock and roll's conception in 1954 many bands and artists have come along and made their mark.  Bands like the Beatles created a formula to appeal to the masses and the Rolling Stones redefined what it meant to be BAD.  The Who created their great rock operas and AC/DC just went out and kicked some ass.  However all of them pale in comparison to the mighty Led Zeppelin.  Each of the albums changed rock music in an incredible way.  Their first album appropriately named \\"Led Zeppelin\\" is without a doubt the birth of heavy metal.  Their second called \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" changed the blues into something more refined then one and produced the inspiration for people like Eddie Van Halen and Steve Vai.  Then three threw everyone on their ass with some mind blowing acoustic work.  Their Untitled fourth album is the culmination of everything they had done up to that point. <br />The record starts off with Black Dog which is probably one of the greatest stop and go rhythms ever, with Robert Plant just wailing out in his oh so recognizable orgasmic style.  Then there is Rock and Roll with some of the fastest fret work any guitarist has ever achieved on a Les Paul.  Then a complete reversal to The Battle of Evermore the only duet Robert Plant ever had with Led Zeppelin, with the beautiful soprano Sandy Denny.  If this doesn't ring as one of the greatest folk songs ever then I can't think of one better.  Next we come to the apex of rock music.  The greatest, most beautiful, most haunting song ever, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN.  If I need to explain this song to you then you can just crawl back under the rock from wence you came.  How could anybody not like the awesome groove that is Misty Mountain Hop.  That is also one of those incredible guitar riffs that could only say LED ZEPPELIN.  Next is the vastly underrated Four Sticks with Bonham playing with guess what, four sticks.  Also another killer groove.  There are parts of this song with Plant singing so high only dogs could discern what he's saying.  Talk about mellow, how about Going to California?  Such a sad melancholy, yet beautiful song.  I can't think of any better song to close out the greatest album ever than When the Levee Breaks.  This song is the epitomy of what the LED loved and respected, the blues.  If you claim to have heard a heavier, louder drum track than Bonham's on Levee then you are a liar.  Flat out LIAR.  It is the undisputed champion of sampled tracks.  Damn you Beastie Boys! <br />It is odd really that this album exists.  I never thought that there was such a thing as a perfect album, well I was dead wrong.  This is it the ultimate album on the list of the best of the best.  With the music, if that is the only other word besides crap that describes what comes, out today it is refreshing to say the least to hear this album.  It really drives home the fact that the golden age of music is over.  <br />PS: GREEN DAY SUCK!!
B00006DEFA|5.0|There are so many things to love about this film: the music (performed so exquisitely, creating Mozart fans out of folks who thought classical music was boring), the controversial storyline (was Mozart really \\"murdered\\"?), and the epic recreation of 18th-century Vienna.  As you fall in love with Mozart and his childlike persona juxtaposed with his musical genius and maturity at such a young age, you can't help but fall in love with the acting genius of F. Murray Abraham.  His character portrayal of Antonio Salieri is, in my humble opinion, the most extraordinary, enigmatic performance ever captured on film. I can't express that enough.  His gestures, his facial expressions, his passion, his overwhelming presence brings Salieri to life and then some.  I think the real Salieiri would be pleased to know he was resurrected in such a larger-than-life manner.  If you're a fan of glorious music, this film will move you.  If you're a fan of Mozart, this film will enrapture you.  If you're a fan of great acting, this film should be your Bible. Abraham won the Best Actor Oscar for this role, and he will forever be revered in the annals of film by this extraordinary performance.  Tom Hulce also did a marvelous job portraying Mozart.  I can't imagine any other actor in the role.  What a treat for the senses.  Bravo!

B00080ZG10|4.0|\\"The Aviator\\" depicts Howard Hughes' life from the late 1920s to roughly 1947.  As the movie opens, Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a newbie film producer - better known in Hollywood circles as a rich Texan oilman (he quickly corrects that his fortune is from manufacturing drill bits, which doesn't augment his credibility).  The film he is making is \\"Wild Angels,\\" and his obsession with perfectly crafting the planes and flight scenes clearly foreshadows his impending fascination with aviation.  As \\"The Aviator\\" unfolds, Hughes has a number of affairs with famous actresses, notably Katherin Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale).  However, his efforts to build innovative aircrafts as well as his takeover and running of TWA comprise the main plot.<br /><br />\\"The Aviator\\" is fantastic in all technical aspects; it's a gorgeous looking movie.  The film deservedly won Oscars for cinematography, art direction, costume design - pummeling the less flashy Best Picture winner, \\"Million Dollar Baby.\\"  However, whereas \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" was all heart, \\"The Aviator\\" is fairly soulless.  I have been a long-time Scorsese fan, and it kills me to say so, but the film is not particularly insightful.  The movie very ably recreates the characters, but it does not deepen our understanding of them.  The script certainly plays up Hughes' likely obsessive-compulsive disorder, which makes for some interesting scenes, but it doesn't humanize him or explain his drive.<br /><br />Despite this flaw, \\"The Aviator\\" is still a decent flick.  The acting is generally quite good.  DeCaprio does an admirable job in depicting Hughes' gradual descent; the role made him an Oscar nominee for the first time in 11 years.  In addition, Cate Blanchett won the Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal (although her prickly performance is likely to be off-putting for some).  Finally, although \\"The Aviator\\" is not as \\"deep\\" as one would like, it's rather enjoyable.  For a long film, it moves at a nice clip and features many well constructed and interesting scenes, with Hughes' testimony at a Congressional Hearing on aviation a true highlight.  With Scorsese at the helm, it's difficult to avoid grading \\"The Aviator\\" on a curve - it should have been better.  However, it's certainly an above average movie that is likely to appeal to many audiences.t moves at a nice clip and features many well constructed and interesting scenes, with Hughes' testimony at a Congressional Hearing on aviation a true highlight.

6304698526|5.0|The thing about Bullitt is that it didn't make Steve McQueen, oddly enough it refined him. He had come from humble beginnings and by 1968, was a superstar playing in the haunting and then sexy Thomas Crown Affair. (Less flesh than the remake; more believable ending; better actors.)<br /><br />Here he is the soft spoken hard as nails San Francisco Police Detective. I would argue that McQueen's role not only influences the future 'detective' genre but the novelist's detective such as Parker's Spenser as well. Quiet. Intelligent. Above it all. Relentless. With a private life that doesn't always hold together.<br /><br />He guards a witness that he loses and can't figure out why. Of course it's the overacted Walter Chalmers by Robert Vaughn who is the key. Strangely enough McQueen and Vaughn crossed paths earlier in \\"The Magnificent Seven,\\" the early vehicle for Charles Bronson et al.<br /><br />Bullitt even has a small part for Duvall, who also had a small part as Boo Radley in \\"Mockingbird,\\" and then of course he took off. Great dialogue possibly typified by the times, odd times for movies, Vietnam, music, hippies, counter culture and a whole lot of other things. And, with the possible exception of Petersen's car chase in the little known \\"To Live and Die in LA,\\" maybe the greatest car chase film ever, with McQueen's beautiful 390 GT Mustang versus the Dodge Charger. (Did you catch Ford's 2005 commercial on the Mustange remake re-release with the driver tossing the keys to a morphed McQueen? Brilliant although maybe too limited in its audience.)<br /><br />5 stars. We miss you Steve. Larry Scantlebury
0792844882|1.0|There's a difference between camp and just plain bad.  This movie is not camp.  There are too many serious scenes in this movie for it to be camp.  Even camp has a sense of innocence.  There is too much ugliness in this film for that. <br /> <br />You can tell that most of the actors in the movie are competent, and, except for Elizabeth Berkley, they protect their reputations.  Gina Gershon is wonderful as Crystal Connors.  She actually ACTS! <br /> <br />Glenn Plummer is great as James Smith.  He's likeable at first, and we think he'll become a romantic lead, but no, the film dispenses with romance and casts him aside.  Ugh! <br /> <br />This film proves that even a multitude of perfect bodies cannot save a bad film, nor bring it into the \\"camp\\" category. <br /> <br />What's most sad about this movie is that there is no sexual tension in it.  I didn't find it erotic at all.  With such a beautiful cast as ammunition, the director doesn't hit the target once.  It's all just a lot of naked, senseless flailing. <br /> <br />And then there's the dancing.  All angry Nazi jerks and snaps, and no smoothness -- no sense of the erotic.  All anger, no seduction.  Yuck. <br /> <br />I was hoping for a turn-on, and got nothing.  Honest porn is better.
0060920084|2.0|This reads like a book the author wrote to fulfil some contractual obligation.     The 'plot' can be summarized as follows: Drive a car into a small town, check into some hotel, make disparaging comments on a few people and then do it all over again. There are some genuinely funny moments in the book but at times it does feel like the author is trying too hard to be funny. Also, a place is pretty or ugly depending on the author's mood.    IMO, other reviewers who are offended by the author are missing the point as I don't think he was being serious (I thought this was a dead giveaway when he makes jokes on his parents). But then again, am not an American who grew up in a small town, so its easier for me to feel that way.    All in all, a harmless little book which can (will) be forgotten the moment you turn the last page.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I purchased this dvd on the internet because, where I live, the dvd was on back order. It was suppose to be released on tuesday but when I went to get it, it was not available, nore anywhere else in the entire city. I purchased two on the internet, for a friend and I, but she had found the dvd at the PX, that was out of town, for $14. I cancelled one of the two and I was impatient to see what the dvd had. After waiting only 4 days I got my order from amazon and I was quite pleased. Oh. and the dvd was released this saturday  and it cost $27. Yeah right. <br />I didn't like having to switch the dvds when part of the movie was over. I did like the special features, even the deleted scenes. I would like to have seen a 'blooper reel' but that was in the little films that were in the 3rd dvd. This dvd is a must for titanic fans. <br />

0525457585|5.0|The Neverending Story by Michael Ende is a fantastic book that has been around for years and will continue to be.  This well written book takes you to a world of fantasy where you can become lost in the book and not want to put it down.  In the story anything can happen and most of the time it does.  Bastian, the main character, is taken to Fantastica to give the Childlike Empress a new name.  But, to give her this new name he must go on a journey,far away from Earth. He learns about friendship and how to trust people you don't really know.  Although he gets conceited towards the end he learns that he doesn't want power, but all he wants to be is loved.  His wishes are running short and he's losing all memories of his world. To make it home he must find the true meaning of why he wants to go home. He makes it home to find his months of long journey in Fantastica was only a day on earth and his father, which he hasn't been close to since his mother died, was shocked when Bastian returned with many, many stories.  Over all, I recommend this book to all ages, 9 to 99.  So if you haven't read this book, go out and buy it!
B000002UUX|5.0|Megadeth: \\"Rust In Peace\\" <br /> <br />Thank You very much for taking the time to read this post. <br /> <br />Until proven otherwise this is the greatest Thrash Metal Album of all time.  <br />Period! 5 stars mates! \\"Rust In Peace\\" is without a shadow of a doubt the pedigree of what <br />all Thrash Metal albums should be compared too. This album is even better  <br />than Metallica's \\"Ride The Lighting, better than Anthrax's \\"Among The Living\\",  <br />and far superior to Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\" or \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\" respectively. <br />When you take into consideration how great the above aforementioned albums <br />are, arguably top 5 of all-time, and none come close to RIP. This is a masterpiece because of the force, <br />the power, the darkness, the undeniable attitude that only the metal gengre of thrash metal could put forth. It's like the great punks bands rage only with  a lot more musicianship, with all due respect. <br /> <br />One can make an argument that this album is so near perfect that this is as good as thrash  <br />metal can get. In essence if you don't like this album then your more than likely not gonna like <br />anything from this particular musical genre which is basically a combination of Heavy Metal, punk, &  <br />jazz Rock fusion in a fast paced progressive form. This is as good as it gets people. This is what thrash metal was suppose <br />to sound like. This album is the blueprint for what is great thrash metal and what is not. No room for second best. It must also be acknowledged for the impact this album has had on the history of hard rock and metal. Just like Never Mind the Bullocks impacted the Punk rock history so has RIP to the Trash metal culture. <br /> <br />If your a fan of hard rock music especially metal then you have to own this album. One listen <br />and you will see what good songwriting, some ingenuity, and some experimention can bring <br />you. From start to finish this is the quessential thrash album,  the thrasher-esque musical recipe for success if ya will. This is the best album Metallica never wrote.  <br /> <br />How can a hard rocker not be awed by the politically adrenalized \\"Holy Wars\\" with the infamous  <br />Middle Eastern solo provided by Marty Friedman? Or how can any guitar fan not appreciate the  <br />shredding of \\"Hangar 18\\"? These 2 songs alone are two of the most devastating metal songs ever <br />recorded. EVER! The musical themes on here range from aliens, sorcery, love lost, warheads,  <br />terrorism, governments, corruption, religion, viruses, and anything and everything in between.  <br />These themes were complimented with great heavy guitar shredding, excellant songwriting, raw  <br />production, thunderous drum pounding, thick bass lines, and touch of politics and the product  <br />result was RIP. Now while Big Dave(Dave Mustaine) is not a great singer, he more than makes up <br />for it with his guitar playing  and overall musicianship. Then again how many rock singers actually <br />really sing? Everyone knows that just as B.B King is the Godfather to the blues, Big <br />Dave is the same to thrash metal. As Scott Ian of Anthrax put it \\"Without Dave there wouldn't be  <br />thrash metal\\" or something along those lines.   <br /> <br />So with that said my advice to you if you do not already own your copy of this album then please <br /> <br />GO BUY, BEG, OR BURROW this album NOW! <br /> <br />Cheers! <br />P.S. And remember what Big Dave said, then still holds true to this day.... \\"Killing for religion something I don't understand.\\" <br />Chris(COKE08)
B0000TLA9G|1.0|If you know anything about Guns N' Roses, they hate each other.  The only thing they agreed upon was to block this greatest hits compilation from ever coming out.  None of the band members wanted this to be released, so don't buy it.   <br /> <br />If you like or respect the band, then respect their wishes and reject this album.  You want a Guns N' Roses album start with Appetite for Destruction.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Though not the most original sounding nor the best produced album in modern rock it's hard to debate that based purely on it's musical strengths Absolution is a force to be reconded with.  From the almost painful pounding of minor chords in \\"Apocalypse Please\\" to the gentle but paranoid conclusion of \\"Ruled by Secrecy\\" a band that sounds many members larger than a trio reviels itself.  Though there are \\"weaker\\" tracks here there are no truely \\"weak\\" ones primarily thanks to Matt's moving vocal performances; even when the lyrics lack the shear emotion and energy convayed make up for it.  Sure he sounds vaguely like Thom Yorke but I would argue that Matt is far more dynamic and does less droning and less pained whining than Yorke (not to say that I don't love Radiohead because I do).  Musically the two bands are really worlds apart thanks to the different numbers in the member count.  Muse has to rely on only three people to make the sound huge, as a result less jangling guitars and intertwining syths are present and shear virtosity and some \\"big\\" distorted chords have to fill in the gaps.  Not that such things are really that original either, however name one other band that mixes Radiohead with Black Sabbath and sounds so good doing it...  Breaking through the mess of overproduction and gaps in inspiration Absolution is, as a whole, so increadibly strong that it overcomes.  Prehapse too powerful even since it's hard to listen to it for more than two times consecutivily, even if it's just in the background.  Anyway, great album fueled by emotions of all kinds and musical talant that is hard to deny, I await the next epic from these three.
006054094X|4.0|If I had written this review immediately after reading the first 80% of it, I would've most likely given it 5 stars. I've always been a fan of looking at things at another angle and challenging the academic establishment, because how else are new things learned. For this alone I would've given him great credit, if every fourth page he didn't mention that none of these theses were original and this is considered \\"common knowledge\\" in China. Seeing as I've never been to China, I, unfortunately, cannot verify this. If Menzies intended to be a trailblazer and a pioneer, he would've trimmed the bulk of his retellings and focused on WHY this isn't considered the real deal in America. WHY does some retired navyman have to expose the conspiracy? Is there a lot in stake for the theory of Europeans discovering the American continent? I don't take issue with what he's saying immediately because he doesn't have a scientific background and no overwhelming corrobation, but I'd like to know why he's the pioneer of this so-called enlightenment.  <br /> <br />The only other issue is somewhat related to the first, and that's the other most definitely knew his point before he made it. He was using a deductive mentality for this entire book, and seeing how that gave us centuries of scientific idiocy, let's just say that's not exactly how you want frame your book. Mind you, I don't think this really hurt him too, too much in the book; it's just a pet peeve of mine. The thing that made me question it more than anything else, was ironically, that he seemed to have an answer for everything. For a theory that is based on documents and evidence from nearly 6 centuries ago, I think it's almost assumed there would be some holes and incongruencies in the data. But not with Menzies! It's the perfect theory, nothing is out of order and every little thing was completely feasible! Am I questioning direct facts (such as the circumnavigation of Greenland, which I really don't know enough about to comment on)? No, but I find the lack of errors, or seeming lack of errors, to be the most suspicious part of all. <br /> <br />Now, after all of that negativity, this book was quite an enjoyable read. Sure, there were the two aforementioned issues, but otherwise it's a thought-provoking page-turner which I found to be a great read. I'd definitely recommend it for a read, but not for a philosophy, not yet at least.
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is a great book all about rabbits. It is definitely one of my favorite books. It has lots of great action and a fast moving plot.  It also has some great characters, with good character description. The cover has a peaceful image of a rabbit on it but this book is warlike. There is fighting and death and gore. However, there is also an engaging storyline about the rabbits' adventures. <br />When Fiver, who has prophesizing powers, warns that the rabbit's home of Sandleford Warren will soon be destroyed, few believe him. So a small band of rabbits who believe Fiver leave the warren, hunting for a new home. They meet many groups of rabbits, all with different  customs and peculiarities. This is an exciting story about some rabbits on a quest for survival. I highly recommend this book.
B00004R99U|1.0|Both part 1 and 2 are terrible. Disney did not follow the historical accounts of pocahontas, by the way didn't you people know that she married John Rolfe, it is a true story. In history John Smith had no part between Rolfe and Pocahontas. Terrible, terrible movies especially part 2. I might give part one 2 or 3 stars.
1401308201|4.0|Upon receiving this book, I was absolutely elated. The cover was so beautiful, and flipping through the book was spectacular. However, while this book was initially flawless, I feel a victim of false adveritising. True: this book has some nice behind-the-scenes stuff (drafts of the novel and of \\"Defying Gravity\\" as well as set and costume designs) and a step-by-step of how Elphaba gets green (of course, you can find this online); it does not include the full libretto or any spells, both of which were why I so desired this book! Yes, it includes the lyrics for \\"Wicked Witch of the East\\" and includes snippets of the book: if you've seen the musical, it's nothing impressive. Some of my favourite scenes they just glance over with a few sentences, barely even managing to explain the scene. For example: What precedes \\"Defying Gravity\\" and the Elphaba/Glinda confrontation near the end. <br />Regardless, if you (like me) are absolutely obsessed with this musical, you will probably still appreciate the book. It does have some nice pictures (though many of them are repeated from online sources and the program) and some good comments. <br />I must say though: why do they think we'd care about their fan letters? I'd much rather have a full libretto. <br />In conclusion, if you are a true Wicked fan, get this book of course! If you are merely mulling it over as a way to spend a spare $25 bucks, well then, I couldn't tell you. (I keep telling myself: \\"at least I didn't pay full price.\\") If you are an Idina fan, I gotta say, this might not be the book for you. It seems to have much more of Stephanie J. Block. <br /> <br />(Just to end on a good note: one sort-of nifty thing that is included that wasn't advertised is a step-by-step for \\"The Elphie.\\")
B0001LYH9S|3.0|This is Bowie going back to his gender bending days, when he pushed boundaries and revelled in the wierd and wonderful.  It's nice to have him back, but it certainly isn't one of my favourites.  I definitely enjoyed Black Tie White Noise, and all of his releases after Outside, but this one was a little too wierd for me, and a little too detached.  It didn't seem to have any real flow throughout the album, and each song was part of a story but still didn't seem like it fitted in.  Still, with Bowie he will always make a few quality tracks at the very least on every album, and 'Hello Spaceboy', 'Outside', 'We Prick You' and 'No Control' are quality tracks.  Average release, but still worth checking out.

B000AYQJJ2|5.0|it's about time the concert for bagladesh came out on dvd.  even better is the deluxe edition, which i bought.  besides the outstanding quality of the concert dvd, the additional disc, with interviews and bonus tracks is just great. (although it's a pity, isn't it a shame that bob dylan didn't do an interview).  then there's the packaging, which is beautiful.  the dvds in its own case, and the great booklet.  the poster is great for framining and hanging on your wall.  postcards are cool, and the apple sticker is ok.  this is how older material should be presented, as opposed to the latest lennon \\"collection\\".  skip the regular dvd edition and get the deluxe.

(If you really want to know, go to his side of the Kooper-Bloomfield \\"Super Session\\" album.) At the same time, he's not too proud to bring on the guitar superstars (Hendrix, Clapton); now *that's* confidence.

0060589280|3.0|Paulo Coehlo is one of my favorite authors. His understanding of the human condition is second to none and he has a way of making the weighty existential angst most of us go through but are chagrin to share pleasurably seductive to read. But with \\"Eleven Minutes,\\" he overshoots his mark.<br /><br />Coehlo does explore the nature of sex and love, as promised, but doesn't really nail down a opinion or point of view on either. This book is best as a generator of thought, a key to unlock your own musings on sex and love. But unfortunately, Coehlo doesn't add as much to the dialog as just repeat ideas that have already been voiced. However, he does this in his typically lovely, lyrical, and heady way that it's hard to take objection to such a well-crafted echo of things that have been said before.<br /><br />And this isn't to say there isn't value in \\"Eleven Minutes\\" for there is. For me, the most memorable parts were when protagonist Maria explores a sado-masochistic relationship and how it seduces and calls to her, and her true love Ralf's admonitions about associating pain with love. This is a welcome warning and to me, perhaps the most important point in Coehlo's book.<br /><br />My second favorite device/theme in this book is how Coehlo details Maria's journey away from innocence, beginning with lost opportunities, lost love, and unrequited love. The powerful forces these unfulfilled emotions have on the human heart can not be understated. The first third of the book explores these themes.<br /><br />Eleven Minutes is an adequate and lovingly crafted treatise on one woman's journy from innocence to sexual exploration to jadedness to hope. I recommend this book, as it's a quick and lovely read. I rated it three stars because in my opinion it doesn't match the majesty of Coehlo's other output.
0316172324|4.0|There is plenty of food for thought in the pages of Blink.  Malcolm Gladwell does indeed, to some degree, inspire you to rethink your whole way of thinking.  I'm not sure how much of a practical effect the book has on a reader, though, because Gladwell never really comes out with a systematic method for training yourself to think differently.  I would sum the book up this way: Your unconscious is smarter than you are - but not always.  It isn't that radical of an idea.  We've all been such advice as: if you don't know the answer, go with your first instinct; you never get a second chance to make a first impression; and the ubiquitous follow your gut.  What Gladwell does is validate these sorts of common sense notions.  Going further, though, he also describes situations in which your unconscious can lead you astray.  Ideally, one must strike a balance between instinct and deliberation.<br /><br />The book features all manner of excellent examples to fit Gladwell's argument - although at times, it gets a little bogged down in minutiae (such as a veritable laundry list of scientific names for facial muscles).  First, he talks about a Greek statue that was scientifically verified as authentic but almost immediately declared a fake (and rightly so) by a number of experts in that form of art.  How could these experts see the truth instantaneously?  Why can other people see and know things that logic dictates it is impossible to know?  These are the questions Gladwell asks.  It all comes down to thin-slicing, he tells us.  Thin-slicing involves the filtering out of all but the most relevant data, and the human unconscious thrives at this special skill.  Then comes the more interesting part - ask someone to explain how he knew something spontaneously, and he/she will struggle to do so.  What is more, the very effort to describe one's reaction makes the person less sure of his/her conclusions.  From here, it's only a hop, skip, and a jump to the argument that too much information can sometimes be a bad thing.  This would seem to be bad news to those of us who prefer to sit and study about something before coming up with an opinion.  It isn't always the case, mind you, but too much deliberation about too many things can be more of a hindrance than a help.<br /><br />Thus, after showing what an unacknowledged genius our unconscious is, Gladwell proceeds to demonstrate how the unconscious sometimes gets things horribly wrong.  He uses real world examples such as the Pepsi Challenge (and goes on to explain why New Coke seemed like a good idea at the time yet failed miserably), the shooting of an unarmed man by police officers, and the success of market-testing failures such as All in the Family.  A number of fascinating insights are gleaned in the process: perception affects satisfaction, stereotypes (even those you strongly rebuke consciously) affect feelings and behavior, mood can be affected just by adopting certain facial expressions, spontaneity is not random, and others.<br /><br />There is a level of contradiction worked into the book.  Sometimes, for example, first impressions are right on the money, and sometimes they are not a good indicator at all.  How do you know the difference?  Sometimes, less information is more valuable than more, but sometimes it isn't.  Gladwell's point is that sound decision making is borne of a balance between instinctive, reactive realization and deliberate, studied conclusions.  I think he pretty well proves the point, but he doesn't really give us a road map for finding that balanced place.  Thus, the book is made up mostly of thought-provoking, fascinating stories and examples.  It makes for fascinating reading, but I'm not sure it will actually change the way I think about things on a routine basis.ormation can sometimes be a bad thing.

0553296981|4.0|Das Tagebuch der Anne Frank (The Diary of Anne Frank) is a real story about the persecution of Jews in the Second World War.  It describes very nearly what happened with a Jewish family in Amsterdam during that time.  They had the luck to have a hiding place and people who helped them to survive longer than other Jews at this time.  This book gives you a view of the life and feelings from a family who worries that nobody hear them.  They couldn't do what everybody else could do they must be quiet and they must find somebody who can help the, to bring them food, clothes and all the stuff that you need to survive. It is writing in a diary from a nine year old girl.  The whole book gives you a lot of information but in the end there is not enough information.  It is an emotionally strong book for what you need basic information about this time to read it. I think you can read this book between 13 years of age and 100 years of age - every body can learn there something about the feelings from a girl that was forced to live in a time of human hate, stupidity, prejudice, and genocide, as a hostage because of fear.  This book should show us that something like that never happen again. And that we have to fight for human rights and peace.  I hope that somebody never has to write about a so horrible time like this time again.
B00008G9JM|4.0|Your jaw will drop when you see how long this song is--a grand total of 44:58 (or at least on the version I have). But don't worry--it's like Thick As a Brick, only a bit more connected. Packed with symbolism, religous references, instrumentals, and everything else in between, APP is one of Tull's stronger song/albums.<br /><br />The overture will probably grind your nerves, as will a few other parts (A couple instrumentals, for example), but the organ part is stunning, as is Ian Anderson's flute playing (as usual). I also like the theme and the \\"Story of a Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\", a must-hear (I'm serious--in the middle of the song, Ian Anderson yells out, \\"This is the story of a hare who lost his spectacles\\" and then they kick into a fairytale or something like that.) A perfect purchase for all Tull fans.
0679745653|3.0|Ok, so after having seen the movie and read all the glowing reviews, I got the book.  I'm commenting only on Tiffany's here, I haven't read the other stories yet.<br /><br />Sorry, it just didn't do that much for me.  It was ok.  It wasn't nearly as different from the movie as I expected from the reviews, albeit there were some differences.  The writing was skillful in that it was pretty enjoyable to read and did keep you wanting to read the next \\"chapter\\" to find out what happens next.<br /><br />But in the end, to me it came across as more of a character study than a story.  While there were some events, there really didn't seem to be a coherent overall plot.<br /><br />And to be honest, I still don't really understand the main character.  I don't know what this whole \\"cafe society\\" thing is, or how she was able to hang out with all these rich people or even how she made her income.  I've read here that she was a former starlet, but what I read was that she was an almost-but-not-quite starlet, who bailed before her first big chance.  So what fame could she possibly have in New York?  Guys giving her $50 (which would have to be like $500 today) to go to the ladies room?  Huh?  On what planet?<br /><br />I've heard it suggested that she was a prostitute, but I didn't get that from the book at all.  She says she's only had eleven lovers.<br /><br />I suspect that I'm just too out of synch with the time period to get what's going on.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I don't know anything about a existence of a 4 disc version but if there is one I would be highly mad cause I thought the 3 disc version was the only one existing and I purchased it at Wal-Mart for $20. The only thing that I'm going to say about this set because everyone else would have said things that I would say so I don't want to repeat and sound like a parakeet. The only thing besides the set being great and \\"It's about time!\\" kinda thing worth waiting for is that on the original dvd release, the entire 3 hours and 24 mins. of the film is on one dvd.  <br /> <br />With the 3 disc version, on the first 2 dvds the movie is split into 2 one and a half hour parts. That means after the first hour and a half on disc 1 you will have to switch the disc and put it disc 2 to continue watching the movie. This makes me mad. I will have to keep the original release just so I can watch it uninterupted when I feel like it.  <br /> <br />Why can't they put the special features from disc 1 and 2 onto a disc of it's own? You know disc 1 the movie with commentaries. Disc 2 and 3 with the special features? Oh well it's great to own something like this even though switching the disc is a pain in the rear! :)
B0009NCQJ6|1.0|I love their music and would give it a rating of 5.  Unfortunately, they use some sort of evil copy protection that prevents me from playing this on a computer.  One thing that I like to do is make copies of my CDs so that I can play them in my car without worrying about it getting destroyed.  Or of course keep mix cd's of favorite songs, etc.  I'm really dissapointed that a band this cool would use such a bastard technology.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|People have told me that you have to see this movie twice to really like it and that you should see it with other people who like it. I've done both a few times and I still dislike this movie. It is dull, slow paced, and pointless. There are moments that are funny, but they aren't really funny, worth maybe a \\"ha\\", but no more than \\"haha\\", if that makes sense. I guess I can see that some people would find this type of movie entertaining, but personally, it left me wondering why I had wasted my time on it.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Ah yes, Aqualung. Out of the eleven or so Tull albums I own, this is my favorite. It's just a flat-out amazing record. For instance, listen to the title track, a four-part suite about a perverted hobo. Several changes of tempo and mood are featured. Within the song's six-and-a-half minutes, it jumps from hard rock to acoustic-driven to one of the best guitar solos ever...amazing. Then there's Cross-Eyed Mary, another centerpiece of this album. Though not as complex as Aqualung, it does start with a great flute solo and shows off Martin Barre's skills. Then there's Cheap Day Return, which is a good track but way too short! Mother Goose has a nursery-rhyme feel, but they somehow pull it off. (Perhaps it's that line about a scarecrow stealing a raincoat from a snowman). In Up to Me, they showcase the dark humor that would make up a major part of Thick As a Brick. After that comes the anti-organized-religion side, starting off with the epic My God. What a song! Same with Hymn 43, musically the closest to traditional rock this album comes. After that comes the highlight of side two, Locomotive Breath, building from a quiet piano introduction to driving. Another great song is Wind Up, the story of a young boy who is dragged to Sunday School though he knows that the teachers have the wrong view of God. Has a lot of meaning to me.<br />Should be in your record collection.
0064407667|4.0|This book is so gloomy and pessimistic that it's absurd.  Seriously, though, I think it's a good introduction to children of the concept that not all stories have happy endings.  In real life, optimism is not always warranted.  This is a fact that some of our political leaders today would do well to learn.

B000A6T1JU|2.0|A great cult classic destroyed by a terrible directors cut.  The comic book scene intercuts are ridiculous.  Anyone who watches this version first, instead of the original, will wonder what the fuss is about.  <br /> <br />The documentary is worth it though.  Most of the main characters cooperate with interviews.  Don't let the box fool you:  it says there are 4 featurettes.  THERE IS ONLY ONE, THEY DIVIDE IT INTO 4 PARTS.  But it is worth the low purchase price.  Keep (or get) the original version for watching the movie, but get this one only if you are a huge Warriors fan.  The (one) documentary is enjoyable.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Like many who are reading this review, I am an avid fan of horror movies, and John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" was probably my biggest reason for becoming a fan of the genre. From the first time I saw this one, up until every time I view it now, \\"Halloween\\" still remains one of my favorite horror movies, and there's a lot of reasons why. The chilling moments, the haunting sountrack, the camera angles, and the visual effects are some of the best and most effective I've ever seen, especially for not being on a large budget. Michael Myers is still one of the scariest characters to have ever been created, and this is no doubt his shining role. While the series would become plagued with a slew of inferior sequels, the original remains a testament of time, and proves that good movies are indeed timeless.<br /><br />There's many things about this movie that make it special. This was before the time of big body counts, and extremely graphic death scenes, so a lot of the movie's scary feel relies on its suspense building, and its intense moments. Michael Myers is the perfect villain; he's cold and heartless, showing virtually no emotions at all, has no sympathy for his victims no matter what twisted or grotesque things he may do to them, and is unnaturally unstoppable due to the \\"curse\\" that has been placed upon him. The story is fairly simple: Meyers has escaped from the mental institution he was being held in after killing his older sister when he was a child, and he is now out to kill his remaining sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), who ironically is unaware that she and Michael are related. For much of the movie Meyers pretty much lurks in the shadows, making his appearances and killings that much more horrifying. Curtis is the perfect heroine for the movie, and can hold her own when it comes to tackling Michael. Although the story and the characters and somewhat simple, the direction and writing makes the movie one of the best that the genre has ever offered. There's moments when you want to cry out to the characters \\"Watch Out!\\" or \\"No!\\" making you feel genuinely connected to the movie. When Myers creeps out of the darkness to attack his victims, or appears in the back of their car, you almost jump right out of your seat. The mix of horror and suspense is what really makes the movie golden. The ending of the movie is perfect when Donald Pleasence saves Curtis from Michael Myers, by shooting him through the upstairs window of a house, only to look down and see that Meyers is gone, leaving you with a chilling feeling that this is not over. While the later sequels would become less focused, \\"Halloween\\" truly combines the right amounts of horror and suspense, and proves why it is still referred to as the series' shining moment.<br /><br />Every year at this time I just have to revisit this classic. There's been so many movies to come along in the time since this one was made, and it still seems that most fail to capture the magic that was there the first time I watched \\"Halloween\\". I don't really need to tell you, that if you're a fan of horror or suspense, then this is a movie that you should not only see, but own as well. With the perfect Villain, a good story, and a great cast of characters, \\"Halloween\\" may very well be the greatest horror movie ever created. Just in time for the holidays.'s moments when you want to cry out to the characters \\"Watch Out!\\" or \\"No!\\" making you feel genuinely connected to the movie.

B00008G9JO|3.0|Though it's not on par with Aqualung, Thick As a Brick, Benefit, A Passion Play or Stand Up, Heavy Horses is still a worthy Tull album. Mouse Police Never Sleeps is just plain weird, but still a good track. Acres Wild is enjoyable, nothing more and nothing less. The eight-minute putdown No Lullaby is a great track and one of my favorites, though I also like Moths. Journeyman, Rover and One Brown Mouse are all forgettable, but the title track (which is, of course, about horses) is my favorite on the album with some great flute playing by Ian Anderson. Weathercock, the closer, is forgettable.<br /><br />It's an OK album, but No Lullaby, Moth and Heavy Horses make it a must-buy for Tull fans.
B000001Y5X|5.0|Fat Man's review made me sick<br /><br />maybe he can listen to that mainstream bulls**t that Manson puts out now (Ex. \\"The Dope Show\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams\\")<br /><br />Manson now only puts out commercial crap for mass consumption<br /><br />so he can rip off people that know nothing about metal.<br /><br />he sold out long before Fat Man even heard of him.<br /><br />This is by far Manson's best work to date and pretty much the only Manson CD worth owning.<br /><br />BEST SONG : \\"Get Your Gunn\\"<br /><br />The kids from who shot up Columbine listened to it religously and you should too!!!
B00004RFFS|5.0|As an Anne Rice Freak, it would practically be a mortal sin not to comment on the all time best annerice-based movie of them all.  <br /> <br />i've watched this movie so many times, i practically know it by heart. i've been watching it for years. <br /> <br />louis, the reluctant vampire, drinks from a dirty little girl he finds in a broken down house sobbing over her dead mother. he's caught by his Maker and companion, Lestat De lioncourt -- <br /> <br />\\"my philospher, my martyr who'd never take a human life!\\" <br /> <br />-- and runs away, leaving the poor little girl for dead. <br /> <br />lestat, in his utter recklessness and disregard for the consequences of his actions, Makes the little girl into a vampire. <br /> <br />claudia, the child vampire, grows into a woman as the years pass but is trapped in the feeble body of a child. because she will never grow up, she burns with utter hatred for her vampire \\"fathers\\" and plans to kill the stronger one and make the weaker one her unknowing slave. <br /> <br />cluadia manages succesfully to cleverly murder (or atleast temporarily hinder) lestat and enslave an utterly devoted louis. even so, she meets her own sticky end in paris, at the hands of  the vampire we least expected. <br /> <br />kirsten dunst gives an outstanding performance. her adultlike demeanor is utterly convincing -- <br /> <br />\\"you are evil since you can not be evil! and i shall suffer for it no longer!\\" <br /> <br />while lestat's frequent comebacks are to die for -- <br /> <br />\\"i assume i need no introduction . .. louis, louis. . . still whinning, louis . . .have you heard enough? i've had to listen to that for centuries!\\" <br /> <br />
B00005JO0J|5.0|If you've never seen the Firefly series, I'm sorry. but the movie will be the door to a wonderful series that had way too short a lifespan on TV. For fans, it's the same wonderful series but glitz up by hollywood. The doc is bigger, Kaylee smaller, Jayne is smaller and Zoeys hair bigger. The costues have had futuristic touches added, but you won't be disappointed. You'll love it and buy it. <br />
076790592X|5.0|This book was honestly life changing for me.  It totally changed the way i view life, the road ahead and life here after.  At the begining of the book I was really confused.  But once you get reading, it all makes sense.  I was completely drawn to it.  I could not put it down!  I would reccomend this book to everyone, girl boy, man woman, it is just an all around fabulous book that everyone should have the chance to read.  Now I am looking forward to reading the next book, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\".
0385336810|4.0|I started with Kinsella's shopaholic series. This author is wonderful! You find yourself laughing out loud throughout.  <br />This book has that same light, silly style as the others.  <br />I hate summarizing a book & giving away the whole plot, so I won't even try. My only gripe was that Jack Harper, the American, did not sound really American. I realize the author is British, but I wished she's done her homework w/ American dialogue, as Jack sounds just like another Brit. <br />Reading Kinsella's novels is wonderful & great way to get your mind off your own hectic life & laugh out loud at the mishaps of another.  :) <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Very cheaply made, looked like it was made back in 1980. I was surprised to find out it was some time in 2004. The wacky acting made it hilarious. I recommend it to all of the people with a warped sense of humor. You'll laugh a lot.
B000B9EY2U|5.0|anyone who is a Depeche Mode fan should love this CD.  I skip a third of \\"Exciter\\" and a quarter of \\"Ultra\\" and only one song off \\"Playing the Angel\\" (the instrumental \\"Introspectre\\").  This is the best Depeche Mode CD to come down the pike since the 90's.  Some reviewers complain this is a rehash of old sounds.  Isn't that what made DM popular in the 80's and 90's?  If they totally changed direction, people would complain it was too different.  I like the \\"old sounds.\\"  I was able to listen to the whole CD through an AOL listening party.  I loved it immediately and couldn't believe some of the reviews I read here.  If you are a fan, go buy this CD.  I drove 30 minutes out of my way last Sunday the 23rd of October to go get this because my local Best Buy didn't have it.  Target had the single CD, but I wanted the DVD as well with the \\"Precious\\" video and other features.  It was well worth the trip and I'm not tired of it yet after six days of constant listening.  If this is the last CD the boys put out, I would die happy.
B00005YT8U|5.0|Do you have any idea how long I have been looking for a recording of \\"I Know My Love?\\"  Try five years!!  When I was in Ireland on tour in 2000, I heard that hauntingly beautiful love song and tried to find it over there.  I can't believe that while I looked everywhere over in the UK, I am now finding it five years later, long after giving up, on the Internet!  And what a beautiful interpretation it is too.  I wouldn't have expected anything less from the mighty Cheiftains...
B00008OLIC|5.0|MOTLEY CRUE-DR.FEELGOOD is in my opionion the crue's best album, because every song on there is outstanding! This album is like  the cream of the crop of all the albums of that time in 1989, and that was the peak of hair metal era, and this album stood out above the rest. This cd here is more than just a cd with songs on it, its like a soundtrack of my life back in the late 80's early 90's.  I remember being a kid riding my bike with my friends to the billards to shoot pool with the high school guys with all of them having long hair down there backs wearing there SKID ROW shirts and some with BATMAN shirts{big movie that summer'89}.  Every time i hear the begining of track 2:Dr. Feelgood- it reminds me of the jukebox in that billards, and track 5:Kick start my heart-i use to listen to that before my little league baseball games to get me going i think that song could fire up a nursing home its such a in your face song with lots of adrenaline,and track 6:without you- great ballad i remember hearing that at my school dances.  If you are like me and enjoyed the simple times of the late 80's and remember great music i would recomend purchasing this album!
079284131X|1.0|ok this movie way to stupid i mean a killer doll thats got to be the stupidest idea ever im a huge horror fan such as a nightmare on elm street, friday the thirteenth,etc...... But this movie is nit scary at all its actually quite funny to laugh at the way this movie is so cheesy i cant belive all the sequels i mean a killer doll. stay away from this crap and go buy a nightmare on elm street.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|Writing reviews isn't an activity I generally partake in but this collection of songs from the long time icon is something to shout about. His passion, creative vision and talent are nothing short of genius here. No need to waste your time with a song by song breakdown. Buy the disc and play it. Then play it again and again. It's brilliant.
0300108834|5.0|this relates history as if an older relative were sitting down and telling a child a story.  full of mysteries, adventures and surprises...beautifully written...
0307276902|5.0|Every once in a while a book comes along that sets new standards for writers and readers alike.  James Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is outstanding, a true masterpiece.  Tremendously engrossing...Brillant, heartbreaking and deeply moving...A gratifying saga of loss and redemption.  Vivid and unforgettable...  Brimming with love and hope.  So well done a reader might feel the people in the book are personal friends. Frey shines a light into the dim, ill defined corners of addiction and ultimately shines through strong enough to gather himself up and go on.  James Frey is a marvelous writer.  It's a hard book to read and to stop reading, and impossible to forget.
B000002IGP|5.0|OUT OF THE CELLAR probly one of the top 10 albums of the hair band era.  If you are new to RATT you look at them as a one hit wonder right? {round and round}, well purchase this album and listen to its entierity, and you will get an album that stands up to the music that your listening today on your local rock radio station, but a lot better!!  If you were a RATT fan back in the day, and your looking at this cd, and thinking \\" i use to have that tape/record 20 years ago\\" well my friend It sounds better than it did then because now you can compare it to bad music now{*see DISTURBED,THREE DAYS GRACE,SYSTEM OF THE DOWN*} its like a breath of fresh air hearing Stephen Pearcy on vocals, and Warren DeMartinni's guitar solos never sounded so better!  Also, like the great music they use to put out in the day bands use to go into the studio and put down 10 to 13 tracks on an album{out of the cellar has 10}and there where the bands best songs,now albums have 15 to 18 with one song being good. In Ratt's OUT OF THE CELLAR your getting 10 great songs.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|First and foremost, I must begin by saying that Gilmore Girls is the best television show I have seen in years. I must start with the cast. Lauren Graham couldn't be better for the role of the mother, Loralei Gilmore. And Rory wouldn't be Rory without Alexis Bledel's angelic appearance and amazing acting skills.  <br />Gilmore Girls is a story of a young mother and daughter who, surprisingly, are best friends. Rory is 16 and Loralei is 32 (Loralei dropped out of highschool at 16 when she became pregnant with Christopher's baby). At the beginning of the season, Loralei wants Rory to go Chilton, a Connecticut prep school. But the only way in is to pay the costly tuition, and the only way to get the money is to ask dear mom and dad for the loan, which means in return, you will have to meet with them for dinner every Friday evening. And that, my friend, is the last thing Loralei wants to do after sixteen years of freedom from her pushy, proper, rich, and conniving parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore. But Rory must go to Chilton. So Loralei must go to dinner. Over the season, you are introduced to more and more characters. Luke Danes, the diner guy who never takes his hat off and hardly ever says a word. But Luke would do anything for Loralei because he has a crush on her. Then there is Dean, Rory's first boyfriend. Ahh, first love. Dean thinks nothing but of Rory and would do anything for her. Next is Lane Kim, Rory's best friend. Lane is Korean and her mother is very religious and strict. Which means, but of course, a lot of sneaking around. Then, there's Sookie St. James, best friend and coworker of Loralei. Sookie is bubbly, funny, and the world's best chef. Then comes Jackson, Sookie's future husband, but for now, the vegetable guy who has a major crush on Sookie. And Sookie, poor thing, is clueless. Michelle is Loralei's french coworker at the Independence Inn. And most of the time, she would love to slap him. Miss Patty is the town gossiper, an old beauty who stillinstructs dance lessons and is a little over the top. But every town has one of those. Next up is Taylor, town mayor, owner of everything, and Luke's arch enemy. Then there's Kirk, the town geek who has a lot of strange ideas. Moving on to Rory's classmates, Paris Geller, the perfectionist who needs a therapist and would like nothing better than to take smart and pretty Rory down. Madelyn and Louise are her possy that think nothing but of fashion and have brains the size of peanuts. Then there's Tristan, the preppy, stuck up, school hottie who is dying for Rory, but Rory hates him. Oh the drama. But the best thing about Gilmore Girls is how all these characters come together with their wacky personalities and create a bond. Stars Hollow is really the perfect, ideal small town filled with busy bodys. But that's to be expected. Loralei and Rory have an unexplainable bond and work perfectly together. Loralei's witty sense of humor ties it all together. With a brilliant cast, a brilliant writer, and a brilliant director, Gilmore Girls is everything you could hope for in a TV show. It's warm, funny, and sweet. It's one of a kind. And I hope this review has persuaded you to buy this season, because you're really missing out on something if you don't. This is a classic that you will never forget.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This three-disc rendition of the books is absolutely spot on!  Sir Ian Richardson is ideally cast and the supporting actors are without exception ideally cast. <br />Especially conniving and sly and arrogant is Urquharts wife who, in effect, is replaying the role of Lady Macbeth that she did in the film by Roman Polanski.  She is the true power behind the throne and has even more balls and a treacherous nature than her husband - but is this not always so. <br /> <br />This set is a joy to watch and althought some of the parliamentary procedures may be baffling and arcane to many Americans - but not we Canadians, since we also have a parliamentary and constitutional monarchy - the machinations and backroom backstabbing is breathtaking in its savagery and complete lack of moral fibre and conscience.  But then, most politicians are snakes, and that is giving snakes a bad name to be compared to snivelling, incompetent politicans who are mostly lawyers and all that that profession implies. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for its biting satire, sly screenplay, and exemplary acting. <br /> <br />Timothy Wingate  OTTAWA  CANADA
B000BBOUU4|5.0|<br />By creating a beautifully crafted town with a mysterious chocolate factory at one end of the town and the struggling Bucket family living in a shabby, tilted and weather beaten house at the other end, the audience was treated to a wonderful journey.  <br /> <br />The chocolate bar making at the factory in the opening credits was a great animation sequence, especially the wrapping of the bars by the robotic hands. Don't enter the cinema late!  <br /> <br />While the Bucket family was deprived from food and material comforts, it was more than made up for by the love and attention among the son, parents and 4 grandparents. Charlie's quest for one of the five golden tickets to the chocolate factory was never smooth and easy. His heart (so did the audience's) sank lower each time the news announced another ticket found elsewhere and he himself unwrapped another ticketless bar. The atmosphere was intense when Charlie's grandparent sent him to buy one more bar with his own last coin. When the screen darkened as the grandfather closed his eyes, the audience suspected that the grandfather was just gone for good. Not so, fortunately.  <br /> <br />The second part of the movie took us to watch how the rich kids, succumbed to temptations (gluttony, spoiledness, competitveness, TV game addiction), were eliminated one after another (reality show?). In the nut sorting room, when the innocent looking squirrels, sensing the threat of the approaching girl, stopped their nut-cracking and prepared for attack, gave people the creeps.  <br /> <br />Charlie's grandparents and parents, with their big screen shots, have displayed their love of Charlie well. But it was Freddie Highmore who was a natural. He portrayed the young and determined Charlie who would not give up his family for anything else. Johnny Depp, with his sinister look every now and then when he detected the unlovable traits of the \\"sophisticated\\" children, built up an unpredictable and secretive air around him.  <br/> <br />The inside of the factory was richly imagined and luxuriously decorated, from a food paradise of luscious colours to top of the notch invention room and flying elevator. The movie succeeded in placing that the people at the centre, they were never dwarfed nor sidetracked by the special effects and the colorful props.  <br /> <br />Does the movie appeal to the child side in every person? Absolutely. Does the film appeal to the adult side in every one? To some extent. Yes. A delightful movie with a heart this is.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNJV|2.0|I liked this movie and I'm a big fan of widescreen, but I was very dissapointed that this version did not contain any bonus features, except for a theatrical trailer.  No \\"making of\\", no actor bio's, no commentaries, etc. Also, this version does not contain a scene index. The only inserts are a symantec software rebate coupon and a Batman collection catalog.  Very cheap packaging.  I'm surprised the case was plastic instead of cardboard!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite is probably the worst movie ever made. But somehow, it is the best. It is one of the rare movies that you will find that is not afraid to be totally, and completely stupid and that has no point whatsoever. But hey, I love it.    Napoleon Dynamite is not your typical highschool student. He is one of those freaks that you made fun of and thanked goodness that you weren't him. But the thing is, Napoleon is completely comfortable with himself and is confident enough to ask the most popular girl in school to play teather ball with him, even though she declined, of course.  Napoleon's friends aren't too average either.  Let's begin with Pedro (finally, the reason for the endless Vote for Pedro t-shirts). Pedro is the new kid. He's spanish and for some reason, he's kinda popular. He is ready to find a date to the dance and actually gets one. He also decides to run for Class President. And wins.  Then there's Deb. The girl Napoleon meets when she shows up on his doorstep selling keychains and Glamour Shots. She's shy and really weird. And she drinks two percent (even when Napoleon says she could drink whole if she wanted). And guess what? Napoleon is in love with her.  Next up is Uncle Rico. He has problems. And lots of them. He gets crazy business ideas and will do anything to get them to sell. Including dragging poor Napoleon along with him.  And then there's Kip. Kip has been chatting online with babes ALL day. And he's found his soul mate, LaFonda (who happens to be a chubby black woman). But hey, we all have our types.   This movie takes place back in the 80's (which I was not alive during so I have no clue what they're talking about). The humor is not presented in an intentional way, but it still gets laughs. This movie has no point or plot. It just kind of goes on and on and on. And the first time you watch it, you will HATE it. But the second time it's completely hilarious. Just don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it. The actors do a goodjob acting like mindless idiots and you'll love learning the one-liners that Napoleon is famous for. Just check it out. So what if it's a complete waste of your time? It's too stupid to miss out on.
B000B5QWKG|5.0|Wow.... This band can be easily compared to as the Beatles: a tight show, very clean, and makes the girls swoon, eh? <br /> <br />Well, Franz outdoes themselves with this anthemic album.  People say the 2nd album is the most important, and they keep their place in our hearts with this master piece. <br /> <br />The opening track: \\"Fallen\\" is my absolute favorite Franz Ferdinand song.  It's anthemic, bawdy, and a hell of a lot of fun to sing along to.  Oh, did I mention that it makes a good point by saying that \\"The fallen are the virtuous among us\\"?  Well, It does.  This is a great song, but doesn't hold it's own as a single. <br /> <br />Then we have an actual single: \\"Do You Want To\\", though the lyrics are sexually suggestive, overall this is a very good.... yet catchy... song.  Makes an awesome single...  Plus the video is great. <br /> <br />The following song is also good, but not as good as the preceding two. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Walk Away\\" is the album's 2nd single, and a very good one at that.  Catchy, pointless, and again, a hell of a lot of fun to play airguitar to.  A good song overall. <br /> <br />The rest of the album speaks for itself.  It's not worth mentioning, so I'd suggest that if you don't want to buy it all, go to iTunes and purchase at least \\"The Fallen,\\" \\"Do You Want To,\\" \\"This Boy,\\" \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"What You Meant,\\" and \\"Outsiders.\\"  Those would be the best, but there's not a bad song on this album.  Very good overall.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|Dream Theater has always been a love/hate experience for me, I've listened to everything they have to offer, I've winced, moaned, headbanged, praised, glorified...Every DT release is a new experience, and for an experience, this was no exception.<br /><br />I found their previous release `Train Of Thought' quite simply dull, it had its moments, but I really couldn't be bothered waiting through passages of instrument masturbation to hear them. They got it out of their system though, and predictably on `Octavarium' went for a simpler approach, 7 relatively straightforward prog rock songs and one grandiose 20+minute piece. Despite actually writing `songs' as opposed to long overblown jams, this album wasn't really much of a step forward for DT.<br /><br />The opener `Root Of All Evil', the new Portnoy multi-album medley, is distinctly average for a DT rock song. The riff is monotonous, never expanding or venturing into anything interesting, and the chorus is rather lame. The section that goes back to `This Dying Soul' is actually nicely done and works well, but finishes all too quickly reverting back to the relentlessly dull main theme. The slower songs, `I Walk Beside You' and the `Answer Lies Within' are syrupy tripe, reminiscent of poor melodramatic 80's pop ballads. `Panic Attack' and `Never Enough' are Muse-come-prog, I really don't understand the thinking behind this, the riff is undeniably Muse-esque and LaBrie even sounds similar to the Muse singer in places. I cannot comprehend why DT would do this, does absolutely nothing for me. `Sacrificed Sons' and `Octavarium' somewhat save the album, the latter is a stunning epic piece that combines both strong melody and good instrumentation, and on its own stopped me from completely slating this album.<br /><br />Overall only the title track is DT at top gear, the rest is simply half hearted.
B000000LZV|5.0|Like many people, I can't stand what the media tries to pass off as punk rock nowadays.  The scene with the tattoos, whiny vocals with faux-British accents (yes Billie Joe Armstrong - I'm referring to you- you can stop hiding behind the tour bus), the refried two-chord riffs, the hypocritical anti-corporate stances, and the cheap looking Hot Topic clothes would be comical if it weren't so annoying.  While punk rock really isn't my cup of tea, I respect the pioneers like The Clash, Husker Du, and The Damned.  And then there were The Minutemen who took not only punk rock, but all of rock music to a whole new level.<br /><br />San Pedro, California's Minutemen were fronted by a chubby, sloppy, and very average looking singer/guitarist named D. Boon (1958-1985).  Boon was not the most refined singer in the world, yet his confident, assertive vocals made it easy to overlook his imperfections.  He had an interesting guitar approach because he would completely turn down the bass and mid-range frequencies on his amplifiers and only use treble.  He lacked the precision and speed of an Yngwie Malmsteen or a Joe Satriani, but his playing was much more fun to listen to.  Boon's childhood pal Mike Watt handled bass with such skill that he sounded far more like Jaco Pastorius than Sid Vicious.  Rounding out the trio was drummer George Hurley, a man who could do astonishing things with a small drumkit.  The Minutemen were fortunate to have not one, not two, but three very gifted musicians within its ranks.<br /><br />1984's _Double Nickels on the Dime_  clocks in at a whopping 74 minutes with 43 tracks.  It defied the convention of both mainstream music and punk rock with it's attitude and experimentation.  Just about everything is on here you can imagine: jazz, country, folk, blues, funk, Egyptian-style rock, spoken word poetry, psychedelia, and covers of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Don't Look Now\\" and Steely Dan's \\"Dr. Wu\\".  On earlier pressings was a cover of Van Halen's \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\".  Unlike many punk bands who do ironic covers of bands they feel contempt for, The Minutemen loved the groups they covered.<br /><br />There is very little that I can say about _DNotD_ that has not been said already.  But in closing I will say that _DNotD_ is one of those albums that has something for ALL rock fans.  Punk fans will love it for its attitude and social commentary.  Progressive rockers may love it for its musicianship and experimentation.  Classic rockers will appreciate the Minutemen's respect for the past, and the pure nostalgic value.  I'm not going to cry about what would have happened had Boon survived.  Instead, I only wish to extend my gratitude for there being _DNotD_.  Thanks guys.s \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\".

B000AM6OQ2|4.0|This vintage John Carpenter film was made in collaboration with Debra Hill, who with Carpenter was responsible for the runaway success of \\"Halloween\\". When \\"The Fog\\" was first released some twenty-five years ago, it was met with a fairly lukewarm reception. It has since gone on to achieve some acclaim, though it has never reached the heights of commercial success touched upon by \\"Halloween\\", though, then again, few films have.<br /><br />\\"The Fog\\" is a highly atmospheric ghost story. The ghosts manifest themselves on the stroke of midnight, as the fishing village of Antonio Bay gets ready to celebrate its centennial. As the midnight hour rolls in, so does an unearthly fog that begins to engulf the whole town. It is a fog that enshrouds of the ghosts of those whose ship was lured to the rocky coast, only to find itself dashed to bits on the rocks, causing all aboard to plummet to the nether regions of Davy Jones' locker. These ghosts are now hell bent on seeking revenge for their fate on the inhabitants of Antonio bay.<br /><br />The special effects in the film are excellent, as is the musical score composed by none other than John Carpenter himself. This is for the most part a subtle, creepy film, highlighted by a stellar cast. If you are looking for a blood and gore slasher film, this is not the film for you. If, however, you enjoy a terse, tightly written script, as well as a pulse pounding musical score, then you will enjoy this highly atmospheric, ghost story.<br /><br />I originally saw this film in the theatre when it was first released and still remember the effectiveness of the fog rolling across the huge silver screen and the pulse pounding, musical score, which was such an excellent accompaniment to the film. Time has not diminished its power.
0345440900|1.0|I would not recommend this book. Her \\"sensible sleep\\" philosophy claims to be a gentler approach to the cry-it-out method of teaching your baby to fall asleep on her own. You are allowed to comfort your baby when she cries but only to the point of comfort and must place her back in her crib to work it out on her own.  If she cries again you pick her up again. The author claims to have had to do this picking up and putting down over a hundred times in one night with some babies. <br /> <br />I was desperate for a solution to my daughter's sleep issues and tried this method. Besides nearly breaking my back with all the picking up and putting down it taught my daughter that to stay in my arms all she had to do was to non-stop cry! She was inconsolible b/c she knew if she stopped she would end up in her crib.  <br /> <br />I would have preferred to just let her cry it out if it was going to strip my ability to soothe her. It would have been less traumatic. Plus when she finally fell asleep she would wake every hour to find herself in her crib and do guess what?...That's right...cry! A total nightmare. <br /> <br />Also her views on breastfeeding are a bit uninformed (she claims it's just a trend on pg. 96) and a lot of her advice is common sense. Don't bother. Your instincts are a better guide.
B00006IU73|5.0|I really enjoy listening to Porcupine Tree's music. It's fresh and exciting and manages to retain the prog elements of old. \\"In Absentia\\" is simply one of the best modern era prog albums around, topping any of the bands previous efforts. This is mostly due to a new approach, predominantly in the riff department, creating an exciting edge to the music, thanks to help from prog metal heavyweights Opeth.<br /><br />The new edge is evident after 20 seconds when the main riff of \\"Blackest Eyes\\" rips through your sound system. I was instantly hooked. This combined with the archetypal Porcupine Tree soft and melodic passage make the opener one of the highlights of the album. \\"Trains\\" is a typically lush PT melodic pop song, and is nailed to perfection. Everything is spot on, especially the great guitar textures and soothing vocals. \\"The Sound Of Muzak\\" is an interesting piece and unlike anything else on the album, it fuses off-beat drumming with lovely stylistic guitar playing, and a sumptuous chorus with poignant lyrics about today's music industry. \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" and \\"Wedding Nails\\" are the best examples of the new Opeth inspired guitar playing, the former being a moody progressive piece that slowly churns and builds to its flooring guitar based climax. The latter is a metal instrumental that's sure to get your toes tapping. \\"Strip The Soul\\" and \\"The Creater Has A Masterpiece\\" are of the same style, but in between the two is the defining moment on the album, the beautiful \\"Heartattack In A Layby\\", PT's most emotional piece to date.<br /><br />Overall this is essential modern era prog, highly recommended for fans of the genre.
B0001CNRSE|1.0|This movie was not about hip-hop. Don't believe the hype. Jessica was nice to look at but the dancing was weak. Lil Romeo can not and I reapeat can not dance. If he was to come to the streets with that wack little shoulder move he would get kicked off the block. But he's just a kid you might say... so what!  Rent a copy of the freshest kids if you want to see what some kids called the Rocksteady Crew did when they we're just kids and you'll see what I mean when I say his moves were garbage.  Secondly the script sucked and plot was ripped straight out of breakin' 2 electric bugaloo with a pinch of flashdance.    P.S. You can't learn HipHop either its in you or it ain't
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I am not one of those detractors of the last cycle of \\"Batman\\" films.  For those too young to remember Tim Burton, the director of \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\", was a young visionary filmmaker and his offerings in the series reflected his comic-goth outlook.  Joel Schumacher, the director of \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman and Robin\\", took a campier approach to the character.  While Schumacher's films were entertaining there wasn't much artistry to them.  Also, these films were geared towards casting movie stars instead of actors appropriate to their roles.  For instance, Jack Nicholson, who played the Joker in the first installment(and was quite good), received top billing over Michael Keaton as Batman.  The makers of this film probably took their cues from Sam Raimi in how he cast his \\"Spider-Man\\" films.  Though Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, or Alfred Molina would be considered household names they were the right actors for the roles and that contributed to the success of Raimi's films.  Warner Brothers must have taken notice because they hired a director, Christopher Nolan, whose previous work, \\"Memento\\" and \\"Insomnia\\", were critical successes but hardly blockbusters.  Where he departs from the previous \\"Batman\\" films is that the emphasis is on Batman and not on the \\"guest villains\\".  Christian Bale is the perfect choice for the conflicted Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Bale, aside from his impressive physique, expertly displays the torment of a man who loathes injustice but has to skirt the fine line between crusader and vigilante.  An example at how well cast a film this is Cillian Murphy, who is excellent as the Scarecrow, isn't the most interesting secondary character.  That plaudit goes to Liam Neeson as Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor in Tibet.  Ducard is by no means a cardboard character rather a complex one who loathes the criminal element but differs from Bruce ever so slightly in combating it.  Michael Caine, born to play Alfred the butler when he reached a certain age(Michael Gough, you were fab in the first four).  Lastly, I refuse to be fashionable and diss Katie Holmes as Bruce's love interest.  Katie, you were great.
0743454537|4.0|This book has a great premise: How much pain and risk can you subject one child to in order to save the other, and should you do it at all? This book was probably inspired by the story of Anissa Ayala, a teenager who, a few years ago, was suffering from leukemia, and in need of a bone marrow transplant. Her parents conceived another child for the sole purpose of trying to get a donor match [it was successful, and the younger child appears well-adjusted and loved.] <br /> <br />This book explores the question of what happens if the parents have to return again and again to the second child, subjecting her to endless and ever more risky procedures. It also indirectly addresses an issue few family novels tackle: that it is possible, and probably common, to love one child more than the other. <br /> <br />I found the book absorbing, and read it quickly, so I would recommend it, but would probably give it 3 and 1/2 stars if I could. First, without giving too much away, I agree with earlier reviewers that the ending felt like a cheat.  <br /> <br />Second, this author's books usually use the somewhat gimmicky method of switching back and forth in each chapter between the viewpoints of various characters. While that was interesting in the first book of hers I read, it gets a bit old after a while. It seems like some kind of a cheat. <br /> <br />Usually, in good writing, you are able to determine what a character is like by their actions. For example, a movie character would not turn to the camera and say, \\"I am selfish, and my motivation for doing what I am doing is thus and such.\\" You can figure that out yourself by observing them. So, this method of writing [telling you exactly what each character is thinking at a given time] seems like a cheap shortcut to me. <br /> <br />On the other hand, this author's prose is very well written, and her books, including this one, are enjoyable.  <br /> <br />On the whole, I would recommend this book for its interesting handling of atimely topic. It's a fast and entertaining read.

0321200683|5.0|This is the second pattern book (after Core J2EE Patterns) since I started reading and using patterns. I did read about high-level  GoF but I was always skeptical about ready to use inline with a programming language like Java or VB. This book is another best example yet of where patterns can really improve your application design. Applications don't miraculously integrate with one another; it needs some architecture ideas and practical experience. This book helps to demonstrate some of those ideas as patterns in action. The descriptions of the problems and their possible solutions... just helps to simplifying and resolving the design problem.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|It sounds almost like Clapton woke up in the 70s when he made this album. And not the 70s according to Eric Clapton and Cream, but the lame stereotypical 70s. I love much of his stuff, but this? Not so much.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|In the last several months, I've been sampling a smorgasbord of musical genres from the sixties and seventies. I was a student then - so, I lacked the financial resources to acquire or play much of anything. If I should have made only one purchase, it would have been this recording. These words...this music, remain(s) so on-target, that I simply can't stop listening to it. I think that Bob Dylan continues to be an extraordinary artist devoted to his own personal expression and musical evolution - not the (social) movement.

A certain orchestral version of an early Stones hit \\"The Last Time\\" contained a riff similar to something heard in \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\" (in fact, if you listen to the opening line of the Stones song, \\"Well I told you once and I told you twice\\" it does sound similar to the opening line of \\"Symphony\\").  An early manager of the Stones successfully sued, gained rights to the song, sold it to Nike for a commercial, which caused Richard Ashcroft to spiral into depression, resulting in the break-up of The Verve.  My guess about the circumstances of the band's demise, though, has more to do with Ashcroft assuming full command, especially over the lead guitarist Nick McCabe, who clearly had more influence over the first album, \\"A Storm in Heaven.\\" <br /> <br />In any event, \\"Urban Hymns\\" is the best of The Verve's three albums, and deserved all if its considerable critical acclaim.  While I'm not crazy about every song, I, of course, love \\"Symphony\\" (who really cares about the litigation thing?).  However, my favorite part of the album are three consecutive songs that I think should be considered a trilogy: \\"Space and Time,\\" \\"Weeping Willow,\\" and \\"Lucky Man.\\"  The choruses of each are probably the most powerful writing Richard Ashcroft has ever done. <br /> <br />One thing you may notice (which usually bodes poorly for any band's surivival) is the change in the songwriting credits.  On The Verve's first two albums, each song is credited to the entire band.  However, all of a sudden, on \\"Urban Hymns,\\" most are credited to Richard Ashcroft.  Something tells me that this may have caused some resentment. <br /> <br />Of course, Ashcroft released two subsequent albums, but don't try to tell me that they are as good as what he did with his Verve bandmates.   <br />                 <br />
0812550706|5.0|As with all my reviews, I don't bother with plot summary--you get that with the publisher's info. Let me just tell you that this is a great novel. Yes, it is magnificently plotted with several climaxes that build in intensity throughout the book, but it also has, unlike many best-selling thrillers, believable and engaging characters that adolescents (and adults) can relate to and learn from. The military codes throughout the book seem authentic and the ethical dilemma presented at the end is excellent.     Most problems in life--whether between friends and spouses or countries--goes back to a problem in communicating. Card has hit this on the head in a \\"mythic\\" way that only SF can do. This rates as one of the best SF novels of all time.    I hear there's a movie coming out. Do yourself a favor and read the novel first.
0385486804|4.0|Here the great adventure journalist Jon Krakauer investigates the noteworthy case of Chris McCandless, an idealistic kid just out of college who hitchhiked around the country, gave all his possessions to charity, and decided to head for Alaska to live off the land, for the ultimate experience in communing with nature. He then hiked off into the mountains and starved to death, leading many critics to declare him either incompetent and unprepared for the real wilderness, or driven by an incomprehensible death wish. Krakauer finds that McCandless, while mixed up and inexperienced in some ways, was competent enough to survive in the wilderness, but was trapped by seasonal floodwaters in his Alaska hideout, and was possibly poisoned by local wild vegetables that were not listed as poisonous in a field guide to edible plants. Here we can see that a few minor mistakes, that were understandable, turned out to be tragic.<br /><br />There's a bit of trouble with this book however, in that the McCandless story just isn't robust enough for an entire lengthy volume. Krakauer has to fill things in with a lot of investigation into the mind and personality of the young McCandless, but this lengthy psychological analysis doesn't go anywhere conclusive. We find that McCandless, while more blindly driven and monomaniacal than most, wasn't that much more confused about life than others in his age group. To add to the filler, four entire chapters of this book (nearly one-quarter of the total length) are about other people who had earlier episodes similar to that of McCandless, including Krakauer himself. These are pretty good comparisons that show how young idealists are drawn to a rough life in the wilderness, but once again they do little to really flesh out the McCandless saga. This is still a very interesting and occasionally stirring book, but the story is better suited to the type of in-depth investigative magazine article in which Krakauer first got involved in this strange and tragic episode.

B000AADYYO|5.0|I have just gained a memory of a life time if I must say so myself. I saw Opeth live Oct. 26 at the House of Blues in Chicago, IL. I must tell you, they are completely solid. Mikael kerfeldt is a crazy beast of a man. There is not another musician alive today that is as great as him. He makes growling, singing, guitar soloes all look so easy.  <br />Nevermore was the supporting band at this gig. If you dont know who they are, buy their newest project \\"The Godless Endeavor\\". Your mind just might explode, in a good way. <br />Anyway, if your actually reading, this is what you wanted - The playlist of the concert. Cant remeber the exact order. Something like this.. <br /> <br />1) The Baying of the Hounds <br />2) When <br />3) In my Time of Need <br />4) Ghost of Perdition <br />5) Blackwater Park <br />6) The Grand Conjuration <br />7) Benighted <br />8) Deliverance <br />And the encore, which the crowd demanded. 9) Demon of the Fall <br /> <br />Im not going to go into anymore detail about the concert. Ya'll will have to see it for yourself. The US tour ends November 13th. Better get your tickets soon.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Demon days is Gorillaz 2nd album and it is truely kick ass! I am a huge Gorillaz fan, they are my life! I can say that their new album has a different sound to it from their first album (which I love to death! in my opinion i think it is better than demon days) To everyone who is reading my review right now, take my warning--do not bother reading other people's reviews that gave this album and their first album a one star rating. They are all just whinners and complainers and have absolutly no taste for good music. They just wanna see how many Gorillaz fans they can piss off out their on Amazon. \\"aww this stuff sucks!\\" \\"I HATE Gorillaz\\"....see what I'm talking about. How can you not like this cd? Dont be one of the stupid people....trust me, go out to your local music store (like sam goodys--thats where i got mine) buy this cd, slap it into your cd player or put the songs on your I-Pod, (which ever way works for you) and listen to it, you'll love it. The songs can cause you to dance (like DARE) so its fun to listen to. I am truely a mega Gorillaz fan--i have both of their cd, their dvd (which kicks ass, i cant stop watching it) and my aunt also bought me a shirt with 2D on it from hot topic up where she lives--which im gonna get soon.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I enjoyed several gut-busting laughs while watching this movie, just as I always do when watching South Park.     What makes Stone and Parker's humor so brilliant is the fact that they pull no punches when satirizing all aspects of human stupidity (of which there is no shortage), irrespective of political orientation.  That's the same strategy that made the original Saturday Night Live so hilarious.       Today's SNL, MAD TV, and virtually all other attempts at humor are pathetically unfunny because 1) those shows are nothing more than highly biased liberal propaganda, 2) they're hamstrung by Political Correctness, 3) the writers apparently aren't all that talented, and 4) liberals generally have a poorly developed sense of humor--their humor is usually nothing more than bitchy, smarmy sarcasm.      Now that The Simpsons have pretty much been compromised by the Dark Side, Stone and Parker seem to be this country's last great hope for genuinely funny, brilliant, and scathing satire.  I can't wait to see what they're going to do next.
B0000640VO|5.0|So many times, the underdog or oddball character in a movie is presented as cynical, dark, and misunderstood (think enid from ghost world.) And although you LOVE the oddball character, sometimes you find him or her hateful in most movies. Sometimes even you, cynical as hell, want to shout at this character, \\"Hey, life's not so bad.\\"  Amelie, on the other hand, is the most lovable oddball ever presented on screen.  You are always rooting for her, never doubting her judge of character. <br /> <br />Some people have written that this movie is too sweet.  But who hasn't felt the pang in your stomach when you have an attraction, or \\"affinity,\\" with someone?  Who hasn't struggled to tell someone they had a crush on that they were interested?  This movie perfectly captures the shyness that comes with confessing love. <br /> <br />This movie is about love, honesty, and finding yourself. You deserve all these things--and you deserve to see this movie.
B000099T2L|3.0|This is first solo important impression of lead singer of Destiny's Child and maybe one of the most caughtivaty woman on the era. This actrees singer just get the idea of take a break and see if she's really what people called her at. Breakin' through classic R&B hit lady she started her album with the overplayed Crazy In Love featuring Sweetheart bringin' up some hugh beat but if you realized the song is quite sizzlyn' and  buiblin' under the true potential of B. Then comes the DISCO with Naughty Girl usin' a sample of prohibid 'Love To Love Your Babe' The song keeps ahead and remarked a classic possitive vocal flat style. The song is kind of good except by some high notes that sound so annoyin'. Comin' ahead Jamaica sensation Sean Paul bring her dutty on Baby Boy where he smashes the mic on, the song released as sencond single isn't the same of the record. The record present a more unsexy Baby Boy and kind of caught into sexual healin'.  <br /> <br />If you were wondering what could possibly can brin Baby Boi to the record, it might be surprisin' gratificatin' and relaxin' Hip Hop Star the one that keep a singin' highlight and research old school joint. Now this last 4 songs are the only party songs like in this album. Then comes the ballad section on a constant and irritatin' cryin' game with higlights and big low fall. Be With You provides the highlight on this section bringin' back a cover song makin' B sound so authentic and providing something that we kind of see on regular DC's records. Me Myself and I marked the 3rd single and the ballad that keeps self respect as private message. Restricted by a possitive message and bringin' some ok lyric just make the song look good but not BRILLIANT.  <br /> <br />Yes sounds like a weak imitation of Ashanti makin' B sound so not her and personally bringin' some R&B prototype on the record. Then comes the sassy and maybe the worst song on the album, Missy did her thang really wrong on Signs makin' weak spassm... awful song dedicatin' to astrology. The song might be good for artists like Tweet or Mya but not to powerful B voice. The sexy Speechless open the door to a brand new woman on stage soundin' special (let's make sure that these sexy song if you don't sing them well you'll look like a hoe)  <br /> <br />Jay Z comes over to sing That's How You Like Ah! so weird song considerin' to childy but so bored at the same time. Dangerously In Love made the last statement as a performer (stealing the song of Survivor album) makin' look like DC is all about B. The song is thrillin' amazin'. Grammy Winner The Closer I Get To You performed with R.I.P. Luther Vandross make possitive ranges on the album with an outstanding performance makin' it right. Gift From Virgo and Daddy sound sazzy but message-full. Then comes international Austin' Hit - Work It Out and basicly biggest duet of her life 03' Boonie & Clyde.  <br /> <br />This album might won the Grammy but just don't stand up from other R&B albums like Ashanti or even Kelly Rowland's Simply Deep <br />.
B00006RINF|2.0|For some reason, I've heard that Lacuna Coil is similar the band Evanescence. And I've even heard that the female singer for Lacuna Coil has a better voice than Evanescence's Amy Lee. Out of curiousity, I decided to buy this CD and listen to it. I listened thouroughly through each and every single song. And guess what? It was an absoulte waste of my time and money. The male singer's voice sounds like it's dying in excruciating pain. However, the female singer sounded ok. But I must say that her voice sounds very typical and ordinary, unlike Amy Lee who has an amazing and unique voice.  <br /> <br />I don't understand why people would like Lacuna Coil over Evanescence. Evanescence is obviously A LOT MORE BETTER (not to mention a lot more succesful). But your opinion is your opinon.
B00008J4P5|5.0|First off I'd like to say don't listen to the people who said this is bad. People see jack's umm, \\"unique\\" features and meg's minimalistic drumming rythms as wierd and stupid. Not so. Meg's drumming is a personal style, just like the way Mick Jagger struts around and Slash's cig-smoking on stage. Different, yes, but stylistic imaging, nonetheless. It's an act. As for Jack, his singing and guitar playing are hard to describe until you se him live. Pretty crazy. His wailing vocals and bluesy/rock/underground-punk riffs and chords are worthy of prais. One thing that is kind of bizzare, (besides the whole red and white trippin out thing), is that Jack and Meg present themselves as brother and sister. Awhile back a marriage certificate surfaced on the internet. I am not sure whether it's real or not, but they still stick to the brother/sister thing. Whatever. I just like the music. I would highly reccomend this album and Get Behind Me Satan. I have not heard their older stuff, but I will getting it soon.  <br /> <br /> <br />                                           Happy Shopping! :)
B000B9EY2U|5.0|I'm a long-time DM fan from the early days and have followed their entire career, seen them multiple times in concert, etc. However, I've been a bit disappointed with their past two or three releases over the past five years or so, but this album easily makes up for it. It should please picky old-school fans such as myself as well as bring new ones to the group and genre. Simply put, it's beautiful, moving, and will haunt you even when you're not actively listening to it. This release sounds like they're back in the saddle, so to speak. It's been in my constant listening rotation since I purchased it a few days ago. A winner; great work guys!
B00005JNJV|3.0|I hated the first 4 Batman movies.  Thought they were all poorly written and filled with boring, non-stop action sequences. <br /> <br />Thus, I was reluctant to see this new one, even though some critics were calling it \\"the best movie of the year.\\" <br /> <br />Well, I just saw it and, whereas it is certainly the best Batman movie yet, anybody who thinks BATMAN BEGINS is even close to being  \\"the best movie of the year\\" should have his/her head examined. <br /> <br />Yes, the first half is pretty good...with Bruce Wayne finding his purpose and developing his alter ego.   <br /> <br />But, once he puts on the Batman suit.... <br /> <br />Here we go again: nonstop boring action sequences. <br /> <br />Maybe if the film was 20-30 minutes shorter, it might have worked better. <br /> <br />
B0009UC7H0|5.0|Seeing as how I have never read Clive Cussler - I will admit that I enjoyed Sahara.  It is great entertainment. <br /> <br />I got a better understanding of the movie after watching the commentaries and makings thereof. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the humor - the action - and the gorgeous color - so who is Dirk?  I didn't find too much wrong with him.  The voyage of the Ironclad was a bit far fetched but enjoyable as a hunt - I surely would like to have seen some of that gold. <br /> <br />And no book ever gets translated perfectly into a movie.  Ah, well, we live to be entertained. <br /> <br />Enjoy it for what it is worth - It was a lot better than some of the far-fetched trash that the movie makers offer us. <br />Definitely recommended - <br />
B000B2YQX4|4.0|At least half of the Cd is worth listening to.  The music is not that different from what they've been doing in the past.  But that doesn't mean its bad either. \\"Precious\\" is catchy and current-sounding enough to attract teens to listen to it (take that as a compliment to the band I guess?).
B000000XB9|5.0|When it comes to greatest hits packages, it's hard to find one better than Creedence Clearwater Revival-Chronicle, Volume 1. Although their existence was brief, CCR's impact on popular music is undeniable. If you listen to a classic rock or oldies station for part of your day, it's virtually guaranteed you'll hear a song by CCR. Between 1969 and 1971, everything songwriter John Fogerty touched turned to gold as every song here was a bonafide hit with most of them hitting the Top 10. When it came to a memorable hook, John Fogerty was the Lennon/McCartney of American music. Despite never having a #1 hit (they had five songs go to #2), few bands could boast as timeless a catalogue as CCR and the proof is right here on Chronicle.<br /><br />The tracks here are listed chronologically with the band's biggest hits comprising most of the first half. \\"Proud Mary\\", \\"Bad Moon Rising\\", \\"Green River\\", \\"Who'll Stop The Rain\\", \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\", and \\"Down On The Corner\\" are were all huge hit singles and still sound great today. Once you hear these tracks, the melodies stay in your head forever. While these songs were all catchy pop singles under the 3:00 mark, there was also a diversity in Fogerty's work. Whether it was introspective ballads like \\"Someday Never Comes\\" and \\"Long As I Can See The Light\\", full-out rockers like \\"Commotion\\" and \\"Travelin' Band\\", or a great anti-war anthem in \\"Fortunate Son\\", Fogerty could do it all and do it well. Bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford stay firmly in the pocket while Tom Fogerty plays solid rhythm guitar throughout providing the perfect accompaniment. Other fantastic tracks include their psychedelic versions of the standards \\"Suzie Q\\" and \\"I Put A Spell On You\\", the country rock of \\"Lodi\\", the hard rock of \\"Hey Tonight\\", and the AOR staples \\"Up Around The Bend\\" and the 11-minute \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine.\\" Basically, you've heard all of these songs at one time or another. If there's one greatest hits album to own, this is it. Highest recommendation.it. Highest recommendation.
0767834739|4.0|well i have to admit they did a great job for a sequel to resident evil. <br />if your into resident evil or if you like action/horror flicks then this is a must see. <br />i enjoyed this movie they had more money to spend in making it compared to the first one. <br />in short this movie takes off where resident evil left off and shows a virus breakout onto the city of raccoon. <br />now i dont want to reveal to much ill try to keep it short so as i said above the virus was released due to the fact that umbrella scientist wanted to go back and reopen the hive to see what happen to the hive. <br />they underestimated the outbreak of the virus with in the hive which in turn they couldnt contain it and was released onto the city. <br />alice was awaken as well as nemisis an alternate plan of umbrella to see which is stronger and be more viable as a bio weapon. <br />that is about all i will say if i told the whole story you wouldnt want to see the movie. <br />the actors did a great job once again bringing it to life as well as some comedy in the movie as well. <br />i enjoyed this but i liked the original better anyway if you collect resident evil items then this is a must have as well as a must see. <br />i rated it a four star due to the fact that some of the special effects just didnt fit in place with the movie as well as they did what they could on making nemisis real but with todays technology i feel they couldve done better. <br />the pace of the movie is nonstop and the feel of the movie was great as well as the sounds effects were great also. <br />the other con to the movie was the film angle of the zombies or how should i put it they zipped them in and out persay its hard to describe once you see the movie youll know what i mean. <br />now the other con is the zombies themselves before i saw land of the dead i thought resident evil zombies were great and made perfect but when i saw land of the dead and george romero zombies well im sorry romero wins hands down. <br />i feel that they couldve done a better job with makeup and effects on the zombies but it looked like they spent alot on the lickers in the movie so that mightve put a crimp in there budget and they had to let some things go as far as in detail. <br />overall its a great movie and a must see and turn out the lights grab some popcorn get ready for some good fun.
B00005JLCE|5.0|This movie is so funny! A very underrated comedy that certainly deserves a dvd release!
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|where do i start well here goes im an avid ok im an fanatic fan of the series as well as owning all the books and video games as well as owning the movies. <br />great flick with a great story line from beginning to end and it doesnt leave anything out. <br />the story is about a corporation named umbrella doing bio weapons research without the public knowing about it. <br />the lab was under the city called raccoon city and the workers for umbrella live and work there. <br />then all of a sudden all the people that worked and live in the underground lab died due to the computer than supervised the lab went homicidal then umbrella sent in a special team to shut it down and force it to reboot and find out what happen. <br />thats all i will tell ya but that is the gist of the movie and i do want to mention a interesting fact that they made this movie on a seriously limited budget. <br />the special effects are great for what money they were allowed to spend as well as the actors did a heck of a job bringing it to life. <br />even if you never played the video game it is a must see movie and a must have. <br />if your a gamer like me the movie brings it home and does not disappoint in any fashion. <br />so in short great all around flick to own or rent and since it is halloween season great flick to spook ya so go out there rent and or buy it. <br />
B0001MDQ2G|3.0|I only have one real problem with this cd, but it is one that pervades throughout every song: there is way too much clean singing.  The singer has great black/death vox, but you only get to hear them for about thirty seconds at a time in between two minutes of crooning.  Other than that, the album is pretty good.  The music is great, even with some cheesy guitar work.  Some of the songs at the beginning of the cd are pretty driving, like Ocean's land, even with the dichotomy caused by the clean singing.  The normal singing that they do in foreign languages is good, too, but most of it is in English.  Still, this is a very solid cd, and if it weren't for my vocal bias I would have given it a much higher score.
B000002OVJ|5.0|You know, I used to hate live albums. I find that more often than not they're either badly-recorded tapes of shrieking teenagers, or myth-destroying documents of uninspired hacks churning out messy versions of badly-selected songs to cheerily indifferent audiences. Actually physically being at a concert is one thing. Listening to what went on there a year after the fact is another. For me, it's usually as pleasant as watching old men die.     I've had to revise that statement these days, though. Because hoo-boy, Live At Leeds is a live album like no other. I'm referring to the reissued, remastered version, which is more than twice as long as the original and three times the fun. No scratches, no muddy tapes, no annoyingly off-key harmonies, just 74 minutes of The Real Thing: gut-crunching metal leavened with delightfully well-written melodies and fantastic singing.     Simply put, ALL of the songs The Who perform here are just as good as their studio counterparts, and if we're talking about \\"A Quick One,\\" \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks,\\" or \\"Heaven And Hell\\" (and why shouldn't we be?) they blow their studio versions away. What's more, a bunch of early singles are covered here, and in commanding performances. They also take one track from each of their albums (bar Tommy, which was performed in its entirety that night, of course) and impress everyone with them: \\"My Generation\\" from My Generation, \\"A Quick One, While He's Away,\\" from A Quick One, and \\"Tattoo\\" from Sell Out.     But the true highlights are the covers, especially \\"Young Man Blues,\\" which first struck me as abrasive but now fairly slaps me upside the head with its obscene musical brilliance. Guitar, bass, drums, vocals, the whole deal! All perfect! This isn't helping much, is it? Well another interesting feature of the reissue of Leeds is the set of dialogues with which Roger & Pete engage the audience. Charming (especially when Pete ruefully recounts the chart history of The Who's early singles) and intriguing,they're just one more reason to enjoy this budget-priced chunk of plastic.     So yes, Virginia, there IS a live album worth buying, and it's Live At Leeds. The Who even learn to jam engagingly here (unlike on \\"Underture\\"), on the epic 14-minute take of \\"My Generation,\\" and the secret is, of course, variety. They do some really creative things here, as Townshend plays off the echo of his own guitar in the concert hall and they fly into pieces of Tommy here and there. It gets 4.5 stars out of 5 from me. Why only 4.5?    I'm deducting half a star because nobody needs to hear a 7 1/2 minute version of \\"Magic Bus.\\" Please.

B000007MVD|5.0|It bears noting that at the time this compilation was released, the Beatles were banned from the BBC.  Not because of any song content, mind you (as if), but because, if I remember the exact wording, they were \\"too boring.\\" This all changed soon enough, when a year later Beatlemania was revamped by the Anthology series and \\"Free As A Bird\\"/\\"Real Love\\" releases.<br /><br />But in the heyday of the sixties, the love affair between the Beeb and the boys from Liverpool was hot and heavy.  And mutually beneficial, no doubt.<br /><br />For those of us who love the \\"personal history\\" stuff of the Beatles story as well as the technical, which-riff-goes-where stuff, this set is a treasure trove.  Not only do we get to hear early interviews where Paul, George, Ringo, and even cheeky John still have butterflies in their stomachs, but despite the low-tech feel of the recordings, the energy of the songs recorded here is palpable.  In between the songs the lads chat with DJs and share Christmas and other holiday greetings. This gives us a glimpse, in part, into even the pre-\\"toppermost of the poppermost\\" days.<br /><br />My favorite songs on the collection feature George, and listening to them gave me further insight into the frustration he must have felt playing an undeserved \\"second fiddle\\" role to the Lennon-McCartney partnership.  His covers of \\"Young Blood\\", \\"Crying, Waiting, Hoping\\", \\"Nothin' Shakin'\\" are so fresh and spot on, to say nothing, of course, of \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\". Even though a Harrison original doesn't show up here, his musicianship and importance in the group comes through.<br /><br />\\"Nothin' Shakin'\\", by the way, a terrific rockabilly number,  is one of several unique recordings on this collection, along with songs such as Carl Perkin's \\"Glad All Over\\" (not to be confused with the Dave Clark number of the same name).<br /><br />A must for any serious Fab Four collection.
B00011CZRE|5.0|Seven surely is a Chilling Entertainer ! Even though there are no Brutalic Killings...The Aftermaths are very Brutal in their own way. This Movie showed that their are many ways to show Horrific Voilence. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman make a great team and are just superb in the Film. This Film was made for them, surely. <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey, even though in a very small role, delivers his finest performance to remember. No wonder he is one of the Greatest !  <br /> <br />This is surely a must buy and a perfect fit for your Dvd Collection. A Landmark in it's own way.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|WOW. I saw this film when it was released in theaters on Halloween of 2004. It had my attention from the opening scene where newcomer actor/writer Leigh Whannell is in the filthy bathroom with \\"The Princess Bride\\"'s Cary Elwes. Both are chained by the ankle and in a believable state of confusion. The ingenuity of the Jigsaw \\"serial\\" killer is remarkable. This is a man that teaches the morally wayward people that he kidnaps to appreciate the value of their own lifes by testing their survival of the fittest instinct. The film has wit and humor as well. The most memorable line for me was Leigh Whannell's \\"This is the most fun I've had without lubricant.\\" (referring to being chained and trapped in the bathroom with Jigsaw watching on the video camera). The gruesome scenes are rather intense, so those that have weak stomachs, watch out. Otherwise, grab a bowl of popcorn, cuddle with a blanket and a boyfriend (or girlfriend), and let the games begin!
0060931671|4.0|It's California, 1965, and Oedipa Maas, 28, a practical but restless woman married to a small-town DJ, discovers she has been made executor of the estate of Pierce Inverarity, a rich industrialist and her one-time lover. Confused but curious, she travels to San Narciso to carry out her duties. She soon begins to suspect she has stumbled upon a conspiracy - a vast, perhaps global-historical conspiracy that involves Inverarity, his lawyers, the employees of the Yoyodyne Corporation, and maybe even her husband and therapist. Haunted by a sense of impending revelation, Oedipa tries to penetrate the enigma, descending into an underworld of broken, lonely souls, cynical playwrights and mysterious booksellers; a shadowy \\"alternate America\\" where coincidences accumulate suspiciously and the postal system takes on a sinister cast. Is it coincidence or conspiracy? Or a giant hoax orchestrated by Inverarity for his posthumous amusement? As the mystery deepens, Oedipa edges perilously close to paranoia... Pynchon's slim volume has the density of a planet. This is the kind of book you will read several times in your life, and still won't exhaust its possibilities. On the most basic level, it can be read as an intellectual thriller. The narrative is consistent, the plot moves along rapidly, and the point of view remains stable. But a reading confined to this surface level does it little justice. Even forty years after publication it's still considered open to interpretation: some critics feel it is ultimately meaningless and impossible to interpret, while others have found it cohesive, and even ethically motivated. (One essay I've read even takes a \\"scientific\\" approach to the plot, finding secret meaning in the novel's probing of entropy, thermodynamics and information theory.) All, however, agree that this is a vital work and a postmodern classic. The book's description of signs that appear everywhere suggests two opposite poles that are equally terrifying: everything happens according to some grand system or conspiracy from which we are tantalizingly excluded, or everything happens out of pure chance. That's the semiotic nightmare Oedipa falls into, and it's the one we live in, too. If you like novels that challenge and stimulate your intellect rather than merely entertain, then this one's for you. Dan Brown fans need not apply.ccording to some grand system or conspiracy from which we are tantalizingly excluded, or everything happens out of pure chance.

B00005JMJG|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST JIM'S MOVIES!! <br />I ALREADY GOT THIS, BUY IT NOWWWWW!
0385507755|4.0|I loved the stream of consciousness writing style.  The much-used term of \\"gritty\\" is apt, and I didn't make it through one chapter without tearing up or feeling ill...which was actually refreshing.  This book leads you into places unthinkable, and at the very least, makes you grateful for what you have.  The author writes in a way that strikes you in the gut and between the eyes, continuously and unabashedly.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially younger people who need a slice of reality pertaining to extreme drug and alcohol addiction.
B000BISBDY|4.0|I recently wondered if we'd ever get a collection up through the American Recordings, and here it is. A single disc that collects songs from all phases of his career. I believe even a casual fan could easily think of another 21 tracks that might belong here, but this is arguably the best of the best. I won't bother with what's missing, because what's here is still so good. Included are early classics like \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"I Walk The Line\\" and \\"Big River\\". We also get a live \\"Boy Named Sue\\", \\"Man In Black\\", and \\"Highwayman\\" from that collaboration of talents. Finally after \\"The Wanderer\\" with U2, we get six of his most recent songs including \\"Rusty Cage\\" and \\"Hurt\\". So many wonderful tracks could have been chosen from the American Recordings albums, but I think these are roughly the best. An all-covers collection would also be a cool idea I think, even though those last few albums were fairly cover-heavy themselves. Bottom line is this, though it misses a few essential songs, \\"The Legend Of Johnny Cash\\" is perfect if you're looking for your first or only Cash collection.
B0002CHIJW|4.0|That scene alone will haunt many men if they choose to view it. It's done so disarmingly that you just stare in disbelief at what has just happened. Definitely the most memorable scene in the film. <br /> <br />As you will have gathered, this infamous film was banned by UK ( under the Video Nasties Act ) and Germany as well. It involves the story of an aspiring novelist Jennifer ( Camille Keaton ) who escapes the hustle and bustle of New York to try to finish her novel. All looks so peaceful and tranquil that you don't really expect anything to happen. But then things take a turn for the worse as Jennifer is gang raped not once, not twice but THREE times. It's awful to see this happen to anyone. The fact that she tries to crawl to her bedroom to phone the police only for her attackers to come back again and inflict more damage is just terrible. <br /> <br />Having said that you can really see the limitations of the actual \\" rape \\" scenes. They use some scenes again and again that you can easily catch out and it sometimes takes a little sting out of the actual scene. Don't get me wrong, the way the guys just won't let her go and get one of them to kill her is awful but you can see the limitations the director had in trying to film the scenes. <br /> <br />Jennifer somehow manages to survive these attacks which seems like a miracle given that she was spared being stabbed by the village idiot. Eventually he gets found out that he didn't stab her and is beaten up for not finishing off the job. <br /> <br />Later on she decides that the only course of action she can take is revenge. Some women might enjoy this aspect while others may feel that she's stooping to their level. Whatever your view, this part of the movie is where it really kicks into gear. First off the list is the village idiot and then the ringleader who, as I mentioned in first paragraph, suffers the most awful death of the lot. And then the final two sidekicks get knocked off as well.  <br /> <br />I suppose this film can be viewed as a feminist statement of revenge being a dish best served cold. The film certainly works despite the limitations of budget and the cut-back scenes between the gang-rapists. That being the only real fault of this film. The acting is pretty good for a horror movie. Camille Keaton portrays her role convincingly during the aftermath of the rape scene and the film in general. <br /> <br />This film is really hard to recommend. Most people will be disgusted that \\" this piece of trash ever existed \\" but for anyone who likes to watch a movie that has gained infamy and notoriety due to being a \\" Video Nasty \\" in Britain....then this is the movie for them. But even then I don't know if they'd want to watch this
B000BC8TBE|5.0|All I can say is that this is by far one of my favorite Christmas albums ever released.  This album was originally released back in 1994 and I have started and finished every Christmas season with this unforgettable album.  I am so happy that Mariah re-released it!<br /><br />How lucky are we that this dual disc CD/DVD has a complete DVD section of all the Christmas video's Mariah created w/ the addition of the new animated video for Santa Clause Is Coming To Town, which is absolutely adorable.  Actually, it is a tie in to the Original cartoon TV classic of Santa Clause Is Coming To Town.  This is a very festive moment and must have for the Holiday Season!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie presents an amazing, yet classic love story. I must admit that I was hesitant to see it originally; I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Watching it for the first time, the first 1/2 hour doesn't make much sense and makes you want to shut it off, but after watching the entire movie everything comes together beautifully. Watch the movie a second time and you will completely understand everything that is going on. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again and will never get old. Every time you watch it you will pick up on something new.<br /><br />One thing that makes this movie especially interesting is its music: it has taken modern music (including Elton John, Nirvana, Madonna, and Queen) and beautifully applied it to an 1899 story.  At the same time it takes music that would have been used in the real Moulin Rouge, and integrates the two magnificently. I constantly find myself singing along with this movie whenever I watch it.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is superb, and the story couldn't be better. The characters all work very well together and are perfect for their parts. While this is a musical, it is one written for a more modern audience.<br /><br />Many people complain that the movie lacks a storyline and doesn't make sense. These people have gone into this movie wanting it to be bad, and have not given it a chance. I urge them to watch it again and realize how wonderful it is.
B00005QXXO|1.0|I was lent the entire Radiohead discography. I hardly kept about 10 songs which are indeed quite good : \\"Sail to the moon\\", \\"Nice dream\\", \\"Creep\\"... but the rest is a proper disaster. I was appalled by the live stuff : the guy just cannot sing properly unless he is backed by studio effects. He just has no voice, just a dismal creaking off-key whine that just make ears cringe. But apparently not everyone has ears. No to mention very poor melodies for most songs.  <br />The fact this band is so popular is not very encouraging. Creaking off-key whine lovers..
B00005KHJM|2.0|Give me a break.  I love kitschy old movies too, but people act like this is some artistic triumph or something.  It is COMPLETELY predictable.  Every step of the way I knew exactly what was gonna happen next.  It's like watching a bad 60s science fiction TV show where you're supposed to be \\"shocked\\" by the  \\"twist ending\\" ....and the entire time you're impatient for the damn thing to just END.... because everything moved so damn SLOW... and you figured out what was gonna happen LONG before it actually happened... and the metaphors were so damn heavy-handed and groan-inducing...    Man it was almost there in the cool-cheese factor though.  If they had just taken the already over-the-top psuedo-creepiness up that last notch into unintentional comedy...well, then it could've been awesome.    Here's the film in a nutshell.  See, like, they're \\"pagans\\", right?  And they \\"sacrifice\\" people.  And this policeman visits their remote island.... by himself.....so yeah, uh...real \\"shocker\\" ending there!

B0007CNXUK|5.0|J. M. Barrie was a playwright. He just had a flop. He was in a loveless marriage. This movie was the story of how Barrie found his muse in a widowed family of three boys.     This movie tells how \\"Peter Pan\\" came to be and it is well done. The relationships are hard to understand, but they seem real. Barrie and his wife care for each other, but there is a lot of emotional baggage on both sides for them to handle. There is a scene of confrontation between him and his wife. Both go to their separate bedrooms. The wife's bedroom is dark. When Barrie steps into his room, the audience sees a very bright light and the landscape of his imagination.  Barrie's relationship with the widow and the boys is one of deep friendship and affection. The movie teaches on the proper role of imagination in one's life. The director uses scenes of imagination like in \\"The Big Fish\\" to good effect in the movie.     The performances are all very good. The behind-the-scenes look on how the play was developed is fun. Dustin Hoffman as the long suffering manager is very good.       This is a very moving and entertaining movie. By the way, the dog is very good.
0064407667|5.0|This is the first but thankfully not the last Lemony Snicket book. The Baudelaire children have been orphaned when their parents burned to death in a fire. They are saddled with ineffectual Mr. Poe to manage their affairs, and they are given to a guardian Count Olaf who is as the author describes, filthy, violent and rude. They must use their wits to foil his plan to marry Violet, the oldest girl, and get his hands on their fortune. How they manage this is original and absorbing. <br />
B0001YRVN4|5.0|All three episodes here, with or without them, are so much better than the new trilogy. Let's face it, Jaba the Hutt's appearance brought very little to A New Hope. But destroyed it? Please. I could care less if Greedo shot first. And if Hayden Christensen replaced the guy who originally played Vader in a brief scene: So what? Here's what was better. The story was so much simpler. Save the princess. Get the plans to the rebellion. And destroy the evil Death Star before it destroys us. Is it remotely possible to sum up any of the new movies so simply and elegantly? Well that's what makes a great film. A simple story told with great detail and great artistic touches. That happened in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. That's why they're all in the IMDB's top 250 movies to this day despite having dated special effects. Who cares? You liked the characters. You knew what there mission was. And you were routing for them from film one to film three. The reason these special touches, every one else is whining about, can't ruin these films was it was never the special touches {or the special effects} that made them special in the first place. It was the story line. And 3 DVDs plus a bonus {making of all three films} for $45 when an average DVD costs $20 sounds like a great deal to me no matter if Lucas revised the original content a little bit at all.
B000002J09|5.0|everyone knows how great this record is, and i won't go into too much detail telling my personal opinion of how good it is...because the music on here speaks for itself. twisted rock with a heavy blues influence with wailing expressive vocals, thrilling song arrangements, and tons of classic cuts including the chart-shattering, ground-breaking epic \\"Stairway To Heaven.\\"
B000BBOUU4|4.0|This film was captivating from the get-go. The stark visualization of the Wonka town and Charlie's meager surroundings was outstanding. Charlie's lopsided little house bespoke his poverty, yet also accurately represented his close-knit, but delightfully off-kilter family.     One of the best parts of the movie was the characterization of Charlie and his relationship with his grandfather. Charlie's poor, but caring family contrasts sharply with Willy's childhood with his father.  As mentioned in a previous review, Johnny Depp DOES look like he is channeling Michael Jackson.  It is almost eerie. However, he makes an effective Willy Wonka and the scenes of his early life with his father, the dentist, certainly explain his eccentric behavior.  The other children (and their parents) give adequate performances... enough so that you are glad that they \\"get what's coming to them.\\"    The 2-Disc Deluxe Edition looks as if it has ample extras and I would certainly recommend this set to anyone who likes the book or the movie.
B0000062FN|5.0|A mixed bag here. The album starts with the flat out Batuka an introduction in which Schon and Santana trade riffs, getting faster and faster, with Carlos putting in some great playing (at least I think its Carlos). The next track No One to Depend On is a funky mid tempo song in much the same vein as Oye Como Va and Evil Ways and one of 2 singles from the album. As I said its a mixed bag and there are a certain number of tracks which I dislike and therefore will only say this about them, they're rather tedious and you'll find yourself reaching for the skip button on your CD player. These being Taboo the next track, Everybody's Everything (the 2nd single and supposedly the stand out track!!??) the 5th track and the 8th one Everything Is Going Our Way. <br />The fourth track Toussaint L'Overture is a great track which sizzles whith precussion and Santana's guitar. It sounds like it was written to be played live with plenty of room for improvisation (guitar and precussion) and in my opinion sounds better live. The next track (in my review that is) is the slinky salsa Guajira with some great Latin vocals and nice piano and trumpet solos. Following this comes Jungle Strut with Schon and Santana oncemore trading riffs though Schons guitar I find is too flashy and a little over the top. Closing the album is Tito Puente's Para Los Rumberos which is a fun little dance number. <br />A word on the extra tracks dug up from a performance at the Filmore, surely Columbia could of found some better ones, I mean they're not bad, but I saw Santana back in those halcyon days of '71 at L'Olympia in Paris and they were absolutely on fire, playing as an octet (the original line up plus Coke Escavado and Neil Schon) it was perhaps the finest live performance I've ever seen (thankfully Neil Schon playing strictly rhythm parts that night allowing Santana to just take off). so my point is surely there is some much better live stuff around from that period.  <br />Anyway this is great if somewhat patchy album that hints at what is to come from future Santana albums.

B000026A5F|4.0|Okay, I admit that I had never heard of Talking Heads before the single \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", but I loved this album. Quirky? Yes. Poppy? Yes. Humour a bit jouvenile? Definitely, but then so was I when I first it. <br /> <br />This is not so much a review as a comment. I wonder whether there is a darker meaning to \\"And She Was\\", which most people have missed, and which juxtaposes with the cutesy melody. \\"And she was\\" - i.e. was, in the past tense. And now isn't. \\"No time to think about what she's done,\\" \\"Rising up above the earth.\\" \\"Joining the world of missing persons\\", etc. I've seen it interpreted as a love song, or as nonsense verse, but is it about a suicide?
B000B2YQX4|1.0|The only things that separates Playing the Angel from Exciter are the two kinda-sorta-brooding songs \\"Pain that I'm Used to\\" and \\"Precious.\\" The rest is dull and, even worse, sounds like it was recorded in 1982. Reinvention through regression is oxymoronic, Marty. DM either need to quit the game (the adolescent agnst bullsh*t does not fit their image or age), or try BEING THEMSELVES and stop it with the I'm-a-depraved-sinner-who-wishes-he-was-exotic-and-sexy-but-isn't act.   <br /> <br />Every aspect about DM is laughable these days. Just flip the CD case over and read the back: \\"Pain and Suffering in Various Tempos\\"? What the hell is that supposed to mean? They must have accurately figured out that we'd be disappointed and suffer from lack of cash after wasting money on this rag of an album. Dave and the \\"boys\\" just can't keep it together. Dave and Martin should take a cue from Trent Reznor and at least try to make their phony-assed \\"pain\\" sound believable (even though we know it isn't).
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Solid album all the way through. I'm sure I'll get a lot of sht for this, but it's better than Transatlanticism. It brings back the  amazing melodies that were found in their earlier albums that were then lost in Trans. Get it.
0679423001|5.0|I think the preface to this, written by Waugh, is invaluable. I too saw the 1981 Irons interpretation of Brideshead revisited. I tried to watch it again recently but it was very slow moving. When I saw this on the shelf at the library, I picked it up because Handful of Dust was a great book about colonialism. I was very surprised when I read in the preface that Waugh wrote this in 3 months! That's amazing! I disagree with many of the reviewers here in that I don't think Waugh was an amazing prose writer, but he did have a very interesting talent. His dialogue manages to capture things said and unsaid. The part where Ryder and Julia are in the boat are magical. Almost all of the religious discussions deal with such magificently huge issues but in an almost quick, offhand manner. He mentions that he toned down the excesses of food and opulence because he had written it in such a time of rationing and greyness. Just fascinating bit of historical fiction, and the interplay between the characters is great. I'm not sure I ever caught the charm of Sebastian, and being Catholic myself much of it was overwrought. I really recommend to anyone who picks up the Everyman version, check out the Preface. He writes that he didn't know at the time that Country Houses would be saved by the aristocracy, so he was writing with such vivid nostalgia. Anyways, he says it better than I!

6305428042|3.0|Although I wouldn't put \\"Hocus Pocus\\" in the same category as a lot of Disney's other live-action fare, it is a very good family flick to watch on Halloween.  Most older children(six and up)can handle the \\"horror\\" sequences in this film.  The acting isn't too shabby and the music is fun for the little ones.<br /><br />Bette Midler turns in a modest performance as Winifred Sanderson.  Kathy Najimy is okay and Sarah Jessica Parker cranks out a fun, over-the-top performance as Midler's lesser witch sisters.  The story starts out three hundred years prior to the actual story where we witness the crime and punishment of the Sanderson sisters, who happen to be witches.  Three hundred years later, a new kid in Salem, MA by way of Los Angeles, lights up the black flame candle and raises the three sisters back from the dead.  Naturally, they wake up angry and intent on avenging their own fates by stealing the souls of youngsters in order to live forever.  Standing in their way are the teen from LA, his little sis, and a local teen with eyes for the candle lighter.  There's also a boy named Binx who's cursed to live forever in the form of a black cat.  He helps the kids out as they try to stop the witches before sunrise.  When the sun does rise, the witches will turn to dust without enough children's souls.<br /><br />The special effects are okay, but they aren't the focus of the film.  The action is pretty tame.  One character does lose his head, but in a humorous way.  His cranial loss does not lead to his death, but some kids might be turned off by a headless corpse flailing around.  In a few other scenes, witches attempt to suck the soul out of children, though the successful attempt is early in the film.  Other than that, everything else is pretty kid-friendly.<br /><br />Throw in a few silly one-liners, three hundred year old reactions to fire trucks, Satan and his lovely wife(hilariously pulled off by Penny Marshall), and one funny zombie named Billy, and you have a pretty good family film for the scariest of nights.<br /><br />The show moves at a quick pace, keeps the kiddies attention, and has a few laughs for adults as well.  I recommended it to anyone who has kids between six and twelve.  Older kids probably won't like this, so don't bother if you have teens.e a pretty good family film for the scariest of nights. <br /> <br />The show moves at a quick pace, keeps the kiddies attention, and has a few laughs for adults as well.

0767903862|5.0|The editorial reviews do a great summary of the book (though I can't resist mentioning how Australia managed had a Prime Minister who went swimming and just never came back), so I'll focus on comparison to other Bryson books. <br /> <br />I'm a huge Bryson fan and have read everything.  This is my favorite.  I've already read it twice and am thinking about doing it again.  First, Australia is just such a great topic for Bryson.  He can make relatively mundane travel (touring the midwest, circling Britain) interesting...look at what he can do with this wonderful exotic place.  Second, I think his writing has simply matured.  As much as I like \\"Neither here nor there\\" and other earlier books, I think Sunburnt and a Short History are just better written, with more finely honed jokes that his earlier books. <br /> <br />Finally, I must say everyone in my family has read this book several times, including my 89-year old aunt.  Quotes are a regular part of family dinners.  Just a great read.
6305291446|4.0|I've never been a big fan of slasher flicks, but of all of the Jasons and Freddies out there, Michael Myers stands out.  The first two films were well above average as far as slasher flicks go.  The rest of the sequels ranged from ho-hum to absurd, but \\"H2O\\" makes up for all of that.  With a wonderful cast that includes Jamie Lee Curtis, Josh Hartnett, and Jodie Lynn O'Keefe, this tale is the best sequel of the bunch.  No matter that it follows any type of logic or dogma built up by the other sequels.  Think of it as the \\"Batman Begins\\" of slasher flicks.  It took everything good about the original film and made a solid second helping by ignoring everything that was bad in between.<br /><br />As stated before, the cast is strong.  Granted, the characters are all pretty standard teen slasher characters, but they are performed in an excellent manner.  Even Michelle Williams turns in a good performance.  LL Cool J is fun to watch as a bumbling security guard and, much like his performance in \\"Deep Blue Sea,\\" he plays the role with flair and humorous style.<br /><br />The premise is simple:  Myers is back to finish the job he started.  He wants his sis dead, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish that.<br /><br />The story moves at a very good pace, and it's the first slasher to give me the willies since the original \\"Halloween.\\"  Though the story is basically the same as every other teen hacker out there, it's one of the best.  Highly recommended to fans of modern horror flicks.  Jason might be a goalie from Hades and Freddy may rule your dreams, but Michael Myers just wants to cut people, and you've gotta love that!

0446577383|5.0|What a high concept book. Oh, to be a member of a club like that, and to find myself in the middle of a murder mystery!  Nope--on second thought I wouldn't like that at all.  It's much more fun to sit back and let writers like Baldacci, Pat Conroy, James Patterson, Dean Koontz and David Meadows sweep me along on their imaginations. <br /> <br />This book is a fast-paced pageturner that kept me guessing and off-balance through the entire exciting read. <br /> <br />It was the first night I ever spent with David Baldacci, but it won't be my last.  Oops, I meant up all night reading his book, of course. <br /> <br />I loved the roller-coaster ride! <br /> <br />
0679422714|5.0|This book is an excellent, scorching review of Mao's malevolence and the truths that his many apologists (including many of the reviewers here) would like to bury alongside the bodies of uncounted tens of millions of Chinese civilians murdered by Mao's genocidal movement.

Anyone who believes in the greatness of Mao needs to read this book, and discard or discount the obfuscating denials that his ghoulish fans will throw about in the wake of this brilliant expose.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|\\"The Wretched Spawn,\\" Cannibal Corpse's sixth album without original frontman Chris Barnes, is one of the better death metal albums of 2004, and it might be their best album since Barnes was fired from the group in 1996. George Fisher, the new vocalist, is very deep and gruff, but his vocals aren't monstrous. Plus, George does change speed (as in tracks one and two), but he doesn't change pitch; there are almost no shrieks or high pitched yells, on here. Other than that, though, this record has everything you need for great death metal: huge riffs, rapid fire drums, propulsive tempos, speaker vibrating rhythms, disgusting lyrics, etc. Even an occasional solo flares up from time to time. \\"Psychotic Precision\\" has surging, grinding riffs, jackhammer drums, and two solos. The title track slows down and becomes an almost bobbing beat, but then a scorching solo kicks in and speeds the pace back up. \\"Cyanide Assassin\\" begins with a fast, steam rolling beat, but it slows down and some super heavy, churning riffs take over. \\"Festering in the Crypt\\" is a mid-paced rocker which gains momentum with cascading riffs and a high pitched yell. \\"Nothing Left to Mutilate\\" features a pounding rhythm, with dizzying, circular riffs and fast double bass drumming. \\"Rotted Body Landslide\\" sounds like the drummer, Paul, is cracking his snare drum, and \\"Slain\\" has more fast, buzzsaw riffs. If you're new to Cannibal Corpse, or if you like growls more than monstrous vocals, \\"The Wretched Spawn\\" is a good place to start. The bottom line is if you like death metal, nothing should prevent you from picking up this C.D.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|9x Grammy Award-winner Alicia Keys has now hit her fans with this terrific set of live music.  There's really not much to review, so this won't be a lengthy review.    The performances of her now-classic hits are exceptional.  Of the new songs, \\"Unbreakable\\" (the 1st single) is hands-down the best; \\"Love It Or Leave It Alone\\" (w/Mos Def & Common) is a shining track as well.    I'm a HUGE Alicia fan because of her musicianship which is probably why people always say that she's the best female vocalist out at this time.  Alicia's a great musician, but Beyonce & Fantasia have her beat by miles when it comes to actually singing.  Alicia is just set apart from them because she did something that was heavily needed in the R&B scene when she debuted in 2001 -- she took us R&B fans back to some of the classic soul of the '60s & '70s.    Don't get me wrong, she's still one of the ultimate best of today, but people are treating her musicianship the wrong way.  Sure, she's one of the best musicians that I've had the pleasure of listening to (I have all 3 OF HER ALBUMS!), but Beyonce has the voice of a goddess.  I have to say this because I've noticed people saying that Keys has a better voice than Beyonce, which is not true.  And Fantasia?  Don't get me started on her.  Ms. Idol has Keys on lock when it comes to the vocals.    Besides that point, for any Alicia fan (like myself), this is a must-have.    ALICIA'S GRAMMY TRACK RECORD:  2002 - Best New Artist  2002 - Song of the Year for \\"Fallin'\\"  2002 - Best R&B Song for \\"Fallin'\\"  2002 - Best R&B Album for \\"Songs In A Minor\\"  2002 - Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \\"Fallin'\\"  2005 - Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \\"If I Ain't Got You\\"  2005 - Best R&B Song for \\"You Don't Know My Name\\"  2005 - Best R&B Album for \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\"  2005 - Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group w/Vocals for \\"My Boo\\" (with Usher)
B0006VIE4C|3.0|Why won't directors leave well enough alone?  Director George Lucas has reworked his STAR WARS saga more than Walt Whitman reworked LEAVES OF GRASS, stringing it into so many different versions (in various media) that the original idea was long ago buried in an avalanche of product.  The first film (which wasn't called \\"A New Hope,\\" just STAR WARS) was groundbreaking, thrilling fun. For this so-called \\"special\\" edition, Lucas added several cheesy CGI images and sound effects, then re-edited other scenes, and didn't permit the original on DVD.  The only way to get the authentic version is to find an old VHS copy of it, which loses the wide screen. However, that is preferable to having our memories mugged (as Pauline Kael said of the altered version of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND).

0307276902|5.0|Cancel your Life for the next 24 hours, order in and call in sick to work b/c you can't put this Book down. AMLP is somehow a page turner and not much happens physically but Frey moves you  to want to hear what he is Thinking next. I gave this 5 stars mainly because it held my attention. Way over-rated hyped up book. Good book if you read as a semi-fiction. Super fast read. Excited to know there is a sequel to this Book.  I don't think that I would have liked the Book as much if I didn't know That there was a follow-up because you are seriously left hanging.  My ADD loved his style of writing.  Recall for events and conversations are Hard to believe and this is partly what makes the book seem like Fiction at times not to mention the mix of characters who connect.  Laughable part where treatment staff drives James on a love quest mission.  The Dentist without meds...was he going to do the same if he needed an amputation?  I could have done without reading about every Meal he ate and what it was.  If you don't spend too much time trying to decipher if this could be Real or not, you will like.  P.S. Don't do what I did and Read the update page BEFORE you read the book. Even better, wait until you finish \\"My Friend Leonard.\\"
B0000025DT|5.0|Finding the perfect ELO album is like trying to outrace two trends moving against each other in time.  ELO's earliest records (which I personally very much like) are afflicted with a heavy dose of art-rock-pretension, which took several albums to fully wear away.  Their later records, however, veer into flippant, silly pop, chirping backing vocals, and stereotypically disco-y string and bass lines.   <br /> <br />Functioning consistently through all of this are the exceptional compositional talents of front man Jeff Lynne.  Lynne's talent remains greatly underrated because it often surpassed his taste:  sometimes you want to grab the man by his lapels and shake him:  What is up with this pompous choir droning in the background?  Do you really need those falsetto exclamations throughout the chorus?  On ELO records, there's a lot that can embarrass the fan. <br /> <br />But if there is a perfect ELO record, this would be my nominee.  This is the one in the sweet spot:  the sweet spot that marries well-trained pop sensibilities with enough virtuouso classical allusions to carry much more of interest than in other pop music.   <br /> <br />Actually, I think this record's immediate predecessor, Face the Music, might be more in the \\"sweet spot\\" than this one, in a certain sense.  Eldorado was definitely on the art-rock-pretension side of the line, and this one, in my view, veers ever so slightly into the too-pop side.  Face the Music is just at the right place. The \\"problem\\" is that A New World Record (and Eldorado, in my opinion) just has better songs than Face the Music.  I think it's the best record that they ever put out. <br /> <br />I still have vivid memories of the first time I spun this record.  I was in a puppy-love relationship in 8th grade, and my love interest was a fan of the song \\"Livin' Thing,\\" then receiving airplay. I listened to it a few times on the radio, thought, \\"that's interesting enough,\\" and bought the record. <br /> <br />Till then I had been mainly a Beatles fan; very little else in pop music had inspired an interest in owning.  But when I put this record on, my jaw dropped: It starts with one of ELO's trademark spaceship keyboard effects, which glisses down into a stern and very classical-sounding melody on the lower strings.  Then the mood shifts again, to a jaunty, jostling pop rhythm. I remember thinking; What the hell is this?  I had never heard so many musical styles played seamlessly and well in such a brief auditory space. <br /> <br />The thing that makes this record better than all the rest is that Lynne is really at the peak of his powers here as a composer and producer.  He writes very accessible melodies, but it's not the trite pop that they would record from Out of the Blue onward.  The melodies are always surrounded by facile manipulation of other musical elements entirely.  You have a leader here who is showing off his musical chops, but much less visibly than on On the Third Day or even Eldorado.   <br /> <br />I find myself, as I listen to this record, marveling at Lynne's evocative compositional skill.  For example, you have moments at the beginning and end of \\"Above the Clouds\\" that are straight out of some 1930s film soundtrack, it seems.  It sends me to the piano trying to determine how exactly those chords were assembled. <br /> <br />Similarly, there's a middle section in \\"So Fine\\" (a very strong up-tempo number) that seems to combine African drums, with the strings joining pseudo-woodwinds in a unison melody.  So different from everything that previously occurs in the song, but it somehow meshes perfectly. <br /> <br />It's not always done with sufficient restraint and taste. The album end, for example, is unforgivably over the top.  Yet. . . somehow you do forgive it, because the broken chords that lead into it a truly gorgeous, almost like a new and improved Bach. <br /> <br />The album's big hits -- Telephone Line, Livin' Thing, and Do Ya, all sound much better here than on context-less radio.  But every single song on the record is excellent.  So Fine and Above the Clouds are particular favorites of mine (the latter is a jewel), but Shangri-La has an exceptionally lovely melody.   <br /> <br />Just a fantastic record. Jeff Lynne deserves far greater recognition for the genius that he was.
B000002U82|5.0|These kids who are saying that is album \\"sucks\\" have no appreciation for the quality of Pink Floyd.  It is by far the greatest album of all time and though it is used by many potheads, you don't have to smoke it to love this album. These kids probably don't enjoy it because it isn't fast enough for them.  The music is somewhat slow and the instrumentals are to die for.  But those are dwarfed by the power of the lyrics.  Listen carefully and you'll hear some powerful stuff.  Not to mention that it coincides with The Wizard of Oz.  This album is superior to any garbage put out today and will remain at the top of the list of Greatest Albums Ever.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Octavarium is a very well done album that since purchasing I haven't been able to stop listening to.  In particular the 24-minute epic title track... I'd say their best epic ever.  Yes, even better than Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  For one, I prefer to listen to epics in their entirety, and since both Scenes and Six are so long people take part of it and say \\"I like [this part of] this epic\\" and don't enjoy the entirety of the whole piece.  Octavarium draws and comes back on many different ideas throughout the entire song, and even at the end draws back to the beginning of the album. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is amazing.  Yes, it is not the heavy metal that most of us are used to (especially after Train of Thought), but musically I believe it is better, because instead of soloists becoming the focus of songs, the solos are a part of the song.  And also the songs are downright good.  Panic Attack is up there with Pull Me Under and Innocence Faded as my favorite DT songs.  GREAT lyrics and GREAT mood of the song.  The Root of All Evil is a perfect opener to the album and sets the mood. <br /> <br />Yes, there are two \\"ballads\\" on here.  I don't consider \\"I Walk Beside You\\" a ballad.  Just because it's more poppy doesn't mean it's a ballad.  It just shows the ability of the musicians to play different genres.  Following the lead of the rest of the album, this song gives hints of U2 (as Octavarium gives hints of Pink Floyd and Genesis, and The Root of all Evil earlier DT songs).   <br /> <br />I believe that overall this is one of their best albums.  Because they don't focus on one style, one mood, one genre... they capture elements of all their past albums and put them all on one album to create awesomeness.
0743424425|5.0|Of all the Stephen King books, this is his best. <br />His writing has the uncanny ability to get into your mind and give a vivid mental picture of everything going on. <br />Everyone knows the story--especially because of the 1980 Kubrick Classic.  However, the movie does not go into the mind of Jack Torrance as he struggles with his inner demons. <br />The spirits of the Overlook tap into his regret, anger, and confusion in order to get Danny.  As Jack struggles, Stephen King forces reader to sympathize and pull for him. <br />This is where the book truly outsines the movie (no pun intended).  Kubrick does not make Jack Torrance a sympathetic character, but rather someone on the edge the movie audience loaths. <br />King is a master writer, and the only horror writer I know who usually has a moral lesson to the story.  Most horror writers have such a cynical end it does not leave any room for hope.  While King will take his reader to hell, they will also find the way out. <br />This one novel alone should have future scholars consider Stephen King the Dickens of American Literature.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I've seen this film a couple of times and while it's not my favourite of Mr. Moore's work, there is certainly a lot of food for thought there.  I find myself thinking about Farenheit  9/11 whenever the stench of  stealth bubbles up in Washington, which seems to be more and more frequently and more and more serious.  Michael Moore probably has more patriotism in his pinky finger than can be mustered up in the whole of  Washington, yet Mr. Moore takes the criticism for speaking out.<br /><br />Suggest you check out the writings of Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, USMC, particularly the excerpt from his speech regarding war and the reasons for war which he delivered way back in 1933.  Chilling!
B000286RNY|4.0|This movie is funny and never stops from being entertaining.  I laughed the whole way through.  The story isnt want i remember as much as the jokes and the way over-the-top action.  They kung-fu action gets a little silly at times instead of amazing, but I can forgive that since this movie has a light hearted theme and great cast including zhou wei(so close, warriors of heaven and earth) who plays a cinderella-type girl who is always over looked.  This movie isnt perfect, but it is a great movie for people who like comedies, kung-fu movies, and sports movies.

To my dismay, all of the deleted scenes are in the movie and 9 out of 10 of them left me thinking, \\"Wow, no wonder they took that out.\\" The extra scenes generally don't make sense with the flow of the movie or don't say anything significant enough to add new insight. For example, the new scene with Salieri and Constanze. It make's Salieri seem reckless and not cunning. The extra scene after Mozart's first opera (the Turkish one) was for people who need Hollywood to spell things out for them. I could go on forever, but I won't.     In the end, I don't watch this version of Amadeus and opt for the two sided original (5 stars!! despite the 2 side disc). I can only hope that they will re-release the original in its ORIGINAL award winning form. I shutter to think if I had seen this version first. However, if you always wanted to know where Mozart got the bottle of wine just before Leopold shows up at his door step, this is the DVD for you.
B0001CNRSE|5.0|In this cute movie about a dancer who makes her dreams come true, Jessica Alba plays the title character named Honey danielles, a girl who works a few crumby jobs like a CD store employee but has a true desire to be a choreographer.  She goes to tryouts galore but never makes it until one man named Michael Ellis who is a music video producer asks her to work as a backup dancer in his jadakiss music video.  Honey jumps at the chance but soon finds out that the media world only wants one thing, sex, and she doesn't want to go that far for work.  Because of her virtue, she gets blacklisted from the music video industry and has to make a new name for herself.<br /><br />Jessica Alba is as cute as she has ever been but is still sexy.  She come off as a female who wont give up her morals just to get money and fame.  She helps out a kid in need (Lil Romeo) and helps him stay out of trouble.<br /><br />In all, Honey may have its cheesy moments, but it is a cute film that will leave you with a smile on your face.
0788815490|5.0|This movie is worth a look only if you like crazy love triangles set in old aristocratic Europe or Helena Bonham Carter (as Kate Croy).  I really like Helena, and the movie was OK.<br /><br />Linus Roache ( as Merton Densher), Alison Elliott (as Millie Theale), and Charlotte Rampling (as Aunt Maude) were all delightful in their roles, but Helena brings the film to life.  Her character is enigmatic and melancholy, but she normally exudes this aura of mystery, no matter what role she is playing.<br /><br />Here, Kate Croy, is an impoverished girl of London Society, fortunate that her rich aunt Maude, has taken her in to assist her in marrying well.  Instead, she loves Merton, a dashing, intellectual, boyishly-seductive pauper, whom she is forbid to see by the aunt.<br /><br />Nevertheless, an improbable triangle forms (by Kate's device) with short-term profits in mind.  It is Millie, who is targeted, by several members of this London Society for her money.  Interesting plot twists develop concerning the money throughout to the end.  Thus, the games play out and the profits are secured, possibly, but not without additional choices and costs.<br /><br />There is a nude scene with Kate and Merton that may confuse purists who want to view this film as sacred among art films.  To me, the scene neither adds greatly or detracts greatly from the artistic value of this film.  I did find it a bit gratuitous initially, but in a little while you accept.  This scene forces viewers into accepting/understanding the passion of Kate and Merton's love by being so in-your-face and putting you in either role.<br /><br />I believe given the same choices as Merton and Kate, most people would do the same.  The outcome basically: money can't buy love or love's relative security (knowing this person will NEVER hurt you and being able to trust them unconditionally); instead, mutual love (THIS is what we want) simply grows wherever it finds fertile ground and that ground is it's true security, regardless of wealth (mutual love is really like that, it's free and secure).  We, like they, have to choose between physical or emotional security.  Who's for going for the ground within which to grow?  And finding that priceless.<br /><br />For Helena Bonham Carter, a melodramatic script, or beautiful views of Venice and London, give this movie a chance.  If not for either of these, find another movie.e security, regardless of wealth (mutual love is really like that, it's free and secure).

B00006J9OT|5.0|Music from this bride of Elvis Costello is absolutely enthralling.  It is passionate, lovely and great musicianship! :)    Through my public library in Sheboygan I have discovered the artistry of Ms. Krall and am thankful for it! :)
0684135051|2.0|This book has been hyped up so much by reviewers and other knitters.  I found her writing to be disorganized and not as useful as I had hoped.  I was hoping I would be able to break away from using patterns, but this book did nothing for that.  Her percentages method was not explained.  How did she come to use percentages?  Who knows.  Obviously Elizabeth was a talented woman, but, in my opinion, not able to translate her knowledge very well.  I will keep looking.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|This 2004 movie has a very unique premise:  Jigsaw, the film's \\"killer\\", doesn't actually kill his victims; he puts them in situations where they're forced to fight for their lives.  I thought that made this much more enjoyable than your standard \\"slash `em up\\" fare. <br /> <br />The actual killing scenes also brought this up a few notches from your traditional \\"modern\\" horror movie.  Each scenario was ingenuous and very suspenseful.  They were also quite gory, but not in a gratuitous sense.  If anything, it added realism and made each of the scenes raw and disturbing in a surprisingly entertaining way. <br /> <br />The only thing that brought this film down was the pace.  It seemed like the action dragged in a few places, especially when it came to the police's pursuit of Jigsaw.  It didn't hurt the film in the long run, though, especially when everything comes together for the surprise ending, which is bound to shock even the most seasoned horror fan. <br /> <br />This is how horror should be done.  Highly recommended.
0307276902|5.0|I thought this book was fabulous.  As one of two daughters of two alcohol and/or prescription medication addicts, I can verify that neither my sister nor I understood what was going on, we just knew that it was AWFUL!!!  Neither my sister nor I drink or use drugs.  A friend recently asked if I enjoyed scary movies; and I answered \\"Who needs scary movies - my entire childhood and adolescence was a scary movie.\\"  This book provided much insight into what causes addictive behavior and the consequences thereof.  Both of my parents were checked into rehab, but it never took.  Thank you James Frey for writing this very startling but informative book!
B000BCKFWK|2.0|I loved Sin City. I thought the style and cinematography were genius. However I have to say, I'm getting a little tired of these bare bones DVD's that come out months before the big Uncut Unrated Extended Deluxe Never Before Seen Director's Cut Version is released. Why can't they just release the good version and the barebones version at the same time? Give people an option, and give them a break while they're at it?

B0002IVN9W|2.0|Why is every dam rock critic raving about this cd. I got this base on there raves. This and that god awful new bright eyes cd which were critically overrated blow. I am never trusting a music critic again i should not have listen to any of those critics in the first place. The one thing i do not like is that all the songs sound the same and the singers voice is wack. It sounds like a bad combination of elo and the pixies. Why would everyone want to combine those two. Some have said that they sound like talking heads i do not hear it. I listen to this cd like 4 times to give it a chance it did not leave any impression on me. So i just decided to sell it on amazon. If this the best that there is in music then boy does music suck now. Hey arcade fire do not think it is a honor being one of bowies favorite bands out now. Do not get me wrong i am a huge bowie fan (of his 70s stuff) but he has not done a decent album since 1980's scary monsters. Too bad i miss that tv concert where bowie sang with arcade fire maybe his better voice would have made there songs better or maybe not.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I did not like operas and was skeptical of watching the movie in case it was too mushy. I was proved wrong went my music teacher made us watch it. I rented it and watched it over and over again. My family got tired of me seeing it and talking about it and singing the songs it was soooo good. You must watch it. Yes there is singing, but the movie is great. Don't let singing stop you from seeing it. Have to Watch it! If I could rate it 10 stars then I would.
B000003S09|4.0|I am not a prog rock fan manily becasuse the songs are way to long and i have yet to find a singer of this type of music with a good voice. Greg Lake does have a good voice i acutally knew his later band emerson lake and palmer before i even heard of King Crimson. I like all the songs on this cd the length does not really bother me. Accept moon child most of it is just boring noise i skip it at the 3 minute mark. The one thing i notice about this cd that it really is not that heavy like the bands that were influence by them songs are. Actually some of this sounds kind of folky. I can imagine someone like Nick Drake singing I talk to the wind. The title song was the first song i heard of them it played on the radio and i quite liked it so i picked this one up.
B000006XXV|2.0|While I really don't listen to the Cure that much anymore, from the ages of 15-20... I  was pretty much consumed by the band.  That being said, I was embarassed for not only the Cure, but for myself when I first heard this album; Wild Mood Swings contains songs that should have never been recorded...or heard...by anyone.  Amazingly bad--some of them.  There are, however, songs on the record that are actually kinda good.  If one were inclined, they might make an edited version using itunes+a cd burner or whatever.  That's what you should do ...but what songs are worth keeping?   I'll tell you. <br /> <br />1) WANT.    best song on the album.   great energy.   sounds like the cure should. <br />3) THIS IS A LIE.   sounds like it could have been on Wish or TheTop maybe. <br />4) The 13th.   \\"yeah but it feeeels GOOD!\\"   sister song to Close to Me.  better than  you think. <br />7) JUPITER CRASH.  nice one. the closest thing to Disentegration you'll hear on this album. backwards effect on his voice works well.  (can you tell i'm listening as i'm doing this?) <br />9) GONE!  this one grew on me.  sister song to Lovecats.  this song is almost sexy(?) <br />    and is better than you think.  great buildup to the horns.    blah blah <br />13) Treasure.  an honest song that sounds like Wish stuff.  should have closed the album because... <br /> <br /> <br />14) BARE starts off sounding great, but plods along w/ some really bad changes. too bad. I was liking it for the first minute or two... but this could be included i guess...it's not that bad. <br />10) NUMB almost makes the list for the cool strings but is boring and lyrically lazy.  <br />12)TRAP almost for sounding....like a bad Wish b-side; but bad b-sides don't belong on albums do they? <br /> <br />All the other songs are only appropriate for 12 year old girls or people with no taste.  So there it is-- a six song album...Just throw on Birdmad Girl(the top) and a couple 'a songs from Head on the Door and you'll have an album that wont scare your friends into an unfortunate disinterest of The Cure.       <br /> <br />In the future stick to Disentegration and the preceeding albums.  That's what Robert wants anyway...honestly... I used to know him.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is the definition of a mature, heavy, and meaningful album. This was Metallica's last effort with Cliff Burton. (R.I.P) May he be sorely missed. Anyway, wipe those tears off your face and read the review! <br /> <br />Battery 5/5: If you've read my other reviews, you already know how I feel about this song. A 35-second, completely accoustic intro, exploding into a fast, thrash masterpiece. This is talking about power, and the consequences of it being overused. The solo after the first chorus is unbelievable. It's WAY too short though! It shifts back to the quieter beat after the second chorus for 10 seconds, then Kirk comes in with a VERY fast solo. <br /> <br />Master of Puppets 5/5: An 8-minute song about what people can do to you when they have power over you. The second solo after the second chorus has incredibly high notes that drive my mother nuts! The end is very cool as well. It starts with a faded laugh, a short guitar beat, then a chorus of evil laughs. <br /> <br />The Thing That Should Not Be 4/5: A good song about something that should not be. A slightly slower tempo is what turned me off on this song. Still worth a listen or 2 though. <br /> <br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) 5/5: Slower paced, with very haunting lyrics about a mental patient. (In his mind) Good guitar and bass work. The drums don't impress me as much as Master of Puppets though. <br /> <br />Disposable Heroes 10/5: Best song on the album! Right here folks! This song is about a soldier who is really mad because he was drafted. A very good solo after the second chorus (The BACK TO THE FRONT! one) He doesn't want to be there, and he thinks the general should die. <br /> <br />Leper Messiah 5/5: A biblical song about a leper who controls all the others. The ending is awesome. There is a short pause, a loud beat, then it stops dead in it's tracks. <br /> <br />Orion (Instrumental) 4/5: A quiet beginning building into a good instrumental. Almost as good as The Call of KTULU from Ride the Lightning. <br /> <br />Damage Inc. 5/5: A very fast song with pounding beats and complicated solos. They say the f-word, but you can't understand it at all. The part wear James whispers damage incorporated instantly won me over. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a beautiful album with little to no flaws. Again, buy it to give the new Metallica a message. MAKE THE OLD THRASH METAL! Bring it back to the mainstream! <br /> <br />Enjoy!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|After taking a chance on watching a movie I knew very little about, Serenity, I was compelled to read up on this fascinating universe. A book, a comic, anything would satisfy my curiosity, but to my amazement I discovered there was a whole tv series. Thanks to this country's ludicrous fascination with reality shows I had long given up on most of television, and so unfortunately I missed out on this when it aired on FOX. But after watching the movie, I did not hesitate on picking this up and was not disappointed. What makes Firefly so special are the characters, not only do they have great chemistry with each other, but you really genuinely find yourself caring for these people and the adventures they find themselves in. Of course it doesn't hurt when there's a hottie like Morena Baccarin on the show. <br /> <br />If you liked the movie, pick this up. I can only hope that this series continues in one form or another.

B00000IUT7|3.0|Not to be derivative, but Mr. Jensen's review highlights the key weakness(es) of this engine, price and number of drive wheels. It REALLY DOES need 4 or 6 wheel drive to handle the hills in any interesting track layout [given the $29.99 price]! That being said, I WILL respectfully disagree with another reviewer by noting that our red engine has taken 1.5 years of ABUSE and has continued functioning with aplomb! Ours was able to handle the Magic Mountain layout until recently. It is thus due, mostly, to hard play that I wish this engine had 4 or 6 wheel drive, as it might still be mountain-capable at this time...In sum, our son has had a blast with this engine for 18 mos. I just wish it had the capabilities it did, out-of-box, due to the price. But given that Brio is Euro-superior and thus less subject to market forces than it might be at Wal-Mart, one dare not hold one's breath for such a product improvement. Ta. Dr. L. <br />

6305428387|5.0|Cool Runnings is a film that takes a few liberties with the actual events to come up with a an inspirational screenplay.  It helps that the characters don't take themselves too seriously.  This movie really had a lot of opportunities to take itself too seriously and yet it avoids the temptation.<br /><br />Of particular interest and impact to me was the sub-story between Junior and his Father.  Films can be therapeutic.  This one proved to be a surprising opportunity to work through my own sense of disconnection with my father.<br /><br />Many will find that to be surprising as well but it is there and in my mind it elevates the value of the film quite a bit.<br /><br />Worth while flick for the whole family.
B0000648WZ|1.0|Bad on every level I can think. Bad war film, bad action film and far worse than stupid political commentary.<br /><br />If this were simply a bad film, that would be fine, but the fact that it is based on a classic science fiction novel makes it a crying shame. I remember how excited fans of the book were that it was finally being made into a film, and how disappointed they still are that Verhoven did it.<br /><br />I'm not surprised people will try to give the film credibility by talking about how \\"complex\\" it is. Um ... no. It's not, really. It doesn't come across as having a bad script and bad acting and a morally bankrupt point of view because it's making a statement, it comes across that way because has a bad script it's truly badly directed and yeah, most of the acting isn't great. On the other hand, the script's subtle-as-a-jackhammer political agenda and wooden dialogue would have been hard to rise above even if the director did have some sort of vision that was worth sharing. Why bother using Heinlein's book if you<br /><br />have so little respect for it?<br /><br />Why ruin the film adaptation of a book for your own purposes? How arrogant, self-serving and irresponsible is that?<br /><br />The combat sequences make no sense whatsover, with the hi-tech Mobile Infantry charging the Bugs in a way that would seem more<br /><br />appropriate in \\"Braveheart\\" being especially bad.<br /><br />I can't remember being more disappointed by a film, ever. You won't just want your money back; you'll be regretting losing those two hours of your life.
B0009X7664|5.0|This classic movie adapted from the classic tale by Harper Lee does not need anyone to speak for it.  What I will say is this particular packaging of the Movie, was a wonderful bonus, and has increased my appreciation of the movie two fold.  The bonus disc gave me an insight into Gregory Peck , whom I knew little about.  Like wise the interview with Mary Badham (who played Scout), provided me with additional enjoyment.  I watched this over the weekend with my three year old son Jacob, kids today don't go out of their way to watch anything in B&W, but such is the power of this movie, that he sat wide eyed waiting for the final arrival of Boo Radley.  Whom he calls \\"Boo Wadderwee\\". I watched the same reaction in him, that I had all those years ago when I first saw Robert Duvall behind that door, the hairs even today, still stand on end! What a marvelous movie what a wonderful story.  Long may it reign.  A great value package.  Also the post card sized movie posters included will look fantastic framed.  I hope everyone enjoys this movie - cause they don't make 'em like this anymore!
B00000I41J|5.0|As all concur this is a great jazz CD..know that the bonus track Alison's Uncle on an earlier remasterered edition  was exchanged for Bangoon on this edition of CD..I guess the better sound here and different track will increase copies sold...why both were not included on this CD is beyond me..The down side of<br /><br />perfectionists.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|If for nothing else, you should buy this for one performance. Dylan's rendition of Mr. Tambourine Man at Newport in 64 is spine-tingling. He can hardly hide his glee during the song, presumably aware of the ground-breaking aspect of this complex song. It's ironic to see Pete Seeger tapping his foot in the background, clearly enjoying a song that pointed the way to Dylan's electric transformation a few months later. Awesome.
B0000844IT|3.0|Some movies are good, some are bad.  Some movies are so bad they're good.  Because of this, some people try to make some movies that are so bad they're good.  If you try to fail and do so, have you succeeded?<br /><br />Well we don't have to ask that question with this movie, because it's not bad enough to be bad or good, and it's really not good.  Thus we conclude it's a mediocre attempt at being so bad it's good.<br /><br />Our hero the brazen braggert Ash goes back in time, where he is the Chosen One who will defeat the Army of Darkness...provided he can remember a few simple syllables.  That's really it as far as the plot goes, along with the whole deal with Evil Ash the doppelganger leading the Army of Darkness.  For some reason, it sounds better on paper, and it really shouldn't have.<br /><br />That said, this movie still has it's tongue-in-cheek charm.  Ash's lines are made-for cult favorites, and the action is wonderfully banal.  One of the strongest parts of the movie has to do with its pacing, how development is discarded to just get the action moving from scene to scene.  For instance, the wise man continuing nonchalantly with his speech after Ash dispatches of a Deadite that interrupts them.<br /><br />It is quite definitely a fun, good time not meant to be taken seriously, more fun especially with friends and a good crowd.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B00006JJ1O|1.0|My sister got this thing, and made me listen to it. I really don't hate a lot of music, but this. *shudder* This is terrible, on all levels. <br /> <br />First, there was the \\"lesbian\\" stunt, which was simply disgusting and cheap. Even if they WERE actually lesbians, they way they played up that angle was just... repulsive.  <br /> <br />Well, fine, publicity smublicity. If the music is good, we can forgive that cheat stunt. <br /> <br />Ha. The music? Generic, forgettable dance. And the voices are annoying and ear-drum shatteringly shrill. And repeatative. Since I didn't get enough of the singer's shrieking out \\"They're not gonna get us\\" the first time! Eugh... And they don't even write or anything on their songs. All they do is sing. In short, UGH.

Not only would a NIN album have actually BEEN Nine Inch Nails, it would have SOUNDED heaps better than this DM crap also. For a band that gave us so many fantastic songs, this is pathetic. Go back to bringing up kids and mowing the lawns or whatever it is you old farts normally do. Leave the NIN albums to Trent. They are heaps better at it than you old smelly tools.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's self-titled debut is undoubtedly one of the finest albums in the history of rock. Only Guns N' Roses debut, \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" (1987) can possibly compete with \\"Van Halen\\" (1978) in terms of greatness in the hard rock genre. \\"Van Halen\\" is the definitive rock album that set the stage for almost every hard-rock band from the 1980s. Poison, RATT, Quiet Riot, Warrant, Cinderella, Dokken, LA Guns, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, and many more, all took their cue from Van Halen.<br /><br />\\"Van Halen,\\" is the prototype that set the stage for the decade to follow. Every singer wanted to be like David Lee Roth, and every guitar player wanted to be Eddie Van Halen. Dave and Eddie were gods, truly rock n' roll icons if ever there were any.<br /><br />Van Halen's debut introduced the world to Diamond David Lee Roth. Roth is truly a maverick in the annals of rock. As journalist Malcolm Dome writes \\"Roth was not merely a frontman, not just a vocalist, but a volcanic eruption of cabaret, Vaudeville, rock n roll and Las Vegas\\" (Excess All Areas, Castle Communications, 1994). While the band and the songs on Van Halen's debut are top notch, it is Roth that gives them the magic touch. If Sammy Hagar had been Van Halen's vocalist in 1978 \\"Van Halen\\" would have been a great album, no doubt, but not the masterpiece that it is. Without Dave, Vince Neil, Brett Michaels, Sebastian Bach, Kid Rock, Anthony Kiedis, among others would have had to look elsewhere for inspiration.<br /><br />Van Halen's debut showcased Eddie Van Halen. With \\"Van Halen,\\" Eddie reinvented the language of guitar. His trademark tapping and laser-fast hammer-ons became the blueprint for a generation of future guitar players. Steve Vai, George Lynch, Zack Wylde, Jerry Cantrell and Billy Corgan among others were all heavily influenced by Eddie Van Halen.<br /><br />Drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony provided a stunning rhythm section. Alex Van Halen's drumming was intense, without being bombastic. While Michael Anthony isn't the most famous member of VH, his playing was the glue the bound the sound together. And with Eddie Van Halen on guitar, a flashy bass player may have been too much. Most importantly, Anthony's signature high-pitched background vocals and harmonies were the perfect counterpart to Roth's bluesy baritone delivery.<br /><br />Together, the four members were an unstoppable, rock n' roll machine that bulldozed over all competitors and created six of the best albums in the history of rock. As Roth once commented, if you put a Van Halen album in your shelf, it will melt all the other records in your collection.<br /><br />Roth has commented in his autobiography, \\"Crazy from the Heat,\\" (1997) the band sounded as good as it did because they played live in the studio without a lot of overdubs. He points out that while the band would record a song three or four times, the first take was usually the best, because it was \\"distraction fee, fear free\\" and the band was not self-conscious.  Roth notes how with classic Van Halen, you can hear and make out each individual instrument-guitar, bass, drums, vocals, very clear and separate. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Van Halen's debut.<br /><br />Roth also notes in his book that the two major albums popular at the time of the recording of \\"Van Halen\\" were \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977) and \\"Nevermind the Bullocks, here's the Sex Pistols\\" (1977). Roth notes that \\"Van Halen\\" was somewhere in between both albums.

B000AY807Q|3.0|I give this CD/DVD combo 3 stars because of the DVD.  The \\"studio\\" footage may have been live, but the audio sure ain't.  It's the same CD tracks matched up to the studio footage.  Booorrring.  Why didn't they just use the live audio that was created at the time? The footage is in the same style as the video for \\"The Painter\\", which is appropriate because the DVD is basically a long music video.  I looked forward to hear the tunes at the moment of studio conception in it's live, raw form;  instead what I got looked like \\"Top of the Pops\\" miming to the CD tracks.  Others have gotten the bonus studio footage AND AUDIO right (Metallica, QOTSA, Paul Weller, etc.).  We already got the excellent CD so why can't we hear some live audio too?  Unless you want a 60 minute music video, skip this combo and buy the standalone instead.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I wasnt a big fan of Audioslave,sure I heard like a stone.. who hasnt? Well anyways I decided to pick this album up and I must say, I like this album alot. Chris Cornell is a genius and Tom Morello`s guitar work is pure beuty. The genre of this album is right up my alley and no fillers on the album... <br /> <br />My fav. tracks: Youre Time Has Come, Out of Exile, Be youreself, Heavens Dead, The Worm, and Dandelion..
B0002OERI0|2.0|What happend? Did you decide to go mainstream and have all these people being posers wear green day shirts but only know american idiot or better yet, dont even know that and just think youre hot? You know why you won a grammy right? Theres a bunch of posers who voted you.HEY I gotta good idea! how bout you play stuff like you did on dookie! That was awesome and it DID sell.. You decided to release an album that would sell , but like dookie didnt? Shure I used to love this album but now i find how stupid it was because of that.
B00005R2IS|4.0|This film will give those who never thought much of Australian films either more fuel for the fire or a wake up call . <br />This is a classic and I suppose there are some who would call it a cult film , but it is full of intense performances and whilst not science fiction , it does have an otherwordly quality to it . <br /> <br />Forget Mel Gibson is in it - watch this film for its own brand of drama , revenge , thrills , action and good old fashioned mean-heartedness . <br /> <br />If you think about it , the plot for this film was recycled for 'Gladiator' , which was another breakthrough film for an actor from the Aussie part of the world .   <br /> <br />Buy and enjoy this distinctive film on DVD , with a healthy and worthwhile dose of extras .
B000B2YQX4|1.0|there was a time when Depeche Mode made some tight Synth Pop that was on time.there \\"Violator\\" Album is still cold to me.I dug that Disc.but this Disc is just boring to me.nothing memorable at all here.vocals are weak&the Production is dated sounding. they lost that vibe they use to have&this Album ain't worth no 4 year wait.
B00005RFVL|5.0|Many people have heard Michael Buble sing and I don't hear the feeling in his singing at all , so it leaves me cold . I get the distinct impression he's out to make money from a demographic who won't be around much longer .  <br /> <br />Robbie is a rocker who behaves a bit like Keith Moon and certainly used to act like him . He is also still alive , due to changing his lifestyle habits  . This was a stylistic change for him and it's not written anywhere that singers can't sing what they like - though I'm sure that selling all those albums in the UK didn't hurt . <br /> <br />This album will get your feet going and a lot of the players have been doing this for many years - they lend a lot of authority and credibility to the whole thing . <br /> <br />I suppose some people feel that all this was done better years ago by other people and that would be a good point to make . <br /> <br />However , what with advances in recording technology , it is a pleasure to hear a good modern recording of this sort of music  as not many singers like to try something new .   <br /> <br />You will probably know most of the songs . <br />If you don't like it , you can go back to the older stuff and if you do , same thing .
B0007GAEW6|5.0|this is not an album that most people like right away. It does take some getting used to. The songs do drag on at times, but overall frances the mute (in my opinion) is one of the most poignant, inventive, and powerful album i have EVER heard. I feel very proud of the fact that my fellow latinos have recorded some of these songs in spanish. AND FOR EVERYONES INFORMATION...THOSE \\"CRICKETS\\" ARE NOT CRICKETS, THEY ARE COQUI (CO-KEE)FROGS NATIVE TO PUERTO RICO. OMAR IS PUERTO RICAN.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I have always loved Cinderella stories, but this is by far the best. Portrayed in the setting of 14th or 15th centurey France, Danielle De Barbarac is not the richest girl around, but has a wonderful father that loves her. Because of him, she has learned to read and is very insightful on the world around her. <br />   The story begins just after Danielle's father has remarried to a rich baroness with two daughters, Marguerite and Jacline. WHile riding to a buisness venture the next day, M. De Barbarac suffers from a stroke, leaving young Danielle alone with her jealous stepmother. <br />   As she grows older, Danielle meets the prince of France, Henry, as he is trying to run away from his royal duties. They meet again later that day, but while Danielle is dressed as a rich lady, trying to save a servent her stepmother has sold away. <br />The prince falls instantly in love and the story takes off from there. <br />   The thing I love best about this movie, is the setting in France and how it seems to tie in so well with the countries history (Though I am no expert). The story line stays very close to the original fairy tale, and doesn't seem to be a mere product of Hollywood's ridiculous tales of unbelieveable romances and ridiculous plots. <br />   I highly recommend this to all who are even slightly interested. Anyone can enjoy this masterpiece, even if you don't like fantasy!
B00005JOI3|5.0|If you like movies with unexplainable events in an apparently ordinary, real-life situation, you'll probably like this one.  I mean psychological dramas like K-Pax and The Butterfly Effect, and certain ghost stories like A Stir Of Echoes and Dragonfly.  This one has ghosts (anachronistic apparitions), miracles, a pivotal car accident, extreme deja vu, and other mysterious happenings.<br /><br />It's ostensibly about a psychiatrist, Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) investigating the background of a young patient, Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling) who threatened suicide.  While searching for Letham, who walked out of his office after the specific threat, Foster visits Letham's mother, a waitress he liked, and others.  Foster himself experiences repeated and increasing deja vu and other illusions and unexplainable events while tracking down and confronting his patient.  For instance, Letham claimed his parents were dead; when Foster sees Letham's mother, he thinks she's real, but to the audience it's like a vision of her spirit.  These mysteries add up gradually, keeping the film intensely interesting.  The main question is whether  you will be disappointed by the end.  I was not.  In the next paragraph I'll tell you about it - it will spoil it for you if you haven't seen the movie yet, so don't read it.<br /><br />To me, the end explained everything.  To some, it might seem a cop out.  Something like in Jacob's Ladder, the whole movie follows the near-death semi-dream-state stream-of-consciousness of a dying man (Henry Letham), bits of his \\"life flashing before his eyes\\" mixed with the personalities of the people around him as he dies from wounds received in the car accident, events in the dream symbols of his memories, his guilt, words from the people fussing over him.  It all adds up at least considering that it doens't have to make perfect sense in a dream.  You might hate that; I could watch it over and over again.
0307276902|2.0|Whether I am wrong or not, I didn't believe half of this book.  The characters and situations seem a bit too \\"stock\\", and Frey seems to love building himself up as this tough guy whom everybody eventually fears.  If Frey had cut this book down by half, I think it would have been a smoother read.  The \\"love scenes\\" between Frey and Lilly bring any action in the book to a screeching halt, and the final scene between them seems to be cribbed from an 80s teen flick.  What starts off as such a promising read became for me an endless one, and I had to stop halfway through because I was growing very tired of Frey.  By the end of the book, I didn't even like him.  Read, but with reservations.
B000001GQY|3.0|I heard the Concerto 2 today on the radio, and I while it was competently played, I kept thinking of how slowly it was paced.  And I yearned to hear the Gilels version (with Fritz Reiner and the CSO).  Imagine my extreme surprise to hear it was Gilels!  But played with nothing like the fire and wit and playfulness of his 1958 version.  Perhaps Brahms would have wanted it played this way, with more majesty and solemnity, but it's not for me.
B0006L16N8|5.0|When I first picked up this CD the day it came out, I immediately popped it in to hear the first track, Square One...and was immediately disappointed.  It was a cool song...but I just couldn't appreciate it as \\"Coldplay\\".  I listened intently through the next hour of music trying to see the goodness...but in all honesty? It was a huge letdown... <br />I was on a camping trip, and needed a looot of music to pass the time in the car...so I popped it in again shortly after listening to its entirety (Speed of Sound however was/is amazing, hands down).   <br />This time was better...I'd come to remember some tracks and go, \\"Yeah, those are good.\\"  However...this second time around was STILL a letdown.  A Rush of Blood to the Head and Parachutes exceeded this new album at incredible lengths!  But it was this THIRD time when I realized the amazingness of tracks like Fix You, Talk, THe Hardest Part, and Swallowed in the Sea.  Before I knew it?  I got home from the camping trip listening to the cd over and over and OVER, loving every single song.  The onnnly let down is What If...it's really just an \\"okay\\" song, and the song THings I Don't Understand off their Fix You Single is a muuuch better fit...but it's all good. <br />No matter how you cut it, X+Y is a big sounding record...and deserves big praise.  You just gotta give this a cd a chance...as it's something a bit different from coldplay...sit down with your sweetie or listen to this late at night...and you'll understand why it's so great. <br />It's worth every cent...and their live concert is absolutely incredible as well, for the record. ;)
B00006DEFA|5.0|'Amadeus' won 8 oscars in 1984 when the movie came out and till this day it hasn't aged a bit. The new director's cut adds a few scenes that clarify some parts of the story. It is a long but there are no parts I felt could have been left out. <br /> <br />Even though the movie is about Mozart the title is his middle name 'Amadeus'. And for that there is a reason. This movie is not really about Mozart but about the Italian court-composer Salieri. A man who was a rival of Mozart and envied his talent. <br /> <br />Salieri is a man fighting with God. God helps him first with the death of his father so he can learn music. He goes to Vienna and meets Mozart but is astounded to see that he is just a vulgar little man.  <br />Saliere is insulted by Mozart all the time in love but also in music. There is a scene where Mozart meets the emperor and the emperor plays a little march written by Salieri. Mozart replays it and starts to freshen it up, mocking the old piece. Salieri loves and loaths Mozart at the same time, asking God why much talent is in such a vulgar little man while he has so little, being completely godfearing. The title of the movie also  <br /> <br />refers to that since it means 'beloved of god'. <br /> <br />The notion of sex (Mozart has an affair with the woman Salieri loves) becomes  more clear in the directors cut, something that was missing from the old  version. Also the very strained relationship with Salieri and Mozart's wife. Another cut scene was when he is teaching but is interrupted by digs but walks out and grabs a bottle of champagne. He drinks the bottle  on the street before coming home to see that his father returned.  <br /> <br />The audio option with remarks by Forman and author Peter Schaffer is very interesting. About  casting, the trouble with location and shooting scenes in then communist Czechoslovakia. Also things about the real life of Mozart <br /> <br />'Amadeus' is not a biopic! It's a succesful play based on sources and letters. Some tings have changed for the play and the movie so don't see it as the actual life of Mozart. <br /> <br />F Murray Abraham is brilliant as Salieri, and most of all as the old Salieri talking to a priest to tell of his plans and his life fighting Mozart.  <br /> <br />Outstanding also are the costumes and of course the brilliant music of one of the greatst composers of all time. Even if you don't like classical music however this movie will entertain you highly as a psychological drama.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|I love the Foo Fighters...their live show is breathtaking and their music, equally powerful.  Despite their grand career, I do believe that their best cd was released in their sophomore effort! <br />The cd opens up with a slow...beautifully crafted song called Doll...kinda...lulls you to sleep almost.  But then you're just jolted and sent flying across the room with the opening riff of Monkey Wrench and you're set on a ride that will never cease to stop.  Every song on here is absolutely stellar and has so much talent.  Each song is so different than the next, and it's quite a beautiful thing.  One of the greatest slow songs ever created is the song Walking After You, and it's simply amazing how a song can be so pretty, but so \\"in your face\\" like the eternal Everlong.  It's generally cheap...and it's pretty much a necessity in any music lovers library.  The Colour and the Shape deserves unsurmountable praise and your undivided attention...enjoy.
068987474X|4.0|This  book  is  so  hilarious!  It'll have  you  laughing. If  you're  sick  and  tired  of  making  the  same  old  excuses  for  those  silly  guys, then  I  recommend  you  read  this.  It'll  help  you'll realize,  you  don't  need  to  waste  the  pretty  and  it'll  give  you  the  closure  you  need to  move  on  to  someone  who  is  actually  into  you!
B000A7S4B0|5.0|One of the best albums of the year. I dont care what people say, this album is great. It makes it unique from the other two. BRMC has transformed and now truly made a name for themselves. Hey they arent like those cookie cutter bands. Just the music alone makes the album great! I saw them live and it is truly remarkable what they can do. Trust me, if its great live, imagine what it sounds like on the album!
B000002MP2|5.0|I was bored one day and i felt like getting another Green Day Cd. I had bought American Idiot and loved it. I was like, i feel like getting another cd, i wounder how Green Day's old stuff sounds like. Well my friend told me Dookie was the best one. So i saw a used copy for 1$, yes 1$. so i bought it. The cd was perfect, noc scratches or anything. I heard the whole cd then hit reset and started again. I was in shock someone would return this cd. I have lisitened to basket case (my fav song ever) at least 5 times a day, maybe more on some days every day since i bought it. I got this cd about 3 months ago btw. ITS THE BEST. I now own every Greenday cd!!!!
0451523938|5.0|I loved this book. The version I read had the Nabokov part in the beginning. It'd be best for anyone who's going to read Nabokov's part to read it AFTER you've read the story by R.L. Stevenson. Elsewise you'll ruin the story for yourself cuz Nabokov just breaks it down by taking excerpts of the already short novel and placing them in front of your eyes and imaginations BEFORE you've ever even read the featured story! Hopefully this version will one day put Vladymir in the back!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Depeche Mode, saca uno de los discos, tal vez el mejor en la etapa post-Alan Wilder. La primera vez que lo escuche pensaba que se habian quedado pegado en \\"Ultra\\" y \\"Exciter\\". Pero la segunda vez fue algo impresionante, es mucho mejor que \\"Exciter\\", que no es un disco malo, pero no de los mejores, a pesar del criterio de algunos fans.    La primera parte del disco es imprescindible y disfrutable por lo demas. \\"A pain that I'm used to\\", \\"John the Revelator\\" y \\"Precious\\", creo que quedaran en temas muy recordados. Sorprendente son los temas de Dave Gahan, mi favorito es \\"Suffer well\\"; tambien \\"Nothing's impossible\\",; en cuanto a \\"I Want it all\\", otro muy buen tema, pero el final se pierde un poco. La segunda parte, \\"The darkest star\\" se recuerda mucho a Ultra; \\"Lilian\\" es como \\"I feel loved\\" de Playing the Angel, pero mucho mejor creado y logrado. Los temas cantados por Martin Gore: \\"Macro\\" y \\"Damaged people\\" creo que algunos, no se merece a hacer un juicio a la primera; a mi me paso; sin embargo escuchandolo una y otra vez, me parece que son muy buenos temas, mejores logrados que \\"Comatose\\" y \\"Breathe\\" del disco \\"Exciter\\". Tal vez el tema algo incomprensible es el interludio \\"Introspectre\\"    Es un gran disco, creo que es el mejor despues de \\"Songs of faith and devotion\\", ademas de estar entre los mejores discos del grupo, pero tambien no se entiende al escuchar la primera vez, hay que escuchar dos veces mas, tal vez varias (tampoco pienso que tienen que estar en la altura de \\"Violator\\"), y ahi se dan cuenta en que nivel estan Depeche Mode.     Rating: 5 estrellas
0790742780|5.0|This had to be one of the funniest movies ever made. Weak ending, though.
B00005JNJV|2.0|Overly long, pretentious, and Liam HAM Neeson sounds like he's giving a zen lecture at an agricultural college.  Fight scenes?  Plenty of them, but you don't really see anything being done. Worst choreographed fight scenes--if this is a new Oscar category, this movie should win it.  Background of Batman looks like a ripoff of the origin of Dr. Strange mixed with Magnus Robot Fighter (Remember that one?)  Some interesting stuff with the effeminate looking badguy shrink with his \\"bag\\" of tricks, but Batman himself looks like he'd fit in better as \\"Fire Island Man.\\"  This picture could have been a lot more than what it is, but it isn't. Still, if you like seeing gravity defied, the laws of physics ignored, and a pretty boy trying to look mean behind a mask, watch this dvd with your hand on the fast forward button.
B00005Y228|3.0|I dont know much about Kylie. I know she been in music scebe for a very long time and released alot of albums. I bought this CD cuz of the song \\"Cant Get Ya Outta My Head\\". I liked the song only for its beat, not for the voice. Cuz her voice sounds like Minny Mouse on helium. I gave this album 3 stars  for some of the music which wasnt half bad except for the slower ballads, cuz I dunt like slow ballads. My favorite  songs were \\"Cant Get Ya Outta My Head\\" \\"Love Affair\\" and \\"Come Into My World\\". And the rest were ok.
B0002858YS|4.0|Hot Fuss by The Killers is almost a perfect album.  I enjoyed the first 7 tracks more so than the last 4, but overall, the entire album is interesting.  A bit overplayed on the radio, but what other popular band isn't?  I saw them live, and their show was great too.
B0000009TJ|5.0|This title, recorded before the BWTHW touring band disintegrated in a flurry of slap-fighting and mean-spirited \\"slam books,\\" offers an extraordinary glimpse of where Zappa could have gone if he had lived another fifteen years.  By this time in his career, Zappa was the undisputed champion of writing impossible compositions and then flogging his musicians into playing them.  Thus, with this tour Zappa settled into a more relaxed set that emphasized showmanship along with the musical feats. <br /> <br />Considering the number of musicians on stage during this tour, there is an amazing amount of space in these songs.  It is almost as though the whole thing was produced in a studio, with some musicians contributing a note or two per chorus.  The wide-open spaces on the album make a fantastic palette for Zappa to really emphasize his strengths as a guitar player, and they also leave room for the other greats in this band to express themselves. <br /> <br />The song list includes stellar versions of some Zappa classics, like Florentien Pogen and Inca Roads, along with a few suprises.  Who knew that Stairway to Heaven's guitar solo would sound so good as a horn arrangement?  Who but Zappa would have equated \\"Ring of Fire\\" with some sort of fungal (possibly sexually transmitted) infection? <br /> <br />I agree with the other reviewers that this is a good intro to Zappa, with one caveat: this is an extraordinarily cynical album.  Maybe all of the parody of Johnny Cash seems over the top in light of his recent passing, and you can probably forgive Zappa for devoting so much time to dissecting the sexual indescretions of Jimmy Swaggart. In any case, there are lots of points in this album where the easy facade of playfulness seems to give way to a very dark underbelly.  All I am saying is, don't put this in the CD player until you've had your morning coffee.
B000025JU0|3.0|Not as melodic as there other albums. More experimental but still has some unbelievable songs. I suggest omd singles it has all the goodies on it.
0440180295|5.0|Ernest Hemingway once said, \\"My aim is to put down on paper what I see and what I feel in the best and simplest way.\\" As a reader and a writer this is a quote that often reminds me to not exclude being concise and telling the story. Kurt is one of those authors who I feel truly tells the story. As Vonnegut's character Billy even stated that the story could've been about Dresden, it went into the psychosis of time and the entirety of what makes Science Fiction. From being captured by Tralfamdorians <br /> to predicting his own death, I found he never forgets to tell his the story. <br /> <br />Personally, I was very confused and almost want to re-read this book due to the amount of times in Billy's narrative he went to another time. What amazes me the most is the fact this incredible story is based around a very real event in our history. Not only was this event real, but the author was also a POW at Dresden! This is why it's almost surreal to find the character of the author mentioned in the book. I can't say I'm in the mood the analyze all the themes between time travel and space and war, but I can understand why Slaughter House Five is considered a classic.

0440224764|1.0|It is a real rare thing for me to be unable to complete a novel.  Like watching a movie at the theatre, I don't want to leave in the middle lest there be some redeeming quality in the finish of the show which would make it worth my money.  Sadly this snoozer broke me down to a point where I just couldn't stand it anymore.<br /><br />It started off well, but around 200 pages into it, it became simply unbearable.  The entire middle deals with the protagonist reading legal documents and preparing for trial as he recovers from his savage beatings.  Unfortunately it is a boring as it sounds, and I decided that I would be less torturous watching paint dry, or hitting myself in the head with a hammer than continuing such suffering.<br /><br />This is an unfortunate blight on John Grishom's writing career, because I have read several other novels by him, and was well entertained.  \\"The Partner\\" is simply not indicative of his writings.  Maybe it gets better toward the end, but I was 3/4 the way through before I gave up, and I couldn't see any light at the end of this tunnel.

0553296981|4.0|Das Tagebuch der Anne Frank (The Diary of Anne Frank) is a real story about the persecution of Jews in the Second World War.  It describes very nearly what happened with a Jewish family in Amsterdam during that time.  They had the luck to have a hiding place and people who helped them to survive longer than other Jews at this time.  This book gives you a view of the life and feelings from a family who worries that nobody hear them.  They couldn't do what everybody else could do they must be quiet and they must find somebody who can help the, to bring them food, clothes and all the stuff that you need to survive. It is writing in a diary from a nine year old girl.  The whole book gives you a lot of information but in the end there is not enough information.  It is an emotionally strong book for what you need basic information about this time to read it. I think you can read this book between 13 years of age and 100 years of age - every body can learn there something about the feelings from a girl that was forced to live in a time of human hate, stupidity, prejudice, and genocide, as a hostage because of fear.  This book should show us that something like that never happen again. And that we have to fight for human rights and peace.  I hope that somebody never has to write about a so horrible time like this time again.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Personally, I can die or kill for Steve Wilson and anyone else from this band.. and, technically, \\"Deadwing\\", after \\"In Absentia\\" was really a pleasant surpirse and one of the best rock album in 2005.. These guys are one of very few people on the road who still understand and really care about.. well .. music. This album is a perfect balance of heavy riffs, melody, rich dark lyrics and guitar solos..just how a modern rock band should be (that's a personal opinion though).  <br /> <br />It just feels weird that a band making quality underground music for about 15 yrs now, and until their \\"In Absentia\\" album, you couldn't find them in the regular shopping mall music stores like FYE. Probably they've been underground for while and now is the time to come off the cover.. <br /> <br />Pink Floyd could have been Porcupine Tree now if they were around..If you like Porcupine Tree, buy this album and if you never heard Porcupine Tree, buy this album too cause I'm sure it will be a whole new experience from then on..The only people who shouldn't buy this album are those who love Linkin Park and hate Progressive rock..
B00006IR5S|5.0|The much-anticipated film sequel to the 2001 \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" was a delight.  The 2002 film version of J.K. Rowling's second book, \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\", began with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) actually having a real bedroom and no longer living beneath the stairs of the home belong to his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw), Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling).  Uncle Vernon warned Harry to not make any noise or be seen while he, Petunia and Dudley entertained some very important people; but a mysterious house elf named Dobby (voice of Toby Jones) unexpectedly appeared in Harry's bedroom. Dobby warned Harry to not return to Hogwarts that year because something horrible was going to happen, but wouldn't tell Harry what it would be.  He did tell Harry, however, that he was responble for taking the letters that Harry's friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) had sent to him during their summer break from their first year at Hogwarts.  To punish himself for revealing too much information to Harry, Dobby began to hit his head against various objects, then ran from Harry's bedroom to create havoc if Harry didn't agree to not return to Hogwarts.  Harry, of course, refuses, and gets into trouble for Dobby's actions; but is rescued from the Dursley's home by Ron and two of his brothers in their father's flying car.  Thus began Harry's first experience at the Weasley's home before returning to Hogwarts for his second year: a year in which many terrible things began to happen. <br /> <br />As John William's wonderfully enchanting and memorable music helped to set the mood for the 2001 film \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", his modified music for the 2002 film \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" was equally wonderful in setting its even darker mood.  This was exemplified with musical arrangements such as \\"Knockturn Alley\\", \\"Meeting Aragog\\" and \\"Dueling The Basilisk\\".  There were also some fun musical arrangements used such as \\"Gilderoy Lockhart \\", \\"The Flying Car\\", \\"Cornish Pixies\\", \\"Reunion Of Friends\\" and the closing credits with the score entitled \\"Harry's Wondrous World\\".  Though veteran composer John Williams did not receive an Oscar nomination for his work in \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" as he had a year earlier for \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", he did win the BMI Film Music Award from the BMI Film & TV Awards for this film's soundtrack. <br /> <br />Overall, I rate the wonderful soundtrack for the 2002 film of \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it. I also highly recommend the soundtracks for the 2001 \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" and the 2004 \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\". I can't wait to hear what composer John Williams has written for the upcoming release of the 2005 film \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\".
B00005JNJV|5.0|The newest movie of Batman is the darkest and the best of any movie that has the Dark Knight sweeping off of roof tops onto bad guys who never really seem to learn how to point a gun right. Anway a star studded cast and possible one of the best evil plots ever to be put on screen gives this wild ride a perfect score..... <br /> <br />Batman Begins does not have the well known comical evil villians that everyone knows about; Two Face, The Joker, Poison Ivy, The Penguin, and perhaps the biggest cliche of them all, Robin, do not appear in this movie. However there is one character who does appear that really doesn't have that much publicity as the others do, and his name is the Scarecrow. Its really creepy how he plays a role in this movie.  <br /> <br />Let me just make it clear, that not having all those evil guys in the movie is NOT a bad thing. In fact that is one of the reasons why Batman Begins actually works rather than watching Danny Devito rise up out of a crater in the floor. Christain Bale [who plays Batman] gets a chance to dwelve into character more and we can relate to seeing someone who has a rough past trying to make a good future for him and everyone else in Gotham City. <br /> <br />The plot goes like this [Don't worry, no spoilers] After the death of his parents, Bruce Wayne goes on a trip around the world, trying to find his own inner self while also looking at the way the criminal mind works and how to conquer evil. This eventually leads him to prison in a foreign country, I think it was China, and he is left there to rot basically. <br /> <br />Liam Neeson plays a mysterious man named Ducard, who arrives at the prison to offer Wayne a chance to become someone that can fight evil in a secret brotherhood known as the League of Shadows. [The movie does a great scenery shoot of snowy mountains and rugged terrain and the music is just excellently placed in the right tone with it.] <br /> <br />Meanwhile Gotham City is like Chicago in the 1920's but just a few times worse. Corrupt cops and businessmen, and also crime lords rule the city. Katie Holmes plays Rachel Dawes, a district attorney, one of the few that's actually fair and not corrupt. She starts to realize that some thing big is starting to happen to Gotham. <br /> <br />A lot of flashy camera work and dramatic music really help this Batman movie to really shine on its own. As Wayne comes home and starts building a secret hideout for Batman he starts to see just how badly his city has turned into. Morgan Freeman plays Lucious Fox, a weapons designer who spends countless hours perfecting spyware and weapons vehicles. His services help Batman out more than once in the movie. <br /> <br />The plot takes twist after twist. Double crosses, and killing sprees are to be expected, as well as poisonous gasses that make people hallucinate. As puzzle clues start to come together the plot just gets that much more captivating.  <br /> <br />I will say the main bad guy is a surprise [it was for me] and the ending is dramatic and nail biting as the entire city is on the verge of chaos [But how and why are two things I am afraid you will have to watch and see for yourself.]  <br /> <br />I might also add that Michale Caine does a wonderful job as Wayne's always reliable butler. A great supporting actor if I ever did see one. So many great actors, one great evil scheme, and a great dark tone in the movie gives this a five star rating from me, so go out and buy it now!
1400082773|5.0|Readers, particularly younger ones,will be able to relate to this wonderful book on many levels. As one of a handful of  black kids at the schools he attended in Hawaii, Obama often felt like the odd-man-out.  He also has dealt with growing up without his father, and there was a period in his life when he didn't resists the temptation to use drugs.      Obama has led a fascinating life, growing up in Hawaii and living for awhile in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather. A third of the book deals with that part of his life.  Obama is the product of a white American mother and a black Kenyan father. I disagree with reviewers who wrote that Obama did not devote enough time writing about the maternal side of his family.  He wrote of his mother and grandparents with great fondness.  It was his mother who helped shape his racial identity as a black man and instill his pride in being black. Because of his mother's and grandparents' love he was able to deal with the indignaties that he and other blacks face in society without becoming angry at all white people.  To their credit, Obama's mother and grandparents never put his absent father down in front of him.    The second third of his book is about his life as a community organizer in Chicago. That part runs a little long, but it's definately worth reading.  He lived in Chicago during an exciting time in that city's history, when Harold Washington was mayor.      The last third is about his discovering his father's past and connecting with his Kenyan siblings.  I learned a lot about Africa that went beyond safaris and famine.  He wrote about people living normal lives and having family drama that is no different than what we experience here in the States.     If he hadn't entered politics, Obama would have a great future as a writer.
B000002I2M|5.0|If you don't like this album, then chances are that you have no mortal soul. \\"L.A.

It's great that the band ended on a high note, Jim went out with guns blaring (at least musically). I went to Paris a few months ago and I'm kicking myself that I didn't go visit Jim. But enough of that. This album is great, infectous, it's real music by a trailblazer. He has been a \\"drunken baffoon posing as a poet\\" but if you just take the time to listen, you can see that he's so much more. RIP Jim. Give this album a listen, you should like it.

B000020617|5.0|There's nothing fake about this album. It's one of the first CDs I bought as a 6th grader, and now that I'm almost out of high school I can look back on its purchase and say that it was a wise one. \\"Stacked Actors\\" is a hard-hitting opener that despite the false expectations that it may give for the rest of the album to follow, is a great track nonetheless. There are so many other infectious tracks on this album, of course \\"Learn to Fly,\\" (which is why I bought this disc in the first place) \\"Breakout,\\" \\"Gimme Stitches,\\" \\"Generator,\\" and \\"M.I.A.\\" The overall sound of the album is not particularly harsh, it's rather melodic but with enough of the right licks to keep things edgy (in most cases). <br /> <br />The bonus video is awesome, not bad for 1999 technology! This album even now finds itself in my roadtrip playlist, six years gone and still plays like the day I bought it. You really can't go wrong with Foo, so if you haven't already, give this album a shot.
034544678X|5.0|This book is excellent.  It's very easy to read, entertaining and the attempts at humor are humorous!  The first half of the book explains dog communication through body language, eye contact, smell, etc.  It was interesting for me to read since my dog is deaf, and I already knew that deafness doesn't really affect a dog, but now I was reading about how he really communicates, so it was confirmed for me that his deafness really doesn't matter.  The second half of the book describes specific dog behaviors (like jumping up), describes what it all means in dog terms, and describes specific ways of modifying the behaviors.  Anecdotes from the author's own dogs and client's dogs give a better understanding of the behavior descriptions.
B000002I2I|5.0|This is a great album, no bones about it. \\"Roadhouse Blues,\\" \\"Peace Frog,\\" \\"Queen of the Highway\\" are the real standouts for me, and the only real weak track is \\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" which was probably a reject from the \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" sessions and really doesn't sound like it belongs on this album. But I digress. It isn't all that bad. Back to the album...it's definitely worth having, the rest of the songs are great, if you have the disposable income, buy this disc as soon as you can. You won't be dissapointed.
B00003CXE7|4.0|It helps to have a smattering of historical background to fully enjoy the portrayals in this epic. Epics have historic consultants to advise the producers and directors on the periods in question and R. Scott obviously listened to his. The attention to detail is very commendable. The opening battle scenes with the Germanic tribes is laudable and quite realistic. Attention to costume and military weapons is exacting (except perhaps for the chrome helmets and swords and the 'kung fu' like handling of them), but thats hollywood entertainment... can't get away from it!     Russel Crowe as the fictional Gladiator is powerful and realistic. The portrayal of Commodus is also brilliantly done. Surprisingly not much has come down to us regarding the real Commodus and most of what we do have was written after his death. He was popular with the public for his games and free bread, but pretty much despised by everyone else, so what has come down to us is believed to have a very negative bias. History tells us Commodus always wanted to be a gladiator and is suppose to have actually fought several hundred gladitorial contests in the arena before the crowds. Of course, one would guess the contests would have been 'fixed' with the winner being a foregone conclusion. However a number of his contests were against wild beasts... (lions, and tigers, and bears... oh my). It is also speculated that the beasts would have been drugged to some level, but it would be impossible to 'fix' one of those contests for a sure outcome! The point being... Commodus was brave enough to get in the arena with them in the first place. He also raced chariots in the Hippodrome (the Circus Maximus), a very dangerous sport to be sure! He regularly wore gladitorial costuming around the palace and gave important positions and money to his gladitorial and charioteer favorites.  History also states he married his sister (alluded to in the movie) and was assassinated in his palace rather than killed in the arena (a forgivable error for the plot). Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent job of portraying Commodus as unbalanced (not insane). In the movie, Commodus murders his father but it should be noted that within the royal family murder was commonplace in this period of Roman history as a means of advancing to become emperor. (His father actually died in bed of illness, but this IS a Hollywood telling of history afterall.) If you don't get yourself bogged down in the historical inaccuracies, you will really enjoy this film. The acting by all is superb.     A footnote: Roman law gave the father the right to kill members of the family (particularly sons) if he was disobeyed or the family dishonored. So, life and death in Rome was looked upon with a very different perspective than we do today.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I usually like Jim Carrey movies, so I decided to give \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" a twirl. Wow. The rubber faced Canadian comic has certainly come a long way since the days of \\"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\\" and \\"Dumb and Dumber.\\" Heck, he's come a long way since his turn as The Riddler in one of the Batman movies. As far as I can tell, Carrey suffers from the same affliction that infected Steve Martin and Robin Williams, namely the disease that convinces wildly popular comedians to turn their backs on stand up in favor of careers as \\"serious\\" actors making \\"serious\\" films. Think about it. Martin went from such classics as \\"The Jerk\\" and \\"The Man with Two Brains\\" to \\"Grand Canyon\\" and \\"The Spanish Prisoner.\\" Robin Williams's turn towards the dramatic is even starker. He turned in memorable comedic performances in the television series \\"Mork and Mindy\\" and movies like \\"The Survivor\\" before moving on to the depressingly downbeat \\"Jakob the Liar\\" and \\"One Hour Photo.\\" What's going on? Well, once comedians hit it big, they worry about becoming pigeonholed in funny flicks. So they immediately seek out meatier roles, preferably ones with Oscar winning potential, in order to achieve longevity in Hollywood.<br /><br />\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" defies easy explanation. If I had to sum the film up in a few words, I'd say it's a story about how we need both good and bad memories to experience the fullness of life. How we get to that conclusion is the interesting part. The movie introduces us to a miserable looking chap named Joel Barish (Carrey) as he rides a train through the countryside on a rather bleak day. Our hero (or is it anti-hero?) has about had it with life. His biggest problem seems linked to bad relationships, but all of that is about to change when he runs into Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). The two immediately strike up a rapport, and it becomes quite clear that Joel and Clementine couldn't be further apart in demeanor. Barish slinks around as though he's trying to hide from the world, never talking above a hoarse whisper. Clementine is wild, with blue hair and an extroverted personality that screams, \\"Look at me!\\" Nonetheless, the old adage that claims opposites always attract seems to bear fruit here. Joel and Clementine strike up an intense relationship that soon finds them living together in a blissful state of love. As in many relationships, love doesn't last.<br /><br />One day Joel discovers that Clementine has decided she's not only had enough of him, but she's also decided to erase any memories of their time together with the help of a place called Lacuna, Inc. Run by a kindly doctor named Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), Lacuna operates a facility that can literally burn memories of any event out of a person's head. When Joel discovers what his love is up to, he decides to retaliate in kind. Unfortunately, once Barish is under the knife (metaphorically speaking) he decides that he doesn't want to lose his precious memories. What follows is a rollercoaster ride as recollections both good and bad fly through Joel's mind. We enter his mind and follow the pair's relationship backwards, at least I think it's backwards, and see how things went so wrong. We also see why Joel fell in love with this wonderful woman in the first place. The best parts of the film show us how Barish tries to hide Clementine in his childhood memories to protect her from Lacuna's invasive procedures. A subplot involving Mierzwiak and his subordinates Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Mary (Kirsten Dunst), and Patrick (Elijah Wood) plays a big role in the film's twist conclusion. \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is definitely not your typical Hollywood romance flick.<br /><br />First and foremost, I want to commend Jim Carrey for his work in this film. Anyone who has seen his manic comedy bits and over the top acting skills will express the utmost astonishment at his incredibly subtle performance in this movie. He conveys a real sense of pain and vulnerability without coming across as forced or insincere. The actor also plays the comedic bits well, mainly the memories of his childhood, without going for broad slapstick. Just as excellent is Kate Winslet. I like this actress anyway, and would watch her in practically any movie she chooses to do, but she's quite good here. She plays off Carrey perfectly, and the two have great onscreen chemistry that makes a relationship between them more believable. I can't say I cared for the subplot involving the Lacuna employees, which I initially thought only added unnecessary clutter to a storyline that demands your full and undivided attention, but their presence becomes important as the film progresses. The conclusion wouldn't work, for example, without Mary giving Joel and Clementine some important items that help them figure out what's going on. I was appreciative of any help at this point because this is one confusing film. Subsequent viewings are practically mandatory.<br /><br />Listening to the commentary track helps. Director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman shed a bit of light--perhaps sunshine is a better term--on the movie's intricate plot. A making of featurette and a conversation with Carrey and Gondry provide further insights. The disc also gives us deleted scenes, a music video, and an infomercial for Lacuna, Inc. I liked the movie immensely, but I'm not sure \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" rates highly as a date movie. My girlfriend quickly bored of the twisting plotlines and promptly fell asleep, leaving me to ponder the film's inimitable charms alone. Oh well. Watch Gondry's film, and then watch it again.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|Please buy this album.  It is totally worth the money, and it showcases one of the best bands around.  If you're not a die hard Death Cab fan, my title for this review may not mean a thing to you.  However, if you are a fan, and have listened to Plans, it probably does make sense to you.  The recording, mixing, and sound on this album are all nicely done.  It's crystal clear.  The songs are great, both lyrically and instrumentally.  Some of my favorite Death Cab songs are on this album, including Summer Skin, Marching Bands of Manhattan, Brothers on a Hotel Bed, and my favorite, What Sarah Said.  This song is amazing.  Gibbard really put forth a lot of effort with his lyrics, and I actually cry when I hear this song occasionally.  The arrangement is also excellent.  But going back to my title, Plans lacks the cohesiveness that listeners got from Transatlanticsm.  On that album, the songs all seemed to flow together.  On Plans, there doesn't seem to be a real message tying them all together.  But, like I said, it is an awesome album, and well worth your money.
B000002MJR|3.0|First off, in my humble opinion this is a recording of the tour in which Dire Straits really started to get tired.  The band is well-known for reinventing ways to play songs on different tours, but in this case, they left behind the spark that made new versions shine (see \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" off of their other live album \\"Alchemy\\"), and opted for operatic bombast instead. <br /> <br />The music is so choreographed and inflated on this show that it feels like the band is actually getting bored.  \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", initially a dry and sweet ballad, has turned into a slow and greasy orchestral mushy mass.  Same with \\"Private Investigations\\", where it's just a zillion keyboards - even the sparse bass line towards the end of the song is drowned out in long sustained synthesizer chords and saxophone riffs.  \\"Calling Elvis\\", initially lunar, sparse and odd, becomes a Vegas-style all-singin', all-dancin', \\"let's swap solos\\" deal, and is interminable.  Worst of all, Mark Knopfler's solos, which used to stir the soul, now seem mechanical.  On \\"Brothers in Arms\\", you hear the same riff is used about 10 times in a row - there isn't much creative spark there, unfortunately.  The same can be said of \\"You and Your Friend\\" - although Paul Franklin's slide guitar/dobro solo on that one is still very good. <br /> <br />I saw this tour back in '91, and again in '92.  It was good fun, but with nine musicians on stage trying to rock, there was little room for improvisation.  This definitely comes through in \\"On the Night\\". <br /> <br />Perhaps also adding to the sense of fatigue are the track-listing and production.  Where is \\"Sultans of Swing\\"?  Where is \\"Telegraph Road\\"?  Where is \\"Two Young Lovers\\"? All three songs were staples of the \\"On Every Street\\" tour, and they still rocked pretty soundly.  A lot of thought has been given to the production of this record, but in all honesty I don't think Guy Fletcher (also keyboardist for DS) is the best person for the job.  In allhonesty, Guy's a great musician, but he's also a bit of a nerdy engineer (who loves his equipment, and extensively documents all the aspects of each tour in his on-line journals, including how good the food is, etc.).  He's a perfectionist, and therefore tries to get the most \\"perfect\\" sound for each song.  The result is that he tries to get the sound of things as close as possible to the studio recordings.  \\"Walk of Life\\" is a clear example: live, it has more of a raw edge, because the guitars tend to be less echoey, and Knopfler's voice isn't as playful, but here it sounds exactly like the studio version, with a slide guitar thrown in.  A \\"perfect\\" version is not what we want - we want the full live recording, warts and all. The \\"warts and all\\" approach is what DS had opted to do on their far superior live album \\"Alchemy\\". <br /> <br />The more creative moments of the show were also cut off - where is the drum solo at the end of \\"Money for Nothing\\" (also a staple of this tour)?  Where is the playful interaction with the audience during \\"Walk of Life\\" (here reduced to nothing)? <br /> <br />So why still 3 stars?  Well, simply, it's Dire Straits.  Although pompous, inflated, and very mellow for a Dire Straits record, \\"On the Night\\" still translates the band's great musicianship, and does have very moving moments.  You just need to force yourself to forget the production and convince yourself they're having fun on stage if you really want to enjoy it.  You can get there, most of the time, but it hurts when the recording doesn't let you.
B0001XAS1M|5.0|WOW! What an album. This album is fantastic and made Meat Loaf a living legend aswell as spawning some of the most memorable and recognised songs ever. It was 'Bat out of hell', 'You took the words right out of my mouth', and `Paradise by the dasboard light `and' Two out of three ain't bad' which made an unlikely superstar out of Meat Loaf.   Every single song on this album is fantastic and it's been a while since I've actually heard an album that doesn't contain a single 'album filler'. This is why the album has lasted as long as it has. It's is one of the biggest selling albums of all time and has stayed it the UK charts for more than 474 weeks (That's over 9 years!). Bat out of hell was #36 in the US music charts in 1990 thirteen years after its release! And has sold over 35 million copies worldwide and is still selling today.     Meat Loaf is known as the Pavarotti of rock and this album really shows off his operatic, bombastic, over the top and theatrical style of music. This album is vital to anyone's music collection and if you haven't got a copy yet, it is well worth getting. I'm a huge Meat Loaf fan but I do not lie when I come to reviewing his music. Personally I think this album is an absolute masterpiece and is the proof that Meat Loaf is still, larger than life... and always will be.
0385474547|5.0|Things Fall Apart is a candid tale about Native African life in an Ibo clan in nigeria. It is about Okonwkwo, a self made man, who would rather die than bend. I read this book in an English class in college and was surprised to see that many of my non-African colleagues made value judgements about Okonkwo and the tribal belief systems. In my view, Achebe suceeds in presenting a fair account of life in an Ibo village. He did not try to sugarcoat it, told it as it was in the good old days. Any infusion of value judgements completely misses the mark. No one could have told a tale about the clash of cultures better than Achebe did in Things Fall Apart.
0345350499|5.0|this book was absolutely amazing.  aside from the normal plot and storyline (there's really not much to say there) the actual writing is beautiful.  marion zimmer-bradely has a talant that few others have (mary stewart being one of them) and its just wonderful to read.  its flows...and even though she uses ellipses a lot, its still very easy to read.  she uses great descriptions...especially metaphors.   <br />she also has impressive takes on the characters.  morgan le fay, who is often seen as evil but much less so with recent novels, is portrayed as someone entirely UNevil...she has her reasons for everything she did...and it was usually for the sake of avalon.  i think this is great, because when you have a character that is purely good or purely evil, they become 2 dimensional and uninteresting.  everyone has to have faults, and even the villains have reasons for doing things, even though they may not be valid.  morgan is a great example of how \\"good and evil\\" sometimes depends on who you are, where you came from, and what has happened to you. <br />i really loved this book, and it will remain one of my favorites.  i would definitly recommend buying and reading it!  just make sure you have a lot of time...because it is long.  :)
0380973650|1.0|Starts off with a weird sex scene and morphs into a collection of weird stories.  Got 2/3rds through it and trashed it.  What a waste of time.  I am reading \\"State of Fear\\" br Micheal Critchen.  Much better read.  Some people seem to like artsy crap just because it offends people.  Why?<br /><br />Waste of money - as I tried an author I was not familiar with, which is good to do.  But not Neil Gai man again.
0312330537|5.0|I found this novel to be enthralling, jaw-dropping, entertaining, mysterious, humorous with a typically Aussie dry wit, and impossible to put down. The characters the author draws, and the vivid pictures he paints of the tangled lives he and the characters are leading in Mumbai is fascinating. There are twists and turns, mysteries and motives to unravel, an insight into lives of Indians as well as foreigners living in Mumbai, on both sides of the law. Yes, it is a lengthy book, but at no time was I bored. I also liked the character's insight into his own behaviour and actions during his life. He made no excuses for anything he had done. The reader gets to know him better as he learns and comes to terms with his own personality, characteristics and behaviour. Brilliant. Totally recommend it.

B00000IQW5|5.0|Say what you will about this movie - that there were technical errors in regard to flying (as I've heard from men who have pilot's licenses.)  ...or pick the movie apart.  I fell in love with Richard Dryfus and Holly Hunter in this movie and the raw emotions I could feel as they expressed love for each other and then anquished over his demise hooked me.  I've been wanting to add this movie to my collection ever since. <br /> <br />By the way, I had a hard time getting past the characters they played in order to see them together in different rolls in the movie, Once Around.  It took a second look at Once Around but I came to love it almost as much as Always! <br /> <br />No doubt this was a chick flick, but hopefully the guys could enjoy the flight scenes!

0385510454|1.0|I was really dissapointed by this book! Ususally I can put down Grisham books. But this time, I wasn't even sure it was written by the same author I have liked so much.  <br /> <br />Very simple plot, no suspense at all, really predictable, 200 pages for the protagonist to get into character and then 20 pages to get everything solved. Really boring!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|everything has a reason.  The other day I was talking to a co-worker and he asked me, knowing that I was 60's hippy and big Jack Bruce fan, if all the guys in Cream were still alive and if I heard about a new cd.  I had not and told him that Clapton, Bruce and Baker were alive but I doubted if they would play together again.  The break-up wasn't friendly and Clapton would never play that type of blues again. <br />That same night I was in the local Price Club looking at big-screen tellies and lo and behold there was Cream, on the large 52\\" screen playing White Room.  It sounded and looked great.  I hustled down to the CD/dvd section and there it was....Cream at Royal Albert Hall.  But, it was $18 and damn I had to get my year supply of toilet paper and stuff.   <br />When I got home I put it on and by the second song, Spoonful, I knew I had my money's worth and more.  After a shaky start on I'm So Glad it all fell together again and I was back to 1966, only I was in front of my computer.  The pot was replaced by a beer but I was and still am in hog heaven.   <br />Out of the 81 reviews I read today there were five that were negative and I have got to say that I am finally sick and tired of this and these guys need to get their heads out of their butts.  No matter where you go on the net, Amazon, IMDB or whatever there are the few that just don't seem to get it or just want to write crap.   <br />Grumbling about no Strange Brew?  Please...it was silly in  1967 and as close to pop-40 as they could come.   <br />No I Feel Free.  I was disappointed with this also but give them a break.  That song is hard to do with the layered vocals.  No Swlabr, no Tales....so what.  Personally I am tired of hearing White Room on every \\"classic\\" rock radio channel I turn to.   <br />Sleepy Time indeed?   <br />Buckle up the recliner?  What did you think you were buying?  These guys are in their 50's and 60's and still playing better than anyone out there.  Have you watched VH1 or MTV lately, pure garbage and nothing can be done onstage even if you wanted to see it.  How can you be a Cream fan?   <br />One guy wrote...Oh my God, this is awful?  Well, turn it off, bring the dvd back and buy the newest Green Day cd.  That would satisfy any 14 year old. A money thing?  damn, I sure hope so.  These guys are getting long in the tooth and need the bucks.  At least they deserve every penny or does the word \\"bling\\" mean more to your hip-hop taste?  Clapton' playing was tired?  You've got to be kidding me.  Did you actual watch and listen?  Can you pay attention that long?  Did you check off that you were over 13 years old. <br />Forget the few negative reviews.  I have been mesmerized all day.  Two versions of We're Going Wrong, one of my favorite blues songs, was the icing on the cake.  Jack's voice is as strong and soulful as ever.To top it all off, they're smiling and enjoying themselves....something that they weren't doing in the 60's. The price of the dvd is a bargain and the 60's never sounded so good. <br />For a little while today I forgot about work and bills and I was back there.  Listen to Sweet Wine and see if it doesn't happen to you.
B00000IP4H|5.0|Yep, I said it, I think this album is very underrated, Chuck Billy proves on this album, how diverse he is, going from the great vocals on the old albums, do Death Metal vocals (mostly) on this one, and he does a great job, you can actually understand what he says, unlike most newer DM bands (Not saying that Testament is new DM, just meaning most DM bands today, aside from Suffocation and Nile), but his DM vocals are kind of like old school DM vocals, he does use his older voice at times on this album, and it blends very well when he does it, great variety, as for the music, while not being the fastest album, the riffs kill, and are catchy, and Gene \\"The Machine\\" Hoglan is a great drummer we all know, the album is mostly mid-paced, does pick up speed in some spots though. <br /> <br />As for the production, it is good, John could be heard a bit more, but it fits the album well. <br /> <br />And for all you old Testament fans, I can see why you're dissapointed in a way, but I think it adds a variety when a band tries something new, and Testament did, and did it well, as they further proved on The Gathering. <br /> <br />Demonic Refusal 5/6, Very chunky riffage, and heavy, the intro \\"10...9...8...7...6...6...6...\\" then it blasts you with all out heaviness <br /> <br />The Burning Times 5/5, Another cool song, has a wicked cool chorus and creepy guitar riff <br /> <br />Together As One 5/5, Chuck blends the DM growl with the old style here, fits very well <br /> <br />Jun-Jun 5/5, Weird song name, but it's actually one of Eric Petersons nicknames, not much to say about it, it just kicks A$$ <br /> <br />John Doe 5/5, KILLER SONG, killer riffs, again, Chuck blends the vocals here <br /> <br />Murky Waters 5/5, When you hear that water sound, wait till after, REALLY heavy, cool riffs being thrown around, a bit faster too, another one with blended vocal styles <br /> <br />Hatred's Arise 5/5, Starts out with a wicked cool riff, then another cool set of riffs, this one hasall old school vocals in it, old Testament fans should love, like me, and YES it has a solo!, that is something that the album lacks a bit of, then moves into a sludgy riff/outro <br /> <br />Distorted Lives 5/5, Opens with yet another cool riff, Chuck starts growling, wait till you hear that riff that comes in with 2:18 in and ends at 2:00...HEAVY, then moves into a catchy slower riff, very cool <br /> <br />New Eyes of Old 5/5, The only song on the album that Peterson wrote some lyrics to, Another cool opening riff, gets wicked heavy, and a cool chorus <br /> <br />Ten Thousand Thrones 5/5, A nice melodic intro, works it's away into the song, then Gene starts hammering, very DMish on this one, cool break <br /> <br />Nostrovia 5/4, More like a short instrumental/outro, does have vocals though <br /> <br />Well, there it is, and I think it's very underrated, it's chunky, heavy, and Chuck experiments on it, and does a very good job with the Dm styled vocals, but like I said, he still uses some old styled vocals too, very cool effect, I did mention the lack of solos on this, but still a great album, and no Testament is not a christian band either for those who think that because of the name, if that was the thought, I guess the great Exodus would be christian too, so don't think that, if you're a Metal fan, check this out, if you're a fan of old Testament with an openmind, get it, I'm sure you'll like it.
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin's fifth studio album, Houses Of The Holy, was released in spring of 1973. <br />Back in those days, Led Zeppelin were the gods of rock n' roll. They were one of those mainstream bands that influenced A LOT of musicans. With releases like Led Zeppelin II or ZOSO, They managed to build up a huge group of fans. However, with Houses Of The Holy, the band left their classic blues-rock sound and started to experimentate with various styles. And what was the result of these works? A diverse and inspired masterpiece! <br /> <br />The Song Remains The Same kicks the album off. This experimental rocker features great guitar work from Jimmy Page. Plant's voice sounds very cool here. Overall, it's an excellent album opener. <br /> <br />The Rain Song follows next and is one of the most underrated tracks in Led Zeppelin's catalogue! Some fans may complain it's too long, too boring - how wrong are they! This sweet ballad has a really beautiful melody. Plant's vocal performance is very soulful and emotional. The song has a very relaxing mood. It reaches its peak as Bonham's drums come in and it gets a bit \\"heavier\\" for a second. It's a masterpiece! <br /> <br />Over The Hills And Far Away has a nice acoustic intro but it builds up into a full oriented bluesy rocker. This track is very catchy and is one of my favourites on the album. <br /> <br />The Crunge is the only one here that I don't really like that much. It's an attempt at James Brown parody, but comes off as weird and silly. Still, I'm impressed by Bonham's drumming. <br /> <br />Dancing Days is a catchy rocker with almost psychodelic sounding riff. It's not the strongest track on here, but it's still good. <br /> <br />D'yer Ma'ker, on the other hand, is a pop tune with reggae flavour. I don't understand why it often gets so bashed. It's just a cool, funny tune. Nothing wrong with this one. It's pretty catchy; You may find Yourself singing this one! <br /> <br />No Quarter is an epic in itself. Jones' keyboard playing is amazing here. The song has a killer riff and an almost scary mood. Undoubtly, it's a masterpiece and of Led Zeppelin's best songs to date. <br /> <br />\\"We've done four already but now we're steady and then they went: One, two, three, four!\\" As Bohnam says this line, funky riff comes in and the rest is just classic Zeppelin at its best. The Ocean is a great funky rocker that closes the album nicely.  <br /> <br />Houses Of The Holy is an amazing album. It's not my favourite Zeppelin album (that honour goes to II) but it's definately in my #top 3 Zepp albums. The difference in sound separates it from other Zeppelin releases. If You're a fan of the band - don't hesitate! Get it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
078681859X|5.0|I'm an avid science fiction/fantasy fan and read books like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Eragon and Keeper Martin. The Bartimaeus books are highly original because of the the way magic is used. Mostly it is used in summoning things like djinnis and you have to then control the creature summoned while it does things for you. In the book Bartimeaus is actually the one with all the power, not the magician, Nathaniel.
6305949980|4.0|This is a fun movie for kids and adults alike.  It has a great musical score and very catchy tunes!  I would recommend it for older kids, or younger kids who are not scared of Halloween and all the associated spooky characters.
B0009MAO46|5.0|The movie's the same - that is to say, \\"awesome.\\"  But what's even more awesome about this new DVD release are the video and audio standards.  The toys always looked terrific, no matter what release format we were watching, but now... details in the backgrounds leap out like never before (check out the really grungy floor in Sid's room), even soft edges stay more defined and in focus and difficult colors like red are truer and no longer bleed.  The audio offers much sharper detail, a truer, more up-front sound and wider dynamic and frequency ranges.  It's as if someone took window cleaner and polished up the whole presentation.  IMO, Pixar's higher bit-rate really paid off - to the point where viewing other DVDs in my collection is now a bit disappointing!  Talk about setting a benchmark. <br /> <br />I didn't mention that you no longer need to buy the big 3-disc set to get the special \\"making-of\\" features.  Just one caveat: I'm sorry that \\"Tin Toy\\" wasn't included this time around. <br /> <br />Now I can't wait to see what TS2 is going to be like!  \\"Tin Toy,\\" anybody? <br /> <br />Roy
B000B5XOY8|5.0|I love this film! Burton's version is the definitive BATMAN!! I don't care what all the sheep are saying,blindly following the pack,throwing undeserved adulation on BATMAN begins. This film captures all the right tones of the character. Its got everthing going for it. Great script....hey chill out its a freakin BATMAN movie,not CITIZEN KANE...Great casting!  Great direction! Music! Action!! It is visually far better than that tripe Nolan put on the screen. The money shot of all money shots is when Batman is flying high above Gotham , pulls straight up and climbs through the clouds ,spinning slowly and as he reaches the apex of his climb WHAAMMMMMMM! Stalls for a perfect silhoutte against the full moon!  Now that is an image that sent chills over everyone and put a big fat smile on their face. That was an inspired shot,that was conceived by a genius! Theres not one shot in Batmans begins that can hold a candle to this one magical movie moment. I refuse to jump on the bandwagon and sing the praises of an inferior piece of dung. They got it perfect back in 1989 and everything that has came since pales in comparison. If you want the ultimate BATMAN experience Burtons is it. This is fun escapism at its best. Nolans version is a dark uninspired rehash of an origin that everyone over the age of five already knew.
B00005KHJR|4.0|I first saw this movie in its shortened version many years ago, and I must admit to having been confused at that time. However, there were two reasons for my confusion. First, all of the nudity was removed from the televised version that I saw. Second, I was too young to understand the sexual references that appear throughout the movie. Now that I have seen the uncut version with the various nude scenes and now that I am old enough to understand many of the references, I realize that this movie was carefully crafted to lead to the ending (which I absolutely will not tell anything about).<br /><br />The general story is that Rowan Morrison has come up missing, and foul play is suspected. Rowan is a child on the island of Summerisle, which is very isolated. Policeman Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) arrives by seaplane to investigate. Sergeant Howie soon encounters strange behavior by the residents. Many of the residents do not seem to know Rowan at all. Others tell Howie that she is gone (do they mean dead?).<br /><br />While Howie is bothered by Rowan's disappearance, the sexual behavior of the islanders bothers him even more. Before long Sergeant Howie learns that all the islanders are pagans, and they worship nature. While the sexual scenes are sufficiently subdued to allow an R-rating, I suspect that once upon a time this movie came close to the highest rating, at least in the uncut versions.<br /><br />I find the complexity of this movie interesting, a complexity that is revealed only at the end of the movie. Unfortunately I must leave the explanations regarding the complexity to a viewer, because I promised not to reveal any significant details. The ending causes some viewers to consider this movie to be a horror movie, though only certain aspects of the movie fall in that genre.<br /><br />This movie is a good exploration of modern paganism, though I am unable to discern the difference between inspiration and basis in truth as I am personally unaware of such practices. The practices shown in the movie seem plausible and all the more chilling once the totality of the movie is revealed at the end.<br /><br />Christopher Lee has frequently appeared in horror movies, but this time he is a sort of grand priest or shaman and is all the more chilling because he seems like he could be an actual person. I was disturbed to realize how easily the islanders fooled Sergeant Howie, and yet the story is quite believable.<br /><br />I recommend that if you see this movie you try to obtain the video of the song \\"Safety Dance\\" by Men Without Hats. The first time I saw the video I was reminded of this movie and was chilled rather than amused. Another interesting point of contrast is Jethro Tull's 1977 album \\"Songs from the Wood,\\" which contains a number of references that can also be found in this movie. After watching this movie I think you will reconsider any interpretations you may give this music.<br /><br />This movie is unusual in many ways. It is not scary, but then again this movie is not a traditional horror movie. This movie is disturbing and you should have a sense of unease that increases until the end. Some people might consider this movie to be an intellectual thriller. Call it what you will, I like this movie. I found comments that this movie is predictable to be partially true. However, those reviewers are using hindsight because there are several possible meanings and outcomes and just because they were lucky in their guess may just mean that they did not see the other possibilities.<br /><br />There is a little problem. This movie exists in several versions. There is the chopped up US version that clocks in at 88 minutes. Avoid that version. There is a 99 minute version (which is this movie, the \\"Limited Edition\\"), which is better, but there is a director's cut (that I have been unable to find) that supposedly has 117 minutes. Be careful what you buy, and I hope you enjoy this very unusual movie.unaware of such practices.

B0000214F0|4.0|I saw this movie in a theatre back in 1984.  A friend of mine had told me about \\"Caligula\\" back in 1981, but I had missed my chance to see it!  Gaius Caligula lived one heck of a life!  According to Mssrs. Tacitus and Suetonius (Roman historians), Caligula and (his uncle?) Tiberius had some swinging times, which, in my view, explained how they could justify some of the scenes that they showed in the movie.  Personally, I can't said that I enjoyed it, but found it fascinating none-the-less!  This review is for the \\"unrated\\" version.  For a \\"skin\\" flick, some serious cash was spent on this work - 4 stars!
B0002IU988|5.0|Alter Bridge is my favorite band and their debut CD is AMAZING.  I love this group so much, their songs have so much meaning behind them and you can tell that the members are 100% committed.  Myles Kennedy (lead singer) has an amazing voice, he has so much talent and brings a lot to the band.  I have seen Alter Bridge live in concert 2 times already this year and I will continue to go and see them when they come to my area again.  They actually sound better in concert than on CD which really says something (I think) with today's technologies.  They have awesome stage presence that makes you want more from them, if you have the opportunity DEFINATELY GO, GO, GO!!!!!
006072448X|5.0|Not knowing anything about the novel (I don't read reviews or even dust-jacket blurbs) I was a bit tentative as I'm...not...a big...fan of children (putting it mucho mildly).  <br />And I saw the writing layout was a series of letters, which I think has saturated the market a bit, or maybe I've just read too many at once (recently Amy Hempel, Chuck Palahniuk, Lydia Davis, among others, have all published stories in letter-style (Hempel's was wonderful though). Hell, I even started writing one before being dismayed by that)...but I was *immediately* taken in by the story. And this format works exceptionally well, as challenging as it is as a concept for an entire 400 page novel.  <br /> <br />Very briefly, each chapter is a correspondence, or better yet, her own term, \\"respondence\\" by the mother of a teenaged boy who is now in jail for a Columbine-like incident [if this is already an outdated or obsolete term: kiddies, this means the kid killed some fellow students on school property] to her husband, as they've separated since the incident.  <br />(none of that was a spoiler of any sort, so don't fret) <br /> <br />And I'll really just leave it at that. Look into it. You may love it, you may hate it.  <br />But I think you'll stick with it and have something to say about it.  <br /> <br />Deftly written and an engaging, and dare I say an *important* novel.  <br /> <br />This is Shriver's 8th novel, most of the preceding titles are out of print. Which is not only disappointing, it's shocking.  <br />If we as readers fail to support such strong writers how are we to encourage new ones?  <br />Literacy is dying: grab a handful of earth.  <br />But buy this book first.
B00005JNQA|3.0|Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter for the United Nations who accidentally overhears a conversation she thinks is linked to a possible assassination plot.  Sean Penn is the Secret Service agent assigned to investigate and/or protect her - it's never completely clear.  The movie holds together well for about the first hour, beginning with a tense scene set in Africa.  Gradually, we learn about Kidman and Penn's characters.  Penn is initially skeptical of Kidman's claims, which adds some nice tension.  However, the plot shifts dramatically during a confusing bus ride, and the movie's believability subsequently went out the window for me.  The script for \\"The Interpreter\\" reeks of doctoring - indeed Scott Zallian (Schindler's List) and others were supposedly brought in for re-writes.<br /><br />A major problem aside from the muddled plot is that Nicole Kidman's character is quite remote.  It's hard to sympathize with her when you never have any idea what she's thinking or feelings.  In this respect, her work and character here reminded me of her movie released just prior, the dismal \\"Birth.\\"  Penn is solid in his role, but he's certainly had more to work with in other recent films (Mystic River, 21 Grams).  Unfortunately, the brilliant Catherine Keener is wasted in yet another movie.  Her role is generic, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason for when she appears.  She seems to be Sean Penn's partner, but then he seems to work alone quote a bit.  Anyway, she's sadly wasted here.<br /><br />\\"The Interpreter\\" made a bit of press as the first major release filmed at the United Nations.  This setting does help with a few scenes, particularly those featuring the General Assembly.  However, many of the U.N. scenes consist of stairwells or small offices, even a bathroom.  The overall effect is probably not worth the hassle, as Sidney Pollack reportedly had to fight voraciously for permission to film there.  Speaking of Pollack, \\"The Interpreter\\" is only his second film in the last decade, following the bomb, \\"Random Hearts.\\"  Pollack was one of the most talented directors working from the late 60s (The Shoot Horses, Don't They?) through the mid-80s (Out of Africa), so it's somewhat perturbing to see him floundering with a mediocre thriller.  He has even contributed to this genre previously with the far superior \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" (1975); even \\"The Firm\\" (1993) is arguably better.<br /><br />In sum, \\"The Interpreter\\" is a decent thriller and time-filler, although it is rather old-fashioned in its storytelling and pacing.  In that respect, it has the feel of a 1970s thriller, although a weak one at that.  Extras include an unremarkable alternate ending and a very sedate director's commentary from Sidney Pollack.m in the last decade, following the bomb, \\"Random Hearts.\\"  Pollack was one of the most talented directors working from the late 60s (The Shoot Horses, Don't They?) through the mid-80s (Out of Africa), so it's somewhat perturbing to see him floundering with a mediocre thriller.

B000957O82|3.0|This was kind of funny in certain parts but it's one of those old tales I keep seeing in Hollywood: boy and girl meet, boy has a secret, girl discovers it, there's a misunderstanding, they hate each other and then they love each other. <br /> <br />Kind of cute but could we get some variety or is this all they think the masses want? <br /> <br />There's a theme here about being yourself which has a lot of truth to it, but, there's also another theme about standing out in the beginning.  Make your own decision.
B00005JNJV|3.0|Let me start by saying I'm a huge Christian Bale fan! I love the guy and I think he was a good choice to play Batman. This film is directed by Chris Nolan, the guy who did \\"Momento\\" and \\"Following\\". Two great movies that I highly recommend. Sadly this movie isn't anywhere near the level of those two as far as direction goes. It has a good cast; Micheal Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldmen as \\"seargent\\" Gordon, I don't know the actors name that played the Scarecrow but he is very good! And of course Christian Bale. The actor I could have done without was Katie Holmes, (not a big fan).  <br /> I thought the movie did a good job of showing how Bruce Wayne became able to do what he can do as Batman. It made sense and it was believable if you have an open mind. The movie I think, took itself too seriously though, which made it come off kind of corny but not in a good way. The movie was also VERY predictable!  <br /> With all that said I would recommend renting this movie. I wouldn't buy it until after you've seen it. It is entertaining! <br /> As far as Christian Bale as the new Batman, I think he is very good. MAYBE even better than Keaton, MAYBE!  <br /> The original Batman is still the best and probably always will be but this was a nice attempt to restart the series, if that's indeed what they're gonna do. The ending lets on to him going after the \\"Joker\\", so I don't know if they're gonna make a second movie with Christian Bale or if this was a pre-quel to the original. I hope they do make another one with Christian. I think it would be better than this one.
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the dog in the Nighttime By Mark Haddon was a great book. It tells the story of a part of Christopher Boone's life. Day by Day, while looking for who killed Wellington, his neighbors dog, Christopher finds more information on other subjects that he wasn't even aware of. And when you find information, that raises questions, but father didn't like these questions so they were banned from their house. Christopher didn't know at the time that these questions could change his life. Like about his mother, why did she die? What happened to make her die? And Father, why did he always lie to cover-up other peoples mistakes. Sure Christopher might need some help, but that doesn't mean that he isn't ready to find out the mystery. The mystery of does everything happen for a reason?     I really enjoyed reading the Curious incident of the dog in the nighttime because it totally flipped the story around in the middle. Which was exciting! Once you've read the first few chapters, you feel like you know what the story will be about. But then it all changed. I really enjoyed it because most of the time there was something interesting going on. My only negative comment would be that it was a little bit slow in the beginning, almost to the point where I stopped reading it. Also, since Christopher was a confused kid, the book was very confusing at times. I think this is a book for all students because its not a one gender book, even though the main characters, were mostly males. The curious incident of the dog in the nighttime was not an easy read. It was more of a challenging book because it was so confusing, and it takes longer to read because you keep rereading over what you just read, to clarify it. Overall, I really enjoyed this book.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|Imagine a Hitchcock thriller crossed with Raymond Chandler's \\"Farewell My Lovely\\" with a twist of David Lynch thrown in for good measure and you'll get an idea about how inventive, startling and powerful \\"Old Boy\\" is. Chan-wook Park's film dazzles with stunning imagery but more importantly with a brilliantly supversive mystery at its core. Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped after a celebratory night. He was headed home for his young daughter's birthday when he disappears. When he wakes up he finds he's a prisoner in a cutrate hotel without windows and a metal door. His meals are slid under the door to him, his only companionship is a TV and his grip on sanity begins to slip away after 15 years of confinement. Suddenly, he's released without explanation. He's given a cellphone, a wallet full of money and 5 days to discover who imprisoned him and why. Filled with rage when he discovers that his wife was murdered and he was framed for it, Oh Dae-Su tries to try down his young daughter with the help of a sushi chef he meets and gradually falls in love with. This twisted, dark tale has more twists and turns than a mountain road. Oh Dae-Su gradually unravels the mystery which stands at the heart of his existence but with each bit he unravels he discovers more unanswered questions.<br /><br />The image quality on this disc is extremely good as is the sound. The film can be viewed in the original Korean (although English is the default language for the film)and there are subtitles which, amusingly, don't always match what the English dubbed track has. Featuring a director's commentary as well as deleted scenes(with optional commentary) and theatrical trailers for this film and others in the Tartan Asia Extreme Cinema DVD releases, \\"Old Boy\\" like \\"Momento\\", will keep you guessing all the way to the conclusion. If this was an ordinary mystery, I'd say it would be worth viewing one time but the dazzling directorial skill of Park and the strong performances by the actors (as well as the well written script)make this graphic, violent suspense thriller worthwhile.<br /><br />You'll be glued to your seat as you try and put together the pieces of the puzzle about why this ordinary man's life is taken apart and, more importantly, why he has to put together the pieces of the mystery to regain his life again. Highly recommended.ll written script)make this graphic, violent suspense thriller worthwhile.<br /><br />You'll be glued to your seat as you try and put together the pieces of the puzzle about why this ordinary man's life is taken apart and, more importantly, why he has to put together the pieces of the mystery to regain his life again.

B000089CJI|5.0|Is all I can say about The Postal Service and \\"Give Up\\". I originally was, and still am, a huge fan of Death Cab For Cutie, Ben Gibbard's original project but I began to leech into the more electronic side of indie rock such as The Anniversary, DNTEL etc. Never in my life have I sat through an entire album and been mesmerized in a totally different way for every song. I honestly can't bring myself to skip a song it is really that good! I believe you can appreciate it alot more if you listen to it on headphones. My personal stand out favorites (and this is very hard to just name a few) are: <br /> <br />1. \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" - What a way to start off an album. Soft, sweet and simply heavenly. I close my eyes while listening to this and feel like i'm drifting through the clouds without a care in the world. This is probably my favorite track on the album. <br /> <br />4. \\"Nothing Better\\" - The trading of female and male vocals in this track, along with the steady yet content sound of the 80's video games really attracts me to this song. On the one side, the boy is singing about how he wants to be with this girl and how he's been foolish and so on, yet the girl is telling him she's not going back with him and finally, that he's had he's chance so say goodbye. <br /> <br />9. \\"Brand New Colony\\" - The sound of a BBQ lighter and the mutation into another soft, sweeping melody of the 80's video games is quirky, yet genius. The melancholic melody continues throughout most of the song with other sounds and bits and pieces looping through to tie this song into another stand out for the album. <br /> <br />Seeing as how Ben Gibbard has just released \\"Plans\\" with Death Cab (which I must say is a huge let down after the masterpiece that was \\"Transatlantacism\\", I sadly don't see another Postal Service album within the near future. However, it is obvious that the duo is hardly running on fumes from their previous projects and I can safely say we will definately seeanother album from this dynamic pair in the future.
B0001WTUH6|3.0|I'm not going to be too hard on this film because it really isn't that bad.  It's just not very good, either.  I'll start with the negative. <br /> <br />This movie has Kate Beckinsdale in it.  Kate Beckinsdale is HOT.  I sat through Serendipity just because she was in it.  I enjoyed Van Helsing even more than I would've because Kate was so beautiful as Queen of the Gypsies.  But in Underworld, Kate looks, well, just not very hot.  She's still beautiful, but the whole pale, bad haircut, bodysuit look just doesn't do anything for her.  So that's a big strike against the film right there. <br /> <br />Onto the positive:  The film has an interesting premise though it doesn't really explore any new ground with it.  These vampires are pretty standard vampires.  Ditto, the werewolves.  But there are some cool action sequences, a nice gothic feel, and solid acting. <br /> <br />Here's the BIG COMPLAINT:  Like so many series books now, this movie doesn't end.  It's just a setup for the next film.  I don't mind a few dangling plot threads, but this movie pretty much stops in the middle of the story.  The ending scene is as \\"To be continued . . .\\" as if I were watching a TV cliffhanger. <br /> <br />I HATE CLIFFHANGERS!  I cannot stress this enough.  When I pay seven bucks to see a movie, I want a whole movie.  Not just the beginning of the movie.  I want a set up, a conflict, and a resolution.  Without that, any film is just wasting my time. <br /> <br />Overall, an okay film, but one I'd probably never watch again. <br />
B000AADYRQ|3.0|To say that this record is a progression from \\"Transatlantacism\\" is not only ridiclous, it's downright criminal! I'm not sure what Death Cab were thinking when they recorded this but it is a very big decline from their previous record. Because it is Death Cab For Cutie, I will not hate it and I have purchased it but from another songwriter/performer's view, this is EXTREMELY mediocre.  <br /> <br />I could only really enjoy the song \\"What Sarah Said\\". The piano intro is very delicate and sweeps through the majority of the song, altering at some points. Ben's voice is very high in some parts which for me, reminisces the layout and beauty of \\"Transatlantacism\\". <br /> <br />My overall thoughts: Ben should give Death Cab a break and team up with Jimmy Tamborello and give the many many Postal Service fans another dose of their highly infectious, melodic electronic indie.

B000B7HZXM|1.0|This recording is a travesty; it should never have been made.
B0000AMRJC|1.0|Influential? How is this trash influential? This movie is disgusting..picture Grand Theft Auto turned movie. Yeah..now for those of you who'd like that..seeing drug dealers cussing a billion times and killing each other, then check this \\"classic\\" out.  <br />This movie is a story of drugs and violence. Now add this to that idea. This movie has nonstop violence, blood and guts and the dialogue is very original. It compromises of the F word and forced Cuban accents. What else? There's people selling drugs..using drugs...going crazy because of drugs..everything drugs. <br />Now what about this movie is influential? This movie is so ridiculous that it is incomprehendable on televison. Why? Because all they say in the dialogue is stuff like this: <br />You got the F'in coke, you F'in F'er? <br />No, F you your mother F'er <br />Man, I cut your F'in face up with my F'in chainsaw you F'in piece of F'in s#$% <br /> <br />Wow! Now that's some quality dialogue. And the visuals are really great too. You see people getting hacked up by chainsaws and getting blown away by tommyguns and getting high off drugs. This movie isn't influential..oh sure maybe it is to the drug dealers out there but how is it influential to most people? How is it regarded as one of the best movies? <br />This is absurd and seriously ridiculous. The dialogue is pathetic and Al Pacino's great acting skills are smuthered in F words. This movie is so \\"good\\" that it got this fancy DVD and is available at every store. Yet a wonderful movie like Malice is literally extinct.  <br />So, if you want to be like the rest of the world and watch this movie..then do it..and if you enjoy curse words and drugs and unnecessary violence...then you'll love this. Or if you love GTA and love running in the street hacking off people's arms..then definitely watch this.  <br />It's very disturbing that someone would like something like this and also very pathetic.
B000AP04OM|5.0|As much a merry musical as a riveting drama, The Sound of Music remains a classic that remains one of our favorite things. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are solidly terrific in Robert Wise's big-screen rerehasing of the (true) story of Austria's von Trapp family, who were forced to flee their Nazi-occupied country in 1938. Rodgers and Hammerstein's score (their last as a team) is magical and memorable, the way all great musical scores should be. Forty years after the flick was released, it's still a smart, strong film, and this anniversary edition is crammed with oodles of goodies, including an introduction by Andrews; a fireside reminiscence with Andrews and Plummer; sing-along lyrics; a reunion of all seven of the performers who played the von Trapp kiddies; behind-the-scenes featurettes and of favorites, the screen tests of Marni Nixon and Mia Farrow. Hope that under the tree, those brown paper packages tied up with string will hold this winner.

B00005JNTX|5.0|From the fertile, creative mind of fiction writer Frank Miller, arrives this powerful new comic-book turned movie entitled Sin City. The film itself contains the rare but measured ingredients of a true classic comic. What the viewer discovers is a crimson colored, black and white film jam packed with live action, special effect and and electrically charged 1950's comic drama from beginning to end. The extraordinary and exciting talents of Bruce Willis, Powers Booth, Michael C. Duncan and Rutger Hauer are further enhanced with the surprising, psychotic appearance of Elijah Wood as an super powered nearly unstoppable maniac. If this combination is not enough, there is yet, one other surprising feature in Sin City which nearly steals the show from all the other actors. This is the superb acting, extraordinary ability and super makeup of the multi-talented Mickey Rourke. Directing this fantastic assemblage of fine actors is multi-talented Robert Rodriguez, who has created in the words of this reviewer, a Cult Classic which will endure far into the future of films.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Rarely does a movie live up to its hype.   This is one of the exceptions.    If you didn't catch this movie in theatres buy it now.   It's not only as good as you've heard, it's actually even better.   For the first time, a Batman film has succeeded completely in capturing all of the elements of the fabled comic book character while also producing a Batman that seems fully grounded in reality.    Let's face it, though the Tim Burton Batman movies have a large and devoted following, those movies are ultimately less about the Dark Knight and more about Burton's ongoing fascination with offbeat characters and the bizarre.   Joel Schumacher's \\"Batman Forever\\" was an enjoyable if overly campy romp but by \\"Batman & Robin\\" this series had collapsed under the weight of too many villains, sidekicks, and corny dialogue.  It's telling that on the recent DVD special edition of that film even Schumacher admits that movie stunk and issues a public apology for running this series into the ground.    This meant that \\"Batman Begins\\" director Chris Nolan had a hell of a task on his hands when he took the reins of this film:  Deliver a Batman film for the 21st Century and restore credibility to the character.       The idea of going back to the character's origins was a master stroke and serves the story well.  Here we get the most detailed on-screen documentation of Batman's beginnings ever shown and damned if it all doesn't come off as more than a little epic.   Much credit must also go to Christian Bale in the title role.    It helps that Bale is the first Batman who is diesel enough to play the role without the benefit of a muscled, rubberized suit.   Seriously, you could probably crack walnuts on this guy's abs.    It helps that he also looks good in a tuxedo.  The whole appeal of Batman was always that as Bruce Wayne by day, he was the biggest playboy this side of James Bond.  But by night he was an obsessive revenge freak bent on striking at criminals from the shadows.  Bale'sgot the acting chops and the look to nail this in a minute.    The movie also benefits from a strong supporting cast.   While much of the pre-release publicity on this point went to the future Mrs. Tom Cruise, Katy Holmes, the real standout performances come from Michael Caine as Alfred, Wayne's stalwart Butler, Gary Oldman as the Gordon, one of Gotham's last honest cops and the city's future police commissioner, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, an inventor who helps equip Wayne for his war on crime.    One thing that is a holdout from the earlier Batman films is that the movie features two villains, in this case criminal mastermind Ras Al Ghul and Scarecrow.  But where this detracted from Batman in the earlier films, it works here because Nolan keeps the story centered where it ought to be, on the Dark Knight.    Granted these aren't exactly A-list Batman baddies but \\"28 Days Later\\"'s Cillian Murphy imbues Scarecrow with just enough serpentine evil to make him a major player.    Hardcore Batfans will of course know that Ras Al Ghul, though not a household name, is depicted in the comics as the Caped Crusader's most dangerous adversary.  As the head of centuries-old criminal empire with ties to all levels of government and organized crime, he's the Batman universe equivalent of Keyser Sose.  The movie gets this exactly right and you're likely to be thrown by a nifty twist involving this character.    If there's one complaint about this movie it's that it's perhaps too long.   But this is perhaps expected given that movie not only introduces Bruce Wayne/Batman, his entire supporting cast, two villains, and lays out a plot to destroy Gotham by driving its citizens mad.    Still this movie is a treat and stands along with Sam Raimi's Spiderman films as the new benchmark by which all superhero films will be measured.    So now that DC is shown that they can get Batman right on film and is getting ready roll out a new Superman next year, how about they drop the Caped Crusader and Man of Steel fixations and greenlight movies based on some of their other cool characters.      A Flash movie would be awesome if done right and, speaking of \\"greenlighting\\" where's that long-discussed Green Lantern flick.    Come on DC! Marvel seems to be prepping movies for just about every single one of its characters, including the C and D list ones. Get on the ball!    Here's my last suggestion in four words:  \\"Jim Carrey Is Plasticman!\\"
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This is no doubt the best Batman flick ever! Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman does an excellent job in my opinion! Way better than George Cloony and Val Kilmer! Michael Cain is the best Alfred ever as well. That is one casting choice where they did not go wrong. The story is very well told about how Bruce Wayne goes from a privilaged child who witnesses the murder of his parents to the Dark Knight out to use fear on those who pray on the fearful of Gotham. <br />
B00004WIBW|5.0|Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is an eerie version of the Washington Irving short story that goes beyond the initial narrative.  Burton twists the storyline and makes it his own, but he keeps the main premise and setting of the story:  Capturing the Headless Horseman, a Hessian mercenary (Christopher Walken), who came to America's shores to seek carnage but loses his head during his mission.  He wreaks havoc along the countryside twenty years later after losing his head in order to seek revenge and a head of his own.  He has no bounds, and he beheads anyone who gets in his way.  Sleepy Hollow takes place in 1799 in the village town of Tarrytown, New York upon the heels of the turn of the century, and Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), an eccentric investigator, is responsible for restoring the town's peace from the Headless Horseman.  Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is the daughter of the head townsman who has ties to the supernatural, and takes a liking to Ichabod.<br /><br />The film itself is amazing.  Burton adds a gothic dimension to Irving's tale and captures the gothic aspect of the story with a dark, foggy, and gory exhibition that is displayed with the characters, costumes and props in the film.  The cinematography is exceptional as well as Burton's teaming with Danny Elfman for the film's score.  The film has an array of horrific scenes of bloody gore, but the most interesting one is the scene where Ichabod takes jabs at a creepy tree with an axe that splashes out blood.  He discovers a most gruesome discovery as he digs deep within the tree, which will make you leap out of your pants.  Sleepy Hollow possesses the Burton traits that many will identify with:  Gray skies and dark nights that resonate doom and gloom and sunless snowy endings, and tinges of dysfunction within the family.  For example, Ichabod Crane is an investigator, but in his own life, he has unending nightmares of his loving mother and his monster-like father lurking in the background.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow will frighten anyone who is looking for a horror film during a Halloween night or anytime of the year.  However, this is not a film for small children, and I recommend Disney's version of \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\\"  Nevertheless, Burton captures the Halloween spirit with much precision.

B00004VVNB|5.0|(This review has spoilers.) <br /> <br />I like the story especially the plot twist in the middle when Logan found out there's no Sanctuary! The joke's on the runners! <br /> <br />And when Logan went back to the City, it made me think that Logan was like the first Neo, trying to convince everyone they were living a lie. <br /> <br />The ending spoilt that, however. It opted for a simple fairy tale ending by destroying the City. A better ending for me would be Logan and Jessica leading more and more people to the Sanctuary, for real this time. <br /> <br />One thing I didn't really get is when Logan turned good for real? It was never shown properly. He still \\"paged\\" his Sandman pals at the end of the tunnel, but then later he attacked them.
0307276902|5.0|I have never read a book like this before and I did not know what to expect.  I am raising a 16 year old grandson who is currently in rehab and I gave him the book and he read half of it the first day (today).  He called me tonight to tell me that he could hear his own words coming out of the book and it sounded like him.  I knew exactly what he meant and it broke my heart.  But it is also the first time he has been that honest about his own addiction.  God, thank you James!  I read it in two days.  I could not put it down, or get it out of my head.  The experience was like putting my own body inside of James' skin, allowing his brain inside of my head and living the life he was telling.  The writing was quick and racing and brilliant.  I found my breathing getting short at times, I would exclaim \\"Oh God!\\" at some points and put my head back and close my eyes, but then continue reading because there was no way not to.  When I finished the book, I just kept carrying it around until I received \\"My Friend Leonard,\\" the follow up story to AMLP.  It was wonderful and broke my heart, but it was a completely different experience than AMLP.  This book is a read.  Not a lecture, not a message (unless you want it to be), but a read.  It is an experience and it is exhausting and exhilerating.  And it haunts you and stays with you.  It's been a few weeks since I've finished it and I can't get it out of my mind.  There are some experiences that are unique and knock the breath out of you.  A Million Little Pieces is like that.  I hope he keeps writing and writing and that everyone gets to read AMLP, because no matter who you are, that experience is amazing!
B00005JNJV|1.0|..is the most interesting thing about this film.  it (the film, not the goatee) is long, boring, unoriginal, and overserious.  Early reviews would have you think that this film has something new to offer the superhero genre but it doesn't.  What the film DOES do is take the FUN out of the genre.    1.it's long and boring:  the film takes forever to get going.  It seems like about the first 45 minutes of the film is Bruce Wayne sortof 'finding himself' - which is fine, but it's just so boring.  We see him in a temple in the mountains talking uber zen psycho babble mumbo jumbo with Liam Neeson for what seems an eternity.  That would almost be okay if the stuff they were saying didn't come off as nonsense.  I can't believe Neeson could keep a straight face talking that trash.  They finally start fighting eventually, but Nolan's style detracts from the effect he is obviously trying to create: excitement.  It's hard to get excited or roused by action scenes shot almost in close-up.  Remember the scenes in the original Matrix where Neo fights Morpheus in the gymnasium?  that was shot from wide angles and you could really get into the acrobatic nature --the ballet if you will-- of the fight scenes.  Batman Begins was mostly like watching two or more people fight in a closet with invisible walls.  2.unoriginal.  You get all the requisite action crap as you'd expect.  Car chases, car crashes, more badly shot fight scenes, grappling hooks.. well basically that's it.  Absolutely nothing you haven't seen done countless times before.  The Batmobile flying across rooftops.. semi cool but not nearly cool enough.  Since we've seen this stuff before you'd think the director would try to make it special.  he doesn't. (we get it:  the Batmobile is really fast n stuff.)  3. Overserious.  This might be the biggest flaw.  Nolan needs to realize that a film about a man whe dresses up like a bat and goes chasing after a bad guy who calls himself the Scarecrow just ISN'T MEANT TO BE TAKEN ALL THAT SERIOUSLY.  That's why all the psycho babble crap comes off as so ludicrous.  We don't watch this stuff for the insight it might give us into anyone's psyche.    I'll reference the first (and by FAR best) Batman flick to close: that film had a few things this films wholely lacks.  Style for one, and panache for another.  The film had a vibe that just worked.  Batman Begins doesn't work.. for me anyway.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Ok so im not really into all that \\"f*** you, f*** your mom, f*** God, f*** the grass, f*** the sky, f*** your dog, f*** everything, i hate you\\" music, and Slipknot at times is most definitely that. But see, that's what they do. Do not knock these guys as musicians; they do what they do well. If you're pissed off, and you just wanna go nuts, put on \\"Duality\\" or \\"Opium of the People\\" or \\"Spit it out\\" off their first album. If you wanna sing some hardcore music with halfway meaningful lyrics, then man, \\"Before I Forget\\" is the song for you. If you wanna brood about a girl and drown in your longing, then \\"Vermilion, Pt.2\\" says everything you want and need to say. And if after that, you're still sad, \\"Circles\\" or \\"Bother\\" off the Stone Sour album is good. But that's how I think people should listen to Slipknot. They should just play a few songs here and there, not obsess over them and dress in black and take the sh*t so seriously. I'm far from emo or punk and stuff and all that goth stuff is nowhere close to my thing; but that's not what it's about. It's about the music. And these guys hit or miss, more often miss in my opinon, but when they hit, they hit dead on. I wouldn't recommend buying this album or any of their other stuff, but you should download a few of their songs and play them when you need a good song that'll fit the mood you're in. Also, I think they were wise to soften up a bit from their earlier stuff;they are much more musical now and this album is the only album of theirs I can find more than one song I like on. So,anyways, I recommend these songs off this album: <br />\\"Prelude 3.0\\" <br />\\"Duality\\" <br />\\"Opium of the People\\" <br />\\"Circles\\" <br />\\"Before I Forget\\" <br />\\"Vermilion, Pt.2\\"

B0009JAENU|5.0|Hilary Hahn's playing always combines a powerful interpretation with meticulous technique that may very well be the cleanest on the planet. This naturally provokes a lot of curiosity as to how she might approach Mozart, and this disc certainly doesn't disappoint.  In this recording she plays the most famous and representative of the Mozart sonatas, and as you might suspect Hahn brings them to life with penetrating intellect and sparkling clarity.    This recording also features a break with traditional articulation.  Most modern instrument recordings feature smooth, singing lyricism contrasted with lilting, dance-like lifts of the bow.  Hahn defies this tradition, preferring to keep better control of tone with her bow on the string, even in runs that are traditionally bounced for percussive effect.  This may disappoint Mozart listeners who feel \\"dancing\\" is the only appropriate contrast to \\"singing\\", but the result is that Hahn's sound is warm and lush and the resulting continuity allows longer phrasing that is not constantly chopped apart by excessive contrasts in technique.      If you never listen to a lot of Mozart, I think it's unlikely that this rather esoteric debate will affect your experience at all.  I warmly recommend this recording as a great value for both its fabulous playing and the very generous and discriminating selection of sonatas included.

Unsheathed, it smiled at me, curing up in a grin. <br />He took the hat from my mouth.  <br />`Tell me you love me,' he said <br />Gently I did. <br />The end came anyway.\\" <br />  <br /> A must read novel The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold comes a haunting, intense, and beautifully written story. Good Morning America says, \\"Read this!\\" This is such a wonderful novel I almost had to read the whole thing twice, reading lines and chapters over again.  <br /> <br /> This novel is so strange, a spectacular way of portraying a girl Susie Salmon who tells her story from heaven. She tells her story from heaven. She tells her tale and watches the world pass her by; watching her family, friends, and cops try to uncover the story of her disappearance. As she experiences heaven, she longs to be with her family again, but most of all to help her family to lead them to the scene of her death, to her murderer, and the story behind it all. <br /> <br /> She finds her whole life, after death, a miraculous masterpiece. Built by this wonderful writer Alice Sebold, Alice makes this story a novel where you must force yourself to set it down. Each word I read made me want to know each word that followed. Each chapter, wanting to know what happened in the next. Once finishing the novel, I wanted to relive each page, each word once more. I felt like I was living in the book like I played the character Susie Salmon watching my family struggle with my death and trying to find my murderer.  <br /> <br /> I recommend this book to high school/ college students and adults. For a reason of rating. If this were to be a movie I would have rated it PG-13 for violence and sexual content. If you read this book, each word will drip from the page as you read. Enjoy!
B000002GW5|5.0|there aren't too many artists who have ventured into the arena of live/studio mixes, quite like this one. the only other one i can really think of is rattle and hum. and compared to that one, running is vastly superior. this is because running on empty is vastly superior to most any other album in its own right. it just capture life on the road and jackson's own coming of age story in a perfect, succinct expression of seventies rock and roll. a perfect balance of the intimate and the grandiose in rock music.
0440237688|4.0|Imagine a world where the greatest pain in your life was a mere scrape on the knee or a thumb jammed in the door.  A world where everyone was the same, there were no choices, and everything was under control.  A life free of worries or fear.  The Giver by Lois Lowry describes this \\"perfect society\\" within its pages.  The Giver does a great job of describin the many consequences of this perfect society in an exciting and easy to read book. <br />       Lois Lowry proved that good authors do truly use their imagination in her description of society in The Giver.  She goes into thorough detail describing every function and the many rules within the society.  She also uses an exciting storyline to give information about such a society.  Lowry also uses her book to include a message about our world.  This message is of how we need conflicts, emotions and even pain to live a thourough life.  She tells of the many disadvantages to a \\"perfect society\\" <br />      Lois Lowry does do a great job with her details in her book.  However, The Giver is not the book for very high level readers.  It is written with simplicity, readers from grades six and above would most likely be very capable of understanding this book.  However I believe many of the older would enjoy reading about the many concepts that are introduced. <br />       Many of us would most likely be able to realize the drawbacks of an attempt at a \\"perfect society\\".  However The Giver gives us an insightful simulation of one of these societies created.  It is an easy read, therefore good for all ages.  I would highly suggest reading the giver to everyone who wants to expand their thinking on society.

Anyway this is far from the best album of the year, it doesn't even make my top 10 but it's still a decent effort and you should certainly listen to it before you judge it. Most of the people who bash this album probably haven't even heard a track off of it, other than the ones they play on the radio and MTV. Give this album a listen and than decide whether you think it's good or not. GGGGGGG-Unit!!!!

EDIT: Actually, it just occured to me that maybe i should put a review here. :-P Rage Against the Machine are an amazingly passionate, powerful and political band. Their sound didn't change much across all of their albums, but then again, it never really had to.    If you're new to the band, start here. If you're not, well, you know what to expect. Great album from a truly great band. 5 stars!

0684833395|5.0|When I first picked up Catch-22, I was hooked by its immediate sense of confusion and hysteria.  These themes seem to saturate the book, creating a satirical, memorable novel that points out the senselessness of war.  The renegade bombardier, Yossarian, consistently attempts to rise above the rule of Catch-22 and return home to the States.  Yet Colonel Cathcart continues to raise the number of missions, causing Yossarian to come up with different ways of rebelling, whether he decides not to wear a uniform, or asks Doc Daneeka to send him to the hospital.   <br /> <br />The novel not only talks about the ridiculousness of certain customs in war, but the tragedy caused by war.  Every soldier risks his life on every mission he flies, hoping that he will survive just this one so that he can be one step closer to going home.  Towards the end of the novel, Yossarian walks through the dirty streets of Rome, where he contemplates the state of the world. <br /> <br />\\"What a lousy earth!  He wondered how many people were destitute that same night even in his own prosperous country, how many homes were shanties, how many husbands were drunk and wives socked, and how many children were bullied, abused or abandoned.\\" <br /> <br />Catch-22 left me with an understanding of the fruitlessness of war.  Every wacky character's seemingly senseless actions culminated into a grim picture of the war front.  This was one of the best books I've read, and it is easy to see why it has become a true literary classic. <br />
B000002L9M|5.0|It has been 10 years since that blustery day in november '95 when I ran out and bought this album and I must say, it has kept me warm on those lonely stormy nights in fall and winter;-).But besides breaking new ground-as DM always does, this is the album that catapulted the Fab-4 into the \\"goth\\" catagory and earned them the nickname \\"Depressed Mode\\".What I REALLY want to emphasize here is how far ahead of its time this album was-though recorded in the 80s, I honestly feel that it was meant for the 90s.Besides the prevailing theme of nihilism with an stroke of death[e.g.:fly on the windscreen], there's a great deal of Sexual content on this album.Quite a bit of it[it doesn't matter too, world full of nothing]focused on coming of age. But it's \\"stripped\\" that really grabs me and surely I may be wrong here but it Totally evokes images of vampirism.Very much a concept album, almost makes me think that Sisters of Mercy must have been an inspiration(lol).
1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is a very interesting book in which he depicted the views of an autistic teen named Christopher Boone. As he tries to unravel the mystery of what happenend to Wellington, the neighbor's dog, we catch a glimpse of what his world is like. The reader experiences everyday events in a different point of view. It is interesting to see the different relationships that the character has with other people, for his condition makes human contact uncomfortable and often frightening. The dog is a connecting component of the book; in trying to solve the dog mystery, the boy uncovers many more mysteries, such as the fate of his mother. He leaves his hometown of Swindon, a daring move for someone like him. He travels to London to solve the mysteries once and for all, scared out of hits wits by his father. For him to live his life with autism, he needs routine. Even leaving his house, to go to the candy store is a big move. Imagine going to London-- alone. I like this book because it is different from most books. The reader actually becomes Christopher, autism and all; they see through his eyes. The reader must examine a different logic, the logic known to Christopher Boone.  <br />*I highly recommend this book.
B000683VI4|1.0|I read the book. I LOVED it! Couldn't wait to see such a lovely-simple book put into a movie. <br /> <br />I was stunned.

(So much so that I'm writing my FIRST ever \\"review\\".)
0670033375|3.0|The problem with \\"Collapse\\" - an inferior book in many ways to \\"Germs\\" - is not the prodigious research or the volumnious effot that obviously was involved in the creation of this work.  If anything it is slightly TOO detailed, many times obscuring the message with needless minutia (ocean currents, humidity, life on Patagonia a zillion years ago).  <br /> <br />Diamond contends that the driving force of human history is ecological.  In many ways this is correct: Nations in certain latitudes have temperatures and weather that are conducive to producing food.  Some ancient peoples settled in areas with favorable minerals or ore deposits while others lived in areas with adequate rainfall.  Here's the rub:  When ecology alone is the determining factor, the prime component of history - people and their motives - become mere automatons. Even more important, were those societies that survive(d) protecting the environment out of serendipity, cultural bias or trial and error?   <br /> <br />The largest fault with the book - and the one that has drawn the most criticism - is the cherry picking of examples supporting his case. All the failures are microcosms occupying such a limited space that doom is almost certain. This problem is current: \\"Nations\\" the size of Chicago lie prostrate after a single disaster.  The larger a state, the more resilient it is to such disasters. <br /> <br />There is much to learn about misuse of the land, water and air. The difference between modern civilization and those he describes is our realization of our actions and our technical prowess to affect it. The absence of cultural strength is disturbing:  Why did Israelis carve a modern state out of the desert when all around them the world remained static? Why did the Mayans flourish and fail? Why did Egypt become a static state? Why does African, the birthplace of mankind, continue to wallow in poverty, failure and starvation? <br /> <br />One should note such ironies as using hundreds of thousands of trees in order to tell readers that we are not preserving our forests.  Lately, Diamond has been doing the talkshow circuit going on about how depressed he is with the modern world and how we would be better off emulating the \\"primitive\\" peoples of the world.  I, for one, am more confident of mankind's ability to overcome obstacles as we have proven over the past 100,000 years.   <br /> <br />

B0000524CY|5.0|Ah the Exorcist!  This movie has definitely earned its reputation as a classic among the horror movie community.  Any movie about possession fails in so many levels because this movie was just so awesome for its time.  I've seen a lot of horror movies, and a lot of them have disappointed me.  For example, the so called classic Rosemary's baby just didn't do it for me; I was let down, expecting something more.  The Exorcist was able to fulfill my desires.  I was searching for a movie that left you with an uneasy feeling, excellent directing, was actually scary and so forth.   Well after viewing the Exorcist, my quest for the perfect horror movie was incomplete.  I still haven't found the perfect horror movie and I may have to make it myself.  The only thing that was wrong with it was that I wasn't scarred.  That is probably because I'm not a catholic, I'm an atheist.  Keeping in mind that this film came out in 1973, it made sense that it scarred the crap out of everyone.   <br /> <br />I was amazed at the special effects at certain points and wondering how they did them.  How the bed lifted off the ground?  How did young Linda Blair hovered above her bed without any noticeable strings?  And then there is the infamous scene that was nicknamed the spiderwalk that was never even used in the movie, yet you can see it here in \\"the version you've never seen\\".  I loved those moments.  But I was never clutching a nearby coat and draping it over my head while looking through a tiny hole, like what my mother did when she saw Psycho in the movie theaters with a friend.  A friend of my parents, told me about the time he took his mother to the movie when it was released.  He was embarrassed because of the language, figuring his mom would frown upon it.  Yet his mom actually loved the film in the end.  You have to remember that when this was released, that sure, swears were said every once in a while in movies, but nothing ever came close to that which came from the Possessed Regan's mouth in 1973, and that was shocking in itself.   <br /> <br />As for the actors, they all did fantastic jobs.  The person who did the voice for the possessed young Regan was amazing.  Some Death metal bands such as Malevolent Creation use audio samples of that voice in their songs because it just sounded so evil.  But there are problems that occur for people who do such great jobs acting in movies such as these for their first films.  Linda Blair had trouble getting work after this because everyone saw her as Regan and they wouldn't look past that; preventing her from showing off her talent as an actor.  And the famed Director William Friedkin; other then the French Connection (which he did before the Exorcist), does anybody really know of anything else he made?  I looked up a list of the rest of his movies and none of them rang any bells.  It's sad that great horror movies can sometimes ruin the careers of their creators.  But then again, maybe that is the price of a masterpiece.  I'm going to give this Movie 5 stars because it deserves it.  You all know what the plot is so I won't have to explain it.  Just keep in mind that if you are not the religious type this may not scare you, but you will be able to witness a great movie anyways.  I'm even considering reading the book in which this movie was based upon.  Hoped this helped.   <br />
B000AV2G3I|5.0|I like to \\"imagine\\" which of these songs would have found their way on to a Beatle album had sanity emerged and the four would have continued recording.  The obvious hits such as \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Power to the People\\" are there, but my favorite couple of of \\"hidden gems\\" are the heavy metal version of \\"I'm Losing You\\" and a bluesey piano dominated song I don't remember hearing before, \\"Isolation.\\"  The former could have used George Harrison cleaning up the guitar rifts a bit and a little tighter recording, but it is a great, great classic Lennon rock and roll song. \\"Isolation\\" is more finished, but the \\"middle bit\\" slips a little, and it would have been nice if Paul McCartney had been around to help.  The collection as a whole is well worth the price of admission.
0553213105|5.0|I have read \\"pride and Prejudic\\" by Jane Austen a total of 5 times now, and it just gets better every time. This book is definately a classic. The characters are witty, and the story is timeless. \\"Pride and Prujudice\\" is an interesting love story involving a very proud man named Mr. Darcy, and  stubborn beauty named Elizabeth Bennet. Together they create a conflict so strong that at one point, neither wants anything to do with the other. But their love for each other is undeniable, once they both get over their pride, and yes, prejudice against one another. They arent the only love story in this classic novel, however. Also fighting for love is Elizabeth's gentle, kindly older sister Jane. She has fallen for the very rich, handsome Mr. Bingly, and it is as if he is under a spell of her charm. Though his sisters try to tear them apart, they somehow find each other again before its too late. Still the question of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's love for each other remains, will they ever give way to their love for each other?  Or will pride and strong will keep them from eternal happiness? Only time(and lots of page turning) will tell. This is one of few books that has kept my interrest and i hope it can keep yours too.
0486236951|3.0|I am disappointed by this book.  There are no real life pictures of what can be done with this technique - only the cover.  It does provide the history, how to do the stitches and a lot of patterns that can be transferred as the \\"Techniques and 188 Designs\\" in the title promises.  However there is no challenge or inspiration to apply this art.
0783117523|4.0|Gia Marie Carangi died at the age of 26 from AIDS.  When they tried to remove her body from the hospital bed, the skin literally fell off of her back.  These were the early days of AIDS in the mid-80s, before there were drugs to treat the disease.<br /><br />Gia stars Angelina Jolie in all of her wild child beauty, a 17-year-old girl with a belly full of abandonment who becomes the hottest model of her day.  Even with skills to successfully handle that life, modeling and high fashion is a dirty business, and Gia was the least likely to triumph. Her story is a downward slide into the hell of heroin addiction and eventually AIDS.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie (AJ) is a perfect fit for the role.  The story is told in mock documentary style, piecing together interviews with those who knew Gia professionally and personally.  There are also voice-over readings from Gia's journals.  And of course we get to see AJ in all kinds of great designer dresses and get ups.  The unrated version has a lot of nudity, too, because apparently Gia was known for her \\"freedom of physical expression.\\"  The girl had no inhibitions.<br /><br />But her Achilles' heel was her emotional neediness.  Early in the movie, we see Gia with her mother, played by Mercedes Ruehl.  No wonder she had abandonment issues.  Her mother was childish and selfish, and she abandoned her young daughter and was no longer a part of her life.  Gia never recovered from the loss, and this abandonment set a pattern for her relationships and behavior the rest of her abbreviated life.  Gia preferred the love and physical comfort of women, but drugs were her true love.  When she discovered heroin, it was downhill all the way.  Her mother was clueless about her daughter's needs and the danger she was in.  At one point, Gia leaves modeling and enters drug rehab.  When she tries to live a life outside of modeling, her mother constantly pushes her to \\"go back to work\\" in modeling.  Clueless, childish, and selfish, the woman seemed incapable of loving anyone other than herself.  She boasts how \\"we were like girlfriends\\" when what Gia needed was a mother.  Faye Dunaway's character took Gia under her tutelage and nurturance, but ultimately Gia faced more abandonment and plunged further into heroin to ease her pain.<br /><br />This is a very effective movie that covers a lot of territory quickly-maternal abandonment, drug addiction, the brutality of the fashion industry, the popular culture of New York in the 80s, and of course AIDS.  For perspective, keep in mind that Gia was one of the first women in America to die from what was known as the \\"gay plague\\" in the 80s.  She died in 1986.  When we see Gia in the hospital after she's been diagnosed, the medical professionals attending her are covered from head to toe in tyvek; clearly, we had no idea what we were dealing with at that time.  How was it transmitted?  Air?  Saliva?  Could you get AIDS from touching someone who was infected?  As her mother said in the movie, \\"we were all scared.\\"  She refused to let Gia come home and live with her during her illness; instead, she and her husband put Gia up in a cheap hotel until Gia was so sick she had to go to the hospital.<br /><br />Compare Gia's fate to Kate Moss losing modeling contracts because of cocaine abuse.  Did the fashion industry learn its lesson from Gia?  Two words here: tough love.<br /><br />Gia was a stunningly beautiful girl who lived a high profile and glamorous life.  But addiction's ends are always the same: jails, institutions, death.  It does not care about celebrity.  This movie stuck to my ribs, so to speak; I thought about Gia for days after viewing it.  What a deeply tragic and moving story.  The movie does have its flaws, but those are mostly in its construction.  For emotional impact and effectiveness, I give it a solid 4 stars.  I recommend this film for biography buffs and AJ fans, but for those considering a career in any area of the fashion industry, it is a must-see tale of caution.s a must-see tale of caution. <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|I first heard John Legend singing the hook on Slum Village's \\"Selfish\\" and I was intrigued by what I heard...then the \\"Used To Love U\\" single dropped...and THEN I caught a live performance that he did on BET in honor of Smokey Robinson doing \\"Quiet Storm\\" and I knew that this brotha had the goods...<br /><br />I have to begin by giving Kanye West madd props for putting a real singer out there.  John Legend's voice has the soul and warmth of the old schoolers...something that is missing from the current crop of R&B singers.<br /><br />This collection of songs is one that has to be played from start to finish...the gospel vibe is ever present throughout, but he also has the influence of current production which keeps the mix interesting.<br /><br />The strongest tracks to me are the ballads...\\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"So High\\" in particular.  \\"Refuge\\" is perhaps the most overlooked track on the album...Legend's lyricism is refreshing (particularly when he focuses on classic content versus the latest slang) and his love of melody makes this project a joy to listen to.<br /><br />My only gripe with this project is the \\"image building\\" songs, in which Legend portrays himself as a chronic cheater, which sounds more like a role the A&R department decided to concoct to make him marketable to the kids,  rather than focus on marketing Legend as the classic artist that he SHOULD be promoted as.<br /><br />I STILL give this album 5 stars as it is the best R&B release of the year in my book.
0066620996|5.0|This book is very insightful for any company owner or employee. Jim Collins brings powerful concepts of management and work ethic into a simplistic form. Which differentiates companies that are good and companies that are great.<br /><br />The Hedgehog Concept [parable] was a delightful surprise in the book. I personally had not heard of the famous essay by Sir Isaiah Berlin. This concept in the book is the topic of the 5th chapter, I have it bookmarked and refer back to it often. A Hedgehog has one central vision and has or develops a system to make it workable. Hedgehogs know how to simply their complex worlds. This question is... are you a hedgehog or a fox. Reading Good to Great will give you a clear understanding of this and many other concepts, bringing the workplace to a new level.<br /><br />I highly recommend Good to Great for all in the pursuit of excellence.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw the movie Serenity and I loved it! I had never seen the original Firefly show, so I bought the box set. <br />What an interesting, quirky, genius show. A perfect cast, an ingenious universe. Action, adventure, humor, surprises. Off axis camera work, jerky focused CGI shots. Breathtaking music. This show could easily be the basis for a semester of film appreciation class.  <br />The chemistry between the characters/actors is amazing, especially the delightful interaction between Mal and Inara. Their communication is as much in what is NOT said as what is said, through facial expressions and knowing glances. The Ron Glass' Shepherd and the River characters are also extremely complex. Unfortunately, their stories are never fully told. And with Shepherd Book now dead in the movie, we will never know. I have not cared about TV characters this much in a very long time. <br />And yet...the show always seems to be fighting for its life. You can feel the urgency and futility as the show's creators struggled with the network, ultimately doomed for cancellation. If only the Sci-Fi channel could have taken on the show back in 2002 when it was cancelled by Fox. We can look forward to a movie franchise, but an opportunity was definitely missed. The movie was great, but the \\"mood\\" was different. Besides, I need my fix now! <br />Favorite episodes: Serenity, The Shindig, War Stories.

B000A0GP0Y|4.0|When you think of remakes you think of movies that don't strike you the way the original did. Most remakes are so bad that they disgrace the original. Others are just average. This is the exception. I've seen the original so I'm not just basing it off the remake. The original is okay. I didn't really like it all that much. Don't get me wrong, its a good movie but it just doesn't appeal to me being from a younger generation. That's why we have remakes. To appeal to younger audiences. The remake has most of the same dialogue in it with more jokes. The characters are funnier and I believe the actual football game is longer. The remake shows more practicing than the original also. The characters are all there but they either have more dialogue or are funnier. Overall this is a great remake.

B00000F566|5.0|The world did not need this movie. It has no redeeming social value. But if there must be a movie about a would-be Peace Corps idealist who gets swept into the earthy world of a brainless but hunky dance instructor, it might as well be as perfectly executed as this one. <br /> <br />There are the characters.  Robbie the Creep, the self-centered waiter.  Neil the Nerd, who considers himself the catch of the county.  \\"Baby, sometimes in life we see things we don't want to see.\\"  Johnny Castle, the dance instructor.  \\"Nobody puts Baby in a corner.\\" And Baby herself.  \\"I brought a watermelon.\\"  What gems.   <br /> <br />There are the different classes of society: the waiters, the rich clients, the low class dirty dancers. <br /> <br />There's the goofy but perfectly constructed plot.  A pregnancy, need a dance fill-in, gotta rehearse so let's get dirty together, sorry daddy I lied, and to top it all off: I was wrong about you Johnny, and thanks for knocking up my daughter. <br /> <br />There's even the pretense of a theme.  Some people are willing to stand up for other people, no matter what it costs them, particularly when their hormones have become involved. <br /> <br />And to top it all off, a climactic dance number that includes every character, every theme, and every element of corn.  Johnny and Baby dance, Johnny goes and gets his dirty dancing chronies, Johnny and chronies dirty dance back to the stage, and everyone dances together. <br /> <br />The perfectly constructed stupid movie.  I watch it every time I can, and find another brilliant detail each time.  <br /> <br />
B000005PRX|2.0|I've been a Batman fan for almost all of my life. I own every movie and every Animated Series DVD collection, so i know what i'm talking about. I hadn't watched this, or the orginal, for quite a while. I sat down yesterday with the original, and loved it on a level i never had before. Everything was perfect, and i made up my mind that it's one of the best movies i've ever seen. So, with hopes high that i would enjoy Returns on a deeper level, like the original, i popped it into my VCR, and was disapointed beyond belief. How could Burton go so wrong with this one after hitting gold with the first? First off, Batman is overshadowed WAY too much in this movie. He seems to be an afterthought to Catwoman, Penguin and Shreck. That's a big problem. Another one is the Max Shreck character. I don't know why they decided to put him in. Frankly, he adds nothing to the story, which is another big problem in the movie. The story is,simply, uninteresting until the last 45 minutes, when the Pegniun goes nuts on all the kids. That would've been a great story by itself; Penguin hates what his paretns did to him, and wants all the other kids to experience what he did. There. Nothing overly complicated. Instead they decide to go with Max Shrek wanting to create a power plant that doesn't supply energy to Gotham, but drains the city of it. The mayor doesn't agree, however, so Shreck tries to make Penguin mayor so he can go on with his dastardy deed. YAWN. The entire movie seems a bit off for some reason, except for the music, which is superb, and the set design, which is spell binding. So, to wrap up, don't bother with this. It's overrated, and coming from a die hard Batman fan, that means a lot. This could have been so much better, bottom line.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wow... certainly the most eccentric, wild, and diverse album of her career. Had the remix track been left out, there would not have been a single \\"bad\\" track. Every one is listenable, enjoyable at moments whether it be the catchy chorus; the wild, electronic beats; or the snarling accent of a voice that seems to be maturing to fit even the ballads for which 'Zone' gives forth. Bravo, Britey.  <br /> <br />Keep this in mind:  I reviewed her music... not her boobs
0792833201|5.0|Steven Spielberg has delivered to us many blockbuster movies, and most of them we have enjoyed watching on the big screen. WAR OF THE WORLDS, JURASSIC PARK, and of course E.T. But when Spielberg and Tobe Hooper got together to make POLTERGEIST, it was destined for great things. <br /> <br />First off, the acting is top notch (Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Oliver Robins, and Heather O'Rourke are all superb) and there are no actors in this movie who underplay or \\"overact\\" their roles. The family is right on key and so are the rest of the characters. The special effects are not over the top and the scenes of supernatural nature will surely frighten you (this stuff does happen in real life, make no mistake). The suburban setting is particularly more memorable than some big prestigious mansion. It's not the typical place to find supernatural lurkings and so it works on a much deeper level than, say, ROSE RED (which I still like).  <br /> <br />The story centers around a family moving into a brand new home in a beautiful neighborhood that seems so quaint and idea for family life (the house actually belongs to one of the crew who worked on the film). Little do the Freelings know that their new idea home sits on an indian burial ground, and that messing with holy soil won't win any points. After the family settles in, we see all these strange and creepy events taking place, whether it be the stacking of the chairs in the kitchen, or Carol Anne sliding across the kitchen floor while dad watches in disbelief. All the supernatural occurences are splendid, but terrifying at the same time. The events begin to get worse, with Robbie nearly getting eaten by an old and very scary looking tree, and then Carol Anne swallowed into the unknown by the light from the closet. But one of the best sequences has to be the clown that almost pulls Robbie under the bed. You already knew from the beginning how nervous he gets with that clown, but then his fear is completely realized in thatsequence. Zelda Rubenstein comes into play as the likable Tangina, a psychic with the power to help the Freelings get Carol Anne back. The first time you see the monster in the movie, it's not as scary as the unexplained events...but it still creeps you out when you see it. The ending to the film was very funny, but you'll like it. The tv was one of the \\"unknown gateways\\" to which you could hear Carol Anne, but not know what was happening to her...well that last bit where the tv in the motel room is shoved off was actually amusing, but you'll understand why they did that. <br /> <br />POLTERGEIST remains one of the strongest horror flicks of all time. No doubt about it, it remains one of my top ten favorite horror movies of all time with its strong cast, superb visual effects, and effective storyline. Prepare for some good scares, take a seat with some popcorn (careful not to spill), and don't get to close to the tv because \\"they're here\\".

B000B2YQX4|4.0|So, when did it become against the law to change?  If a band or solo artist tries anything outside of what was once commercially acceptable, people hate.  But if they re-run the same beat over and over again, people hate. <br /> <br />As a DM fan for over 15 years, I can say that yes, originally, I wasn't feeling this CD.  I had high expectations and was hoping for yet another Violator or possibly Music for the Masses, but Playing the Angel is great on its own merits. <br /> <br />I think the people who are writing negative reviews are those that were only into DM based on their singles, on not on their albums as a whole.   <br /> <br />Playing the Angel is more along the lines of Songs of Faith and Devotion for me with the same dark undertones and creative lyrics. <br /> <br />For those true DM fans out there... buy this CD.  You'll enjoy it's sound and by the way, Dave Gahan's voice has never sounded better.
B000AUDHW8|5.0|I wrote a review on this two years ago but it vanished!Yentl is an exellent widesreen dvd in stereo,although the dilogue is not as clean as the musical scores.This dvd is in region 2 and requires a multiregion dvd player such as the pioneer dv383s,set to playback ntsc at the output.While the studios argue and play games through 2007,this release will be an excellent choice.Your standard dvd player wont play this disc.Further,the studios will only allow you to buy the crappy fullscreen vhs version.My last review was removed.You cant handle the truth you see.I hope you read this before amazon removes it!The french version is better than the full screen uk edition.I own both discs and the crappy vhs movie 5 star rated.Thank you from Stewart L.02/19/07 1057am est
0446577383|5.0|The Camel Club is one of those hard to put down books, the kind that keep you up late at night, and that, when you are done, leave you feeling a little lost for awhile.  People that have liked Baldacci's previous books will no doubt feel the same about this one.  If you've never read one of his books, and you like thrillers, you should pick this one up.<br /><br />With a central group of characters you would not normally pick for a thriller-a rag tag group of conspiracy buffs led by a former, uh, well, best not to spoil that, I suppose-this book tells a tale about what might happen if a whole bunch of unlikely things happened at the right time and the right place.  Not that individual events and plot developments are necessarily hard to swallow-if you think that, you'd better pay more attention to the world around you.  But taken together, it's a little far fetched.<br /><br />(Although the Secret Service is probably pleased to have someone, not on the government payroll, expend a great many brain hours figuring out novel new ways to do things they are paid to prevent, so they can make sure they have systems and training in place to counter such an attack, no matter how far-fetched it might be.  Sort of like crisis planning provided by the marketplace.  Kinda handy, I'd guess.)<br /><br />Anyway, all this is absolutely OK, because it's a great read.  You've got a couple of Secret Service agents trying to figure out why another agent died on Roosevelt Island, and thus getting close to a big bad plot, and our aforementioned group (the Camel Club) trying to figure everything out about that plot.  In the background are various bad folks inside and outside government trying to do their nasty best to destroy or save things, often with little effective difference.<br /><br />Baldacci probably goes a bit too far with some of the exposition inside the terrorist and government bad guys minds.  Not anywhere near as bad as Clancy and others would get, but maybe a bit much.  Nevertheless, the viewpoints found within the book are worth thinking about.<br /><br />But in the end, no matter how much thinking you might do, the main point is turning the page to find out what happens next, particularly at the end when the tension is way high and the action is plowing along at mach speed.  Great book!ch.

B00005NEUF|5.0|I had no idea this is the \\"UK issue,\\" when I picked this up. I love this album. All the songs are very catchy. You just have to tap your foot. The cover art is interesting...I'm sure all the men picked this one up instead of the other version.  <br />I think The Strokes should've kept NYC cops on the other version, it's way better than that other bland song they chucked on there. Anyway, I absolutely love the song \\"Last Nite.\\" But all the other tracks are equally good.  <br />I don't know, is this garage rock? Or \\"indie\\" (what is that btw?) Or just plain old rock? Don't ask me. (Because I wouldn't know.) All I know is that this is great rock. Whatever type it might be.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
0099456761|5.0|Writing this first novel from the point of view of an autistic 15-year-old, Mark Haddon takes the reader into the chaos of autism and creates a character of such empathy that many readers will begin to feel for the first time what it is like to live a life in which there are no filters to eliminate or order the millions of pieces of information that come to us through our senses every instant of the day. For the autistic person, most stimuli register with equal impact, and Christopher's teacher Siobhan, at the special school he attends, has been trying to teach him to deal with the confusing outside world more effectively. At fifteen he is on the verge of gaining some tenuous control over the mass of stimuli which often sidetrack him.<br /><br />When the dog across the street is stabbed and dies, Christopher decides to solve the mystery and write a book about it. His favorite novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, becomes his model as he investigates the crime, uncovering many secrets involving his own family in the process. Innocent and honest, he sees things logically and interprets the spoken word literally, unable to recognize the clues which would tell him if someone is being dishonest, devious, or even facetious. As he tells his story in a simple subject-verb-object sentence pattern, Christopher tries to communicate and give order to his world, and the reader can easily see how desperate he is to find some pattern which will enable him to make sense of it.<br /><br />Christopher's investigations eventually require him to make some remarkably brave decisions, and when he faces his fears and moves beyond his immediate neighborhood, the magnitude of this challenge is both dramatic and poignant. Strange places have always been traumatic for him, and he has difficulties with his emotions. \\"Feelings,\\" he says, \\"are just having a picture on the screen in your head.\\" He responds either with logic or with the anger which sometimes overwhelms him as result of fear or frustration, and the reader cannot help aching for him and empathizing with his family.<br /><br />Christopher's coming-of-age story is most unusual, if not unique, and he ends the book a much more mature 15-year-old than he was when he started. With warmth and humor, Haddon creates a fascinating main character, allowing the reader to share in his world and experience his ups and downs, his trials and successes. In providing a vivid world in which the reader participates vicariously, Haddon fulfills the most important requirements of fiction, entertaining at the same time that he broadens the reader's perspective and allows him to gain knowledge.

B000002U82|5.0|I amazed that neither VH1 or Rolling Stone put this album in their top ten albums of all time.  And then again they hailed Britany Spears' and 50 Cent's debut albums so its not like they're credible anyway.  This is where Pink Floyd got their sound together and made an album that everybody (that is everybody who has not been brainwashed by MTV) can enjoy.  After Syd Barret left the group after their incredible debut it looked as if Floyd was done for.  And with a stream of somewhat mediocre to downright terrible albums it looked as if that were true. That is, untill this album came out.  Then everything changed.  Pink Floyd had gone somewhat mainstream and the whole rock audience was now into their music. <br /> <br />A brilliant concept album, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", borrows from the psychedelic and British psychedelia music of the 60's and combines it with the new sounds of the progressive rock era of the 70's.  The Album was written mostly by bassist Rodger Waters and not once does he fall flat.   <br /> <br />The album opens with a bunch of assorted noises taken from nearly every other track on the record.  The first track, \\"Speak To Me/Breathe\\", was first written for a British movie before the album was even thought of.  Originaly an acoustic ballad about the hardships of everyday life, it was drastically rewritten and <br />included on the opening of the record.  It still has the same meaning but at a much more artistic level.  The next track, \\"On The Run\\", may very well be the first techno music ever recorded.  It is one of several instrumentals on the album and is a simulation of someone running away from their life or fears.  The track, \\"Time\\", starts out with its familiar clock chimes and electric drum opening and then explodes with angry and powerful lyrics about the passing of time and how you don't realise intill your old how much time you've wasted.  The song contains one of David Gilmore's best guitar solos and ends with a reprise of, \\"Breathe\\".  Next track is, \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\", and is one of Floyd's most haunting tracks.  Largely an instrumental track with a soaring vocal performance by Claire Torry, the song sums up and climaxes the first side with images of death and life after death.  The groups slide guitar and piano playing works perfectly well with the eerie voacal work and overall theme of the song. <br /> <br />As side two begins, you wake up form the bittersweet dream of the first side to the more upbringing and brighter side of the next track.  \\"Money\\", was one of Pink Floyd's first and only singles.  Opening with the sound effects of cash registers opening and closing and money being stacked and receipts being ripped off, the song almost has a jazz-fusion feel to it with its whining sax solos and progressive guitar solos.  The song is ironic in that the group is dismissing money and wealth as frivolous and unnecessary on an album that made them rise to incredible wealth and fame.  The next track is, \\"Us And Them\\".  Another jazz-fusion song, it was written for yet another movie during a scene regarding a confrotation between anti-war protesters and police.  \\"Any Colour You Like\\", is a short organ and keyboard instrumental by Richard Wright.  Very effective and easy to listen to.  Next track titled, \\"Brain Damage\\", is about insanity played at an almost humorist level.  The bridge explodes with more voice overs by Torry and the only time the title of the album is said during the record.  The album ends with the shortest track, \\"Eclipse\\"  which closes the track with the infamous heartbeat sound effect and the line that sums up the entire album. <br /> <br />If you don't own this album you are missing out.  Get away from MTV and modern pop and hip-hop and see what your parents have been listening to and loving since they were you age.
0743454537|5.0|<br />  <br />A little bit about the book  <br />My sisters keeper is a story about Anna Fitzgerald (a 13 year old girl) who was genetically made to be a \\"match\\" for her sister Kate Fitzgerald. The topic of Anna being born was because when Kate was 2, she was diagnosed with leukemia. The doctors said the only way she would be able to live was if she had a donor give her some blood at the time Brian Fitzgerald [anna, kate, and Jesse's (anna and kate's brother brother) dad] thought that would be the only thing that anna would have to donate for kate, and she would be to young to remember but he was wrong] well to make a long story short, Brian, Sara (Kate, anna, and Jesse's mom), or Jesse (Kate's older brother) were all not matches... so they had anna.  <br />Since then anna had MANY surgeries but the saddest part was none of them benefitted her directly the only reasons people gave her were \\"because Kate would live\\". So in the book, 13 year old Anna hires a lawyer (Campbell) and she sues her parents to get her medical emancipation. Not only is this story about the Fitzgerald's but it has side stories about Campbell and Julia's ( Kate's legal guardian because she couldn't stay home) \\"loving\\" relationship, and Jesse's....life.  <br /> <br />Why you should read this  <br />I thought this story was well written because the book was always releasing new secrets piece by piece until every detail meshed together at the end.I thought the book was interesting because the protagonist was a 13 year old girl trying to gain independence and getting a medical emancipation. I also liked how there where A LOT of different conflicts within the book because you hardly ever get bored with 1 problem, there's always something new. This story taught me a lot about how I look at life and my relationships with my family. My Sisters keeper also did a great job at making me \\"think\\" because at certain parts in the book I actually found me asking myself \\"what would I do in this situation\\" or\\"why would they do that: or \\"what do I think is going to happen next?\\".  <br /> <br />What else?  <br />Well, im not going to say this book was perfect because it wasn't. There where 2 things I found annoying with this book. 1. Was the fact that there where a few places in the book where I was BORED and it lost my interest maybe it was because im 13 and all the times I lost concentration where at Julia and Campbell's stories... Also my 2nd reason was because the ending was terrible! I was very mad that Jodi Picoult ...well i dont want to ruin the ending but  I feel that the book was terrific until she jacked up the ending. <br />  <br />
0792164903|3.0|Tim Burton's \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is an unusual take on the classic story, depicting Ichabod Crane (Johhny Depp) as a Forensic Investigator sent to Sleepy Hollow to solve the mystery of its' beheaded citizenry (interesting modern-day notion). <br /> <br />The movie had great eerie atmosphere and believable scenery, but the movie had several problems (IMO). <br /> <br />Christopher Walken's Headless Horseman was too gore-inspired, and nasty looking; he should have stayed closer to the classic interpretation. <br /> <br />They should have left the conclusion to the investigation unsolved (would have left you with a cliff-hanger, spooky feeling). The person who perpretrated the beheadings was rediculously implausible (I won't give away who it was). <br /> <br />The part with the \\"Tree of Death\\" was just silly and overly gory (unnecessary). <br /> <br />Burton could have taken a lot of cues from Disney's \\"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\". The timing, sound effects, and set really gave you the chills when you knew the Headless Horseman was going to attack some poor Colonial. That version is STILL my favorite rendition of the story.
0679422714|5.0|A brilliant piece of revisionism, this book quite clearly states its new ideas, namely that Mao was responsible for the death of 70 million Chinese, more than any other Tyrant, and that the communists did not fight the Japanese as hard as previously thought.  This book seeks to expose the hidden side of Communism in China.  First, its assault on all things Chinese, including culture, history and Buddhism.  This book seeks to catalogue the darker side of Mao.  Other books have given insight into his personal life or been laudatory in showing the Communists as the only true fighters of Japanese Aggression between 1933 and 1945.  This book seeks to turn history on its head.  Written by a Chinese author and steeped in a deep understanding of China and the actual origins of Mao this book paints a new picture of the Communist revolution and subsequent cultural revolution.  Revisionist as it is, it is a daring and well written assault on the accepted history.  A good read, colorful with many citations and new information based on extensive interview.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman
B00003CX9E|4.0|\\"Citizen Kane,\\" released in 1941, was ahead of its time in cinematography. Many long cuts, showing action in real time, fill the film. The few short cuts are taken mainly to emphasize dialogue. This story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane is based losely on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who fought the release of this film into theaters.<br /><br />The story is not told in chronological order. The first impression we get in this film is of a run down mansion, inhabited by a dying old man, whose last word in life was \\"rosebud.\\" The quest of the film is to discover the meaning of this word, which we discover has nothing to do with the lady-loves of his life.<br /><br />\\"March of the News,\\" a satire of the theater weekly \\"Time Marches On\\" newsreel, is footage of Kane documenting his lifetime, and gets the audience inside the life of this powerful, yet uncaring man. The story of his life is told through a series of flashbacks, some spanning many years through one dissolve. Kane collects statues, paintings, animals in a zoo, and a vast area for his home and castle in Florida known as Xanadu, based on the \\"castle\\" of William Randolph Hearst, who did his best to destroy the film before it was shown to the public. Charles Foster Kane is a montage of several real-life characters, Hearst among them.<br /><br />Shot in black and white, this film uses the space of the audience's screen to show a qwell focused depth in the field of vision. Lighting is maintained through low key lights, and sharp angles of hard light, with characters all remaining in focus. Characters in the beginning of the film are shot almost in silhouette, focusing on voice and dialogue rather than the visual images. Symbolically, the public is in the dark about who Kane was. The older Kane gets, the darker shots become, reflecting a realism of cinema in the beginning of the film, but changing to baroque and excessive with the passage of time.<br /><br />As a boy, Kane is removed from his mother's home because she has come into money, and wishes for the boy to be well cared for. In addition, the father is excited about receiving $50,000 each year during the boy's absence. The mother, played by a young Agnes Morehead of \\"Bewitched\\" fame, is solid, stoic and almost unfeeling at the loss of her child. Similarly, Kane does not visit his parents during the film, referring only to his mother's passing, and possessions he ought to go through. He is on the way to see about the family's possessions when he is splashed by a passing carriage and covered in mud. By chance a young woman offers him some hot water to clean up, and a relationship developes between them. Susan Alexander, age 22, works in a music store in charge of sheet music. Susan's mother wanted her to be an opera star. In this scene, Kane is a middle aged newspapeer tycoon.<br /><br />On his twenty-fifth birthday, Kane comes into total inheritance of the sixth largest fortune in America. It is here we see the adult Kane for the first time, preferring to dabble in newspapers of all his assets. Mr. Thatcher, Kane's guardian and personal attorney, keeps Kane informed of his misguided interest in the newspaper which is costing him a million dollars a year. \\"At this rate, I'll be broke in sixty years,\\" Kane quips.<br /><br />Kane and his worldy belongings move, claiming his previous editor's office as his home. To increase circulation of the \\"Inquirer,\\" Kane hires the top ten newspaper men from a rival paper. He always buys the best.<br /><br />The shot of a portrait of these newsmen of \\"The Chronicle\\" dissolves into a new shot of his staff. Kane paid these reporters well to come to work for him. One senses Kane has no scruples, despite the fact he gets his way by being charming. During an office celebration, Kane dances charmingly with chorus girls, his dancing reflected in an elaborate shot with his image reflected in the mirror as his friends Mr. Bernstein and Jedidiah talk of him as a great and famous man, and all sing an original sone about Charle Kane. Kane leaves for Europe, and returns collecting not statues but one who collects diamonds.<br /><br />Kane announces his engagement, and consequent marriage to the niece of the President of the United States, the dark haired Emily. He wants not only to fit in with the elite, but to have high society to bend to his whims. His is not a happy marriage, shown in a series of montage cuts over the breakfast table. His wife eventually leaves Kane and takes their son because Kane doesn't spend time with them, or understand and empathize with family feelings. Kane is newspaper tycoon bound.<br /><br />Kane treats his wives like another<br /><br />of his many possessions, telling the women what they are, what they will think, and what they will do. His second wife pursues a career in opera, which is a mistake because she has no talent. Her misery falls back on him, but he pushes her to continue.<br /><br />Kane has political aspirations which burst like a bubble once his extramarital affair with the second woman is made public, and his first wife divorces him. The grandiosity in which Kane presents himself is actually very shallow, his work for his fellow man's benefit appears only in his early life. As an old man he is callous and uncaring of anything that doesn't have directly to do with him. \\"All he ever wanted was love,\\" recollects Jedidiah as an old man.<br /><br />Kane is a man of wealth and power, and builds an opera house in Chicago for his wife to sing in. As well, his newspapers across the country give Susan Alexander Kane rave reviews. Only his friend, Jedidiah Leland, arts editor, writes a scathing review of her performance which Kane finishes as the man, his friend from college days,<br /><br />passes out from drunk before he finishes the review. \\"Some kind of friend he is,\\" whines his lame songstress-wife. His was a friend who returned the now defunct constituion of the paper, written in the early and naive days.<br /><br />Kane is responsible for the coverage, and perhaps the fighting of the Spanish American war in Cuba, saying he only needed pictures and he could supply the headlines. The \\"Inquirer\\" is not a newspaper of solid fact, but rather sensational items.<br /><br />The second interview the report, getting an angle on a \\"great American's life,\\" is the interview with his second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an alcoholic night club singer. She performs twice nightly for a floor show in a club in Atlantic City, which has no patrons. She sits alone, drunk and getting drunker. She doesn't wish to talk to the man, but is finally persuaded on a subsequent visit from the reporter Thompson.<br /><br />We learn of the meeting of Kane and his second wife on a street corner, as she leaves the drugstore with toothache medicine, and he has just been splashed with mud by a passing horse and buggy. Thety retire to her boarding house room, and his attempt at first seduction is quelled by her keeping the door open. Their relationship shown on screen is harmless, but the audience knows that more comes to pass between them. Kane loves Susan because she loves him, without realizing he is a wealthy powerful newspaper man. But, the more she knows him, the less she likes him.<br /><br />Kane pursues the governorship of the state, expressing his concern for the \\"working man.\\" His dreams for the Presidency of the United States die, but out of his grasp because his affair is exposed. \\"A toast to love on my terms. That's the only terms that anyone really knows,\\" says Kane when defeated at the hands of his precious working class, now represented by organized labor.<br /><br />Kane is a man of wealth and power, and builds an opera house in Chicago for his wife to sing in. As well, his newspapers across the country give her rave reviews. Only his friend, and arts editor prints a scathing review which Kane finishes as the man, Jedidiah Leland, his friend from college days passes out from drinking before he finishes the review of her performance. \\"Some kind of friend he is,\\" shrikes his lame songstress, now wife.<br /><br />Despite a palace of 49,000 acres of scenery and statues, and the still being built compound/castle of Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane, and he erupts into a violent temper explosion in which he destroys Susan's room.

Can one word really sum up the wishes of one's life?and naive days. <br /> <br />Kane is responsible for the coverage, and perhaps the fighting of the Spanish American war in Cuba, saying he only needed pictures and he could supply the headlines. The \\"Inquirer\\" is not a newspaper of solid fact, but rather sensational items. <br /> <br />The second interview the report, getting an angle on a \\"great American's life,\\" is the interview with his second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an alcoholic night club singer. She performs twice nightly for a floor show in a club in Atlantic City, which has no patrons. She sits alone, drunk and getting drunker. She doesn't wish to talk to the man, but is finally persuaded on a subsequent visit from the reporter Thompson. <br /> <br />We learn of the meeting of Kane and his second wife on a street corner, as she leaves the drugstore with toothache medicine, and he has just been splashed with mud by a passing horse and buggy. Thety retire to her boarding house room, and his attempt at first seduction is quelled by her keeping the door open. Their relationship shown on screen is harmless, but the audience knows that more comes to pass between them. Kane loves Susan because she loves him, without realizing he is a wealthy powerful newspaper man. But, the more she knows him, the less she likes him. <br /> <br />Kane pursues the governorship of the state, expressing his concern for the \\"working man.\\" His dreams for the Presidency of the United States die, but out of his grasp because his affair is exposed. \\"A toast to love on my terms. That's the only terms that anyone really knows,\\" says Kane when defeated at the hands of his precious working class, now represented by organized labor. <br /> <br />Kane is a man of wealth and power, and builds an opera house in Chicago for his wife to sing in. As well, his newspapers across the country give her rave reviews. Only his friend, and arts editor prints a scathing review which Kane finishes as the man, Jedidiah Leland, his friend from college days passes out from drinking before he finishes the review of her performance. \\"Some kind of friend he is,\\" shrikes his lame songstress, now wife. <br /> <br />Despite a palace of 49,000 acres of scenery and statues, and the still being built compound/castle of Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane, and he erupts into a violent temper explosion in which he destroys Susan's room. Kane lives his final years alone, in what Leland refers to as his colleseum. <br /> <br />As a group of reporters and photographers survey more possessions than can be counted, the audience sees Kane's sled, burning in an incinerator.

0684847248|5.0|I'll be honest, I've barely read the latter 2/3 of this book. It is the first 1/3 that to me is the valuable portion, and I reread whenever I need a free self-therapy 101 refresher. <br /> <br />The reason I like that portion of the book so much is that it outlines some of the fundamentals of discipline, what makes us value ourself, and what life is really about in a way that I guarantee you your parents probably never managed to do as insightfully. There's no BS'ing, suger coating, grandioseness, or other people's neurosis nor \\"professional distancing\\" here... it's one of the most candidly honest and helpful opening thesis's of psychology I've read. For this reason, I recommend you buy this book for conjunction with other books and treatments for any sort of mental recovery or personal journey. <br /> <br />The rest of it goes on to talk about love and spirituality it would seem, which may or may not be something you feel like reading about. The first part alone is worth it to me, however.
B000BTJDG2|3.0|Father Richard Moore, played by Tom Wilkinson (upcoming Seperate Lives, Batman Begins), is on trial for the supposed murder of 19 Year Old Emily Rose, played surprisingly in a believable performance by Jennifer Carpenter (White Chicks). As Wilkinson's Lawyer, Erin, played by the always good Laura Linney (Mystic River, p.s.), is told the tale of what happened to Emily Rose from Wilkinson himself and defending the people would be Evan Thomas, played by Campbell Scott (Rodger Dodger, Big Night) and he's also good. Emily Rose was taking medicine and suffering from delusions, seeing things, things made her so stuff but Wilkinson knows that she was possessed by a demon or more demons...they say 6...including Lucifier. Scott Derrickson doesnt do a bad job but this isnt a masterpiece and it could possibly...is...the years spookiest if mixed with courtroom dramatics,movie. It's better then White Noise, let's say that because we all know how bad White Noise was. Carpenter is the real deal here and her character beind 19 Years Old and seeing her suffer even though she's acting on screen, you get a chill down the back of your spine if it was you who was witnessing everything that happened to her, even the part in the chapel where she is crying, asking the boy she likes to please say with her...you feel as if you want to stay with her, comfort her as she goes threw all of this. Also starring Colm Feore (City of Angels, Storm Of The Century), Henry Czerny (Mission:Impossible, Clear and Present Danger) and Alec Roberts (Tv's Stargate SGI, 13 Ghosts(2001). I dont know, you decide...it's your opinion but in my mind, I felt like The Exorcism Of Emily Rose was a good movie even if it had it's falts along the way. Other thing is that Derrickson stated that he didnt rip off The Exorcist...some might disagree with him, I on the other hand dont see any of The Exorcist in this....well, the only thing is that it's a young girl, like in The Exorcist but I cant say it's ripping from it.  <br/> <br />
B00005KHJV|3.0|Ok this is the slasher flick that started the bad 70's and 80's horror films. Ok the film is good for beeing mad ein the 70's but when you get passed that the movie is ok but not great. Yes the movie is creepy and scary at times but it's boring also. If they would of focused more on the killing and not so much on the girls talking it would of been good. Well the movie is still good espesailly the theme song is creppy. It's just too bad they made all the really nad pointless sequals the only good one was H20. Overall it's good to watch every Halloween and it's a good Horror film.

B00005JNJV|5.0|By far, BATMAN BEGINS is the best of the Batman movies to date. Just a few minutes into the movie, you forget you are watching Batman or even a superhero movie at all...very well done! Leaving the flashiness and flamboyence of the previous movies behind, this Batman is packed with action, a great storyline and superior acting...Christian Bale is Batman. I only wish this movie had been the first and the others followed in it's tradition. I'll also add...the Batmobile has never been badder!! You do NOT have to like superhero movies to like this movie.
0380820846|4.0|This book was really wonderful and I felt that I could really relate to Penelope. I love Colin. He was a wonderful character and not perfect at all (which is very appealing). I love to re-read this book all the time!!!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This movie is so cool because Tom Cruise totally wastes so many mofo's. In the club scene Micahel Mann shows his dynamic camera work as Vincent (Tom Cruise) kills so many people with precision skill. He snaps one guys neck, then kicks a guy's leg which snaps at the knee and later takes out one of his contracts. The movie is paced really well and we see Jamie Foxx showing his acting skills as a convincing meek yet virtuous cab driver. Whenever Vincent kills someone it looks so awesome. We need more ultra violent movies like this. The movie is also very deep and dark and we see who Vincent is and why he turned out the way he did.
B00000I8UD|2.0|\\"Dead Bees On a Cake\\" supuso el esperado retorno en 1999 de un David Sylvian felizmente casado y afincado en Norteam&eacute;rica. Este trabajo constitu&iacute;a su primer proyecto en solitario desde aquel sublime \\"Secrets of the Beehive\\" (un disco prodigioso del a&ntilde;o 1987) y muchos de sus fans esper&aacute;bamos este nuevo material ansiosamente pero, por desgracia, el resultado final no pudo ser m&aacute;s decepcionante. \\"Dead Bees On a Cake\\" es un ambicioso &aacute;lbum que se torna pretencioso y aburrido ya desde el primer corte: el innecesariamente extenso \\"I Surrender\\" (&iquest;para qu&eacute; contar en m&aacute;s de nueve minutos lo que puede hacerse de sobra en cuatro?).<br /><br />Musical y l&iacute;ricamente, los temas est&aacute;n por debajo de casi todas sus anteriores obras, con la posible excepci&oacute;n de alguna canci&oacute;n suelta como la arrebatadora \\"Thalhiem\\" (lo mejor del disco), \\"Caf&eacute; Europa\\" o \\"Wanderlust\\". Destellos aparte, un aire alarmantemente auto-indulgente y convencional preside el &aacute;lbum, con temas muy desiguales entre s&iacute; y que poco tienen que ver los unos con los otros. Da la impresi&oacute;n de que Sylvian se metiera en el estudio y comenzara a cortar y a pegar material que ten&iacute;a en la rec&aacute;mara durante todos estos a&ntilde;os sin orden ni concierto ninguno. Tampoco ayudan nada las previsibles atm&oacute;sferas &eacute;tnicas y \\"ex&oacute;ticas\\" de algunos cortes, realizadas sin la elegancia de anta&ntilde;o y bastante t&oacute;picas, as&iacute; como la inclusi&oacute;n en los coros de su por entonces esposa Ingrid Chavez, algo, por cierto, que le da al disco un aire de \\"todo queda en casa\\" que no le va nada, pero nada (siempre me ha molestado que algunos artistas se concedan las t&iacute;picas licencias de meter a cantar en el estudio a sus parientes).<br /><br />Los ambientes que una vez funcionaron a la perfecci&oacute;n en \\"Brilliant Trees\\" (1984) aqu&iacute; se me antojan como superfluos y gratuitos. La falta de inspiraci&oacute;n se deja notar en casi todo momento en un &aacute;lbum confuso y poco cohesionado que provoca el sopor y la indiferencia a partir de los primeros minutos. Yo personalmente s&oacute;lo lo he escuchado entero unas pocas veces; casi siempre termino apag&aacute;ndolo o salt&aacute;ndome canciones. Apenas hay alg&uacute;n tema que me suscite emociones como las de los m&iacute;ticos trabajos de los '80 y a pesar de que \\"Dead Bees On a Cake\\" cuenta con buenos colaboradores (Ryuichi Sakamoto; Steve Jansen), el hecho es que este trabajo me parece bastante intrascendente y olvidable, puro humo. El nivel de producci&oacute;n es muy bueno y las instrumentaciones son correctas pero yo no veo nada m&aacute;s que subrayar. En mi opini&oacute;n, su disco m&aacute;s prescindible.<br /><br />Afortunadamente para sus fans, Sylvian mostr&oacute; claros s&iacute;ntomas de recuperaci&oacute;n con su siguiente &aacute;lbum \\"Blemish\\", un trabajo que me hace cruzar los dedos pensando en el futuro. Ojal&aacute; siga en esa l&iacute;nea y esperemos que no vuelva a derivar hacia posturas acomodaticias ya que nos quedar&iacute;amos sin uno de los m&aacute;s grandes artistas de culto de todos los tiempos.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|As soon as I left the theater after seeing Serenity, I headed over to the store to pick up the Firefly DVD set. What an amazing show that is even better than the movie. The characters and fresh dialogue make this show good for those who are not really into Sci-Fi as well. Firefly needs to come back soon, so hopefully Sci-Fi channel will pick it up and air it before Battlestar Gallactica. What a shame this show wasn't given the proper chance to expand its intersting universe over multiple seasons.
B000AARKOO|4.0|\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" was a very enjoyable film, in my own opinion, and one that had a bit of everything in it. It had a bit love for the hopeless romantics, almost sickening idealism for the idealists, some pretty nasty bad guys, for those who feel a good villian really makes a movie and lots of action for those of us who just enjoy sword fights and war.<br /><br />Firstly, I thought the movie did well to portray the complexity of Outremer politics as it was, (or close to it). The delicate balancing act of the local nobles between diplomacy with the Muslims and the hot-headed fanaticism of newly arrived knights is brought out, along with the internal rivalries and bickering that caused more than its share of problems.<br /><br />The protrayal of some \\"Christians\\" in a bad light has been commented on, and was nothing far from the truth. As one historian noted on the BBC, these were \\"brutal\\" people. Reymond of Chatillon, Lord of the Transjordan, was known for his tendency to attack caravans and do other \\"unpleasant\\" things. While some Christians were relatively mild, others were not. The Muslims were often more \\"civilised\\" than their Christian counterparts in many respects.<br /><br />Secondly, as to the historical licenses made in the film, it is to be expected. Films of this kind take certain liberties to weave their story to tell a message. Those seeking a real description of the Crusades of the 1180's period will be disappointed with this film. While central figures and events are true, there is much that is not, and some that has been deliberately changed or glossed over.<br /><br />Finally, the movie has a good message about human disapppointment in tragedy, and the finding of oneself. The central character, Beylin, suffers great loss, is offered hope of redemption in the Crusader territories, and ultimately finds himself and his place in his own way. It is a powerful message and one that has plenty of scope for thought.<br /><br />\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is a great movie with plenty for everyone. It can be taken as deeply as you want it to, or just enjoyed as a spectacular movie. I have seen it twice now, and have enjoyed it immensely both times. Not history per se, but a fine film all the same.s a great movie with plenty for everyone. It can be taken as deeply as you want it to, or just enjoyed as a spectacular movie.

B000002L71|3.0|I love Talking Heads.  I do.  But I love them in the way that someone who knows them mainly through hearing his older siblings constantly playing them as he grew up loves them.  I don't own many of their albums, and I've never even see the film \\"Stop Making Sense,\\" though I've watched David Byrne's \\"True Stories\\" dozens of times.  I picked this CD up out of a bargain bin a couple of years ago, and though I like it, I just don't feel it's Talking Heads at their best.<br /><br />It's got a great version of \\"Psycho Killer,\\" played the way David Byrne would play it back in art school--with recorded music played on a boombox kicking off the song--some okay tracks by the Tom Tom Club, and some genuinely clever liner notes (\\"In the future women will have breasts all over\\").<br /><br />But, almost all the songs here aren't as good as their album counterparts, and overall the CD feels erratic and irregular.  If you love Talking Heads, you should own this.  You probably already do.  But if you're just looking to get into them, this probably isn't the album to start with.  Check out their \\"Popular Favorites\\" compilation instead, or either of their first two albums.  Those are much better.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Great music gets better over time. I usually know I'm going to really love an album when i'm intrigued by it at first but just don't quite get it and am left a little disappointed. I know I have to listen to it again. This describes the initial phase of an album's worth or longetivity. After another couple of spins you are hooked and the music is whirling around your head throughout the day as chunks of mood and atmosphere. After a month or so its real value kicks in and you find yourself restraining the impulse to play it everyday because you don't want to burn it out. you save it for a special music occasion when you want to be enthralled and enraptured the way you were in the beginning. This is the ultimate phase of a \\"best album ever\\" type.<br /><br />The above is true for my experience with OK Computer. My honeymoon phase consisted of me hearing the album several times a day for weeks maybe a month. almost every night in bed i would hear it while drifting to sleep. It became to symbolize and enrapture what i was going through in my life at the time. As months went by i played it less and less not because the music changed but because I had changed. I always knew I could fall back on OK Computer when I was in the mood though. A 5 star album is definately one that you will pull out of your collection 8 years later.<br /><br />Here is I think another testament to how remarkable this album is: Granted i've heard these songs hundreds of times and am quite familiar with the albums flow. Something strange happened a couple days ago. I queued up OK Computer on my media player, turned off the lights in my room, laid in bed with a guitar by my side in case I had the urge to softly strum as happens occasionaly and started to feel strange. The first two songs sounded familiar but then I noticed that the song after song was sounding more and more unfamiliar. It was as if I was hearing this music for the first time. A quite unsettling feeling at first until I got over my initial shock. I am convinced that this is another reason this album is so special if it can make you feel like you're listening to it for the first time again based on new experiences in your life.<br /><br />Thanks.y initial shock.

B000001DYY|3.0|I like this album enough that I still own and (occasionally)listen to it twelve years after it was released.<br /><br />That said, it's not that great.<br /><br />\\"Elemental\\" is a nice song--Roland Orzabel's vocals are strong, and the song hits powerfully.  It's slightly reminiscent of the band's earlier song \\"Shout.\\"<br /><br />\\"Break It Down Again\\" is a classic song with classic lyrics.  It's got a great build and it makes the world feel nice and wild.  My only complaint with it is that now, in 2005, I can't believe how cheesy and dated some of its minor synthesizer parts sound.  Prior to a few years ago, I never really noticed that any of it was synthesized, yet now it's impossible not to think about its phony-feeling keyboard fills.<br /><br />The entire middle of the album just wanders and trudges around.  It's nice in the way that a hot desert's nice, but it's not really engaging.  It's slow.<br /><br />\\"Brian Wilson Said,\\" the album's second-to-last song could be a lost Beach Boys track, and is very tender, and \\"Goodnight Song\\" features excellent electric guitar and captures the feel of growing up and grieving one's youth almost perfectly.  It may be the album's best.<br /><br />The songs that are good on this CD make it worth owning, but it's not the sort of thing you'll listen to without ever skipping through a track.
B00003CXDG|1.0|I'll be brief, and get right to the point: this is a TERRIBLE movie! The only thing at all memorable about it is that it is freaking awful! Terrible acting, horrible, forgettable dialogue, terrible everything! Yes, it does have more action in it than the first \\"Mission Impossible\\" movie, but that doesn't mean it's good. In fact, that might be one of its flaws; everything that was good about the first \\"Mission Impossible\\" (the secretiveness and subtlety, the good acting, and especially the mystery) is gone! This movie is completely one-dimensional and it has no depth whatsoever, and barely any plot! One scene after another is full of just shooting and death. Tom Cruise's character, who is a bad rip off of James Bond, kills so many people, he's barely even a good guy, anymore. And the villians are so evil, they verge on self parody. Two other flaws this movie has is the scenes blend together and the characters use masks ENTIRELY too much. Now, Hollywood has made a lot of bad movies over the years, so there might be a movie (out there, somewhere) that is worse than this one. But whatever that movie was, I haven't seen it!
B000B0WODA|4.0|a vivacious and infectious release that injects new blood into the world of pop music. One must, however, be willing once again to embrace the powerful Beatles' influences all over this work. Obviously, with bands like Travis and Keane (as well as all the others, including Tears For Fears on their latest) the listener has become used to hearing references and sounds straight out of the Liverpool pantheon. That's not always a bad thing. Just be prepared to accept it first before moving on to all the unique qualities of the latest wave of Brit rockers.<br /><br />For a cleaner and arguably better produced release, check out the new one by Depeche Mode, Playing The Angel. It's a nice counterpoint to FF.
B000ANVQ0K|2.0|Three discs and only three hours of special features... TWO OF THE DISCS ARE THE MOVIES WITH ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF EXTRA FEATURES! So basically you're buying a 2-disc DVD spread out on 3-discs, hell, there are so little special features (HALF OF THE \\"THREE HOURS\\" ARE DELETED SCENES) this could be on one disc of the film wasn't so long. Titanic is a good movie, although cheesy at times I don't wonder why it grossed $1.8 billion, but the special features on here just aren't worth it. This DVD should've came out 7 years ago as a 2-disc edition and this year should've came with a 4-disc edition with hours upon hours of special features.  <br /> <br />What special features do we have here? About 6 hours of deleted scens that were deleted for a reason (I especially hate the first one where Cal says Picasso won't amount to anything; haha, get it? Picasso won't amount to anything but now he's perhaps the most famous artist right up there with DaVinci? Haha!). The alternate ending is painful, but that's merely a drop in the bucket compared to My Heart Will Go On music video. The only special feature really worth it is that Fox Marketing video, all the other \\"special features\\" are about 2 minutes, especially when they could be 20 minutes and very interesting. The \\"Titanic Ship Tour\\" for example is amazing but could have been better. The special features just aren't worth it unless you love deleted scenes. At least when Peter Jackson made the film spread out on 2 discs, HE PUT 2 EXTRA DISCS FOR SPECIAL FEATURES! And his movie (Return of the King) wasn't half as big as Titanic! What a waste. <br /> <br />Good movie, gets 4/5 but the special features are useless. Not only that but while the first DVD had the movie on ONE disc this one has it on TWO discs - which could have held way more features!

It has some humor to keep you involved and has some very solid money management systems in it. I've read hundreds of self-help books by other famous authors and they haven't come close to this book by far. If they had a higher rating scale this would be off the charts. Do yourself a favor and get this book for yourself, your family, and your friends. <br /> <br />
B0009MDPYM|2.0|Constantine is yet another movie based on a comic book that even most comic book nerd hadn't heard of.  So they take the story of John Constantine on the pursuit of riding the world of demons because of something long ago that bars him from the gates of heaven.  It's extra important to get in now because a large chunk of the residents of hell were put their by him. <br /> <br />In the role of the title character is Keanu Reeves who will forever conjure up the thoughts of Theodore Logan no matter how serious the role.  Needless to say, the slacker surfer persona doesn't mesh well with the demon hunter.  On his quest in the movie, Constantine crosses path with the chick from The Mummy movies as a detective trying to prove that her twin didn't commit suicide.  And because ever good comic book character need a sidekick and Constantine has a cab driving apprentice played by the dude from one of the Disney Channel shows that I won't admit to watching. <br /> <br />One of the few entertaining elements of the movie is the unintentional comedy most notable being every moment where Reeves tries to act, and be sure to watch out for Constantine's rubber ducky.  Equally questionable casting choice was the dude from Bush showing up as the bad guy.  It was extremely hard to be scared of him because whenever he comes on the screen I fell off the couch laughing. <br /> <br />The only redeemable aspect of the movie was the scenes of hell.  They really captured what I assume hell to be, a very hot version of Earth with weird demon ready to rip the flesh.  The only part missing from my version of hell would be the members of the Backstreet Boys raping me for eternity while singing their songs.  In fact all the special effects were all well done.  Now if they can figure out to make a CGI Keanu Reeves and the movie might have been a lot better. <br /> <br />The biggest crime of the movie is that they cut out what could have made the movie.  If you role through threw the delete scenes youfind out about Constantine's tryst with a very hot (bad pun intended) half-demon who was cut out of various scenes in the movie.  If I were to ever make rules of making a good move, number one would be \\"Never leave out the token hot chick.\\"  Because of that, this movie deserves to fail.
B0000033P0|5.0|Great record! Atonishing musicianship, and some of Greg Lake's best lyrics (cuts like \\"Battlefield\\" and \\"The Only Way\\" give we anti-war agnostics a reason to sing along). Also, if you listen closely to the form, the manipulation of themes and, generally, ELP's successful tributes to various rock, jazz and classical composers (Lennon/McCartney, Coltrane, Davis, Copland, Bach!), you can hear that the band did some homework before they started this project. They also did a lot of practicing. <br /> <br />As an aside, I was surprised to see this LP unjustly listed in \\"The Worst Rock and Roll Records of All Time\\" by Jimmy Guterman and Owen O'Donnell. An unfair judgment, since Guterman and O'Donnell don't seem to be fans of the Prog Rock sub-genre in general. (Yes' \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" was also unfairly included on their \\"worst\\" list.) This is like saying, \\"I don't like classical music, and therefore Stravinsky's `Rite of Spring' is a piece of trash.\\" In other words, if you don't like a style of music, even the best examples aren't going to impress you.
B000067DNC|4.0|Ok, if you bought this is because you like the series, right? so, no point in going \\"is the best series ever...\\" or \\"who writes this stuff...\\" because if you like the series (as I do) you're going to like it, if you don't, why even bother buying. Also, this is supposed to be a store review, not a tv critic or movie review (which a lot of people forget), so here is the good and the bad: <br /> <br />Good <br />-Nice packaging, which matches the collection <br />-Every DVD worked just fine. I've read about the final DVD in season 5(I think is the 5, but I'm not sure) having some issues <br /> <br />Bad <br />-No close caption, no subtitles or other languages, so, if you're hearing impaired or you don't speak english, you're out of luck, since there doesn't seem to be an edition which these options, which is odd given the fact that the season 1 set included them
0887307280|3.0|There is a lot of hype on this book. I found it to be interesting and contains some good advice for small business owners. However, you can't \\"McDonaldize\\" every business. Retail - sure.  But try doing that with a professional service business, or a manufacturin business. Only some of the concepts apply. The main message - get yourself out of the day to day of running the business and that you should work ON the business and not IN it is very good advice. This book just doesn't tell you how to do that unless you are in a retail environment.
0316096199|5.0|\\"Lucky\\" is a true story about author Alice Sebold, who was attacked and raped in a park on the last day of school during her freshman year of college. Although people constantly tell her that she is lucky to have survived the attack, Alice's life is forever changed as a result of what happened to her. This brutally honest memoir details how Alice manages to pick up the pieces and move on with her life and how her experience affects other people around her: her family, her friends, her potential love interests, and her peers. Alice demonstrated remarkable strength and courage during her ordeal and aggressively fought to seek justice and put the man who raped her behind bars. The book includes detailed descriptions of the legal proceedings and courtroom experiences that Alice has to endure.<br /><br />Sebold doesn't sugar-coat anything in her book, which is refreshing because the reader is forced to absorb all the horrible details of the rape and its aftermath. I recommend this book to everyone and I also suggest that you pick up Sebold's other book, \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" which is a work of fiction that I enjoyed even more than \\"Lucky.\\"
B0007Y08QA|3.0|Definitely a so-so effort.  It wouldn't be worth your time without Bale's performance.  Or without his concentration camp physique.  I amused myself during the film trying to figure out why a major actor would do this to himself.  It would be a terrible idea in a terrific film -- hey, starving yourself is NOT acting! -- but to go to those lengths for this mediocre effort...I don't get it.  The filmmakers certainly hit gold when he elected to do that (again, the movie has little else going for it), but what was in it for him? <br /> <br />That story...yeah, the other reviewers are correct; we've seen it before.  The interesting thing here is that they telegraph the \\"gimmick\\" from the first frame.  It's almost not a Spoiler to mention those other films, because the filmmakers waste no time themselves letting you in on the \\"secret.\\"  The details of Bale's character's recent past are unclear, but the broad picture is handed to you very early.  You're more confused than the machinist if you bought the possibility that it was all a vast conspiracy. <br /> <br />Hey, explain this to me.  The guy's a skeleton because he hasn't slept in a year.  But in dozens of different scenes, he's on the verge of nodding off.  What's that about? <br /> <br />Ok film.  Worth watching to see Skeletor.
B000005JA8|1.0|i first heard Captain Beefheart in his song \\"Her Eyes are a Blue Million MIles\\" on the BIg lebowski soundtrack. I liked it so i thought i should check him out. i like all kinds of music and have a very  open mind to music. I love almost all zappa ive heard and a lot of different styles of music, but i must say no matter how much i hear this it's still the most annoying thing ive ever heard. where the hell is the music, i dont kno if i'll ever understand this. i dont know what is worst..this or lil Jon retarded screaming played everywhere i go
0307276902|5.0|Yes, I did get this book after seeing it featured on the Oprah Show.  For some reason maybe this is viewed as \\"not literary\\".  No matter, people who dismiss this book based on the fact that Oprah chose it are missing out.  This book is gripping, plain and simple.  You feel like you are there with Mr. Frey for every agonizing step of his journey through rehab.  His tale is that of a true survivor, one with strength and fortitude that are incomprable once he chooses to fight his unimaginable addictions.  I haven't had a sheltered life, so I feel like not much could shock me, but there are some passages in this book that made my eyes pop out of my head.  You root for Mr. Frey throughout his journey, even though his success is evidenced by the publication of his memoir.  Other addicts turn out to be not so lucky, unfortunately.  I definitely loved this book.
B000AL730O|5.0|What a wonderful surprise to hear Paul back with it's best CD since...yes, let's put it out loud and clear: \\"Ram\\"..1971. That's a very long time ago, and even if other releases by Paul have not been bad at all, this one really hits sensibilities and musicianship way beyond the average mark. Very reluctant to listen to Paul's new material of often irregular quality, this CD came out like the strongest revelation of 2005. A word or two must be said about the production here. Nigel Godrich did a fantastic job of layering sound carpets nicely woven into one of the most exquisite tapestries of sound I can remember since George Martin or Phil Spector best days. What a superb production, full of equisite sound quality- pure crystalline- (As one reviewer put it already) but with such a warmness, it's hard to take it all in one first sip. The CD grows on you, revealing layers and layers of sounds (a quality seen in some of Godrich's productions with Radio Head and Beck)that merit listening and re-listening with a GOOD sound stereo or sorround system that will reveal these secrets to you. There are too many gems here to mention, but on the front row of the all very good songs, a mention should be given to \\"How kind of you\\", \\"At your mercy\\", \\"Riding to vanity fair\\", \\"Jenny Wren\\"(all of which explore minor-major harmonies with taste and drama, as well as a melancholy rarely heard on Paul songs!) and even \\"Promise to you girl\\" (one of the 2 rockers of the album with an excellent lead guitar echoing some of \\"Ram's\\" best parts). The explorations on sound on this CD are quite evident, a fact that will probably annoy old grumpy beatles fans used to the sunny and much too silly Paul. \\"Chaos\\" is certainly not a downer, but it asks for attention when listening to it. This is not McCartney's Musak, but a gem that will be probably remembered as Pauls's most introspective work of his whole career. 5 Stars, and urgently recommended!
0142004235|3.0|This book is definitely not short on Biblical themes and references, but as someone who is - at best - agnostic, I wasn't put off at all by this.  East of Eden is an obvious Steinbeck work, in that it does have a lot of the darker side of human-kind along with the turn-of-the-century California setting.  The grandiose tale spans two families and three generations, with apt ties between all.  It is a story of morality and brings up some questions about the soul and inner workings of us all.  To me, it ultimately boils down to a story of hope, highlighted by the repeated mention of a single word, timshel, which equates to \\"thou mayest.\\"  It is this theme of choosing and controlling your own destiny that most captivated me, as well as the thoughts on acceptance and forgiveness.

0812550706|4.0|The plot of Ender's Game is swift and engaging, and although fits the genre of sci-fi, it is not hard sci-fi.  The future in which it takes place and the technology that it describes merely set the scene.  Ender's character is especially interesting, and he rings true as an isolated genius with huge responsibility, but not necessarily a child.  The trio of Ender, his sister, and his brother makes an interesting set of personalities that drives the fate of the world.  Sometimes I wished that the psychological elements were more deeply probed, since there is an interesting element of manipulation and control; the same goes for the technology.  Surprisingly accurate prediction of the prominence of web pundits.  Overall, it was a satisfying read, even though it was a fast read for me, being in my late 20's.
B000AL730O|2.0|For me, this is Paul's second disappointing recording in a row, after Driving Rain.  I am not seeing any progression of Paul's songwriting -- do not be mistaken, I am not looking for timeless, classic hits here that remind me of his Beatles days -- but I am expecting Paul to do something along the lines of what Paul Simon did on \\"Graceland\\" and \\"Rhythm of the Saints.\\"  A world-class songwriter expanding the boundaries of what he is capable of and creating something entirely new in the process.  This is what historically has made Paul great and what history will remember him for.  It will take quite a bit more effort than just partnering with a new producer to continue the growth of this, my all-time favorite, songwriter.<br /><br />I am afraid that McCartney fans will not find anything new here.  This album even lacks the energy and creativity of the band he used on \\"Driving Rain\\" and falls far short of the musicianship forged on his great albums of the early-mid 90's, \\"Flowers In The Dirt,\\" \\"Off the Ground,\\" and \\"Flaming Pie.\\"<br /><br />We know you are capable of more than this, Sir Paul.
0141439831|4.0|I originally watched the film on an airplane, and the airline cut off the ending.  Wanting to know the conclusion, and being a bigger fan of books than the films of the books, I bought a copy of Vanity Fair while on vacation. <br /> <br />I was immediately surprised to find that the Fair referred to in the title was not 'fair of face', but an actual carnival - a clever theme wound through the book.  Of course a novel of this length can't be completely captured in the film, but I was surprised to find so many of the sharp details had been omitted. <br /> <br />Other reviews cover the plot and rightly praise the humorous writing, so I won't duplicate that here.  I'll conclude by saying this book is a wonderful read for those like me who enjoy this genre.  Those who don't will probably find the length daunting and the description of Victorian etiquette to be a bore.
B0001O3YC6|4.0|As far as Sci-Fis go this is pretty good.  It is cetainly better then \\"Chronicles\\"  I believe this movie was Vin Diesel's first big break out role and does a good job planning, well a character you'd expect him to play.  Definately a movie you should check out and it is worth owning.
1400032717|5.0|Yup, that's how much I loved this book.  I was particularly impressed with the way human emotions are revealed through the dry and factual observations of a boy who can't personally experience these feelings, so much so that he has to carry a cheat sheet to match facial expressions with mood.   <br /> <br />It's a quick read - much to quick for me.  I closed the cover and was sad it was over.
B000068OSK|5.0|They could have used a tape recorder and this would have sounded just as good. Garage Rock at its absolute peak. All of you fans of their new albums: why don't you shell out some dough and find their roots.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I have always been a big batman fan since I was a kid. As a teenager, I was thrilled to see that finally somebody (Tim Burton) decided to make a big movie about him. I liked the movie really much, but still... I was left with the feeling that there was something missing. When the second production came out...wow!!! I was impressed!!! It finally got it!! Still, there was a lot of Burtonesque cartoonish flavor about it but it was the best of the first 4 movies (of course, before this one). Then, Schuhmacher came to the director chair and it all went down from that point... very dissappointing. I sadly came to the conclusion that my best childhood superhero was dead.  <br /> <br />I was very happy to see that superhero movies could have some substance and depth to them when the Spidey series came out (Two thumbs up still for Spidey 2, which for me, was the best superhero adaptation from Hollywood, until this one came out). Xmen 2 was incredibly awesome too. But this one really blows them all away!!! <br /> <br />First of all, the great story behind Bruce Wayne and all of his motivations which led him to become his alter ego. Then, the actors: Christian Bale was born to be Batman!!! I have to admit that I hadn't seen him acting before, I came to know him as an actor with this movie. He's a really good actor with a very promising career and a promising franchise; at this point, I can't think of anyone else who could put up with the Bruce Wayne/Batman role better than him. Not to mention the more known actors such as Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman (love his roles as the \\"badguy\\", and was stunningly surprised to see him as Comm. Gordon, but did a very good job with it). I even think that Katie Holmes did a nice job. Although her acting is not extraordinary here, but I think it was decent and did not affect the movie in its storytelling or quality, as opposite as other reviewers think.  <br /> <br />Now, regarding the Deluxe Double DVD edition... its features are awesome. I was a little afraid at first when I read a lot of complaint from some reviewers about the second disc menu, but I found it to be fun. Of course, if you did not have the patience to go all the way through the story, you did not find that at the very end of it, there is a little \\"document\\" icon. If you click on it, you finally see the whole menu in a \\"regular\\" or \\"decent\\" layout, as other reviewers may put it asking for something more \\"standard\\". It has all the featurettes included in the interactive comic book and even a couple of them, which I was not able to find in my first interactive \\"trip\\" through it. So, to all of the reviewers that state that it was a \\"challenge\\" for your DVD players and got frustrated about it, thinking that it was the only way of getting into the different features, never mind the comic book, go all the way to the end with the cursor arrows, click on the \\"document\\" arrow at the end of it, and there you go... good old standard menu for all of you. Hope this tip helps. <br /> <br />Enjoy
B00005JOGU|5.0|The critics are right about this movie. It's all about Philip Seymour Hoffman (THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY and MAGNOLIA). He is completely and totally Truman Capote and is always convincing with his mannerisms (his hand movements and his eyes in particular) I do not know when I have seen an actor convey so much of what he is thinking with his eyes alone. Catherine Keener (THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN) is convincing as Capote's friend Harper Lee. The photography is good and catches the bleak Kansas landscape so the movie works well on a wide screen.<br /><br />The film is disturbing. The realism of the execution is shattering, and Capote's personality leaves a lot to be desired. From his infatuation or whatever you prefer to call his feelings for the killer Perry Smith to his cynical use of this friendship for his own selfish interest, Capote's actions leave a lot to be desired. His book needed a conclusion that only an execution of the killers would bring about so he had no interest in helping Smith find a lawyer for further appeals. It's hard to imagine, however, that these two men would have ever \\"gotten off,\\" given the climate at the time and the evidence against them so Capote, had he chosen to do so, could have been a lot more decent by  actually attempting to help Smith in his appeal rather than refusing to answer his mail and then lying to him when he finally did visit him shortly before his execution. Capote ultimately could have written the same ending to his book.<br /><br />For all the brutal realism of this movie-- from the gruesome, bloody murders of the Clutter family to the execution-- I wondered if visitors to death row inmates actually went inside their cells and sat down with the men-- at one point Capote actually embraces Smith-- or was this detail added to make the film more dramatic.<br /><br />Even though the film is practically two hours long and could have been cut slightly without damaging the story, it's worth every minute of it to watch Hoffman. There are no surprises here since the Clutter story is well-known so the film is ultimately carried by the sheer performance of this most talented actor. His performance is not to be missed.n.

0743424425|5.0|This book was one of the best books i have ever read. I loved everything about it. The entire time i read The Shining i was just waiting and waiting to see what would happen next. King really brought the Overlook to life, with the hedge animals and the costume party that seems to never end. The way Stephen King described what was always going through Jack's mind and how his past always was coming back to haunt him is what really made this book great. Not only was Danny battling the spirits of the Overlook, Jack was battling his past. The ghosts take Jack over, and thats when the excitement and fear really come into play. I really enjoyed this Stephen King book and i intend to read more.
0525948023|5.0|Eckhart has done it again.  A clear , succinct message that we are already that which we seek, namely pure consciousness.

B000000XB9|5.0|My father is not a huge fan of rock and roll. He is an avid jazz fan who sees rock as a simplified form of his favorite genre. My father loves CCR. I remember the first time he played this compilation, and sitting amazed as I listened to John Fogerty send forceful grit flying from the speakers. To me, no American band can match Creedence Clearwater Revival's groove, melody or intensity. This collection provides 20 examples of their fine work. <br /> <br />CCR is perhaps the most concise band in history. The vast majority of the songs on this album clock in at under three minutes, yet never suffer from underdevelopment. It's been said that great bands build their style around their limitations, and CCR embodies this doctrine fully. Nearly every song begins with an insanely catchy, simple riff, while the rhythm section pounds out a tight groove, waiting for John Fogerty to command the world to listen to him. With the exception of the extended piece, \\"I Heard It Through The Grape Vine,\\" the songs never stray from these basic elements, and that's a good thing.  <br /> <br />Most of the songs here are justifiably common fare on classic rock radio, but these songs are so raw and elementally good that I will never tire of hearing them. Fogerty is a tremendous lyricist, and his topics range from love to life on the river to politics without ever sounding like products of their times. There is no pretention, no attempt at stardom, nothing trite in these songs, just the gritty sound of honest Americans. CCR shares stylistic element with the Rolling Stones, but to me is the far better band, obtaining a more serious, intense sound. <br /> <br />This album is probably the best compilation I have heard, and an excellent introduction to this truly classic band.
B000000YNZ|5.0|This is my favorite album by the Bill Evans trio. The album \\"How My Heart Sings\\" was recorded during the same session as this album and all the ballads from the session were put on \\"Moonbeams\\". This is one of the best jazz records I can think of. \\"Polka Dots and Moonbeams\\" is an absolutely beautiful song, but really the whole disc is breathtaking. Evans was depressed over the death of his bassist Scott Lafaro shortly after the recording of their performances at the Village Vanguard in New York, and the melancholy feel of the music matched his mood I'm sure. Whatever the circumstances were, this is one of my favorite jazz recordings and I have given it as a gift to many friends and relatives because I really think everyone should hear it.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Considering all the reviews expounding upon the musical merits of London Calling, I don't think there is much more I can say to persuade you to buy this album. Except for this. London Calling is a monster not because of the music alone, but because it is the greatest underdog story in the history of rock and roll.     I must note that this album did not hook me from the start. It took at least a minute and a half, immediately after the first chorus of the title cut, when I first heard Joe Strummer mangled the lyric that defines the album, \\"London Calling, to the imitation zone - forget it brother, and go it alone!\\" London Calling tells the story of abandonment. By friends, family, girls, big business, government and ultimately the punk movement that promised to change all that. London Calling is a cry to the scattered few who remain loyal to their ideals, to the fight, whatever it may be. It transcends time and geography, proclaiming a regrouping and the beginning of a new crusade.    The next cut shifts styles entirely to show the many distractions presented to these loyal soldiers, the promise of materialism, taking on the form of a \\"Brand New Cadillac,\\" owned by a former girlfriend. One of three cuts on consumerism, the vulnerable \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\" portrays a man trying and failing to find his identity in the products he buys, and \\"Koka Kola\\" gives a nightmare vision of corporate life. It is not capitalism itself that is under attack, but cultural obsession with the fruits of the system.     The prevailing theme throughout London Calling is perseverance through an impossible fight, one that has been lost before, and will probably never be won. On \\"The Guns of Brixton,\\" bassist Paul Simonon sings, \\"When the law break in/How you gonna go?/Shot down on the pavement/Or waiting in death row?\\" Life is not a possible outcome, but to go out fighting, to take out a few of enemy while losing, that is still worthwhile. Anecdotes about \\"Jimmy Jazz\\" and \\"Spanish Bombs\\" maintain similar themes.    Ultimately, the most important song on London Calling is \\"Death or Glory.\\" The song's lyrics seem to mock the band's idealistic pervseverance, with     Well every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock and roll  Grabs the mike and tells us he'll die before he's sold  But I believe in this and it's been tested by research  That he who f---s nuns will later join the church    Death or Glory becomes just another story   Death or Glory becomes just another story    Then, almost unbeknownst to the listener, Strummer begins to whisper, then to sing, then to shout, building to the anthemic, \\"We gonna raise TROUBLE! We gonna raise HELL!\\" Retorting all naysayers, the band insists that no matter how many have fallen from the movement, they still remain, more determined than ever to choose death or glory.    \\"I'm Not Down\\" is a more typical expression of underdog sentiments, but Mick Jones sings the tune with such honesty that it is difficult to criticize his straightforward lyrics.    The album's final cut, \\"Train in Vain,\\" nicely caps off the album, a simple pop song lamenting the unfaithfulness of the one woman who made life worth living. Jones maintains that though he sees no way in which he can live after her, he will somehow collect himself, forget her and proceed with the fight.     I discovered London Calling in the spring of my senior year of high school, at which point I thought that every person and every institution in the world had turned against me. To hear men who had been through far greater struggles express their anger and fear, but also their moxy and commitment, stopped me dead in my tracks, and convinced me that the only reasonable response to a lost struggle is to redouble one's resolve and make the attempt again. Hearing this in creative musical form was a revelation.
6304119046|5.0|It's one of the great films of all-time.  Cinematagraphy, screenplay, acting, music--stunning in every respect.  Orson was a genius, and despite problems with studios and funding he made many other brilliant films, most notably The Magnificent Ambersons and Chimes at Midnight. <br />
0385507755|5.0|under normal circumstances I don't really go for the Oprah Book Club thing. I'd even say at times it can be a bit of a deterent.<br /><br />I spent a few weeks just picking this up and looking at the jacket blurb and gauging the size of it everytime I saw it at the grocery store, but that Oprah Book Club sticker on it kept bugging me.<br /><br />On my Birthday a friend had given me a copy of the second book \\"my friend leonard\\", That gift closed the deal, I decided if I was going to read the second book then I would have to read \\"a million little pieces\\", I found a copy that day.<br /><br />  I read many things, but I am always drawn to those that deal with darker and more painful human struggle. And I usually read straight through most books, once I'm pulled in I can't be pulled back out until I'm finished.<br /><br />With two solid days and some 400 plus pages behing me I am in awe of this great book. Mr. Frey had me locked into the story by page 58, and I loved every minute  of the read. The voice is honest, to the bone, visceral and true. From time to time books come along that remind me that great writers still exist, this is one such book.<br /><br />  Mr. Frey seems lucky to be alive, but as readers we are luckier that he survived to write such an amazing book. Oprah made a great and edgy choice with this selection, I may have to reconsider her other recommendations.<br /><br />  consider this book required reading!
B0006399FS|5.0|Looks like I may be in the minority here, but U2 has put out its best album since Actung Baby, and in many ways I could argue it is its best ever.  The theme of the album transcends each song with meaningful lyrics on each piece that support a core message. <br /> <br />  It seems that the biggest complaint by some reviewers is that this album is too \\"mainstream.\\"  While I agree that this album will appeal to many, the album is unique and is not merely a regurgitation of other work by the band.  U2's sound on this album is perhaps most closely aligned with All That You Can't Leave Behind, but only because it has a more traditional rock structure.  That being said, each song is unique and the album as a whole has a very different feel from All That You Can't Leave Behind--and is a stronger album across the board. <br /> <br />  The lyrics are strong, the music is top notch and any U2 fan will certainly want this album in her collection.  Enjoy.

B00000255F|5.0|I came back from Vietnam, a young and confused kid and my sister told me that she had heard this new group, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Shuffle. My response was that any group with that moniker would never make it. So I guess that's how much I knew. But then, \\"Born to Run\\" was released.<br /><br />The individual songs are, like a great book, seamless. True, an overused word. But accurate nonetheless.<br /><br />And Bruce stays true to his title although I think sometimes it's more about freedom. I've thought about this for awhile and I think that some albums . . . Four Way Street, Allman Brothers: Live at Fillmore East, are meant to be live. And some are better in the studio. \\"Born to Run\\" is in the latter group.<br /><br />I don't know which track stands out. I'll be listening to 106.7 in Detroit and Thunder Road comes on and I say, 'that's it!' A couple of weeks later I'm in Chicago visiting my son and listening to XRT on 93.1 and Jungleland comes on. And I say, 'that's it!'<br /><br />This is a remarkable album about a remarkable band. I listen to Jungleland, Meeting across the River, Thunder Road and Born to Run and all I can think about is hope. Hope for us all. Hope for ourselves. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Talk about not resting on one's considerable laurels.  This one surprised the heck out of me: I don't consider myself a hardcore Mac fan, and I'd never have imagined that these four (and especially Lindsay Buckingham) would be having this much obvious fun after so many years.  Like _Up_ by Peter Gabriel, a fellow member of the old school infamous for taking his own sweet time between albums, _Say You Will_ was well worth the wait.  It's a delightful, energetic, surprisingly daring album, more than generous at 76 minutes.  And while I can sympathize with those who miss Christine McVie, and while I have nothing against her, I'd have to say that Buckingham/Nicks have the songwriting angle covered quite nicely on their own, thank you very much.  Going track by track, just for fun...<br /><br />1. What's the World Coming To?  (A-)  A catchy and solid midtempo opener in the classic Mac vein.<br />2. Murrow Turning Over in His Grave (A)  Love it.  Here we have the first of Buckingham's little experiments.  Nicely layered vocals, smart lyrics, squalling guitars...it's all good, especially the over-the-top, almost Pink Floyd-esque instrumental section in the final 1:41.<br />3. Illume (9-11) (B)  This one has its heart in the right place but could probably use a few more chord changes.<br />4. Thrown Down (A+)  Best song on the album.  It's pure, brilliant pop, courtesy of Stevie Nicks, though from the first note, it's Buckingham's shimmering guitar work that catapults it into the stratosphere.<br />5. Miranda (C)  First one that doesn't really work for me.  It's just kinda blah.<br />6. Red Rover (A)  Experiment #2.  Big wacky fun for Buckingham, with FM's formidable rhythm section keeping it anchored in as much reality as you really need.<br />7. Say You Will (B+)  I'd have no problem with the children's choir at the end if the kids sounded a bit more innocent and a bit less screechy, because it doesn't really fit the mood as presented, but whatever.  Nice little pop song otherwise.<br />8. Peacekeeper (B+)  Nothing groundbreaking, but I like the lyrics, and that \\"ah ah ah ah ah ah\\" thingy in the chorus is disturbingly catchy.<br />9. Come (A)  Experiment #3.  \\"Think of me every time you don't come\\"?  I'm not sure that makes any sense as a sendoff, and I'm even less sure that the rest of this song makes any sense as a song, but I flat-out love it nonetheless.  The chorus (if you can call it that) is a big cacophonic mess, but somehow, it just works.  And, wow, those guitars.  It's mad genius, and while others have had the temerity to suggest that it should have been left off the album, you should believe me and not them, because I'm right, darnit.<br />10. Smile at Me (C)  I've listened to this song over a dozen times, and it continues to leave no impression on me whatsoever, so I'm giving it the requisite neutral grade.<br />11. Running Through the Garden (A)  Irresistable, edgy, and beaten out by \\"Thrown Down\\" in the pure pop department by just the narrowest margin.  If you had to pick a track to play with the top down on a sunny day, this arguably would be it.<br />12. Silver Girl (D+)  Too boring for words (and it might have been better without them, because Nicks pretty much falls down here in the lyrical department).<br />13. Steal Your Heart Away (B)  Pleasant enough midtempo track, though nothing particularly special.<br />14. Bleed To Love Her (A-)  Great acoustic guitar work, and arguably the best vocal collaboration on the album.<br />15. Everybody Finds Out (A)  Yay...it rocks *and* it's got strings attached.  The last forty seconds of this one are my favorite forty seconds on the album, and I'd have given it an A+ if they lasted just a bit longer.<br />16. Destiny Rules (B-)  Pretty much what you'd expect at this point in the track list.<br />17. Say Goodbye (C)  Ditto.<br />18. Goodbye Baby (A)  Now this is something.  Written by Buckingham, sung by Nicks, it's terribly sad and terribly gorgeous, and it ends the album on a perfect note.  It reminds me somehow of Liz Phair, who should probably cover it pronto.over it pronto.
B000008CSN|5.0|Just an unbelievable album for a couple of reasons. First of all, I think we can't lose track of the fact that 7-8 years earlier, DJ's in New York (not a small market) like Peter Tripp (guy went down with payola) and Murray the K were playing Freddy Cannon and Franki Valli. There was no southern rock 'n roll. There was barely rock 'n roll. So here we go with tremendous lyrics. Tremendous acoustics. Gritty vocals. And they're doing this in the face of \\"I want to hold your hand\\" and \\"Time is on my side.\\"<br /><br />I don't mean to denigrate the UK guys but wow, can you listen TODAY to \\"Statesboro Blues\\" and not still hyperventilate? How about \\"Whipping Post?\\"<br /><br />Duane and Gregg were the real deal. And the second reason is that while Duane is missed the band, like all great bands, kept on moving. Dickie Betts was pretty good. Well OK, except for that Cher bit. What was that all about?<br /><br />5 stars. Larry Scantlebury

B00005JO0J|5.0|I agree with a lot of the posters here about the movie not being up to par with the DVD series. However, that's an unfair comparison. With a year long TV series, you are really able to get into it. You grow with it, and it can become something more than just a show. It becomes personal, and you can really feel and understand the characters. With a movie, you really only have about two hours to pack all of this feeling and emotion into the production. That's a very hard task. However, I think that Joss did a great job with that aspect of it, and, as movies go, this one ROCKS!! I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I think that the average movie-goer will to. It's a very exciting film that evokes a lot of different emotion. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it already, I also recommend the Firefly DVD series. It's simply fantastic, and it will give you a better understanding of the movie and its characters.
0767817664|5.0|I just love \\"Fright Night.\\" This was the last film I saw at a drive in,and I went the next night also.I love scary movies with comedy,and great acting and production.This is a MUST have for you DVD collection.
B00019PDKC|3.0|I WON'T SAY MUCH!! <br />Just listen to Hecate Enthroned - The Spell of the Winter Forest (from the album: Slaughter of Innocence) especially to the second half of the song and after this listen to track 6 \\"Pulled Under At 2000 Metres A Second\\" and tell me what you se..... ;@)
B0009NCQJ6|3.0|I love this group. They have a very unique sound, upbeat classical. That said, I'm disappointed in another compilation album from them. I'd like to hear something new.
B000BEZPQE|3.0|I saw them live, and wanted to go see them again but thats anther story. Anyways, I was very impressed by the show. Changed my life, they were my faviorte band of all time. Then Slayer played after Slipknot, and Slayer is now my faviorte metal band of all time. Same concert as Reign in Blood was filmed! The concert was probably the greatest thing ive seen in my entire life. Awesome set list,  Slipknot treats fans as long time friends, and interacts with the crowd very well. The problem? Corey isnt the best singer live. Plus if you go see Slipknot once, every concert is basically the same. He'll say the same thing about the fans and the area they are in. You'll feel speical going, until you go to anther concert and hear the same stuff. Isnt everything in show buisness like that though? The cd might have Skin Ticket, but its not too impressive and Iowa is cut short. Id go see them live again, but I wouldnt recommend a live cd. Enjoy this cd maggots, Slipknot will soon be done touring and be hibernating. See you in a few years Slipknot!
0740748475|4.0|There is something unique about Watterson; all Calvin and Hobbes fans know that.  No one should expect an explanation from Bill as to why he completely edited and altered the \\"biological mother\\" strip from November 25, 1988, which is reprinted in its original form in \\"Weirdos from Another Planet\\".  He is like J.D. Salinger and simply won't talk to the media; he has complete control over his edits, which means IT WAS HIS IDEA TO CHANGE IT, and thus, BLAME WATTERSON if you don't like the edit, NOT THE PUBLISHER.  <br /> <br />The original goes:  <br />CALVIN: Watch out, Mom. I'm in a bad mood. <br />MOM: Be in a bad mood somewhere else, OK? I'm busy. <br />CALVIN: Hmph! I'll bet my BIOLOGICAL MOTHER would've bought me a comic book and made me feel better instead of shunning me like you. <br />MOM: Kid, anyone but your BIOLOGICAL MOTHER would've left you to the wolves long ago. <br />CALVIN: Yeah right. REALLY, HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR ME? <br /> <br />Watterson CHANGED IT IN HIS OWN FREE WILL to read; <br /> <br />CALVIN: Watch out, Mom. I'm in a bad mood. <br />MOM: Be in a bad mood somewhere else, OK? I'm busy. <br />CALVIN: Hmph! I'll bet A GOOD MOTHER would've bought me a comic book and made me feel better instead of shunning me like you. <br />MOM: Kid, anyone but your GOOD MOTHER would've left you to the wolves long ago. <br />CALVIN: Yeah right. LET'S SEE YOUR TRAINING CERTIFICATE. <br /> <br />It changes alot of the meaning of the strip itself; instead of ending in a preguntory, philosophical QUESTION, he changes it to a flat statement with no rhetorical thought at all.  maybe he felt it was anti-adoption, and maybe he had a change of view after 15 YEARS.  it happens.  buy the set, respect watterson for not giving in to big business TEN years ago or selling out to plush toys and stickers, which are ALL illegal and never approved by Bill.  He is a genius, and should be able to edit ONE comic in his opus if he felt the need-- he deserves all the credit he receives.
0722532938|3.0|Looking at the cover of this book with the combination of colors,words of appraisal and the impressive one line reviews I thought I'm in for something that is gonna alter my existence. I enjoyed the beginning of this book for it promises an unpreachy worldly outlook and in simpler words, boredomfree reading. The first thing I enjoyed in this book was how the young boy assumed a sheperd's life to travel to distant parts of earth. Somewhere in the middle of the book it starts to lose it's plot and got a tad repetitive for my liking.<br /><br />\\"The Alchemist\\" taught me two things.One, you can realise your destiny at any given point of your life. Two, \\"Your Eyes Show The Strength Of Your Soul\\" Overall, I'd say this book is an average read really. If you think you're missing out on  something by not reading it, then I'd say you're not.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|I love this movie.  It's imaginative and fast-paced.  It's very, very funny.  The action sequences are great.  I am not normally a kung fu aficionado, but I like the offbeat, and I was intially attracted to see this movie because I saw the promo with the slum landlady in curlers and the mobsters dancing in sequence. Then what a pleasant surprise to meet Sing... what a great character! The movie exceeded all of my expectations and I hated to see it end.  Stephen Chow is brilliant.
B000000WCA|5.0|Spice Girls are the greatest pop girl group of all time!! No contest!! These girls may have been the butt of many jokes and recieved plenty of critism for their harmonies, but I think their music, especially on this album, is pop genius!!! Scary, Baby, Ginger, Posh, and Sporty make the best pop music anyone can buy in only ten songs here. They ooze with charisma, charm, fun, and originality. Buy this album or you are truly missing out!! <br /> <br />Spice: <br />1. Wannabe - The song that started it all. The song is extremly simple but insanely catchy and fun. A pop song to last a lifetime. The song is one of my least favorite though. 8/10 <br /> <br />2. Say You'll Be There - Brilliant pop song. Plenty of sass and yearning with good harmonies. Love Emmas voice. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. 2 Become 1 - The ballad about safe sex. This song is still great and beautiful. Harmonies are brilliant and I love the music. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Love Thing - The sassiest and yet perky Girl Power song on the album. The song has the funnest rap provided by Mel B. making the song an extremley fun pop song. Maybea little cheesy but it is tons of fun. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Last Time Lover - A sexy song with sexy vocals and interesting lyrics about second guessing sexual rendeavous. 8/10 <br /> <br />6. Mama - A great ballad about mothers. The vocals are sweet and the harmonies beautiful. The acoustic guitar and powerful chior really take the song to a higher place. Brilliant. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Who Do You Think You Are? - A great song with fun lyrics and catchy chorus. The song is lots of fun with its Disco beat. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Something Kinda Funny - The song that got the girls their record deal. This laid back R&B song is so catchy and sexy that you cant help but love it. It is brilliant and nicely sung. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. Naked - My favorite song on the album. This haunting song about sex is extremly beautiful. Great Harmonies and belty vocals (mel C) and sexy vocals provided by the spices. Brilliant song with an R&B beat. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. If U Can't Dance - A dance song with an fun rap and sexy vocals provided by Geri and Mel B. 8/10 <br /> <br />This album is a classic, it defines pop at its briliance.
0679422714|5.0|Dear son George, <br />  <br />I have just finished what is a first for me.  I have read a best seller --  The release of: Mao the Untold Story in the USA edition  -- for the first time before it became a best seller.  Also before Time Magazine gave a full page review of the book in this week's edition.  However the reviewer does a very poor job and probably did not read the book.  Please read the review and \\"destroy\\" it on your blog.  The review is a farce.  He covers very little of what the book is about and obviously has doubts about the main proposition of the book, that Mao was motivated by his desire for personal power and ruthlessly put to death anyone in his way, no matter how close they were to him; and he had no care for the Chinese people or their future.  Which of course can be historically documented. <br />  <br />The almost endless list of murdered friends relatives and associates that he used and then destroyed for simple statements of opposition to his policies are documented facts of history.  The reviewer omits any mention of this tyranny. <br />  <br />The reviewer, Adi Ignatius betrays his doubts about the book's conclusions which cast a shadow over the whole of the extensive research, that he seems to acknowledge, by one statement re: the above mentioned proposition of the book : \\"Who could characterize even their own feelings with such certitude.\\"  I would say someone read the book for him and he got paid for the review <br />  <br />Anyway the book is a mammoth read and has taken me many hours stretched over almost 3 weeks.  The documentation is unique in that it is incredibly extensive but there are no footnote numbers inserted in the text but almost every page is documented in the notes at the end of the book.  The reviewer mentions that there are about 817 pages in the book; there are actually 877including many unnumbered pages of  maps and 36 full pages of photos with extensive text.  He does not know evidently that the text is 630 pageslong and almost 300 pages are given to documentation and lists of sources that seem endless.  What an incredible accomplishment.  What ever else may be said about the authors, they are literary geniuses. <br />  <br />Fred P Miller <br />PO Box 274 Slanesville, WV 25444 <br />304 496 8094 <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have to say that this album is one of the best albums in a while. Britney gets lots of criticism from people all the time, saying that she can't sing and is untalented. But I disagree completely. I am not going to lie and say she is a great singer becuase she isn't. She is a popstar with the great elements that make a popstar great. And I think Britney has more potential to last through bubblegum pop phases and this album proves she has what it takes to be the next Madonna or Janet. Two icons with limited vocal ability themselves. This album takes Brit's sex appeal to a higher place, a place that hasn't been done well since Madonna hit Erotica and Janet did her Velvet Rope album. Britney's IN THE ZONE is a perfect album, every song is catchy and each song engulfs you in its sexual rythyms and trance. IN  THE ZONE is the perfect dance album for anyone ready to see Brit mature and for those wanting dance pop perfection. <br /> <br />Each Song is good: <br />1. Me Against The Music - A great dance song! Madonna and Britney are the ultimate pop duo! Though the begining is cheesy the chorus and hooks will take you in and get you moving. 9/10 <br /> <br />2.(I Got That) Boom Boom - One of the best on the album! The Rappers and fun and sexy chorus make this song completely fun! 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Showdown - A good r&b dance tune with a unique beat. 8/10 <br /> <br />4. Breathe On Me - Britney experiments with techno and comes out with a sexual trance of a song. Very erotic and pretty. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Early Morning - Moby produced track. The song is kinda different and it is kinda alternative, not quite pop, r&b, or dance. very different. My least fave song on the album 5/10 <br /> <br />6. Toxic - The song is extremely popular. It has a great dance beat, breathy sexy vocals, and a unique violin screetching intro that makes the song unique. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Outrageous - The most R&B song ont the album. This R.Kelly written song is sexy and serious while still getting you to dance. 8/10 <br /> <br />8. Touch Of My Hand - Another song with trance and dance influences. The song is similar to Breathe On Me, but more subtle, making it even sexier. My favorite song on the album. 11/10 <br /> <br />9. The Hook Up - A regaee inspired song that is fun and catchy even though its had to understand what is being said. 7/10 <br /> <br />10. Shadow - A ballad that is just brilliant. The song is haunting and beautiful with good vocals provided by Mrs. Federline. 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Brave New Girl - The song that doesn't quite fit in with the others. The song reminds me of anticipating from the Britney album. Its a little too poppy to be on this album. 6/10 <br /> <br />12. Everytime - Completely brilliant, haunting, beautiful, and very sad. Regret is a sad topic and Britney takes it on greatly. Britneys best ballad ever. 10/10 <br /> <br />the other two tracks are basic remixes. <br /> <br />A brilliant album everyone should own!!!!!! Buy it now!!!!

B000063DFN|5.0|I think we can all agree that this is one of the best Maiden albums.  If you don't like the larger genre of heavy metal, then you may not like it, but I can't think of any REAL metal fan who didn't like this album.  Aces High, Two Minutes to Midnight, Flash of the Blade, and the rest...all classics.  Fans can enjoy Maiden on a number of levels: if you're into the technical guitar work, Murray and Smith never dissapoint, if on the other hand you just like to jam out, Maiden has a serious adrenaline rush behind the play button.  Also, McBrain and Harris are extremely talented and provide solid underpinnings, sometimes so solid that you may neglect to appreciate the genius underneath.  I look at Maiden's career as having two major peaks and some valleys.  The first peak is Seventh Son, up to that point, each album gets better and better, until it peaks at that masterpiece, then dramatically falls off on Fear of the Dark, No Prayer for the Dying and X.  The reason for the decade-long valley?  I can only guess it can be summed up in two words: No Smith.  Adrian Smith must have been a much larger force and influence in the composition.  In ~1990, Smith was replaced by ex-Spirit and Maiden afictionado Janick Gers.  The band's composition faltered as a result.  By ~1999, Maiden decided to take Smith back but kept Gers, resulting in a three guitar line up, which brought back Maiden in a big way on Brave New World.  So basically, you can skip Maiden in the 90s, which was when I was discovering them (1990, that is).  They came here to Indianapolis but I didn't go because I'd have to sit through the whole Ozzfest thing (or maybe that was Priest, I can't remember).  So I still long to see them live, but I've seen their live video, and it probably was a better view anyway.  By the way, even though I refer to Maiden's career peaking at Seventh Son, there are still great tunes on the earlier albums, it's just that the albums themselves aren't masterpieces like Seventh Son.  So enough of my ranting...Powerslave, Seventh Son and others are classic metal albums that defined the genre.  Maiden is sort of the bridge between progressive and pop metal, or the niche that Maiden carved out, heavy metal, somewhere between Motley Crue and Metallica, maybe closer to Megadeth.  All up for debate.
0790731479|2.0|I love this movie and I bought it on VHS a long time ago. Recently I bought the regular PG version on DVD at my mom's store. The first thing i noteced was that the disc was double sided! about halfway thru I had to flip the disc over to watch the rest of the movie. and another thing: It was censored. I don't mean just the \\"violence\\" i mean language. Then I bought the PG-13 version hoping for a better verson. Instead I found out it was the same thing, just with a different cover. So i reccomend you buy the VHS.<br /><br />Trust me, it sucks.
B000063DIH|2.0|If you're new to Iron Maiden, you're probably wondering what albums to buy.  Let me warn you: this is not one of their best.  None of the songs are memorable.  This was one of their 90s albums WITHOUT Smith, and all of their albums without Smith, including No Prayer and X, are terrible.  It doesn't even sound like Maiden compared to Powerslave or Seventh Son.  Several of the reviews on here actually praise this album.  I think they must have this album confused with something else.  I think there's only one or two good songs on here and I can't remember their titles nor their melodies.  I could cut and paste this review for No Prayer for the Dying.  I remember I was in high school when this album came out, which was 1990.  I put the tape into my tape player in my car and started listening and I felt so let down.  How could such a great band make such a miserable album?  A major disappointment.  Now I knew I would probably have to wait two years or longer for a new Maiden album, and even after the wait, who knows how good the album would be.  I tried hard to like this album, I listened to it over and over, every morning while I was getting ready for school.  No dice.  It would be over nine long years until another good new Maiden album would come out (Brave New World)...so hopefully this review will counter-balance any positive reviews.  DONT BUY THIS ALBUM! IT IS TERRIBLE!
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little Pieces by James Frey is the true and harrowing and all too often explicit account of James Frey's time spent in a rehabilitation clinic.  I never thought I would read this book until somebody urged me to try it.  Like many others who have spoken to me about this book, I was hooked from the very first page.  And although I found that  I could have gulped down the pages in a day or two I had to take breaks to catch my breath and think about this man and his experiences so overwhelming was his story.<br /><br />Most likely this will be my number 1 read for this year and I cannot think of a better book to choose for my list.  While not an easy read and I might say I appreciated this book rather than enjoyed it this was a most worthwhile and illuminating read as to the powers and triumphs of the of the human spirit. I also found this book to show that friendships and the support of others, in James case the wonderful men and women he found at the rehab center made all of the difference for his recovery.  and how poignant was the ending when I found out what happened to many of James' friends and fellow addicts.  Most of all the book beautifully describes James relationship with Leonard who is like a father to him and Lily a woman with the most regrettable of lives who he falls in love with and promises to protect when she leaves the clinic.  I read the pages of last meeting with Lily with tears streaming down my face and know that James and these people will stay with me for a lifetime<br /><br />I consider this a must read for everybody who is not only fighting addictions but also for those who want a better understanding of how these can take hold of a person and change lives forever.  James story is but one of thousands but it does provide a detailed picture of what drives somebody to an addiction and the road back.<br /><br />The book was made even more real now that I watched the author on the Oprah show, saw his parents, brother, wife and young daughter. By all accounts at 23 James was almost dead but today he is happily married, productive and loving his sober life.<br /><br />Kudos to Mr. Frey for succeeding on a journey that never really ends and for Ms. Winfrey for recommending this book.  And kudos to my friend and fellow colleague for pressing this book into my hands and saying, \\"Read this.  You won't be sorry!\\"young daughter.

B000063DI8|2.0|What a letdown this album is!  I remember when this album came out, I was in high school, and I bought this at the mall.  Got out to my car, put the tape in, and listened to Tailgunner.  It was ok, but only ok.  I could sense that the whole album was going to be weak, and I was right.  I was so depressed.  I was thinking that it was Fear of the Dark when I wrote a review for that one but it was this one.  What a downer.  Tailgunner and maybe the second song are mediocre.  The rest are terrible.  Tailgunner is a second-rate Aces High recap with only about 20% of the adrenaline.  Don't buy this album if you like Maiden.  I can't believe that people gave this 4 and 5 stars.  They are confused.
B000092Q8K|5.0|Do not listen to Bill Bennett's reviews of Peter Gabriel's re-released SACD albums. The SACD releases are head and shoulders better than the CD releases.<br /><br />Despite the rather odd change in the running order I am continually impressed by this disc which has been in my collection for some time now.<br /><br />I remember looking forward to hearing Mercy Street in SACD and it did not disappoint. The quality of this recording is excellent from start to finish. The bass lines in Sledgehammer, That Voice Again and In Your Eyes feel like Tony Levin is right there in your living room.<br />Cymbals and high end are crisp and have great resolve. There are no issues with cranking this recording, it is clean and clear, an excellent example of stereo SACD.<br /><br />My only fault with this recording is that they did not make a multi-channel mix of it. The SACD multi-channel mix on \\"Up\\" is brilliant. On \\"Play The Videos\\" Daniel Lanois and Peter Gabriel did some excellent 5.1 mixes and every video is presented in DTS 96/24, but to put it in persepctive if I'm going to listen to In Your Eyes I'll take the 2 channel stereo version over the DTS 96/24 version because the fidelity is noticeably better.
B000092ZYX|5.0|One Day Radio Head will release a collection much like that of Pink Floyds Shine Collection that will also rival it in importance and how worth it, it will be to own.  Fortunatly they will be seen as equals.  When that collection does come out I shall put each disc in my player with the utmost care, put on state of the art headphones that blockout even an alarm that signals either a bombing raid or a tornado, hit repeat then play and enter a comatic state of bliss that I will never want to get up from (except to take care of the essentials ofcoarse).  I feel that this album is the frosting, icing, cherry or what have you ontop of a multilayerd Radiohead experience that combines all they have done to a sweet flowing album that makes you wish time could stand still to give each track on this disc its due time (but then again I feel that way about every radio head album so...) if you were expecting something different from Radiohead then think again with no where to go than across (since they are already as high as they can go) a mix of experience from each album is quite possibly the best thing they could have done which in fact is a new high in its own right.
B000002HJD|5.0|People do not give Jim Morrison the credit he deserves as a poet. This album proves how brilliant this man really was. This is one of my favorite albums (and in my opinion) the album to own if you're a Morrison fan. Even if you're not,you will be after this.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|My favorite Depeche Mode (\\"DM\\") album before this album was Songs of Faith & Devotion (\\"SOFAD\\"). Now, I don't know - I might like this the better than SOFAD. Tough - it's a tie. Anyway, anyone who knows SOFAD will agree that SOFAD was one of DM's darker albums.  With Playing the Angel, there are also quite a few \\"dark\\" songs, which I love; so it might lead some people to consider this a dark/moody album as well. But I actually think quite the opposite. <br /> <br />My favorite songs from these album are Suffer Well, The Sinner In Me, Precious, I Want It All, Nothing's Impossible. But I know I will love all of the other songs as they grow on me. I know I will because all DM songs do grow on me. <br /> <br />In short: <br /> <br />Suffer Well - the lyrics are dark in DM style, but the melody is really uplifting. <br /> <br />The Sinner In Me - the lyrics are dark.  The melody is dark as well but very catchy if not addicting. <br /> <br />Precious - lyrics and melody are the most uplifting among the 5 songs that I have mentioned. If there is one song for the radio, this is it. <br /> <br />I Want It All - Not dark or moody, but not very uplifting. If you've felt you were in a haze at one point, this song does it for you through the ears. It sort of reminds me of Waiting for the Night from Violator. <br /> <br />Nothing's Impossible - although it sounds positive, the melody is quite dark and heavy. It's got heavy beats like The Sinner in Me.  It's also very catchy and addicting to listen to.  <br /> <br />Overall this is a great album to own. Best album that I've purchased in a long time.  I don't know how everyone else feels, but I have an ear for listening to DM as well as the alternative bands and west coast rappers of the 90s.  Listening to DM brings me back to my younger gen-X flannel days.  I can't wait to see DM live.
061301328X|5.0|When I first read this book, I was nine years old and not as intelligent as I am now. What attracted me to James Clavell's masterpiece was the samurai katana on the front, only because I was enamored with anything Japanese at the time. Little did I know the adventure I was going to get into. I started to read it and was bored within ten minutes. Of course, being little, there was a difference in my intellect from when I read it again at 12. This time, the book captivated me and definately held my interest. Now at the age of fifteen, I have read this book a total of 14 times. There is no novel I enjoy more than Shogun. It is much like a movie, every time I go back to enjoy the beatiful tale of Shogun, I find something new. The characters are presented in a beleivable way, especially in the enviroment they are set in. You instantly fall in love with the lush Japanese landscape, unforgettable characters, and deep submersive plot. The first night I started to really read it, I didn't get to bed until nearly 4 a.m. Now off of the personal story with Shogun. <br /> <br />The events in Shogun may not have that much of an accurate story from the point of history. Unless you are thouroughly offended by something being told wrong pertaining to Japanese history, then you will absolutely fall in love with this book. The plot starts off a little slow, but it soon takes off and submerses you into Japanese culture, ways, and politics. I seriously reccomend the book to anyone with an interest in a deep plot or wonderful characters, pick up this book.
B000001GH9|5.0|Alban Berg (1885 -- 1935) composed his violin concerto as a requiem for a young woman, Manon Gropius, but the work effectively became Berg's own requiem as well.  It is Berg's last completed score, written in 1935.  This is passionate, emotive music which staddles the bounds between atonality and musical romanticism.  The performance by Anne-Sophie Mutter and James Levine conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, recorded in 1992,is justly celebrated. This is an ideal introduction to Berg and to his masterful violin concerto. This is difficult music, make no mistake. The new listerner should stay with it, as the violin concerto will reward many hearings.<br /><br />I used the discussion of this work in Michael Steinberg's book, \\"The Concerto,\\" (1998) as a guide to my listening.  Steinberg writes with great enthusiasm for Berg's concerto and gives the reader a good, brief introduction to Berg and his work.  The violin concerto is a hermetic work.  That is, the concerto is filled with allusions to Berg's love life, to affairs both late in his life and to an affair he had as a young man.  The work also shows Berg's fascination with secrecy and with numerology.  He followed certain pseudo-science of his day in thinking that the number 23 had some mystical significance for the life-rhythm while the number 28 had significance for women.  This thinking, and other beliefs in lucky numbers and the like are built into Berg's score.<br /><br />But of the music were only a code to be deciphered, it would not be of much interest.  The emotion and force of the violin concerto drew me in and will make the work live for other listeners as well.  The work is in two movements, each of which has two parts.  The first movement opens slowly and elegaically with a quiet figure in the harp, followed shortly by an ascending 12-tone figure for the violin.  The second part of the music is more rapid in tempo and develops nostagically an old folk-song -- in Berg's case, perhaps, to remind him of a love affair he had when young, the memory of which remained with him through life.<br /><br />The second movement opens with a violently dissonant passage that speaks of calamity and loss.  The second part of the movement, though, is a response and an answer to deep sorrow.  It develops a chorale theme from a Bach cantata, \\"Es ist Genug\\" through a combination of Bach's harmonies and Berg's own.  The chorale goes through a number of variations and moods ranging from a rememberance of love and passion to quiet acceptance and resignation.  The work fades away with only the solo violin remaining at the end.  The solo and the orchestral writing are deeply intertwined in this concerto.<br /><br />It may be a shame that Wolfgang Rihm's \\"Time Chant: Music for Violin and Orchestra\\" is the companion piece on this CD. It seemed to me a thoughtful work, but it pales in comparison with the Berg.  Rihm is a prolific contemporary German composer, and he wrote this work for Anne-Sophie Mutter. This was my first exposure to his music. The \\"Time Chant\\" is in two movements, both of which feature the violin playing declamatory passages at the top of its register punctuated on occasion by orchestral outbursts.  The work shimmers and has the quality of a chant but functions mostly as a showpiece for Ms. Mutter's formidable technique.  There are some striking passages for the violin but they are surrounded by musical moments in which not much happens.<br /><br />The Mutter-Levine reading of Berg's concerto is more than enough reason to hear this CD with Rihm's work an intriguing addition. This disk offers an outstanding opportunity to get to know one of the great masterpieces of Twentieth Century music.<br /><br />Robin Friedmand him of a love affair he had when young, the memory of which remained with him through life. <br /> <br />The second movement opens with a violently dissonant passage that speaks of calamity and loss.

0380002930|5.0|I can't add too much to the plot descriptions and praise already posted here.  Suffice to say that this was the first grown up novel I ever read, at age nine or thereabouts, and it certainly didn't turn me off reading. <br /> <br />A book for both children and adults, I re-read it every few years, picking up more each time -- From animal adventure to folkloric saga to political allegory.  I hope that I'll find even more in it next time I read it.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Why is this so bad. I just get tired. My girlfriend got this and I feel the other one is better. Much more so. Is it just a way to make more money? I feel like we thought we were getting new songs but all they did was take the old songs and leave off the embellishments. \\"The long and winding road\\" use to sound like a lullabye now it sounds like its unfinished. But my girlfriend had me laauhging today with one by the Rolling Stones called \\"let it bleed\\"! I think the Rolling Stones were prolly ripping off the Beatles in a real obvious way!!! <br /> <br />Matthew Poturich
B00000JMOJ|3.0|The idea behind this film is a good one and seems more relevant nowadays , what with all the 'reality' shows on TV , which shows how far we've gone backward . Maybe they'll stop showing the news as it will just get in the way of those shows . <br /> <br />Does society love violence when it is structured and organised ?  <br /> <br />The film deals with this idea and delivers on the action front . <br />I like the dark humor in it . <br />Enjoy it for what it is - there is a Special Edition DVD available also .
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This movie out did the first buy far by going much more by the book! I found it to be alot better to watch than the first which had pointless songs in it which is understandable considering it's time but I always fast forwared through all the songs but in this movie, there is no reason to fast forward. I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and this along with all his other Tim Burton movies shows what a talented actor he trully is. Any true Johnny Depp fan and fan of the book will find this movie worth the watch!
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I'm not a Metallica fan and would have hated to miss out on seeing a great documentary because I didn't like the music . <br /> <br />If you have not seen this because of your own musical preferences , I encourage you to put those aside , as you will be missing out . <br /> <br />Watch and see how the very successful and wealthy cannot just use money to help with problems that arise . Rather , they have to rely on talking to each other .   <br />We all do , I suppose . <br /> <br />A fascinating film .
0792163710|2.0|I had read  the book as required reading in ninth grade, then my teacher showed the class the movie. If this were a stand-alone film, and the novel didn't exist, then I would greatly enjoy it. However, it gets several things wrong. It adds a level of hostility to Joe Starret's relationship with Shane. In the novel, the two were more friendly towards each other. In the film however, you get the impression that Joe's on the verge of shooting him. Joe's wife (sorry, I forgot her name) is made to appear a little more rougher thean she was in the novel. The actor who played Shane looks all wrong. The cover of the novel paints Shane as a man with an ominous air to him, and he looks younger. The movie version seems to have trouble potraying that. Then there is Joey, who is called Boby in the novel and also the narrator. In the novel, I sympathised with him. The movie goes for the route of curious kid with annoying voice. Thne there's the scene where Shane knocks Joe out to prevent him from fighting Fletcher. This never happened. In the novel, Shane persuaded Joe to let him go instead. I will give props to the costume design, the beatiful settings, and a score that really fit the scenes. If you enjoyed the book, then don't expect a faithful adpation. This is not.

B00009ATIX|5.0|Have you ever seen Solaris with George Clooney?  I love this film.  It moves a little slow (the director of the film is the guy who directed Oceans 11 but he was trying to impress the artsy crowd with Solaris) at times.  But it is about, in the future, a psychiatrist whose wife committed suicide, being asked to go to a space station that is circling this wierd planet named Solaris.  Seems everyone on the station has been going bonkers.  When he gets there he finds that for everyone there, the planet reaches into their memories and brings someone to them that they have an unresolved issue with.  His wife comes back to him.  But here is the trick: his wife is constructed from his memories about her, and that is the cool thing about the whole film.  See, when we meet people, especially when we have relationships with them, we think about them and remember them in ways that are not actually correct with who they are.  So since his wife acted a little wierd, he remembers her as a 'crazy person' and never really got to know her.  His 'new' version of his wife is incomplete in her head; she is only his idea of her, which is as a sad, incomplete person.  In flashbacks the movie shows that he has missed the idea on her; she actually was quite stronger than him at times.  But of course their relationship could not go on because he NEVER really got to know who she was (as he says in the film, in a beautiful line, \\"I was haunted by the idea that I had remembered her wrong.\\").  They will keep repeating the same old arguments, because they don't allow that the other can change. <br />
B000AQBA1W|5.0|I have been a fan of The Corrs since the very beginning, when they released \\"Runaway\\". I have all of their full albums. And as much as I love their songs, that becoming more pop (maybe to fit the American taste *shrugs*), I yearn to have them playing the Irish sounds, especially the instrumental like the ones they have in their first and second album. So this is a dream comes true. I love the songs they have here. The addition of the songs in Gaelic is masterpiece. There are two songs that have been recorded before \\"Old Town\\" (MTV Unplugged) and \\"Haste to the Wedding\\" (In Blue Special Edition) but still, this album is worth for collection. If you're a true The Corrs fan, you won't miss this one.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Gosford Park is a big English country house in the early 1930s. It is inhabited by William McCordle (Michael Gambon), his wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott-Thomas) and their daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford). William and Sylvia's not very happy marriage is a fairly flagrant exchange of financial prosperity for social standing as prior to it she was immensely posh but broke, while he was not posh at all but extremely rich thanks to the factories he owns. They are hosting a weekend social gathering to do a spot of shooting and have invited mainly her relatives, his being presumably too common. The exception is his cousin Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) who belongs to the new Hollywood aristocracy (not that that cuts much social ice hereabouts - the servants are overawed, their masters sniffy) and his film director friend from Hollywood Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban) who has got himself invited along with a view to researching a planned movie about toffs together with the later's valet Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe). Also along are Sylvia's sister Louisa Stocksbridge (Geraldine Somerville) accompanied by her arrogantly patrician war hero husband Raymond (Charles Dance) and his valet Robert Parks (Clive Owen); her other sister Lavinia (Natasha Wightman) rather less successfully married off to the weak and financially straightened Anthony (Tom Hollander) who is as desperate to get William to invest in his schemes for a boot factory in the Sudan as William is determined to do no such thing; her nephew Freddie Nesbit who is also in dire straits for money and divides his time between sucking up to William in the hope of being offered employment and bullying his wife Mabel (Caudie Blakely), who has also been married for her money, but having had less that was hoped, is now treated with merciless scorn and contempt; Sylvia's stingy and supercilious aunt Constance Trentham (Maggie Smith) and her maid Mary MacCeachran (Kelly MacDonald).  That's about it upstairs about from a couple ofadditional young fellows Lord Rupert Standish (Laurence Fox) and Jeremy Blond (Trent Ford) who show up late and never really integrate successfully into either the social gathering or the film except that the former seems to have his eye on Isobel or at least what she stands to inherit inheritance.  <br /> <br />You might perhaps think that was already complicated enough. But in the meantime Parks and Maceachran arrive downstairs to find themselves in the midst of a huge army of servants presided over by housekeeper Mrs Wilson (Helen Mirren) and alcoholic butler Jennings (Alan Bates) prominent among whom are head cook Mrs Croft (Eileen Atkins); head housemaid (and William's mistress), Elsie (Emily Watson), William's valet Probert (Derek Jacobi), the lecherous footman George (Richard E. Grant) and the nymphomaniac kitchen maid Dorothy (Sophie Thompson). All this huge array of people mingle, gossip, intrigue their way though an evening and the following day until, the second evening, Sir William turns up murdered in his study, bringing the law onto the scene in the form of the drolly moronic Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) and his rather less dimwitted underling Constable Dexter (Ron Webster). <br /> <br />Smith, Mirren, Gambon, Scott-Thomas, Jacobi, Bates, Dance, Watson, Grant, Atkins, Fry... Some cast. The British film A-list is very bit as talented as their American counterparts but, sadly for them, an awful lot less expensive, to the point where it is possible for a movie such as this to simply buy them all up as a huge job lot. All are perfectly cast and superb with the exception I fear of Fry whose bumbling clod of an Inspector is mildly amusing but completely unbelievable and belongs in a very different, less serious and naturalistic sort of comedy than is this: like Geraldine Chalplin in 'Nashville' he is the comic touch that doesn't really work. In such a sprawling typically Altmanesque ensemble piece it should be impossible for any actor to dominate but happily no one has explained this to Maggie Smith whose magnificently funny performance effortlessly steal the movie.  <br /> <br />It's a hugely enjoyable movie superbly put together. Altman has much with age. It lacks the satirical savagery of a `Nashville' or a `Short Cuts' and a clearly deeply critical take on the puffery, snobbery and often terrible cruelty of this ferociously hierarchical class system is tempered and slightly undermined by a slight but definitely perceptible unmistakeable nostalgic sneaking regard for this nice stable ordered but clearly dying world where everybody knew where they belonged and (mostly) stayed there. So it's an at once contemptuous and affectionate, despairing and humane picture of a bunch of toffs and their servants in the years between the wars with a scene in the middle where they all go off shooting birds in the local woods: it's certainly natural to suppose all this involves considerably more than a nodding glance back to Renoir's `Rules of the Game'. If that is Altman's model of course he hasn't matched it but he's nonetheless made a richly intricate, intelligent and highly enjoyable film.  <br />
B00005JN0T|4.0|For those of you who do not know yet, the movie \\"i'Robot\\" and the short story collection by Issac Asimov from which the movie takes it's name, are not the same story.  Not even close.  The only connection is the Three Laws of Robotics, and a few character names.  This is not a bad thing, however.  Personally I much prefer that the movie only took place in the Asimov universe rather than try to adapt one of, or (worse yet) merge together, Asimov's robot stories. <br /> <br />Many Asimov purists are spitting mad at this film for not being a faithful adaptation of the book.  When you think about it, however, two major issues come up: <br /> <br />1) i'Robot the book is a short story collection, how could you make a normal feature length movie out of such a book, and <br /> <br />2) Most movies (not all though) do no justice to the source material, so isn't it better to have a completely new story that is based in the universe of the original source material than mutilate a beloved story <br /> <br />Either way, i'Robot is a fun, action packed, summer blockbuster by every definition.  The story is more of an extension of the i'Robot universe, which was probably the best way to go with this material.  Overall, I am thoroughly impressed.
B00000IL26|5.0|The Sidewinder is one of the greatest jazz albums ever released and really goes to show that Morgan is the best trumpet player even if he did not live past the age of 33. <br /> <br />Morgan's sassy, funky licks create complete jazz euphoria to all who listen. There isn't one track on the album that is anything short of spectacular and all the songs were written by Morgan. <br /> <br />This album deserves all the accolades it receives.
B000068OCS|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi is a Hopi Indian word that means \\"life out of balance\\". Godfrey Reggio, the director, said he had to be talked into even giving the movie a word title.  He, in fact, had to be talked out of giving it a symbol title (which probably has never been done in movies). He also made the movie without any spoken words, making it come straight at you without any supports, or carry on baggage.  There is an energetic sound track from Phillip Glass which is really not a support either. It is explained in one of the DVD features that the viewer is to understand the film by entering into the space between the scenes and the music, which I thought was a very interesting concept.  (By the way, be sure to visit the special features.  They are highly informative about how the film came together).     Our planet is displayed to us as if we had come from outer space to see it for the first time.  The film migrates from some truly astounding and spiritual nature shots in the first part of the film to hectic and sometimes disturbing civilization shots later in the film.  We go from clouds, mountain, and oceans to big cities with lots of people, buildings, traffic, and machinery. Some of the film is speeded up to show the flow of clouds (that looks like the ocean) and the flow of traffic (that looks like arteries).  Also, at times, the film is slowed down to study people and their faces as the try deal with the pace and density of things in the cities.  Add to this the unique Phillip Glass sound track, and you get the full effect of  the meaning of Koyaanisqatsi.     The Phillip Glass music is integral to the strange feel of the movie.  He, of course, is the guru of Minimalist Music, which sounds to me roughly like a morph of Classic Rock with Classical music (maybe Baroque).  It is repetitive, but in an engaging and powerful way, with enough variation to keep you into it -  which is hard to envision if you have not heard his music before. I like it very much.  Though it might not be for everybody, I think it really works for this movie.    I hope you enjoy this unique movie as much as I did.
0671027387|1.0|If you know anything about technology and how to develop a good password, then read this for the comical value. This book reminds me of a B-rated movie. Starting with the plot, and the now expected lack of character development, the whole book as a piece of writing is unbelievable. The lack of facts just follows course.<br /><br />This was my third Dan Brown book. Each one came recommended by someone who knew of my love for reading and was just convinced that this was worth my time. Dan Brown goes after conspiricy ideas, twisted facts, and claims of just trying to get people to be more aware. Take all that away and what is left is that Dan Brown cannot write. The plots fall apart, the characters are lacking, and there is nothing to sustain the finish.<br /><br />Thanks, Dan Brown, for again making me so grateful that there are other authors to read. Because those other authors are who I am going to read from now on. Three books in a row that were just aweful was enough waste of my time.
B000000WCV|4.0|HOMEWORK was a critical darling in the late 90s and many DAFT PUNK fans will you tell it is the band's best.  Here is why DISCOVERY is better.  HOMEWORK sounds dated, like it was recorded in 1997 :)  In fact the drum machine beats in some of the tracks sound like they are out of a bad 1984 rap song.  The complex and progressive DISCOVERY, however, is still so fresh and that over 4 years later (2001) the music is consistently played in the background of Hollywood/Celeb shows on channels such as MTV and VHI. <br />I strongly urge DAFT newbies to try DISCOVERY 1st. <br /> <br />DAFT PUNK CDS (RANKED):  <br /> <br />1) DISCOVER (2001)  <br />Simply the best electronica/dance record ever released. Leaps and bounds better than HOMEWORK. <br /> <br />2) HOMEWORK (1997) <br />A strong album that propelled DAFT PUNK into the limelight with tracks such as AROUND THE WORLD and DA FUNK.  AROUND THE WORLD is the disc's best song, followed closely by INDO SILVER CLUB and ALIVE.  DA FUNK, conversely, is among the disc's worst songs primarily due to its elementary drum machine beat. <br /> <br />3) HUMAN AFTER ALL (2005)  <br />I have to say I was disappointed with this one, with PRIMETIME, MAKE LOVE, and EMOTION the only decent songs. For those looking for DISCOVERY part 2 steer clear of this album. Also the songs are VERY, VERY repetitive. One could make an argument that DISCOVERY is repetitive also, however the the songs are so phenomenal you hardly even notice.  <br />
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I loved them back during the We Have the Facts album.  They lost me a little during the Photo Album, and I completely abandoned my once favorite indie band during Transatlanticism. <br />They return to the amazing melodies and spacious sound stage they created in their second album after a huge departure from that style.  Even though they've switched labels, I feel as if they went \\"more indie\\" with this major label as a statement.  For me, they've regained legitimacy as an indie-spirited band.
B0007P3582|1.0|wat a bad album,artist,and genre.i bet this guy doesnt write his own songs.if he or any rapper does they are by far the worst song writers of all time.the whole music industry has become so unbelievably lazy,(not just mtv).back in the 80's wen mtv began,they supported bands like ac/dc,bon jovi,aerosmith,poison, and motley crue.now they support with very little if any talent like pimple can,relient gay,stinkin fark,bawl out boy. also rappers will make up things to look kool.example,in \\"a baltimore love thing\\" (wicth isnt even a love song)50 says hes \\"chilled\\" with the jimi hendrix \\"crew\\"how old is 50 23, 25?.JIMI HENDRIX DIED IN 1970.it takes no talent any more.music is now longer about quality,its about getting rich any way possible,looking good for the camera,and playing the same songs until real music fans get tired of them all.pop heads never get tiredof the same songs.dont be a robot!    P.S. I'll bet 50 ur movie sucked more than muscle beach party!!!!!!!!!!!

The book is full of so many individual pieces, and all of them are concluded throughout the book.  Nothing is left untold.  This book gave me an idea of what mafia life could actually be like, and made me think hard about what those men do daily to stay alive.  It amazes me how complicated their lives can be, and how under control they can keep them.  I think this book should be read by anyone who has even the slightest interest in mysteries, thrillers, or anything else along those lines.

B000AARKOO|4.0|\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" soars so far above our perception of an historical epic that it's not surprising it did poorly at the box office. However, it's good to see this two-disc DVD edition flying off retail and rental shelves. Muslims fighting invading Christians in the Middle East, the movie makes clearn, is not ancient history.     There's no denying that this picture is a spectacular achievement. It has only one non-fatal flaw, the casting of Orlando Bloom in the lead. Nevertheless, that does not detract from the substance of director Ridley Scott's film, a controversial follow-up to his Oscar-inning \\"Gladiator.\\"      His subject is the Christian crusades into the Holy Land (\\"God wills it!\\") It ends with the siege of Jerusalem, prompting Richard the Lionhearted to launch yet another plundering crusade. Most of the characters are based on real figures and the actors are aware of that, especially a masked Edward Norton, unbilled as Baldwin the Leper King, and Jeremy Irons as his advisor.     Only Bloom seems miscast; he isn't yet able to center a character or anchor a film, as Russell Crowe did \\"Gladiator.\\" Eva Green is fetching as the king's sister, the fictional love interest and only that. Liam Neeson, Brendon Gleeson and others lend superior support.     Scott's visuals are stunning: the windy port city of Messina, the entry into Jerusalem, and two battle sequences with sweeping views of opposing armies. Scott uses weather elements and streaming flags to enliven sequences. He actually explains how the technical defense of Jerusalem was executed. Scott is one of the few large scale directors (David Lean was another) able to make intimate moments between characters as meaningful as magnificent vistas. The extras are lackluster save for a lavish documentary that shows what an artistic and logistical accomplishment this film is, and how relevant it is today.    Addendeum: A new director's cut of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" extends the narrative by an hour, expanding upon character and incident and accomplishing the rare feat of improving the original. Whole characters and their story lines are restored, and scenes are enlarged to the scale that Scott intended.
0671027387|1.0|God... Why do authors like Dan Brown and Michael Crichton take their readers to be stupid? The plot of 'Deception Point' is outrageously unscientific - and, by the way, a real scientist would tell you that you cannot fake a meteorite the way Brown describes it. He has made the director of NASA and the President of United States seem utterly jobless (has he been hanging aroud with GW Bush lately?), and touched upon theories like panspermia with the eye of a charlatan.<br /><br />Okay, when have these page-turners had any real plots? There is always chasing, action, sex, incredible chain of events, and flaccid narration. I can excuse all of that. Now, what have I been left with? Ugh, nothing. Half-a-star - that sums it up.<br /><br />You can go and read this from any lending library. It gives the promised fun-ride. But there is nothing to cherish, to ponder and absolutely nothing to be content with.
B000022TSW|4.0|With the show's early success, a movie was quickly planned and produced before the series could go cold.  Now year later it is obvious that the rush was unnecessary and fans would like to know where the next movie is. <br /> <br />From the opening scene it is obvious that this is not quite like the show as Stan breaks out into song about the town.  Terrence and Phillip have a new movie out and the guys manage to get in around the R rating.  Suddenly they are in a different world.  As the rest of the audience is offended the foursome falls in love with the movie and everything in it.  Especially the colorful cursing. <br /> <br />As more kids see the movie and begin imitating the language, the parents of South Park rise up in revolt and begin protesting Canada, the home of Terrence and Phillip.  But as international politics heats up Kenny gets involved in a second story.  This time we see what happens when he dies.  His adventures let us see the workings of Hell where Satan enters into a relationship with Saddam Hussein.  But as different as the two stories are, they do come together is a very interesting way. <br /> <br />In the end I found myself with song lyrics stuck in my head and wanting to skip back to key scenes to watch them again.  Although lacking in the hidden truths that provide strength to the series, this is still a good movie if you are a fan.  I think that people unfamiliar with the series should not let this be their first exposure.  Once again, the series may star little kids but it is not aimed at or intended for them.  While tame compared to Team America, it is still very deserving of its rating.
0671004107|4.0|You think you have read the best of science fiction? Have you read 'Contact'? Then, you might want to think again. Sure, you'd have faithfully watched every episode of the X-files; perhaps even maintain a fan site for Mulder and Scully; watched every alien encounter movie from Strange Encounters and ET to Independence Day and War of the Worlds; you might even have SETI@home running on your system, and a record of Alien Invasion Week on your VHS. But, it takes a true scientific spirit to look at both the objective and the humanistic sides of a scientific endeavour, and Sagan shines there bright in the sky. Two thumbs up! <br /> <br />His erudition is displayed unabashedly in the quotations at the beginning of every chapter; he ceaselessly opines on worldly problems throughout the book. Unlike the balderdash that people like Dan Brown et al. write, Sagan knows what he is writing about; his scientific pursuit does not defy logic; there is every reason to believe in the possiblity that the exact sequence of events might happen; and concludes with a brilliance, that might disappoint the arch skeptics and delight the agnostics. Unlike its contemporaries, Contact maintains the same pace of movement throughout the novel, and pays attention to little details to breathe an air of scented nuance. <br /> <br />There are a few downsides to the novel - sometimes, the narrative, and the dialogue, becomes clichd. Banal details about all the scientists could have been avoided, given that we know the protagonist well. And Sagan could have handled imagery much better. But, these are trivial compared to the scale and the ambition of the novel, and its unique attempt in provoking boundary-crossing and unifying thoughts. For that, Sagan deserves  full credit. <br /> <br />A word about the movie. In my opinion, it is better to watch the movie first )given the brilliant direction by Robert Zemeckis) and then turn to the novel, as the versions are drastically different. One who watches themovie after reading the novel will certainly feel disappointed. Given a choice, I would always recommend the novel.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I finally got around to seeing this Oscar-winner from a few years back. I love Nicholson (who doesn't) and was expecting an above average movie experience. What I got was one gem of a movie.<br /><br />Even with the mis-cast Keanu, this stacked up there with my all-time favorite romantic-comedies, \\"Sabrina\\" (Bogart), \\"It Happened One Night\\", and \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\".<br /><br />The \\"cry\\" scene is one of the best movie scenes ever.
0375507256|5.0|There are two attributes to a novel that are rare.  Rarely does a novel, after completion, leaves the readers begging for more; and rarely does a novel cross all known boundaries of fiction - genre, time-frame, and voice-filled efficacious narrative. Cloud Atlas has both these attributes. Neel Mukherjee is right when he says, \\"The novel's scale, ambition and execution make almost everything in contemporary fiction look like a squalid straggle of Nissen huts compared with its vertiginous edifice...\\" <br /> <br />It is a compendium of six nested novellae, wherein the central novella in itself alone is complete, and the rest are left halfway, rendering the readers restless. Each novella takes place at a unique time frame, has its own protagonist, has a different style of narration, and endowed with a powerful muse. Trust Mitchell and read the book from cover to cover - there is a reason for adopting a nested narrative. <br /> <br />There are several recurring themes in the book - reincarnation, for instance; slavery and imprisonment, spanning the duration from the nineteenth century to the era of post-nuclear apocalypse; pacifism; and the use of the word 'cloud atlas' by the protagonists in at least three of the novellae. However, the innumberable ways in which the stories connect up are too beautiful and too complicated to mention here... You ought to discover it yourself. <br /> <br />One of the best novels I've read in a long time! Highly recommended!

0517123207|5.0|Few moments in science change humanity's perception of itself, and presents science with an impetus to guide generations ahead. Examples? Watson and Crick's description of DNA structure, Einsten's theory of Relativity, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle - to name a few from the twentieth century. However, one man's thought and scientific deduction was so revolutionary that it ought to be considered one of the most momentous event in science - the man was Darwin and event was the publication of the first edition of the book which I am reviewing.  <br /> <br />Before you go on ahead, it is my duty to tell you that I give the work 5 stars, only because I have no other alternative. The contents of the book are invaluable -  priceless gift to humanity. HOW CAN A REVOLUTION BE RATED? It is also my duty to tell you that this book is not for unscientific fundamentalists whose lives are guided by rigid walls of baseless faith, and not an inkling of true science. <br /> <br />I shall not be restating the contents of the book. Suffice it to mention that any lay person without the knowledge of current scientific advances in biology should completely agree with the deductions of Darwin. I will however, mention this. No more is evolution a 'theory'. It is a fact. For proof, the Human Genome Project has been completed, as have the genomes of several plants  and animals sequenced. Just compare them. And you'll find the truth for yourself. Here are some facts for fundamentalists to chew: a human embryo is almost identical to that of a fish; the genetic code of a bacterium is identical to that of human, and every other species on this planet; and by the way, the basic constituents of DNA of every living species on the planet is the same!!!!! So, stop advancing anti-scientific and pseudoscientific nonsense in place of evolution. That is balderdash! <br /> <br />Now, for the open-minded and/or the scientific, I have a request for you. Once you finish reading the book, sit down and think about this - in hindsight, without knowledge even of the basics of genetics and without the aid of scientific advancements we know today, a man, through sheer observation and deduction, proposed the 'theory' of evolution - which has virtually all the sciences to back it up. If that is not revolution, what is?

0385720920|3.0|'Choke' is the first and only book I've read by Palahniuk.  The concept was creative, and it held my attention throughout the book.  However, Palahniuk seemed more interested in shocking the reader with gross descriptions than actual character development.  Palahniuk only gives us hints on how and why Victor Mancini went from a bright med school student to a depraved sex maniac who earns a living off of sympathy checks from choking in restaurants.  That would've been a more fulfilling story, but he only devotes one chapter at the end of the book to it.  Choke is an interesting read, even if it is flawed.
B000000OQF|5.0|_______________________________________________________________ <br /> <br />Thank you very much for reading my post. <br /> <br />This is in my personal opinion the best hard rock album of all-time. <br />\\"Appetite For Destruction\\" came out in the late 80's and basically took the <br />world by storm. The names of gunners Slash(lead & rhythm guitars), Izzy  <br />Stradlin(rhythm & lead guitars), Duff Mckagan(bass), Steven Adler(drums),  <br />and especially Axl Rose(vocals) became household names. You know a band <br />rocks when average people know the names of the band. This record was an  <br />onslaught of old school classic rock, a ton of rhythm & blues, garage rock, glam, <br />a tiny dose of punk rock, and even a little bit of country if ya believe it or not.  <br />Rarely does one have an album that can stand the test of time. While trends come and go as <br />do musical genres it's nice to have music that never gets old and can just flat out stand the  <br />test of time. AFD is just simply a hard rock masterpiece.  <br /> <br />Let us look at the impact this record has had on the history of rock. This cd basically <br />kicked all the other bands right in their faces and showed the world how to rock hard.  <br />There is a very good reason why GNR was dubbed \\"the most dangerous band in the world\\"  <br />for the fact that they were real and not superficial like most other bands then and now. <br />With the gunners there was no bs & what you saw was what you got. Case in point was their <br />music that showcased each members individual strenghts and weaknesses as a complete hard rock <br />monstrosity. Listen to the old school classic sound despite the fact that at the time they <br />were a hair band. Hear the punk rock influences and garage rock roots. This was not your  <br />typical rock band this was a supergroup that took the best of the best from two local LA bands  <br />\\"Hollywood Rose\\" & \\"LA Guns\\" that allowed them to unleash the beast that is GNR.  <br /> <br />Before this record there was no question that as far as mainstream Hard rock was concerned there was no <br />doubt in most people's minds that Motley Crue was the best. That all changed after GNR released <br />their first and best record ever. The songs unleased propelled the band to become at  <br />the time the sort of Beatles of the modern Hard rock world. Imagine a band that almost <br />everyone liked. I still remember as a teen that the Country music people liked them, the  <br />punk rock community liked them, the top forty teeny popers liked them, and others for the fact <br />that they were so universal sounding. Hell even the Hip Hop & Rap fans liked them!  <br />And even their harshest critics then can not disagree now with the impact that GNR has had on <br />the history of Rock. Think about this can you name me one band in hard rock that has been bigger, <br />rawer, or better than Guns N' Roses? There has not been anyone since then in hard rock that has  <br />been this good. Anyone who even dares to imply Nirvana is a moron. I don't remember anyone <br />spending all their time to play the guitar like Kurt Cobain as 1,000's have to Slash.  <br /> <br />The music speaks for it's self. The best thing about this record was the ingenuity of the band  <br />that made their songs sound like two totally different songs within each one. For example listen  <br />to \\"Rocket Queen\\" as proof how the first part and second half are almost completely different <br />yet a like. Songs such as \\"Sweet Child of Mine\\" & \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" sound just as good today  <br />as they did back in the late 80's. This is the type of record that everyone that lives and dies  <br />with rock music has to have. Your collection is incomplete without it. From the opening screams  <br />of \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" to the punk rock outro in \\"Paradise City\\" and to the guitar onslaught  <br />of \\"Sweet Child of Mine\\" one can not deny the power and fury of AFD. Thesongwriting, the  <br />musicianship, the raw production, & ingenuity are all here. There are no songs that you  <br />need to skip or fast forward like on most cds this is the type of record you have to hear from  <br />start to finish over and over. <br /> <br />My advice to you is if you don't already own this cd then please\\" <br /> <br />GO BUY, BEG, BORROW, OR STEAL THIS ALBUM NOW! <br /> <br />Cheers! <br /> <br />COKE08  <br /> <br />_____________________________________________________________
B000002UJQ|5.0|In terms of songcraft, vision, innovation, and relevance, OK Computer is one of the greatest album in the rock canon.  It's right up there with Revolver, Dark Side of the Moon and London Calling.  OK Computer is an epic critique of our modern way of life.  Each song illustrates the dehumanizing effects of corporations, politics, machines, and consumerism.  Along with Kid A, this album provides the soundtrack to a world spinning out of control.  Not since Pink Floyd has a band been able to do this so brilliantly, and OK Computer is better than anything Floyd has ever done.  The song that exemplifies the brilliance of this album the most is \\"Let Down,\\" with numbing lyrics set to a gorgeous melody.  Deceptive, cunning and effective.  This album's legend has only grown over the years, and will continue to build a reputation for being one of rock's greatest.

B0006L16N8|2.0|There's nothing worse than when a band believes its own hype.  It seems as if on X&Y, Chris Martin is striving to be bigger than Bono.  But where Bono's strength lies is in earnest righteousness and soaring, bombastic melodies, Martin's lies in subtle, beautiful melodies. <br /> <br />X&Y sees Martin abandoning the very things that made Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head such beautiful albums.  Lyrics are simplified to the point of silly, pop cliches on 'Fix You' and 'What if?'  The same happens on 'Swallowed in the Sea,' which is a shame because it's a great melody.  Too many of the songs add too many layers of sound to the point of sounding cheesy.  A notable exception is 'Square One,' which is a fantastic opener.  'Speed of Sound' sounds like an emasculated Clocks.  'Twisted Logic' sees Coldplay eschewing the corny love and help themes for politics, and it pretty much works (although not on the same level as U2 or Radiohead). <br /> <br />By far the best song on the album is the bonus track, + (Till Kingdom Come).  Here, Coldplay keeps it simple and throws out the overproduced sounds and lowest common denominator lyrics to create a stunning, quiet, acoustic song that reminds listeners of the best moments on Parachutes and Rush.  Too bad you have to listen to the whole album before hearing Coldplay return to form.

B0007OCG4W|2.0|There's already been enough reviews so I'll keep it short. This movie just tries to use sexual inuendo and images to makeup for the poor storyline. It is not deserving of any awards. Julia Roberts is blah in this. Natalie Portman is good and Jude Law is good but the movie itself is disappointing and just goes round and round and ends up rehashing itself. The biggest problem I had was it showed peoples emotions changing with the wind without any real reason.
B00079HZUM|5.0|Whether you're a Shakespeare buff, or a fan of the theatre in any period, you can't afford to miss this one!  Comparisons to Shakespeare in Love are inevitable, down to the framework of a Shakespearian play-within-a-play, and the central role of an appealing blonde actress struggling against societal mores to claim her dream of taking the stage.  I am not in accord with those reviewers who regard Stage Beauty as Shakespeare in Love-lite, however.  It's `compleatly' the other way around  . . .with its darker tone & far more complex screenplay, Stage Beauty tackles ground which the earlier film dreamt not of.  Whereas Shakespeare in Love was rather like a jolly Disney ride through Shakespearian London, Stage Beauty reflects a much grittier, often unflinching, portrait of what life was like in the thespian milieu, circa 1660. <br /> <br />`Stage Beauty is set some 60-odd years after the action of Shakespeare in Love-the Bard, long gone, is a voice in the film only through his play  Othello.   Billy  Crudup (in a tour-de-force performance) is Edward `Ned' Kynaston, the reigning `leading lady' of the London stage.  Bringing the house down night after night as Desdemona, Ned revels in his life as the top celebrity diva in town.  He is attended by his faithful dresser, Maria (Claire Danes), who longs to act herself, and has memorized his performance as she watches every night from the wings.  Ned and Maria have a complicated relationship; he treats her like a servant, yet seems to have more tender feelings for her as well, feelings which she secretly shares.  Further complicating matters is Ned's homosexual relationship with the Duke of Buckingham (Ben Chaplin).   Even though Ned has sex with men, and has been trained from boyhood to project a feminine demeanor, he can't live his life offstage as a woman.  And even though a `manly' mode of being feels unnatural, his underlying masculinity is always showing through his mask of painstakingly cultivated femininity.  The world`pansexual' could have been coined for him.  One of the strengths of the film is how it captures the fluidity of sexuality prevalent at the time . . .Ned is a man who plays women, yet women respond to the person under the costume.  Ned sleeps with a man who rejects him for a `real' woman, and yet at the same time, Ned finds himself attracted to his female dresser.  At this time, dressing in drag was thought to be the height of hilarity, and even the King could wear a dress to the vast entertainment of his guests.  In this overheated atmosphere of sexual confusion, and blurring of gender identity labels, this time seems not a great deal different than our own. <br /> <br />Ned tumbles from the pinnacle of success to the dregs of society almost overnight as a number of misfortunes pile up at once:  Maria's performance as the first female Desdemona in an underground theatre production catches the attention of the Court, leading the King to grant permission for women to perform on stage.  When Ned inadvertently insults the King's mistress, this leniency hardens into a ban against male actors playing any women's parts.  Suddenly unemployable in the only field he knows, Ned is severely beaten by thugs hired by Maria's patron, and starts to slip into alcoholism.  Rejected by the stage for not being a `real' woman, he is rejected by his noble lover for the same crime.   When he has reached bottom, redemption comes from an unexpected quarter-an opportunity to return to the stage in Othello, this time playing the man's part . . . opposite the woman who stole his livelihood, and in his eyes, his very life.  Once again the lines between stage and reality blur, as the Moor and Ned have both been wounded deeply by women they love, and both have `cause' for revenge.  The scene where Maria & Ned are reunited on stage is as breathlessly compelling for us as it must have been for the first audiences witnessing naturalistic performances on the stage. <br /> <br />I really can't raveabout this film enough.  Billy Crudup carries the film in a multifaceted and grueling part.  He does make a pretty girl, too, though I prefer him as a guy.  Claire Danes hits the right note as Maria . . .low-key and in the background when that is called for, and then radiant or petulant by turns when that is called for.  She does not swan about self-assuredly like the lady of noble birth slumming on the boards like Gwneth Paltrow's Lady Viola in Shakespeare in Love; Maria is a commoner, someone who has had to survive a hardscrabble existence by hard work, her wits and by her loyalty to her employer.  When she betrays that loyalty and sets the events of the movie in motion, it is for her deeply-felt conviction that acting is more than a lark or a hobby, it is something she must do, even if she does it badly.   An all-star cast lends support, including Hugh Bonneville as an endearingly befuddled Samuel Pepys, perpetual diarist (One of my favorite lines is when Ben Chaplin as the Duke of Buckingham tells Ned: `If two mice were in a nutshell screwing, Pepys would find a way to squeeze in and write it down'), and Rupert Everett, in a wry, campy performance as Charles II, looking rather like he wandered over from the Three Musketeers set, but having a wonderful time.  Tom Wilkinson plays Mr. Betterton, the owner of Ned's theatre and his co-star, an enthusiastically bad Othello.  Also deserving mention is newcomer Zoe Tropper, who is a delightfully bawdy and pulchritudinous Nell Gwynn.  Asked about her parentage, Nell responds, cheerfully, \\"Me mum was a whore; me dad was in the Navy . . .that's why I don't do sailors!\\" <br /> <br />If  watching Stage Beauty isn't as addictive as chocolate (I watched it twice in two days), and if it doesn't make you want to go out immediately and get your local library's copy of Othello so you can revisit Desdemona's death scene, then tack a mustache on me and call me a boy! <br />
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer has a really nice voice and you can see that in his music. I mean in his 4th track \\"Your body is a wonderland\\", he really uses the extent of his vocals quite well in trying to persuade you that his body is a wonderland...Anyways.. the album starts off quite strong with songs such as No such thing and neon but it falls a little short towards the end > exceptions being love song for no one and back to you < But although it was not entirely perfect, the album is still quite strong and is rather worthy of being heard!!

B00000J7JO|4.0|There's not too much to not like about this album. I can't really compare this with their other work, seeing as how I don't at the moment own any other RHCP albums, but I can say that this is one of my favorite records of 1999 (There is Nothing Left to Lose, Astrolounge, among others), and that there is not too many things more satisfying than driving down the highway, blasting the beginning of \\"Around the World.\\" Always gets me in a good mood. <br /> <br />Other tracks that have made little nooks for themselves in my musical cavern are \\"Parallel Universe,\\" \\"Scar Tissue\\" (my favorite on the album), \\"Easily,\\" and the schitzophrenic \\"Get on Top.\\" Several other tracks are just a cut below, but then there are a few songs that really didn't need to be put on the album in the first place (I'm not naming names, you can spot them pretty easily with a quick listen). I wouldn't mind paying for less songs of higher quality than the same for more songs with some mindless filler that breaks the flow of the album. But that's the end of my complaints. <br /> <br />Is this album unbelievable? No. Is it great? Yes. Is it worth buying? Absolutely.

B00020HEG6|5.0|Of the three films released to date about J.K. Rowling's fictional young wizard named Harry Potter, the soundtrack for the third film, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" (2004), is probably the best. Composed again by veteran Hollywood composer John Williams, the music written for this film took upon darker undertones than the previous two films, but also some of most beautiful & emotional music as well. <br /> <br />The film opens at the Dursley's home on Privet Drive with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) reading with his wand as a light beneath the sheets to the delightful music of \\"Lumos! (Hedwig's Theme)\\".  This is followed by the next day when Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) tells Harry that he must be on his behavior while Vernon's unpleasant sister Marge (Pam Ferris) visits.  Her tune, entitled \\"Marge's Theme\\", fits her perfectly.  Unfortunately, Aunt Marge upsets Harry who accidentally uses magic to make her inflate like a balloon.  While she floats outside with Uncle Vernon trying to keep her close to the ground, Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) is visibly upset while Harry's cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) continues to eat and watch TV. Harry grabs his trunk, Hedwig and the rest of belongings and flees from the house and into the night.  When a dark creature looms in the nearby woods, Harry raises his wand and inadvertently attracts the nightbus, which has its own music appropriately titled as \\"The Nightbus\\".  This, however, proves advantageous for Harry as he climbs on board and is taken to the Leaky Cauldron upon his request.  At the Leaky Cauldron, Harry is met by the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy).  Harry believes he will be severely punished for what happened to his Aunt Marge, but the Minister assures Harry that he won't be as there is something more important that he must be protected from: the escape from Azkaban Prison of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who is believed to be in league with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (Voldemort).  WithJohn Williams' marvelous music, Harry's third year at Hogwarts is going to be very challenging, especially with dementors and Sirius Black on the loose and it begins on the Hogwarts Express when the dementors show up to look for him to the eerie music entitled \\"Apparition on the Train\\".  Upon arriving at Hogwarts, a choir assembled in the Great Hall sing the eerily beautiful tune called \\"Double Trouble\\" to music created by instruments from the Middle Ages, including a harpsichord. (A harpsichord is also used in other arrangements.)  This is followed later when Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) take their first magical creatures class with Hagrid to the extraordinarily beautiful tune entitled \\"Buckbeak's Flight\\".  Other wonderful music from this film include \\"Monster Books and Boggarts!\\", \\"Quidditch, Third Year\\", \\"The Patronus Light\\", \\"The Dementors Converge\\", \\"Finale\\" and \\"Mischief Managed!\\". <br /> <br />Like the first Harry Potter film from 2001, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", John Williams received an Oscar nomination for his phenomenal musical compositions in \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\".  Overall, I rate the magnificent & enchanting soundtrack for the 2004 film of \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it. I also highly recommend the soundtracks for the 2001 \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" and the 2002 \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\". I can't wait to hear what composer John Williams has written for the upcoming release of the 2005 film \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\".
B000002OZY|5.0|First Id like to clarify some issues in the reviews below me. While it is true that S.F. Sorrow was released before Tommy,it is not true that The Pretty Things made up the idea of a Rock Opera. Look up A Quick One While Hes Away, which is really the first attempt at a rock opera; which was also written by Townshend. This came out in 1966, so a full two years before SF Sorrow. In essence, The Pretty Things took the idea from Townshend. Townshend also composed another rock opera a year after A Quick One,entitled Rael. So, Townshend had written two before Tommy and SF Sorrow. Granted these were only songs and not a complete album, and Tommy is some what in resemblance to SF Sorrow, the idea of a rock opera is purely Townshends. <br /> <br />On to the album-It is truly a lyrical masterpiece. It tells the complete story of a traumatized child who becomes deaf, mute, and blind. He is saved through pinball and earns a group of followers, who later rebel againt him. One of the best things about this album is that it was not entirely composed by a single author, making some of the songs slightly different than the others. Most notably are the songs Cousin Kevin and Fiddle About, both written by bassman John Entwistle. I had heard that Townshend simply could not compose these pieces because of similar troubles he'd had in his childhood. These songs are probably the most powerful songs on the album, simply because of their horrid content. Of course there are the timeless classics Pinball Wizard and See Me, Feel Me; along with some other great compositions such as Overture. The only downside to the album is that some of the songs, like Its A Boy, seem to be there as simply fillers and have no effect on the story. All in all, however, a classic album deserves a 5/5 rating. The compsotional value of this album should be regarded as one of the best and never forgotten.
B0006FO8RA|1.0|At least she is cute... so if you wasted your money on the album... you can at least see a pretty girl on the cover.  Not a total loss.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|I'll be brief and blunt. The new EC disc is slick, clean and rather pedestrian. I have been a loyal follower and fan of EC since first hearing Cream on L.A.'s first free-form FM radio station in the mid-late 60s. I believe he has always been, and is now, a stellar artist. So, it's not without some perspective that I opine on this recent effort. The references to family are great in a scrapbook or photo album. On a record album? I think no. After realizing that what I heard in one of the cuts was a baby crying back in the mix, I really had a hard time going through the remaining material. It's a little too sappy. It's wonderful he is happy and I suppose for some (many?) it's pleasing to hear that happiness echoed in his music. I'll lay out on this one and hope the next time he gets a bit grittier. (No, I don't believe his material has to be dark or that he has to maintain the \\"tormented artist\\" persona but this is a bit too far up on the happy-meter).
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Since I havent bought any of the seasons on DVD, YET. I am soo glad that this set is out! I am definantely buying it from Amazon.com because of the HUGE price Cut. I would say this is not a must-have for people who have already started collecting the DVD's seperately for every season. But for everyone who has not started collecting, this is a Must-have!
B000BEZPQE|1.0|...Comes out with one of the worst live albums of all time. Go pick up the new Old Man's Child instead, not this poor excuse for metal. This is just as bad as Simple Plan.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|At first I HATED this CD, but now it's my favourite. You need to let it grow. The melodies are beautiful, the lyrics are well written and James' voice is unmistakeable.  <br /> <br />If you give it a listen a few times you will not skip a single track! <br /> <br />1. Waking up with someone and grasping the moment, telling the other person you want the moment to last forever and grow old with him/her. Catchy ballad. 4/5 <br /> <br />2. Meeting someone and never seeing that person again and the pain knowing you never will. Strongest track. 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Catchy mid-tempo song about three wise men trying to have some fun, but ended up alone. I love the chorus. 5/5 <br /> <br />4. About after you have broken up and you think about the fact that you know everything there is to know about that person and how addiced you were. The lyrics are present and it's incredible how the words all fit nicely on the paper. Ballad. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />5. This is a weird song, but has nice words and nice melody. Slow song. 3/5 <br /> <br />6. Being out of your mind and being judged. Mid-tempo. 3/5 <br /> <br />7. Trip down memory lane. It seems like Jimmy is a friend who has passed away. It's a mid-tempo sad song and very catchy. 5/5 <br /> <br />8. My favourite song. About Billy, the cheater, but it's deep and powerful. Another catchy, mid-tempo track. 5/5 <br /> <br />9. \\"Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder, I'm a friend.\\" pretty much sums it up. Slow song. Not so catchy, but it will grow and you won't skip it. 3/5 <br /> <br />10. About tragedy in the world. Slow song. Weakest track on CD, but still good. 3/5
B000068IEU|3.0|Yes,it's dated and I actually haven't seen it in a while.  <br />But let me just say this is a sickening movie. Yes, I  <br />understand that it probably isn't these days because  <br />these sickening things you see and hear about everyday.  <br />We live in a culture were things like this simply don't  <br />seem like a big deal anymore. People just shut off the TV's  <br />and forget about it. <br /> <br />I first seen this film as a youngster in the middle 80's and <br />it was rather gruesome. The rape and the revenge are equally <br />repugnant, and it's almost like Wes Craven is seeing into the <br />future of what america would be like, and it's basically what <br />it has become now so people aren't so effected. America really <br />doesn't have any innocence left, so I guess it isn't surprising. <br /> <br />I don't think this movie is worth buying, but if you see it for <br />rent then it will be worth checking out.  <br /> <br /> <br />

B00006LPER|2.0|I adored this movie in that it dispelled the simulacra of gracious living with classical music.  I hated this movie in the shallow way it demonized bdsm culture, much as Irreversible demonized gay men.<br /><br />I was suprised that a young carefree boy in love would suddenly turn judgemental when the object of his affections, his teacher no less, provided instructions for him to please her.  I had difficulty making that leap.  I was not surprised that a pianist, being a tactile creature, would chose manual engagement for arousal.<br /><br />I thought the scene where Huppert pulled that little box of personal delights from beneath her bed had the greatest amount of compassion and empathy in the film.  It was heartbreaking to see how small her world truly was.
B00005JMCW|5.0|A lot of teenage girls will be able to relate to Annabel in this entertaining comedy! Anna is convinced her mother is trying to ruin her life and all Ana wants to do is have fun. After a huge fuss one night at a restaurant with arguing, the next morning they find out they have switched bodies. <br /> <br />This movie has a lot of potential. It's well directed. You'll go, 'Oh, but that's really how it is!' when Anna tries to beat up her brother every time he annoys her. It is probably best for teenagers, but everyone will like this one. <br /> <br />Listen up for the great soundtrack as well and the handsome Chad Michael Murray! Definitely worth your time and money! <br /> <br />It has many great scenes and I could recommend it to anyone!  <br />
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Titanic is a great movie... and I think Amazon should import the 4 DVD edition for American People.  <br /> <br />Remember, if Amazon could do it, the DVDs are Region 4.

B000AJJNOK|4.0|Anyone who reviewed this album after one listen does not have a real credible opinion on it. With 50, most of us expect commercially successfull beats and lyrics, but on \\"The Massacre\\", 50 delivers a grittier, harder album than \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin.\\" The best song on the album, hands-down, is \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\" as it is reminiscent of his career-best \\"Many Men.\\" The other most notable song is \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\", which one can argue is his best lyrical work, certainly most creative. Other top-notch cuts are \\"Get in My Car\\", \\"Position of Power\\", \\"When the Gunz Come Out\\", \\"Outta Control\\" and \\"God Gave Me Style\\". Let this cd ride once and it's tracks will grow on you. Unfortunetly, with the success of the two albums plus the drama involving his name, 50 may never come out with an album matching \\"The Massacre\\", let alone \\"Get Rich\\". Any album cover with his name on it will sell him at least 3 million.
0385338686|5.0|Samantha Sweeting, 29-year old law prodigy, is about to realize the dream of her lifetime, which is being named a partner at the prestigious London law firm of Carter Spinks.  However, on the morning of the partner meeting to confirm her partnership, Samantha discovers she's made a gigantic mistake on one of her cases which will cost the firm 50 million pounds.  In a blind panic, Samantha flees her office and boards a train bound for an unknown destination.<br /><br />  Her destination turn out to be an idyllic village in the Cotswalds, called Lower Ebury.  Once there, she literally stumbles into a mansion, where she is mistaken for an applicant for the open position of housekeeper.  Wanting to spend the night at the home, Samantha pretends to be a housekeeper and finds herself with a new job!  Being a perfectionist, Samantha can't admit to her new employers that she know nothing about housekeeping beyong making a piece of toast, so she learns the ropes of cooking and cleaning.  Of course, she quickly meets the handsome gardener and has her first real love affair in a long time.  Although the romance was a bitt too predictable, the predictability didn't detract from the enjoyment of this novel one bit!  Samantha's trials in learning the domestic arts are simply hilarious.  Underneath the humorous episodes, there is a serious undercurrant asking whether working 60 hours a week at a stressful job can really make a person happy.<br /><br />  I found the character of Samantha Sweeting to be much more beleivable than the Shopaholic. For a hilarious romp through an English manor as well as the legal hall of London, don't miss this story!
B00005JNJV|4.0|I have been a fan of Batman for years. I really enjoyed the Dark Knight resurrection of the 80s, which has been the focus of the entire Batman franchise. On the whole, I have enjoyed most of the films. <br /> <br />This Batman is dark, but without the Tim Burton touch of hyper reality (or unreality, if you would prefer that term). He is also cool and calculating, taking time to study the criminal element, even to the point of getting arrested to learn more. Very driven to change the world in his quest for catharcism for his parent's death. <br /> <br />Early on in the film, Bruce Wayne is given the opportunity to hone his skills fighting evil by the mysterious Henri Ducard. Henri tells him he can find what he is searching for if he will just come and learn to fight evil under the tutelidge of a grand master. <br /> <br />As you have seen in the previews, he does this. In the process, he learns a lot about his own fears and learns the limits of his own anger over his past.  <br /> <br />In a pivotal moment, Bruce returns to Gotham City and through exploration of his own psyche becomes the Batman.  <br /> <br />What is good about the film: <br />* Very good back story that adds a lot of depth to Bruce Wayne's character <br />* Nice effects kept realistic. While there are some fantasy eleemnts, the story is kept in the realm of believable. <br />* Realistic presentation of a human superhero. <br />* Fight choreography. This Batman uses distraction rather than simply relying on gimmickry. <br />* Villians have depth. Nothing one dimensional like Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br />What is not so good <br />* There are a couple of moments where the veil is lifted due to bad acting, primarily when Christian Bale attempts to be \\"too Batman\\" (low, raspy voice) - the plane scene comes to mind <br />* Katie Holmes -something about her character just annoys me; almost too pure for the film. I guess every film needs a goody two-shoes, but I found Jim Gordon far more realistic. <br /> <br/>If you are purchasing, get the two disc set, as the single disk has no special features (unless you consider the theatrical trailer special).
B000A6CLL0|5.0|The 3rd season, which at this point is now known as \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\" and also the remix of \\"Where my heart will take me\\" from a Gospel like song to a more upbeat rock version of the show. But anyway, I think the best episodes on this sete were, The Xindi \\"because they were the ones that started it with the attack on earth\\", another episode would be \\"North Star\\", in which an old western \\"Skag\\" Outsider was hung just because he was a skag. The other episode that caught my eye was called \\"e2\\" in which 150 yrs back, the same Enterprise crew was founded by the same crew as the current Enterprise! But all in all, season 3 is one of my favorite episodes in which will lead towards the season 4 multi-story-arc finale.
B00097DXZS|5.0|Santana's new album \\"All That I Am\\" is similar in concept to his last two, \\"Supernatural\\" and \\"Shaman\\" - the difference is that the ante is upped a bit this time with the collaborators.  On the hip hop-flavored \\"My Man,\\" Santana works not only with Outkast's Big Boi (who wrote the music, produced the track and rhymes on it as well) and Mary J. Blige (who sings the nice-to-hear-for-a-change \\"not all men are bad news\\" lyric)  but also with Rob Thomas (who wrote the lyrics for Mary).  On \\"Trinity,\\" a three way guitar shoot out between Carlos, pedal steel wiz Robert Randolph and Metallica's Kirk Hammett, the song arrives courtesy of the late Sufi master Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.  And on \\"Just Feel Better,\\" Santana collaborates with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler where the lyric - which talks about fighting inner demons to emerge stronger on the other side - takes on a life of its own in the context of what these two guys have dealt with in terms of addiction and rags-to-riches-to-rags.   There's also a three way collaboration (\\"Cry Baby Cry\\") between the Jamaican dance hall star Sean Paul and Brit Soulstress Joss Stone that recalls Sting's \\"Fragile\\" as a lovelorn ballad.  Throughout, Carlos Santana's guitar has a vibrancy that was oft times missing from his last effort.  And on solo band cuts like \\"Hermes\\" and \\"El Fuego,\\" where Carlos takes center stage, his guitar shoots fire.  It seems that all of the high profile pairings have inspired him on his own cuts as well.  All in all, an extremely solid return to form for Senor Santana.
B0007TKH66|5.0|You know, I really liked the fact that each Star Trek series had to bite the dust after season 4, but the early Enterprise years were at some of it's best. The Temporal Cold wars and the Fantastic Broken Bow Pilot episode. The Season finale Shockwave is the best I've seen Yet! And don't let those belitting negative comments get to you to not buy the DVD set because I think Enterprise had alot of potential. But lets just say that it was a great show that got robbed of a long 7 season or 8 season run as with the other Star Trek predecessors.
0783225849|5.0|Having finally seen Psycho, after hearing this movie for years, knowing the music, and seeing parts of the famous shower scene and hearing all about the Bates Motel, all I can say is WOW.<br /><br />This is a great piece of filmmaking and is probably Hitchcock's peak film.  It took all the other great Hitchcock films for Psycho to add up to one hell of a picture.  It is instinctively different than any other Hitchcock film I have seen.<br /><br />The black and white gives it that noirish feeling ala The Wrong Man.  However, this isn't your father's  North by Northwest which Hitchcock made the previous year!!  Anthony Perkins is one great actor in this move.  He is creepy and yet boyishly beguiling as Norman Bates.  Janet Leigh as Marion Crane is great as well.<br /><br />As a Hitchcock fan and having never seen this movie is that after 40 plus years, this film is timeless and wonderful in the sense of horror.  Sure, this is not a kids' movie, but an entertaining and creepy flick sure to build to a climax of horror.<br /><br />Surely, one of the best films I have ever seen in terms of the stunning originality of this film.<br /><br />\\"Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?\\" :)
0060506989|5.0|This book, besides moving me deeply, made me realize that my (and probably many other people's) view of war is very unrealistic. I rarely think of it in terms of the possibility of running out of food, water, or ammunition. I don't think about the possibility of not being able to dig a foxhole for protection. I don't think about your gun jamming and needing to be cleared and especially not about having it shot out of your hands and being so shot up that it is unusable. This book tells about each of those situations more than once. <br />Beyond that, this book gave me a better picture about what Vietnam was really like. More specifically, many decisions that turned out to be \\"wrong\\" decisions, as well as many good decisions that helped improve the situations for troops that had been sent into tight spots. <br />I have also seen the movie and, while a movie can show things that books can't, the opposite is the same. I am glad that I have both \\"seen\\" and read about this battle. I have to say that the book is better though. It tells not only about Landing Zone X-Ray like the movie, but also about Landing Zone Albany a few days later. Also, the movie doesn't show such things as American soldiers watching enemy soldiers walking around in the open, shooting wounded Americans, and being able to do nothing about it. <br /> <br />Overall, this was a very pointed and emotional book book for me, and I highly recommend it. I cannot stress how important a book this is to read. I would also recommend the movie, \\"We Were Soldiers\\". <br />If you want to read other good books about survival against a determined enemy, I would recommend \\"Out of the Depths; The Sinking of the 'USS Indianapolis'\\" and \\"Left to Die; The Sinking of the 'USS Juneau'\\". These are stories of sailors fighting against the enemies of nature and those armed with teeth, not guns. Read and enjoy.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Why, for the most part, do the rookie music reviewers on Amazon come off sounding like angry, bitter, frustrated musicians or rock critics without spellcheck if they don't like an album or artist? It's one thing to intelligently review an album, but it's another to resort to putting cruel words and gratuitous foul language in a public forum, usually behind some \\"cute\\" made-up name. <br />In the specific case of Franz Ferdinand, if you (whomever you are) don't like a little bit of progressive pop-rock from the UK, then you have no sense of the history of this genre of music. There's no way you can properly judge this album or band without a solid foot in the 1960s era of The Kinks, The Beatles, The Who, The Moody Blues, Cream, The Yardbirds, Traffic, etc. Know \\"the family tree\\" before you attempt to cut it down.
B00000J7SS|4.0|In 1970, when this album was released, it would have been almost impossible to find a positive review of this album. As of 2010, it is almost impossible to find a negative review of it. So changes critical taste. Since the heady days of jazz fusion have passed on, the value of Miles Davis's electric music has become much more appreciated. Further, the fact that this album went platinum within months of its release shows that it struck a chord with the general public regardless of critical opinion.    At the time, people accused Miles Davis of pandering to the pop crowd by compromising his music. Miles Davis almost never talked about his music directly, encouraging myths to spread.   Over the decades, especially with the availability of studio sessions and live concerts from the period, a more accurate picture has emerged of a slow evolution from the incredible postbop sound of the Second Great Quintet (1964 - 1968) through the bizarre combination of free jazz and electric instruments of the Lost Quintet (1969-1970) and finally to the funky style that evolved down to 1975. Throughout that period, Miles can be heard to be exploring bit by bit. Rather than chucking over the postbop style and \\"cruising\\" by simplifying his music, Miles was in fact incrementally experimenting with different innovations over time, cautiously adopting some (like the ostinato bassline and the use of electric instruments) and rejecting others (like the boogaloo influenced material on \\"Water Babies\\" and the blatant rock rhythms of Jack Johnson).    Towards the beginning of this evolution, Miles recorded Bitches Brew. In effect, Bitches Brew is two albums, the first resembling his previous album In A Silent Way (by consisting of two extremely long meandering tracks made from jam sessions recut) and the second consisting of a reproduction of a live set by the Lost Quintet (this interesting factor is not clear unless you are familiar with recordings by the Lost Quintet).    In this review, Iwill only talk about one track, Pharaoh's Dance.    Pharaoh's Dance is a tune by Joe Zawinul. In A Silent Way was another Zawinul compsition that started out being much more simple and filled with chord changes. Miles Davis sliced away the chord changes and made the tune much more mysterious and questing in sound.     Likewise with Pharaoh's Dance, but to an even more extreme degree. The main tune and groove actually occurs first only at 16:40 (listen to it and see; the tune occurs particularly clearly at 19:08). It's a mysterious melody, but it's coherent and layered over a funky beat and bassline. Like \\"Shh Peaceful\\", Miles does not begin the tune with this \\"head\\". Rather, the tape editing is handled in such a way that the tune grows gradually and ambiguously throughout the track. The first thing you hear is a drum groove similar to \\"Shh Peaceful\\", with Benny Maupin's mysterious bass clarinet placing washes of sound over it.     Miles's first entrance at 2:34 is not the main melody, but part of an improvisation, soft and harmonically ambiguous. His improvisation is fascinating and sophisticated, with many phrases that play around with the beat in an interesting way; listen to the way he \\"disobeys\\" the direction of the rhythm around 4:15, which is reminiscent of his interesting Second Quintet music. Benny Maupin's solo is less rhythmic, but has a mysterious feel. Around 8:40, Miles starts on a second solo filled with emotion. I particularly like the repeated \\"questioning\\" sounds from about 10:07, resulting in rising tension, followed by the \\"answers\\" from around 10:21 and a concluding phrase at 10:34 - a wonderful example of how to make a structured solo that makes emotional sense in the absence of chord changes.    Solos by Wayne Shorter and John McLaughlin follow, the latter being particularly interesting to me. After a brief solo by Chick Corea, the actual start of the session begins at 15:19, with, as I mentioned, the actual \\"head\\" of the tune first occurring at about 16:40.    This album may justifiably be accused of being confusing and difficult to get into. I didn't like Pharaoh's Dance myself when I first heard it. However, I hope this review provides some guidance to help newcomers get into this wonderful music.    I must emphasise, too, the importance of getting a good recording of this album. Pharaoh's Dance sounds particularly muddy on the inferior US CD version of this album. If you're lucky enough to find the original vinyl get that; or if not then the superior Japanese CD from 1997.
0753506483|5.0|It was a great inspiration to me as an entrepneur, abeit not so successful.  Nevetheless, I enjoyed it so much I have suggested to  many friends and employees that they read this one!

B000AMWIVM|5.0|I was impressed with the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre back in 2003... <br />That's about it.  It just seems that no matter how hard they try, movie execs can't seem to release a decent horror film, something gritty and disturbing and downright horrifying.  They just can't do it.   <br />And then there was Saw. <br />This movie is amazing in the fact that it breaks down to a simple formula of twists and thrills, bypasses the special effects and CGI crap that pollutes too many scary movies these days and focuses on something that could take place, something that could really happen versus the faux thrills expidited by cheap ghost storys and sci-fi.  This is the type of movie that will leave you disturbed long after you watch it.  You'll think about it a week, two weeks, a month later while you lay awake and wonder if there really is a man that sick and twisted... <br />Yes... <br />He is out there... <br />So by now EVERYONE knows the premise.  Two men wake up in a nasty restroom chained to oposite ends and theres a dead man in the center of the room.  They both have choices to make, clues to unravel in order to make it out alive.   <br />That's all I'm going to tell you... <br />Trust me, if you haven't seen Saw by now you need to watch this movie.  It is truly an origional film with genuine scares and real backbone.  Not for the faint of heart, but for the horror fan in us all, the fan whos getting increasingly preturbed with the lack of scares and the redundancy in recent horror instalments...this is for you my friends... <br />Relish in it. <br />It won't come again. <br />Not for a long time... <br />(Actually, Saw II is even better...but I didn't see that coming!)
B000002I27|5.0|This is The Doors second album (the follow up to the album that produced the hits \\"Light My Fire\\" & \\"Break on Through\\") and though at least one reviewer on this site has said this is the essential Doors album, I disagree. It's a marvelous album, one of the best in fact...But it's not THE BEST. The album produced a number of popular Doors songs (my favorite being \\"When the Music's Over) and some underrated classics (My Eyes Have Seen You), and while I think any Doors fan should have this CD in their collection...By it after the first album. Here's the tracks: <br />1. Strange Days-5/5-Great song. The lyrics, beat, and Morrison's voice are infectious. <br />2. You're Lost Little Girl-4/5-OK song. Not the greatest. <br />3. Love Me Two Times-5/5-Written by Robbie Krieger, probably one of the best Doors songs. <br />4. Unhappy Girl-4/5-Pretty cool. Simalar to track 2. <br />5. Horse Latitudes-5/5-Just Morrison speaking (a poem?) into the mic. Pretty cool though. <br />6. Moonlight Drive-5/5-The first verse is reportedly the verse that inspired Morrison and Manzarek to form The Doors. The lyrics to this song are amazing. <br />7. People Are Strange-5/5-\\"Women seem wicked, when you're unwanted.\\" Very true. <br />8. My Eyes Have Seen You-5/5-This song is f**king great.  <br />9. I Can't See Your Face in My Mind-3/5-This is the worst song on the album; it's not horrible. It's just not my favorite. <br />10. When the Music's Over-5/5-One of my favorite Doors songs. Spectacular. <br />A-
0743527305|5.0|As Peck says at the end of the book \\"If you have gotten this far, you probably don't need therapy\\".  If one has the discipline and the intellectual openess for the latter challenging parts of the book, he is probably right. RLT is a challenge. And one of immense rewards only if completed. Many books contain excellent explainations and models of what it really means, and takes, in order to love another.  This is one of the best. My generation of \\"boomers\\", amongst the most frequent readers of the book, tended to focus on the early sections, which explain so well how and why one's parents probably  failed in so many aspects of parenthood.  Some continued on to the descion rules and discipline required in a healthy relationship. Few finished the challenging latter third, or applied the concepts of the second third, due to the work involved.  Of the millions of copies sold, perhaps a quarter have been read completely, and fewer than that fully comprehended. I can hear in a conversation about Road Less Traveled whether a person actually completed reading and understanding the book.   In context of it's original 1979 publication date, the latter half could even seem mystical, spacey.  However, if one has read much Wayne Dyer, Chopra, perhaps Pantagali, other modern spiritually enlightening books, and even parts of Asimov's \\"Understanding Physics\\", then the more complex concepts in the latter third are seen in a supporting context. What seemed far fetched (the latter parts of \\"RLT\\") 20 years ago, then falls together as perfectly matching pieces of the puzzle that Dyer, Chopra, and others have so eloquently put into 21st century context. If I was forced to own only five books to guide my life, as opposed to entertain me, they would include something by Dyer, Chopra, a couple of others, and Road Less Travelled.  Those I know personally who read the easy first half and then drifted off are still going back to therapy. It took three readings for me to both fully grasp it's complexity and be able to apply the concepts to my life, and will probably require re-reading every three years.  One note: The psychiatry described holds up only part of the time.  Due to quantum leaps in brain-scanning technology since RLT's publication, what the scientific community thought we knew about the brain, various disorders, and therefore psychiatric and pschological dogma are being constantly redefined.   But certain aspects of the psychiatric/psychological explanations remain valid, they just require a critical eye, and a broader knowledge base to know which to take as insights, and which to understand as obsolete.
B000089RV6|5.0|Come on now, how can you not like at least something on this album. AC/DC is the all time greatest rock band. They never suck, they always rock. WHY? Cuz, they got the formula, it will never fail. No matter how crappy the vocals sound, no matter how bad the production is, its still gonna ROCK!<br /><br />And trust me, the world NEEDS this stuff. The stick is so far up everyones ass lately, its time to get it LOOSE!<br /><br />BACK IN BLACK is my cure for everything that ails ya. Put this peice on ultra loud and move! Shake yo' body ladies, rock it out dudes... GET RIGHT! Stop coming by to put up reveiws about how NELLY or FIDDY is better, cuz we don't give a sh*t. We know that AC/DC is the greatest and you trash talkin' wasters don't know nothin!<br /><br />AND especially to AIDS vs. CANCER who said that this album was only for drunk hicks who like to finger WAL MART cosmetic clerks, DAMN- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT I LIKE TO THAT?!?!<br /><br />PUMP THIS UP! Its pure, real, rock and roll.... nothing more, nothing less... come on boys and girls BREAK FREE!
1572704233|5.0|Though I've read and loved the Bertie Wooster canon, listening to Jonathan Cecil's vocal renderings have added an entirely new dimension to Wodehouse's works. \\"Right Ho, Jeeves\\" was never my best-loved Wodehouse, but after hearing it read by Cecil, \\"RHJ\\" has become my all-time favorite.<br /><br />Cecil's character voices are pitch perfect. If you've ever heard Madeline Bassett's voice in your head saying that \\"the stars are God's daisy chain,\\" it probably sounds exactly like Cecil's breathless falsetto. And he perfectly captures Aunt Dahlia's purring timbre as she sardonically instructs Bertie on the steps he must take to drown himself in the kitchen garden pond.<br /><br />Cecil manages to slip seamlessly from one voice to another. Though the scene of Gussie Fink-Nottle awarding prizes at Market Snodsbury Grammar School is generally ranked as one of the funniest scenes in literature and Cecil's impersonation of the normally abstemious Gussie now slurring drunk at the podium was certainly inspired, the real high point of this audio version is Cecil's virtuoso reenactment of star chef Anatole's fit of the vapors spoken in some sort of \\"Provence-anglais,\\" with Bertie, Aunt Dahlia, Gussie, and Seppings the uptight butler taking seamless part in the conversation. Listen and you will gain a new appreciation of the genius of Wodehouse - and Cecil.<br /><br />I've listened to other Wodehouse audio stylists and Cecil's performances are by far the best. Unlike many other readers, each voice sounds absolutely unique - I often wonder what Cecil's real voice sounds like.<br /><br />If you're interested in trying Wooster on audio, try this one first.  Best heard while driving to work - it's always great to start the day with a laugh.
B00004LN16|5.0|WHAT IS EVERYONE SAYING? Just say its good. Of course it doesn't have Shook me all night Long, or TNT, or Highway to HELL. Those are on other albums... If you happen to be looking for those songs, I hear ya, those songs f*ckin ROCK, they can be found on BACK IN BLACK, HIGH VOLTAGE, and HIGHWAY TO HELL, respectively.<br /><br />If you are looking for killer songs like SAFE IN NEW YORK CITY, SATELLITE BLUES, STIFF UPPER LIP, ALL SCREWED and stuff that ROCKS, then get STIFF UPPER LIP.<br /><br />Who cares if they were hits or not, its AC/DC, its always good; and here, its actually REALLY good.<br /><br />BRIAN JOHNSON smoked a pack of smokes before recording every cut, his throat is going through more hell than ever on this one, but it sounds incredible; especially cool on the title track.<br /><br />This is one of those albums that gets me fired up just thinking about it. I can't wait to get home so I can blast it on the stereo and piss off my baby's mama... YEAH!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|SAW. <br /> <br />First of all, let me get this out in my opening. This isn't my normally preferred style horror flick. I enjoy films ala Event Horizon or Hellraiser (I and II) much more.  <br /> <br />This movie does very well keeping you guessing. Not until the very end does it reveal its cards. For that it kept my attention from stem to stern. <br /> <br />The style of the movie - some of the quick cuts and shifting around in the story. They did it well for what they were trying to go for. For that, I'm not critical. Its just not my favored way to tell a story. I understood the story with no problems. I'm just no fan of \\"flashback\\" sequences when they are overused. <br /> <br />The writers do a good job playing on our fears of confinement.  That dirty, nasty bathroom was a perfect scene to augment those fears. <br /> <br />Overall, its a decent movie. A creative style killer who doesn't kill you, but mindf*cks you forcing you to do something that sickens you to live - I found that refreshing. The ending is most definetly not a \\"feel good\\" type either. For that it wins points too. I hate cliche endings that are too safe. <br /> <br />My only knocks against it story could be bit jarring the way it was constructed. However, for its creativity and willingness not to cop for the crowd pleasing end. This one gets a rental recommendation from me. <br /> <br />*** 1/2
B00005YUPO|5.0|This video is cute.  The chickens going \\"bach, bach, bach\\" distinguish it from all other baby einstein videos.  My son really enjoys it.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Ridley Scott has given us a lot of great movies, like Blade Runner and Alien, but Gladiator is probably his biggest mainstream hit and for good reason.  The story of Maximus is a human, entertaining one, the depiction of Rome is the best we've yet seen (thanks to some digital imagery)and as a result, as viewers we really do feel transported to that time and place.  I think some of the history is flat out wrong, like the ending which suggests that Rome will become a Republic again (yeah, right!), but hey, you can't have everything.  I will say this, for all it's glories maybe the movie is a tad overlong, but that's hardly to be mentioned when compared to the magnificence of the opening battle sequence and the tension of the rounds in the colosseum with the gladiators fighting for life and death.  I hear there's going to be a sequel, but it will have to take place in Tartarus...
630521610X|5.0|scream exploded onto the world with its scary scenes, pop-culture refrences, and its parody of old slasher movies. the first ten minutes in my terms are the one of the best opening sequences in horror history (along with halloween) were drew berrymore gets killed. and i know you liked it. the movie is basiclly about a killer who is stalking a teen who was the daughter of his first victom. simple enough story but then craven and williamson then juice it up with funny one-liners, a steller cast, lots of blood, and showing the rules of a horror pick. its been almost ten years since scream came out but it has still left a mark on the horror gerne. the success brought up two extremly clever sequels tha broke even more ground by being worthy sequels in the horror gerne. a feet never achived before and becoming the greatest slasher series of all time, a title that may never be beat. so see this cool flick and the sequels you will not be dissapointed.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|Let's say up front that I'm not a Depeche Mode \\"fan\\". <br />That said, I loved Violator. I'd recommend listening to that again rather than spending time on this album. At track 2 things are looking good...by track 5 they're still OK... by track 10 I'm just waiting for it to end.

1932100385|5.0|This is a very informative book, I highly recommend it. I have been vegan for 2 years and I love every minute of it, anyone and everyone CAN do it, even though it may seem impossible at first.

B000B19BCG|3.0|I'd read that this was a mellow Supergrass album and I was intrigued.  Unfortunately, the band doesn't take it far enough.  The songs aren't really mellow, and they aren't very catchy either.  There are a couple of bright spots (especially the first track).  But overall, it's disappointing.  I'm not sure Supergrass has a really introspective album in them.  Maybe next time they'll take the glam thing they started on \\"Life on Other Planets\\" a little farther.  that might be more promising and natural.
B00005G95I|4.0|It starts off oh so mysterious and withheld. A laidback guitar leads us through the instrumental Signs Of Life and into Learning To Fly.  <br /> <br />David Gilmour then sings the first vocals on an album by Pink Floyd without Roger Waters. \\"Into the distance, a ribbon of black <br />Stretched to the point of no turning back\\". And there is no turning back. I am already hooked on this track, and this album, knowing I will not stop until I am through every track. I am simply flying into a new Pink Floyd sound, I have a new universe to discover.  <br /> <br />A massive wall of sound surrounds me, the use of effects and instrumentation unlike almost anything yet heard in the 80s.  <br /> <br />Dogs Of War starts off great, but is by many considered the weakest track on the album. I am not sure if I agree. In my opinion it fits beautifully inbetween Learning To Fly and One Slip. The sound is filled with hard guitars and backingvocals that could be taken from Dark Side Of The Moon. I think even the sax-solo fits well with everything. OK, the lyrics might not be the greatest ever written, but sometimes the instrumentation can do a lot as well, as they do now. <br /> <br />One Slip, starts slow, but intensifies as we go along. It has nice use of drums, percussion and bass. As well as Mr. Gilmour's guitar of course. I like the way they have built the song and the way the backing vocals are arranged. This is also the track that has the title of the album in the lyrics.  <br /> <br />\\"One slip, and down the hole we fall <br />It seems to take no time at all <br />A momentary lapse of reason <br />That binds a life for life <br />A small regret, you won't forget, <br />There'll be no sleep in here tonight\\" <br /> <br />On The Turning Away is a classic Pink Floyd ballad. It has everything. A strong and laidback build-up, until it grows and grows to an elegant song that grabs you and takes you along. You can't help stomping your foot to this one, in steady rhythm. In the beginning it is just Gilmours voice and a synth, then an acoustic guitar joins in, before drums and bass are allowed into the party. The electric guitar is also allowed a place eventually. No Pink Floyd ballad without a solo from Mr. Gilmour, which is very understandable, he is a champion at those.  <br /> <br />Yet Another Movie follows the great ballad. It starts off almost sci-fi like. Somehow it makes me think of the Alien-movies. I have no idea why. They have an elegant sound here too. Which is the case with every Pink Floyd album through the years. They have never released anything with poor sound-quality. Yet Another Movie is sort of an inbetween song. And it's not the only one. The thing is that they fit so well though. I just love how they have arranged the instruments in this song, to create an atmosphere and an incredible sound. The guitar solo is excellent also on this one.  <br /> <br />A New Machine part 1 is a logical follow up to Yet Another Movie. The second part of the album is sort of conseptual, as it deals with loss of innocense, and gives portrait of a man in desperation. A New Machine is made by Gilmour manipulating his voice by a voicebox, and last for just over a minute.  <br /> <br />It leads directly to the intstrumental Terminal Frost. A moody track, where the saxophone has a vital role in bringing through the emotions. It's very well played, and when I listened to it on headphones the first time I got small shivers down my spine. Because it sounds beautiful, really beautiful. Especially at the soloparts in the middle of the song, when the backing vocals wrap the whole thing in so beautifully. <br /> <br />A New Machine Part 2 is even shorter than the first part, and serves as merely an intermission towards the best track on the album.  <br /> <br />Track 10. Sorrow. <br />The guitar in the beginning takes the control of you and whirls you inside the Pink Floyd universe. It is impossible to resist. On the other hand, after the 9 previous tracks there is no resistance left, if it ever was any. I am not really going to say more about Sorrow, other than that you have to lend an ear to it yourself. Then you will really hear the magic of Pink Floyd, and David Gilmour.  <br /> <br />Is it a downer that Roger Waters is not participating on this album? Yes it is, but the quality of the album is outstanding anyway, so you don't really miss Waters after you have heard it. At least that is how I feel. I know that many fans of Pink Floyd disagree with me on that. Which I have no problem with. There will always be different opinions about music, and that is the beautiful thing with music - we all see and hear things differently. <br /> <br />I recommend this album very much. It is not Dark Side Of The Moon, it is no Wish You Were Here or The Wall. But it is an album by Pink Floyd and it is an extremely good one. I'd recommend you to buy it!
B000BCKFWK|4.0|Blood. Blood. And more Blood. But the gore, gore and more gore is often minimalized by an effect that shows the splatter in off white and usually only the carnage gets red treatment. In fact, the entire movie was in some cool variation of black and white with red as the predominant color that does not get black and white treatment. Oh, there's an occasional pair of blue-eyes here and there and other brief color treatments, but the film is mostly in the funky black and white.<br /><br />Sin City jumps around a bit similar to Pulp Fiction. The jumping is actually effective and easy to follow. The movie is the story of the pursuit of a couple of serial killers...one pursued by Bruce Willis, the other pursued by Mickey Rourke...and the story of a network of hookers...and how the pursuit of the serial killers and the network of hookers all ultimately interconnect.<br /><br />Captivating, very entertaining, and suspenseful at times. An original movie with a great cast. Worthy certainly of a rental. If you have to own, you'll likely get more for your money with the recut and extended edition, so I'd opt for that.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|If you are a Titanic fan, you must have this DVD set.  Order it, and then clear your schedule for a weekend because you won't be leaving the house for a while.  Here are some of the highlights: <br /> <br />The cast and crew commentary is certainly varied, with producers Jon Landau and Rae Sanchini commenting throughout and then Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, various supporting characters and even extras and stunt people chiming in with behind the scenes stories.  Interesting to find out about the scene where Jack and Rose are taking their first daylight walk on the deck and Jack confronts Rose by asking her if she loves Cal.  That wasn't in the original script and was only added at the insistence of Kate and Leo that there be something more than hearts and flowers in the Jack - Rose relationship. <br /> <br />The historical commentary with Don Lynch & Ken Marschall was fun.  Cal and Rose may be arguing on screen - but Don and Ken are talking about the historically accurate White Start Line ashtrays on the dresser.  Of course, sometimes we are back on a set they've already dissected, so they are reduced to watching the movie and saying things like \\"I love that line!\\", just like any fan. <br /> <br />Motor-mouth James Cameron gets his own directors track where he tries to give background on every shot: \\"This is on the set, and then now we cut to models with CGI water; now this is back on the set with green screen and now we're in the tank with models and the boats in the background are CGI, and now we're...\\"  It may be more than most can take for the length of this movie.  Still, Jim actually gives more historical background that Don and Ken - he obviously knows his stuff and is very passionate.   <br /> <br />Breaking New Ground - The Making Of Titanic Tv Special  is a good behind the scenes feature, particularly for people who want some of the backstage story but won't be taking the time to get into the commentaries and \\"pods\\" where much of this is explored in even more detail.  Titanic Crew Video is a hoot - one of the AD's took home video footage of the shoot and then edited it together with some of the movie scenes (along with a few shots from Poseidon Adventure and other old films) for comic effect.  Low brow - but funny.  (I particularly liked the shot of Titanic pulling out of the harbor with a big \\"Sink Me\\" Post-It digitally slapped on to the stern.) <br /> <br />Then, of course, there's always The Movie: <br /> <br />I realize that there are a lot of people who disagree about this - but I think Titanic is an incredible screenplay.  Yes, some of the dialog is inane, and yes, Cal does everything but twirl his moustache (if he had one).  But screenplays are not built on dialog.  (Case in point - Star Wars.  Some of the worst dialog ever written - but still a compelling and entertaining movie.)  Screenplays are about structure and visual storytelling.  And it's here that Titanic excels.   <br /> <br />The first problem in writing a screenplay of the Titanic story is this: how do you get beyond the tragic numbers (1500 people dead) make people care about these long forgotten people? Enter Rose, Cal, and Jack - a cross-class love triangle.  Their story will show the audience the ship as well as the social structure of the day.  (And you can't understand Titanic without grasping the social underpinnings.)  <br /> <br />The second issue the screenwriter has to overcome is the Apollo 13 problem: everyone already knows how the tale ends. Enter Brock and his modern-day crew.  What I love about the opening of Titanic is that you are expecting to see this 1912 story with Kate and Leo, but for the first 20 minutes you are firmly in the present.  This tells the audience that, like Brock the treasure hunter, they don't know this story the way they think they do.  They need Rose to take them back to Titanic and paint the triumph and tragedy of the great ship. <br /> <br />The film is visually audacious - the angles are dramatic and unimaginable.  Where previous Titanic movies have shot scenes tightly to disguise the fact that the real ship isn't there - Cameron boldly goes for big helicopter views. Even the close shots have deep detailed backgrounds.     <br /> <br />Finally, the themes of the film acted out by the characters, are the drawn from the lessons of Titanic as well.  Rose begins the story corseted into a beautiful, but narrow existence with limited possibilities.  She leaves all that behind in the North Atlantic, and embarks on a life with no security - but unlimited possibilities.  On a larger scale, Titanic was that beautiful but strictly controlled society.  But, passengers and crew found out that you can't control everything, and the grand world broke apart and sank into chaos.  Two years after these events, The Great War would scuttle most of the upper classes of Europe and kill or wound 30 million more.  At the same time the rights of workers, women, and minorities were ascendant, so that today it is hard to imagine living under the Edwardian social conventions.  Titanic foreshadowed the violent demise of the old order.  We can roll our eyes at their arrogance, but we also can't help but be a little nostalgic for the lovely world they created. <br /> <br />This exquisite DVD set will be treasured by anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the craft of the actors and technicians, or in the great ship itself.
B00005JNTX|4.0|It's graphic book version of 'Kill Bill,' it's pitch dark, it's violent, it's nasty, it's whatever makes you sick, and it's very fascinating.  Not everyone would find the film that way, and I confess I am not a big fan of this film or Frank Miller's original books, but I still kept watching this brutal world where the revenge story of The Bride is enacted on everyday basis.   <br /> <br />Perhaps it is pointless to repeat the story after more than 500 reviewers pasted their own views.  As they said, 'Sin City' means the title itself, the city filled with crimes and violence, where the dark world of the original comic book comes alive.  Three stories, each of which are connected tangentially (ala 'Pulp Fiction'), features three tough guys: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen.  And all of their stories involve women, as old noir films do.  <br /> <br />[BRITTANY MURPHY SAID ... ] I would like to add something else.  Brittany Murphy, who came to Japan to promote the film (with Devon Aoki), during the interview with Yahoo Japan strongly recommended that those viewers who find the content too sick should wait for Mickey Rourke.  She said, 'it's 'meant to be funny.'   <br /> <br />Funny?  She said so clearly.  I'd rather say 'darkly funny' but she made a good point about Rourke.  Marv, played by Mickey Rourke, vows a revenge for a beautiful girl who slept with him just one night, and follows those responsible no matter what it takes.  As you see, the story itself is nothing new, just a standard noir one.  But it is the way of revenge or killing that matters.  Bullets are too ordinary.  You should be Hannibal Lector to claim originality in Sin City. <br /> <br />[MICKEY'S SEMI-COMEBACK]  Among the various players gathering for this rare chance to become the comic book characters themselves, Mickey Rourke steals every scene in this film.  In fact, almost all actors are excellent ... I said 'almost' because Bruce Willis looks exactly Bruce Willis (perhaps that is nota bad thing), and Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, and Nick Stahl, all cast against type, are less convincing and impressive than Rourke, Owen, or Benicio Del Toro. <br /> <br />As to the story and script 'Sin City' needs more re-writes.  Frequent voice-overs are annoying to me, and some materials are used too much (like torture and imprisonement). 'Sin City' is not as groundbreaking as 'Pulp Fiction' but is visually rivetting, no question about it.
0783225482|5.0|This Machiavellian reflection seems to fit exactly in this funny black humour picture around two women obsessed with a same man and her countless traps to catch him. The film is visibly inspired by The Witches of Eastwick but with an intelligent twist, transcribing an universal desire surrounded for the most infamous devices that will include plastic surgery, the last innovation in the expected dream to reach the eternal youth.<br /><br />Original entertainment and admirable tragic comedy.
0312305060|5.0|For whatever reason, I found this book hard to read when I first tried a few years ago. The second time around, it proved to be a true revelation. The lyrical prose, the brilliant interweaving of three stories, and the unforgettable characterization all come together for me. And it's been more than 30 years since I read Virginia Woolf.<br /><br />I agree with those who said the book can be understood as a fugue with repeating and interlocking musical themes. I also want to emphasize the \\"Laura\\" story. Even beyond the connection to the other two stories, it stands as a poignant evocation of a life of quiet desperation. The whole world of suburban California in 1949 is rendered brilliantly -- the postwar affluence and complacency, the continuing homage to those who fought for their nation, the circumscribed role of woman as wife and mother.<br /><br />I have not read Cunningham's other books but I will make sure to do so.

B0006GAOBI|1.0|Donnie Darko was one of my favorite films of all time... Until I saw the director's cut.  To make this short, the DC took out ALL the good music and replaced it with other stuff which didn't even fit the scenes.  Secondly, they added the \\"scene titles\\" which literally try to explain what's going on so you don't have to use your brain.  In short, the DC killed everything that was unique and interesting about the film and made it into a film for the masses (just to make more money).  If you really enjoyed Donnie Darko, don't watch this horrible version of it... go buy the original.  And if you haven't seen the original, you're missing out.
B000000W5N|5.0|To guy who gives one star who didn't say buy Exile or Beggar's Banquet, which are great as well. (I don't understand his review on this one, it's one of the great Stones albums so if you like the Stones, you should like this, I certainly do.) No, the other guy, please disregard him completely, look at his list of what he gives one star ratings, he doesn't appear to like any kind of music that I could gather, besides Will Smith, who is an alright actor, but not particularly regarded for his musical ability, I don't think, but I don't listen to that particular genre anyway.  But besides that he doesn't like other rap that I have heard regarded highly by people who listen to rap, so I can't figure it out.  He makes a couple of references to punk, so I am guessing he probably likes some kind of whiny skater type music or something, which should never even be mentioned in the same breath as Stones. (Crap, I just did.)  All I can conclude is that he is too cowardly to put up what he likes for derision, but he feels fine deriding everybody else, and according to me, he has terrible taste as far as I know, so don't pay attention to him, he's just dumb.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Probably yes. <br /> <br />Multiple subtle layers of melodic story telling, without ever being soft, or fake. New sounds and rythems emerge every time you play the record after some time. <br /> <br />This one goes straight into your heart & mind, for most songs never to leave again. And most songs are getting even better by the years.  <br />
B00020HEL6|5.0|I saw Renee open for B.B. King during his 80th Birthday Tour...she was spectacular; the album does not disappoint.  Jazz standards are not generally my cup of tea, but this is a truly stellar effort by a rising young star (no pun intended).  Her voice and presentation are both mature well beyond her years.  Veteran performers would be proud to claim such a solid piece of work.
B00000I8UF|5.0|I'll be perfectly frank and say right off the bat that I'm the kind of guy who can't get into a lot of jazz music.  I love the sound of it, but some of the more avant-garde stuff just seems to meander too much without really making an impact on me, so there are many jazz albums that I just can't stay with for extended periods of time.   <br /> <br />     Maybe it's just because I don't know what chromatic scales or augmented ninths are, and I don't understand the technical brilliance of what most jazz musicians are doing.  But I do have an ear for music, albeit an untrained one, and I know what I like!  And this is, unequivocally, my favorite jazz album ever produced, beating out very illustrious competitors like Miles Davis' \\"Birth of the Cool\\" and Herbie Hancock's \\"Head Hunters.\\" <br /> <br />Try as I might, I can not remember one dull moment throughout this entire full-length album.  In fact, I sat in awe throughout most of it.  Not only are the songs tuneful, catchy, and interesting to the point where I often found myself humming along, but some of the instrumentalists are dazzling!  I don't know who the pianist is, but his first solo took the breath right out of me. <br /> <br />Some of the musical ideas expressed in this work are just as rich with imagery as most any piece of classical music.  At several points, the drums go into the most exciting solos since the days of Gene Krupa, conjuring wonderful pictures in the mind's eye.  I can say with a fair amount of confidence that nearly everybody, jazz fan or not, can find something to like about this extraordinarily visceral, unforgettable piece of music!
1400032717|5.0|In Swindon, England lives a boy named Christopher Boone. Christopher knows all of the countries in the world and all of the prime numbers up to 7,057. The book is about Christopher and his journeys to find his mother and solve a murder mystery. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, by Mark Haddon, is a moving, well written story.  <br /> The first strength of this book is the content of the book. The book is very easy to read. The author made the book have a mix of moods and still made Christopher lovable. The language is spoken in a modern-day text with slang spoken in Britain. The story also changes in the middle which makes it exciting to read. A younger reader would probably not be able to understand most of the language but for teenage readers and adult readers it is quite easy to comprehend. <br /> The next strength of Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime is the side story Christopher tells. The \\"side story\\" is not actually a story, but it tells more about Christopher's disease and background information about him. He also includes pictures and diagrams in most of the side story which makes it very easy to tell what he is talking about. The side stories are also amusing. Sometimes the story gets dark and then the next chapter is an amusing story Christopher experienced in his life. <br /> Finally, the last strength is the book is the story in general. The story gets more and more dramatic as the book progresses. The book starts out with a small conflict and a murder of a dog, and then turns into a fight over parent's custody. The story also shows the growing confidence and courage of a young boy with a mental illness. Christopher starts out as a wimpy boy who is afraid of anyone who he does not know, and then grows to a man who travels all the way tot London by himself.  <br /> The book Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime shows courage, bravery, and strength of a young by with autism.  The book is a well written moving story withcountless twists and cliff hangers. The book starts out as a small murder case and grows to an even larger conflict with a very content ending. <br />  <br />
B00000K31V|4.0|I mean, play the game. 'eXistenZ' is the next generation of video game, the one that jacks directly into your nervous system. Allegra, a pert blonde, is the game designer. For the first time ever, she has emerged from her coding den to launch one of her games, to face her adoring public.<br /><br />Except, one of them doesn't adore her so much, and takes a shot at her with a bizarre weapon. The crowd pulls their own guns, and pumps a few pounds of lead into the would-be assassin. The chase is on, with Pikul (Jude Law) at her side. They enter the hyper-realistic game and leave it a few times, signalled by changes to Allegra's perm. The action is low-key but moves along well, down to the very end. In the last moment, you'll have reason to rethink everything you've seen, back to the opening sequence.<br /><br />Effects and chases are decidedly low-key. There's minimal loss of blood, except among the genetically engineered amphibians who give their all (or at least some pinkish wobbly bits) to biological game consoles. People of queasy stomachs might have a bit of trouble. It's an interesting, watchable movie, and presents a reasonable attempt at being thoughtful. It's also one of that very small genre that takes place almost (?) entirely within the game.<br /><br />//wiredweird

4893580914|5.0|This is the kanji textbook series we use in my university courses.  The first semester we didn't study Kanji at all, then the next year-and-a-half we studied out of this book.    This book is also good for anybody who wants to learn independently.  If you at least know how to read Hiragana and Katakana, you won't have any trouble at all learning the Kanji.  Just be sure to pay special attention to the instructions on stroke technique in Lesson 1 if you want to REALLY learn the right way to write Kanji.    Additional tools in the book are:  * An insert listing of all the taught Kanji by lesson  * An index listing Vol. 1's Kanji by readings (Vol. 2's index includings readings from both books)    For each lesson, I usually spend about an hour practicing writing the Kanji and their examples, then it takes me a little over an hour to do the exercises.  (Most students choose to photocopy the work pages or else just rip them out of the book and turn those in, but I write out the questions & answers--which I can fit on a single sheet of paper--because I like the extra practice.)
0060989157|5.0|This is a killer book both for Crue and non-Crue fans alike!  I read it three times already...each time in a single weekend...YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!  This is a first-hand account of all the sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll you could want written by the baddest of the bad...THE CRUE!  Its a knock-down, drag-out, balls-to-the-wall tale of rock 'n roll excess and mayhem!  Ride shotgun with the Crue through their meteoric rise to the heights of metal Gods...and their downward spiral into the abyss of addiction, infighting, and egomania. <br /> <br />For anyone that ever dreamed of being a rock 'n roll star...this is the book for you!  The four members of the Crue take you through the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows...and the insane roller coaster ride in between.  You won't know whether to smile or cringe, laugh or cry, turn away or keep on going!  One thing I can guarantee...your jaw will drop!  No one does excess like THE CRUE! <br /> <br />
1878424114|3.0|If you already have a lot of money go ahead and read this book.  (The people who listen to Deepak's TV shows look quite affluent.)  It will make you feel warm and fuzzy.  But if you have hardly any money just feeling warm and fuzzy may not be a luxury you can afford.  This book does not tell you how to make money.  It does tell you how to feel rich in spirit.   <br /> <br />To make money you have to do the hard stuff.  Get a job.  Live on half your income (as Benjamin Franklin told us).  Invest wisely.  Reading this book and having your head in the clouds won't do it.  You must be practical and look down to see that you are walking down a clearly marked path (job, income, saving, investing). <br /> <br />In the very long run Mr. Chopra is right; security, of course, is an illusion.  Something (illness, death, etc.) sooner or later will make you feel insecure -- but in the meantime a big pile of cash will make you feel more secure and each and every day you will be better able to really enjoy the present as Deepak wants you to. <br /> <br />I subtract two stars from Mr. Chopra for making incredible promises to the reader.
B000003RCY|4.0|Sehnsucht and Live aus berlin were a little bit better but Herzelied is definitely a great cd. only problem with it is, it is not as fast tempo on the cd as on stage. I dont know if tht is good or not
0062502182|5.0|11/01/2005 - I Read this book for the third time this past weekend and LOVED it again. It is a very good book about following your dreams and anyone who enjoys exploring the inner-self. Subjects like destiny and omen are referenced and highly focused, making the reader think about life. There are also many references to the middle-eastern world which makes the book a cultural experience as well. (Le monde Arabe, Andalousie, Spain, etc.) I found Santiago's story very enlightening and would recommend it.
B0000025D0|5.0|Grandiose, visionary, baroque, tragic, triumphant, dark, beautiful.  Embodies the aspirations and existential terror of the American workingclass- mythologizing and simultaneously shattering said mythology in one fell swoop.  Raw yet well crafted, terrifying yet consoling- Bruce speaks with the  confused, angry, passionate, truthful voice of every American outcast, drifter, junkie, and working stiff.  This is Bruce's swan song- infinitely better even than the oft lionized \\"Born to Run\\"-  a pinnacle in the creative arc of a storytelling genius and true American poet- in the same league as all the greats- and this is hands down his masterpiece.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was my favorite film of the year. (It was either this or Corpse Bride- extremely hard decision- but, in the end, \\"Charlie\\" won out).   I was 7 years old when I first read CATCF and I fell in LOVE with it. I didn't watch WWATCF till I was 8 and when I did, I was disspointed, they had changed EVERYTHING! (This is before I knew that it was normal with adaptations)    Needless to say, I was SO happy when I heard that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were doing \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\". Finally, the story as it should've been told. I still had some apprehensions mind you, but knowing Burton/Depp style, I was mostly excited.   I LOVED it, beginning to end, I was enraptured up by it. From the music, (Yeah for Danny Elfman) to costumes, sets, and acting, everything was a masterpiece. I completely understand why they had to alter the ending a bit, since they never intended to do \\"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator\\", they need a real ending instead of a link up to the next installment.   I know I'm getting this film ASAP and I advise you to do the same
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I will put this plain and simple. If you do not like this movie you have no taste. This film was brilliant in every aspect of the word
0307276902|3.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It is written in the first person without parenthesies which makes it very interesting and quick to read.
0316172324|3.0|Gladwell probably doesn't know it, but his book could be a hit on Oprah's bookclub - at least the chapter on the Warren Harding Problem.  This problem consists of the bad, misguided blink - to be distinguished from the insightful, intuitively on-point blink.  Warren, you see, looked like a president, sounded like a president, and undoubtedly had a presidential swagger (though it hardly could have compared to WBush's peacocking under the Mission Accomplished banner or under the lights in New Orleans). But Warren was a superficial \\"skirt-chaser,\\" an idiot and a truly horrible president. <br /> <br />But back to Oprah.   The Warren Harding Problem, you see, extends not just to picking really bad presidents and CEO's, but to Boyfriends.  Yep, that's what makes this Oprah-hot.  We pick `em `cause they look like boyfriends, sound like boyfriends and even walk like boyfriends.  But we fail to avoid the Warren Harding Problem and blink badly and our Warren-boyfriend turns out to be the worst boyfriend possible - actually, not a boyfriend at all. <br /> <br />Note to Gladwell's agent:  Forward this to Oprah. <br />
1400031087|3.0|I just finished the book.  Very powerful but not quite believable. Having worked in a rehab facility I can tell you that most of what James describes going on in the hospital would never happen.  He gives the impression that he had this strange power over everyone that would allow him to do whatever he wanted without regard for the rules or boundaries set forth in the program. Kind of like his early years at home, refusing to live within the guidelines established by his parents.  I hope mom and dad have been reimbursed for all the money they spent confirming James' lifelong belief that he is above any authority and can do everything on his own. I think the greatest benefit realized by James' stay in the hospital is the financial windfall he's now faced with based on Oprah's endorsement. Very resourceful indeed...
B0002WZTOI|5.0|This DVD does justice to the movie that all of us love and remember. <br /> <br />This is Cruise before he was Cruise, along with Val Kilmer, Tim Robbins and Anthony Edwards all before they became famous.  Oh, and Meg Ryan too. <br /> <br />The DVD has beautiful menus and effects--the little things that can make a DVD memorable.   The film itself looks great, just like I remember it all those years ago. <br /> <br />Action, love, rivalry, patriotism.  Top Gun offers it all.  It is hard to imagine someone that hasn't seen this film, but if you haven't, one-click this DVD now!
0812550706|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much and I'm not a SciFi fan. By the number of reviews for this book, you know how enthusiastic people are about this book so I won't go into details. I was ready to give up on this book after reading the first quarter of it. It did not spark my interest at all. But I kept reading and things got very interesting. It was definitely one of the more memorable books I've read. I am going to read the rest of the books in the series.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Sorry guys.  I love your work and I've bought everything you've released upto this point, but I have to vote with my wallet this time.<br /><br />I hope it wasn't your decision to distribute with copy protection and it's just Sony's corporate pissing match against Apple at the expense of their customer base.<br /><br />Why should I listen to poor quality audio?  I want to appreciate all the work you put into this, not downgrade my audio experience by losing quality getting this onto my iPod just to 'play fair' with Sony's DRM.<br /><br />I'm sure the album rocks, but I hope you'll re-release without Sony's DRM.  Chalk up yet another Sony product consumer loss for me this year.  Next year I won't be buying a PS3 and it's even more crippling Blu-Ray DRM either.  I regrettably can't trust any Sony product from this point onwards; Foo Fighter DVD/Blu-Ray discs included.
B00097DXZS|1.0|Not only is this a mediocre Santana CD (Carlos with a bunch of trendy guests for big sales!), it is loaded with copy protection software.  I gritted my teeth when I learned that I could NOT rip this CD directly into iTunes for my iPod.  Copy protection limits and lessens the conumer experience; a huge backlash has already started, causing CD sales to slide even further.  Why doesn't Sony/BMG get it?  Copy protected CDs are terrible and you must avoid this CD!

0385504209|1.0|I rate this item a 0.<br /><br />Please keep in mind this book is a work of fiction; I strongly encourage you to discover the Truth about Jesus Christ, and read the Bible!<br /><br />I have learned more than enough about The da Vinci code from The History Channel; enough to know I have no intentions on throwing my money away on this book. I will not support this book in any way.<br />This book is irreverent, sacrilegious. I consider it an insult to the true Christian.
B00005NC66|5.0|Godard saw that amateur films of family and friends had a poignant nostalgia and an immediacy that was lacking in American films.  Even the great Hitchcock working in America at well-financed studios produces his masterpieces with great deliberation and finesse creating a plastic art.  So Godard mixes improvisation, street scenes shot from within a box on a wheelchair and captures Parisians as they really are in their banality, in their recognizable humanity, and therefore, the thrill of humankind in recognition.    The Belmondo character smokes his fat Chesterfields exactly like Bogart, his gangster screen mentor.  So the director interjects his admiring eye on American film actors within the storyline.  Belmondo impersonates Bogart, his many personal screen quirks, but then the stoic Bogey is exaggerated, a modern stalking horse for future punkdom.  You could almost see the swinging 60's five years in advance as Belmondo and doll-like Jean Seberg prance about Paris, breaking the stodgy rules of their 1940's,1950's parents, making love on a whim, making banal, pseudo-intellectual references, outlandish statements - I've had lovers, many, anyone I see, blahhh blah, I'm pregnant - so what - let's get under the sheets, banality under amazing visual setups in a plain room for thirty minutes. Then there's the cuts from moment to moment, a two or three minute cut to the same shot with the car driving through Paris - a parade of diplomats - a policeman on the trail of Belmondo interwoven, so we have the effect, especially in black and white, of a documentary spliced together by an amateur.    These are all very original ideas, which I think along with One Life to Live make Godard a heavy weight in the pentathlon of great directors.
6305428042|4.0|There are a lot of good reviews here about \\"Hocus Pocus\\".  Most of them give a good picture of what to expect in this early 90s film.  However, most of the recent and highly read reviews leave out a few very important factors for parents to consider before letting your kids watch this bewitching tale;<br /><br />-Bette Midler says \\"Da#n\\" about 15 times.  If you don't mind your kids hearing that repeated with great vigor, start the movie.<br /><br />-A key ingredient to releasing the witches from the \\"Dark Beyond\\" is a \\"VIRGIN\\".  This gets mentioned about 5 or 6 times (at least).  If you don't have a problem explaining that to your kids (or making up a lie) then, by all means, start the movie.<br /><br />-There is mataphysical violence (kids getting the life sucked from them, zombies with their heads and fingers coming off and mouth sewn shut, teans being zapped by lightning bolts).  Not particularly offensive, but a bit intense for some kids.  If your kids really have a grasp of reallity and don't get creeped out too easily, start the movie.<br /><br />I watched this right after I put my kids to bed.  I, personally enjoyed this film.  I really have nothing bad to say about it. Great picture and sound.  No extras.  However, I have decided that my 7-year-old daughter would not handle this too well, so I'm glad I pre-viewed it.<br /><br />Great viewing for Halloween, but not for my kids...  ...yet.
B000AADYRQ|2.0|Death Cab For Cutie, although sometimes mislabled as emo, is really the anti-emo act of today. Their music isn't layered in screaming or breakdowns, and it doesn't follow any a-typical emo trends. If i had to describe cutie, it would be pure indie. For their newest \\"plans\\", cutie takes a slightly different direction, one more generic, and because of that, \\"plans\\" is probably the band's worst effort to date. Short, but not so sweet, this record really isn't worth a 12+ dollar purchase. If you're a diehard cutie fan, you probably own this record already, so i'm not preaching to you. If you're still on the fence, download a couple tracks first and make up your mind. <br /> <br />Music: 2 stars <br />Lyrics: 3 stars <br />Production: 2 stars <br />Overall: 2 stars
B0001WTUH6|4.0|The \\"Underworld\\" sequel will soon be out so now is a good time to revisit the original.  Personally I enjoyed this film more than any high budget \\"mainstream movie\\" I have seen in years. But I can see many of the problems others have pointed out. Although the small action scenes work very well, the more elaborate scenes are disjointed, confused, and somewhat silly. If you compare the opening subway sequence to the train station sequence in \\"The Untouchables\\", you see an illustration of why less is better; and \\"Underworld\\" expends more ammo for less effect than anything this side of a \\"Godzilla\\" film.    Along with too much aggressive confusion is the silliest head-splitting in cinema history. Similar to the way Tarentino dispatched Lucy Lie in \\"Kill Bill Vol.1\\" (i.e. a delay in the actual detachment-I don't know which film did it first but Tarentine did it way better), the effects editor overlooked the need to show a slice in the head before it topples off. Surely this was just simple incompetence and not deliberate, because there are ways to show this (i.e. a line) that would still make it a relatively shocking scene.    The story itself breaks too many horror genre conventions and fails to generate much real suspense (although the climax is somewhat surprising). But ultimately these problems did not interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.    This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle, as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel. It is likely that your feeling about the film will depend on your impression of Beckensale. She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint.  She is increasingly an absolute ringer for a 1940-ish Loretta Young. An earlier comment noted that: \\"This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model, with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a reflective rubber suit and you have something to anchor your movie\\". All this is very true but add intelligence, subtlety and nuance not seen since Diana Rigg was playing Mrs. Peel. The film does not demonstrate her range (you have to watch \\"Alice Through the Looking Glass\\" for the best evidence of that) but it is one of those rare cases where you can't imagine anyone but her in the role.    The production design, lighting, and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production.    The film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story.  I don't understand the comments that are negative overall, or what films these people are unfavorably comparing it to-can't be the garbage films that have been coming to mainstream theaters over the past few years. Bottom line, if you like the genre, appreciate stylish production design, and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie.     Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Firstly, whether you are a Foo Fan who's been buying their albums for the last ten years (Like I am), or think the band cooked this nightmare of a disc up on their own (Instead of being coerced by their label) some facts are indisputable: <br /> <br />1. Many people think this was a good album which was poorly fabricated. Sound quality issues are rife, DRM issues aside. <br />2. There are places where installing software on the users PC WITHOUT informing the owner or allowing to cancell installation is illegal! Where it is NOT illegal, it damn well should be. <br />3. Crashed systems have been confirmed with the DRM in use by this disc. <br />4. Failure to play in car\portable CD players have been confirmed with this disc. <br />5. Legal protections of \\"Fair Use\\" of music\movies ALLOW people to backup their originals (I'd happily give this up if they are all required to replace scratched\damaged\destroyed [e.g. house fire] media at no cost to the consumer, but for  some reason they don't want to) and make duplicates to their hearts content to play anywhere\anyhow they want so long as they have the original. THIS WOULD INCLUDE EXTRACTING TO MP3 FOR USE ON AN IPOD!!! <br />6. iPod Users CANNOT play this disc on their iPods! Of course the label is only TOO HAPPY to sell you a SECOND copy that you CAN play on your iPod . . . Anyone think that's fair? <br />7. SCORES of (Former) fans are stuck with an unreturnable album they would NEVER have bought if they knew to be virulently crippled in this way. <br />8. I will never buy another Foo Fighters disc, nor any disc that is protected after this experience. I'm also NOT alone in deciding this. <br /> <br />\\"Protections\\" like this abuse the rights of the fans, make the artists look bad, and probably actually ENCOURAGE illegal music downloads. Since you can reportedly rip this without issue in a Mac, it stands to reaon someone will (or has) rip these on a Mac or Linux box and distribute it! <br /> <br />The music industry DOES NOT GET IT!!! Treating paying customers like thieves will only cost you customers. According to the DMCA (A REALLY bad law signed by that phillandering buffoon Bill Clinton) attempting to circumvent this criminal protection scheme is a felony! So you can vote with your wallet and NOT buy, or pay twice for the same album. Unacceptable. <br /> <br />Sign a petition to repeal the DMCA and de-criminalize a permanent FIX for this kind of garbage! Developers need to be able to kill\prevent malware\spyware masquerading as \\"DRM\\" without fear of prosecution!  <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />Antivirus vendors should also tag this criminal garbage as hostile and allow it's easy removal.

B000001EG6|5.0|After \\"Empty Sky\\"'s release in Britain everyone knew Elton JOhn had potential.  At the release of his first single the papers and magazines raved him to be the greatest musician at that time.  But after only sell 4,000 copies of \\"Empty Sky\\" Elton decided that it was time for him to really make a name for himself.  He did this by releasing this album. <br /> <br />Here is a step-by-step breakdown of each of the classic songs found on this legendary album.  The album was not only released in England but also in the United States.  The American got to know Elton because of this album.  First, let me tell you my knowledge of this album. <br /> <br />The album began in 1970, shortly after the release of \\"Empty Sky\\".  Elton went to the producer who helped produce \\"Empty Sky\\" asking if he would produce \\"Elton JOhn\\".  The producer pretty much laughed Elton JOhn out of the studio.  Yeah, like he was going to produce another album from this guy.  The first time he fell for it, the album only sold 4,000 copies! <br /> <br />So Elton goes off to find someone else willing to produce this album.  He takes it to another guy who knows Elton's record selling history, but he is much more compassionate for Elton and listens to the album.  He is amazed and pretty much declares that \\"this is a hit.\\" <br /> <br />After the album's release, fans were bewildered.  They loved the album and it did very well here in the US, much better then it did in Britain.  The greatest hit on the album is \\"Your Song\\", and it remains probably the most loved hit of Elton JOhn's thirty-seven year career.  It seems that Elton plays your song on every tour. <br /> <br />In 1970, you could hear \\"Elton JOhn\\" being played by old record machines in homes across the country.  Infact there is a story of the record company that produced it playing the album over and over while the employees' jaws dropped because they were amazed by this album. <br /> <br />As for Elton, he did not like his vocals on this album.  He says that he sounds like a \\"young schoolboy with his balls cut off.\\"  Well, yes, this isn't the mature voice that we here on today's Elton JOhn music, but it is an excellent portrayal of the extent of Elton's voice at this stage and time.   The vocals to Elton's albums get better and better every album.  The vocals on this album are much,much better then the catastrophic vocals of \\"Empty Sky\\". <br /> <br />\\"YOur Song\\"-Ah, Elton's number one and first hit.  \\"Your Song\\" is a beatiful love song that is kind of odd if you listen to it closely.  Its as if the song is about the writer of a song writing a song.  You can always picture Elton JOhn sitting on a roof kicking off large patches of moss from the shingles with a notebook and pen writing this song.  It nearly cry when it is played because it is so beautiful. <br /> <br />\\"The Cage\\"-\\"The Cage\\" is a classic song by Elton.  It is a rocky song with a very catchy tune. <br /> <br />\\"Take Me to the Pilot\\"-This is also one of Elton John's greatest hits.  It is an up tempo, rocky song that depicts a man trying to get control of a woman. <br /> <br />\\"No Shoe Strings on Louise\\"-This is kind of a country-type song, but it isn't twangy like country.  It's probably my least favorite song on this album.  That isn't because it sucks, its just because its not as strong as some of the other songs on this album. <br /> <br />\\"First Episode at Hienton\\"-This is definetly my favorite song on this album.  It isn't really considered a hit, but if you really listen to the vocals on this album it's amazing for a twenty year old performer.  The song is a love song, one that you would want to dance to with your girl especially if her name's Valerie. <br /> <br />\\"Sixty Years On\\"-this is one of my favorite Elton John songs because it is well performed and it has this mysterious lure about it.  The lyrics are highly intelligent as is the melody.  You can almost picture Elton as an old man being walked by someone to church. <br /> <br />\\"BorderSong\\"- This is Elton's first Rhythym and Blue performance.  It is compared to the work of Aretha Franklin, but it has a message that we should all take heed to.  We should love one another. <br /> <br />\\"The Greatest Discovery\\"- This song has a beautiful melody, and the lyrics are very interesting.  It depicts Bernie soon finding out that he has a new baby brother. <br /> <br />\\"I Need you to Turn To\\"-Like, \\"Sixty Years On\\", \\"I Need you to Turn To\\" is a work depicting Elton as an older man.  He needs someone to turn to when times are rough as the title indicates. <br /> <br />\\"The King Must Die\\"-definetly the best written song the album.  It also has a catchy toon.  After the album is over you can still here it ringing through you ears...\\"LONG LIVE THE KING\\" <br /> <br />Long live Elton and it's albums like this that keep him alive. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000A0GXGA|5.0|Another great western series that is long overdo for DVD release. The 3 episodes picked were very good and in top quality.  However this series would be best sold in complete season sets like most other tv shows are being released today A.S.A.P.   There are too many great episodes not to release them in seasons. I rate this disc as a great sampler.
0395645662|5.0|i have always liked sci-fi books but this one beets em all. this book is amazing. so full of detail and description. I have fallen in love with the futureistic world that lois lowry has created. Its like the perfect world. no one gets hurt. but there are some things that i dislike such as how in that world once you get to a certain age or if you have an identical twin you get your life taken away. what are we animals, i dont appear to be a dog but go ahead and check just to make sure. i also disliked the excessive rules. but over all this is one of the best books i have ever read it has become my favorite book. i recommend this book to anyone who loves to read science fiction.
B00005NKKY|5.0|A rightful classic by S&G. The tracklist sort of speaks for itself here. America, Old Friends, At the Zoo Mrs. Robinson AND a Hazy Shade of Winter are all on the hits album, and Mrs. Robinson stands as one of the best known songs of all time. It's a great song, though it isn't my favorite (that goes to Hazy Shade of Winter). America is another great tune, and let's not forget Old Friends (though the orchestration is overkill, oh well), and At the Zoo is a funny political satire. But there are some good lesser-known tracks, such as Save the Life of My Child, with some amazing female backup singing, Punky's Dillemma, a really funny song, and You Don't Know Where Your Interest Lies, which is actually from way back when S&G were Tom and Jerry. But there's one weak song (Overs) and the avant-garde Voices of Old People is more than a bit nerve-grinding. But if you want a good folk-rock album that's not by Bob Dylan, this is what you should go after.
0143034901|5.0|SHADOW OF THE WIND tells the tale of a decrepit mansion and it's horrible secrets, a labyrinth of forgotten books, a mysterious hooded man who smells of sulfur, a murdered writer whose books are being destroyed, an evil police sergeant, and the young man who brings all of these macabre figures together.<br /><br />If I could only use one word to describe this novel, I would choose the word BRILLIANT.
B000AMF7BK|4.0|So you're here wondering whether to sink however many bucks into the latest Sigur Ros album. You're either a bona-fide fan looking for affirmation that this latest effort doesn't suck before purchasing it (it doesn't, buy it now), or you're a fence-sitter, having heard them before, and thought their sound was beautiful and wonderfully weird, occasionally inspired but also occasionally incredibly self-indulgent and, well, pointless.  <br /> <br />I'm here to offer my opinion that Takk is Sigur Ros' most focused and joyous album to date, and my personal pick of the bunch (I do have all their previous albums). Songs- indeed, you can even classify them as songs instead of moods and atmospheres- have structure and momentum that reaches satisfying conclusions. Some even had me rockin' in my chair. All are beautiful as only songs crafted by this bunch of Icelanders can be.  <br /> <br />Will Takk, then, be able to convert a non-fan? I'm not sure; after all, it is another Sigur Ros album, with all that implies. And if their other albums invoked a terrible sense of pretentious, faux-art, hipster nonsense in you, then this latest effort will hardly change your mind. But if you wonder what Sigur Ros have been doing in the 3 years since their previous album, and are willing to give these lads some leeway for their indulgences, I'd say this album is well worth a gamble. <br /> <br />As a side note, the special edition packaging is a thing of beauty and I urge you to choose it over the normal CD case.
6305949980|5.0|This movie is a tradition and I watch it every year Halloween time and it never gets old.  The music very well done.
B0009JAENU|4.0|I heard the G Major (K.301) sonata in Hilary Hahn's recital.  I absolutely melted as goon as she started playing the piece.  Her tone is so full, sweet and tender.  This is reflected in this CD.  What is also reflected in this CD is her \\"flare\\".  Although her interpretation is not so \\"Mozart-ish\\" but she does a good job interpreting the music and certainly playing it.  Perlman's recording is also a good one to own.  His playing is sweet but less tender.  His tempo is lively but too fast and his interpretation is jolly but too casual.   Perlman also doesn't emphasize too much the details.  It's hard for me to recommand one over the other but you can't go wrong with Hahn's recording.  Personally, I prefer Hahn's.  Her tonal beauty has kept me enchanted since I bought her Brahms/Stravinsky CD a few years ago.  I also prefer her taking the time to show the many little details many people over look in Mozart.  I also have Grumiaux's recording which is inferior to Hahn and Perlman in tone.  In interpretation, Grumiaux was way too old school.  He lacked \\"flare\\" Hahn posess.  I only wish Hahn's interpretation can be more old school.  Her interpretation in combination with her silky tone is already making her playing sound \\"heavy\\" and old school.  I just wish there could be more old-schoolism in her playing.  This is why I only give her 4 stars.  Nonethelss, I recommand this recording.  If you also have a chance to see her in recital, you will certainly agree with  my views.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|The perfect new recording for snuggling by the fire or mingling at the cosmopolitan cocktail party.  Diana sounds amazing and the Clayton Hamilton big band delivers fresh swingin' sounds to the sleigh ride.  Very sexy!  A classic.
B000005TQO|5.0|I bought this CD pretty much out of spite in 1997 or so.  I had been an exchange student in Mexico long enough to become fluent, and upon returning to Pittsburgh, to help keep my Spanish as active as possible, I did the only thing available at that time (1980 onward) - I browsed the one record store that had a Latin section (rather than just a World Music section).  Well, around 1996 or so, this CD by Laura ended up in that section. I guess the store clerks had no idea it was Italian and not Spanish.  After seeing her face on that CD staring at me over 4 or 5 months, I just said, \\"What the heck!  I'll buy it.\\"  I loved it so much, I bought 3 more copies for my niece and a couple of friends.  I listen to it regularly and there's not a bad song on it.  The more I listen to it, the more I love it.  Each song grows on you with time.  I've bought more of Laura's CD's, and though her voice may have improved, the songs and the quality of the lyrics have not - none of her later CD's can match the quality of this one.  I think as she got more popular she also got more cheesy and more politico-pushy as some artists tend to do.  I want to hear you sing without hearing your political views in every song!  But, thanks to this CD I decided to learn Italian.  I studied it mostly on my own and part of my self-teaching involved writing down the words to these songs just from listening to them and then translating them to Spanish, then to English.  My Italian is not as good as my Spanish, but I've been to both Rome and Milan on business and had no trouble getting by on my own.  Thanks, Laura!  There's only one other Italian singer who had as much influence on me (Fiorella Mannoia, who I discovered after Laura through a friend who lived in Milan) and her CD's are just as wonderful but harder to find in the US, the best one is \\"Le Canzoni.\\"  I would suggest her stuff, too.
B00005JNTX|5.0|My prediction: Sin City will become the Road Warrior of the next 10 years.  That movie also was considered a bit cultish on its release and wasn't a huge theatrical success.  But through word of mouth it became one of the most popular films among young and youngish males.  Sin City will do the same.    This movie brings to life what comic books really feel like in the mind of the reader (albeit a comic book directed at young male adults).  Clearly the direct involvement of Frank Miller (author of the comic books) played a key role in the success, although I couldn't imagine a better choice for director than Robert Rodriguez.      All of the stories are interesting and visually compelling, but very violent.  To me, though, the violence was not disturbing because it was delivered in a highly stylized manner.  It's impossible to explain the look and feel of the film because there's no precedent.  It succeeds (and then some) at what \\"The Crow\\" only hinted at.  Key to the success is that they didn't try to make this believable in a real world context.  There's a license to create a world that could only exist in comic books and that license is fully utilized.  The way people talk and act and the look of the world they live in is disturbingly unreal and that's as it should be, it's based on a comic book after all. There's no attempt, as in so many other comic book adaptations (Spiderman, X-Men, etc.), to make it appear that this is the real world and comic book characters just happen to inhabit our world. I like that.    The stunner for me was Mickey Rourke in the opening of three loosely connected stories.  In this performance, Rourke does not appear to be an actor giving an impression of a character in a comic book world.  He makes us feel like a window has been opened and we are watching someone who lives in that world.  A truly stunning performance.    This film no doubt has many detractors who aggravate over excessive violence, misogyny, etc.  These people don't get it and should stay away from a film like this in the first place.  Sin City is making no attempt to please everybody.  To me it's refreshing that someone took a risk instead of making movies by polls and committee, which is how so many awful movies get realized.  I can't guarantee that you'll love this movie.  But I can pretty much guarantee that, if you read all the reviews and know what to expect going in, and you still decide to go ahead, then you will love this.
B000AU9UYM|2.0|Someone actually told me that BATMAN BEGINS was a decent action hero flick.  I was leery, to be sure, as I had sat through all those horrific, mind-numbing \\"Batman\\" features of a decade ago, yet I was advised to relax; this movie, I was told, was a \\"thinking man's\\" action hero yarn--a deep, broad, introspective spectacle of existential proportions.  And so I took up my pipe and popped this puppy into the DVD player, thoroughly prepared to discover the dark origins of a comic book legend.  Well, to be sure, there were bats, and there was brooding, and there was a sinister, bleak city, and there was some fighting, and some explosions--even a vehicle that reminded me of a high-torque fertilizer spreader--but there wasn't much of anything else.  In fact, BATMAN BEGINS turned out to be as shallow as dried bread crust, and just as palatable; this movie grated on my nerves like a marathon session of traffic court.  Where do I pay the fine so I can get out of here?<br /><br />Via much fanfare, this movie was heralded as a departure from its batty predecessors.  Writer David Goyer and director Christopher Nolan collaborated on the screenplay--an allegedly brilliant manuscript destined to redefine the action hero genre.  In all fairness, the writers did attempt to present a story meshing the incompatible elements of realism and super action.  They also attempted to present a brooding, troubled Bruce Wayne as he grapples with his inner weaknesses and finds his crime-battling persona.  But a wet dog is a wet dog; the makers of this film can apply as many layers of reason they wish, yet this dud still comes across as a monotonous, tedious, unoriginal, been-there-done-that comic book caper.  What's worse, the fighting scenes are so constipated they looked like they were choreographed in a phone booth--and sounded like pillow fights.  And Batman (played by a wild-eyed Christian Bale), once he puts on his pointy-eared cowl, allows his speech to become so raspy and throaty I swore he swallowed a furrball.<br /><br />Finally, let's go over a roll call of utterly wasted cinematic talent.  Liam Neeson.  Michael Caine.  Gary Oldman.  Ken Watanabe.  Morgan Freeman.  Rutger Hauer.  There's some serious talent there, all of it zapped into superficial inconsequence via very one-dimensional, forgettable roles.  And Katie Holmes, were you in this movie?  Could've fooled me.<br /><br />Alas, if BATMAN BEGINS is the new face of the action hero genre, I'll pass.  Two stars for the special features deluxe edition, as the information presented on the second disc is much more entertaining than the film itself.  Never a good sign when the special features trump the movie, but that's the case here, as it turns out to be a lot more fun talking about Batman than actually watching him.<br /><br />--D.

B00005JNJV|5.0|Take all the hype and granduer and over-merchandized insanity of the first four Batman films and throw them right out the window.  This is Batman stipped down.  No big deal stars!  (Unless you're a huge Michael Caine or Rutger Hauer or Liam Neeson freak!) No over-exposed criminal masterminds!  Director Cristopher Nolan strips down The Bat it his primal form and lets it rip.  Get it straight....I'm not saying that the first four Batman efforts were a total waste...Nicholson, Burton, Keaton...etc.  (Except for the 4th which was utter and complete crap!) I'm just pointing out that Batman Begins is honest.  It doesn't hide behind stars and stage-dressing.  It relies on...acting.  There's a change for Hollywood.  This movie rox on levels that most movies never even reach.  Great ensemble cast of characters (including Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman)a plot that actually develops into something from something...sure it's been rehashed a little.  (Some of us are asking \\"Didn't Jack Napier a.k.a. The Joker kill Bruce Wayne's parents?\\"  Are we supposed to discount all the films from before?)  Well, I guess so.  Now, if Nolan continues the story where he leaves off (Good luck to him) then the next installment should include The Joker.  Does Nolan have the balls to go after Nicholson's performance?  Who knows.  All I do know is that as long as WB keeps The Bat pure and simple then it will continue to flourish and attract new fans.  If it gets corrupted like it did before and turned into a media-holocaust...oh well at least there's The X-Men and Superman and so many more classic characters to explore.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000002PC6|5.0|Landslide- Great way to open an album with a bang! Awesome rock song...love the \\"heaven\\" bridge in the middle...beautiful harmonies! Too bad this song was single #3 off the \\"Physical\\" album...I feel the melody was too complicated for the commercial audiences to appreciate at the time...hence, the poor chart placing...not to mention possible radio overkill of her two previous singles and maybe everyone was too \\"physical-ed\\" out to give this song a chance! <br /> <br />Stranger's Touch- ooh yeah! The slinky verses have ONJ oozing with seduction and the chorus packs a punch! This should have definately been a single! Very commercial, pop appeal... <br /> <br />Make A Move On Me- a solid pop song for single #2 off the album...possible over-kill with the synthesisers though! But it was the 80s so I'll give this song a break! This sounds like something off Madonna's debut album...even though this album came out before that! ONJ truly was a torchbearer for strong, female solo artists...songs like this give her credit <br /> <br />Falling- hmm...I think I lost count of the times the word \\"falling\\" is mentioned in this song?! Every single line of this song seems to end with the word \\"falling\\"!? I think this ballad is just OK...a bit too theatrical...sounds like some Broadway musical ballad...not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing, yet... <br /> <br />Love Make Me Strong- um....the beat is awesome! I'm trying to find nice things to say about this song...it is decent filler for an 80s album... <br /> <br />Physical- this video of this song infamous for spawning 80s fashion-fitness trends like legwarmers and headbands...I actually skip this song a lot...not because it is a bad song...but it has been played to death so much...it is definately catchy though... <br /> <br />Silvery Rain- it took me a while to get into this song...which is quite unique! With sweet acoustic verses that then burst into an angry, loud chorus...this song makes reference to that nursery rhyme \\"Fly away Peter, Fly away Paul\\" and is actually an anti-crop dusting song...has to be heard to be believed...I think the last note ONJ holds on this song is the longest note she has ever held in tune! Impressive... <br /> <br />Carried Away- this song is a typical, BeeGees, paint-by-numbers song...and I mean that in a good way! You can tell it was written by The BeeGees...it has the type of melodies and hooks they write...probably the best ballad on the album...a very dreamy song with lush arrangements that ONJ pulls off well <br /> <br />Recovery- such an overlooked song! This has to be one of my favourite ONJ songs ever! A beautiful, long intro with a Spanish/Tropical feel...even though the song sounds quite peppy, the lyrics are quite nihilistic which is a great juxtaposition...the chorus is basically a duet with John Farrar because his voice is featured heavily kind of \\"duelling\\" with ONJ's...the final chorus is just incredible! The way ONJ harmonises...with herself! This is such a layered song...I can listen to it over and over...you hear different things every time you listen! The album highlight! <br /> <br />The Promise (The Dolphin Song)- I think it is very cute how the dolphins and the Miami ocean are given instrumental credit on the linear notes to this song! This sounds like a \\"New Age\\" song with all the water sounds and dolphin squeaks...I only wish the chorus was featured more...it seems to go verse, verse, chorus, verse...and that's it?! The chorus where ONJ sings \\"Then I'll have done what I promised you\\" is extremely soothing and beautiful...a very classy song
6305718954|1.0|Much has already been said about this movie, so I will keep it brief. <br /> <br />I find it absurd, contrived, and ultimately, weak. <br />It had a lot of potential, but chose the easier route with its love scenes and such. I have such a respect for writers who _don't_ have their main characters sleep together.  <br /> <br />I would have been more gracious with my opinion of this movie if it hadn't been for the last ten seconds of it. The ultimate moment in this already tired Hollywood cliche came as the movie ended with somber text appearing, painting a final stroke in its story of a grand conspiracy against the Gospel Of Thomas. Such a heavy-handed attempt to give the preceding images a deeper meaning fails; it's misleading and inaccurate, and amounts little more than a weak potshot. Sadly, though, many people may be taken in by this trick. <br />Like a made-for-TV movie about \\"True Stories\\", this one should come with its own disclaimer: \\"Based on an actual religion.\\" <br /> <br />Many will find this movie entertaining, but don't confuse style for substance.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|For any music lover, one of the joys of life is the feeling that you've discovered something. There's nothing like the adrenaline rush of excitement, first hearing a song or band that you know will impact your life, and dropping everything to focus all your attentions on the wondrous racket emanating from a nearby speaker. You pass along the discovery to a select band of friends, confident that they will most likely share your passion, and come back to thank you in days to come. You look with a keen sense of pride as their reviews just start to perforate the outer reaches of the mainstream press, then wince at the feeling that they might not be `your band' for much longer. John Peel had this very feeling hearing Teenage Kicks by The Undertones, for the first time. I am delighted to share that my own personal musical highlight of the year was first 'discovering' Mr. November by The National. <br />It is a melancholy yet rousing mix. An ambiguous, repetitive lyric delivered by an instantly unique voice, possessed of the same unmistakeably personal style of an Ian Curtis, Nick Cave or Leonard Cohen. A raw, yet polished sound, moving from lulling to frantic, particularly in the machine-gun drumming of the song's last bridge. The brilliant use of the sound of silence following the chorus, leading to the song's best line; \\"I wish I believed in fate, wish I didn't sleep so late\\". <br />Given that this was my first encounter with The National, their Beggar's Banquet-released third album, had a lot to live up to. Formed in Brooklyn, and hailing from Cincinnati, they have been around longer than it would seem, but they have remained just below the mainstream radar up until now.  Preceded by 2001's self-titled debut (showing potential without finesse), 2003's brilliantly-titled Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers and the EP Cherry Tree, they aren't the newcomers any more, and Alligator has a tender confidence to prove that. <br />Opening track Secret Meeting is a revelation, once again, sounding absolutely nothing like Mr. November, and all the better in its own right, for that. Centred around the baritone of Matt Berninger, it saunters rather than explodes from the speakers. A bundle of alluring poetics, backed by wonderfully-noodly guitar lines, it is a great track to begin the album, and correctly bodes well for what is to follow. Secret Meeting is also one of the album's most quotable songs with its central line \\"I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain\\", and \\"Didn't anybody tell you how to gracefully disappear in a room?\\" among the eloquent highlights. <br />Lyrically, the darkly humorous Karen is a tale of those aforementioned dirty lovers, evoking scenarios such as: \\"It's a common fetish for a doting man, to ballerina on the coffee table, cock in hand\\". <br />Listening to this new set, The National have grown into a great band, who are intriguingly impossible to pin down. Sparsely sprinkled through the album are raucous New York stormers such as Lit Up and the single Abel, alive with electric drumming and insistent, powerful choruses. For the main part, though, they retreat to down-home American tales over sorrowful, melodic arrangements. Soul-searching, wistful and touching; Looking for Astronauts and Daughters of the Soho Riots are among the best Americana you are likely to hear. The latter rotates around simple guitar, comparable to the best of Richmond Fontaine or Bright Eyes' less complex arrangements, and reveals another of the album's most memorable aural images- \\"Break my arms around the one I love, and be forgiven by the time my lover comes.\\" <br />The mood of the album is also difficult to easily pinpoint- whereas before they nailed their `sad songs' colours to the mast- Alligator is a trickier, less-navigated emotional journey. While the majority of the tracks are downbeat and introspective, there is seemingly always a pervading sense of hope. Likewise, the more upbeat sentiments expressed cannot shake their composers'keen sense of irony, particularly noticeable in the likes of All The Wine. In Berninger's own words he has given \\"a permanent piece of my medium-sized American heart\\". <br />There are no weak links in the album's song list, as each track is a revelation; and it's all rounded off with Mr. November, which provides a feeling of the experience coming full circle for this writer. Whereas the group's earlier releases could be seen as somewhat two-dimensional sad songs, they are showcased in glorious 3D Technicolor here. <br />      <br />
B000BEZPQE|5.0|This CD is one of the best live CDs I have ever heard. Slipknot really does know how to entertain an audience and put on a damn good show. I was able to see them live in April. It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. If you ever get the chance to see them live, DO IT! But, for now, get this live CD to tide you over till then! Trust me, you won't regret it!
0060977493|5.0|The book that demands re-reading--not only because of its Complexities but also because of its purely amazing Roy's Language. The thought of completing this book never crossed my mind--and admittedly, I didn't manage to complete my assigned reading when first introduced to the book in my 101E (English as an Additional Language) class. But five years later, the book was recuperated from the shelf and \\"was suffered\\" as I \\"awardingly suffered\\" while reading it. The God of Small Things: one of the books I can claim to be one of my favorites... A second novel, Ms. Arundhati Roy?
B000AU9UYC|5.0|Outstanding, the best superhero movie I can remember watching.  Director Nolan completely nailed the feel of the story and the character of Batman, returning him to his original noble vigilante persona rather than the vaudeville act the original TV show and directors Burton and Schumacher mutated him into.  Christian Bale was born to play this part and I hope for many sequels with him at the helm.  Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman; all fabulous in their roles, and finally, we have a female lead in a superhero movie who isn't a whiny, helpless lump just waiting to be rescued from their own ineptitude (thank you, Kim Basinger and Kirsten Dunst)  Kate Holmes is strong, confident and totally believable in her part.  Batman Begins is fantastic from beginning to end.  I agree with other critics that the fight scenes could have been a little less muddy, but that is my only complaint.  The Batman portrayed here is perfect and a flawless return to what the character was originally intended to be in the comic books.  Finally, Batman is back!!!
B000003BD3|4.0|Rock acts in the sixties never took themselves too seriously, and this production of the Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus is no exception. Sex, drugs, and rock & roll were the order of the day, not high-tech professionalism, and members of \\"the Establishment,\\" such as television producers, had no choice but to conform. Obviously, this project was an attempt to assemble a handful of British rock acts for a loosely thrown together BBC variety show, modeled on America's zany and popular \\"Rowen & Martin's Laugh-in.\\" Set under a circus big top, the result is revealing window into what was then coined \\"The British Invasion\\" of the classic rock era.<br /><br />One has to look below the surface of this light-hearted production to appreciate its magic. Tony Iommi, the left-handed guitarist, later to become the driving force behind Black Sabbath seemingly goes unnoticed as Jethro Tull's side man in \\"Song For Jeffrey.\\" The falsetto harmonies of the Who's quiet bassist John Entwistle, and Keith Moon, barely able to contain himself, highlight Pete Townsend's \\"A Quick One While He's Away. \\"Ain't That A Lot of Love\\" and some extra performances resurrect the nearly forgotten blues group Taj Mahal.<br /><br />Girlfriends and wives also got in on the act, and contributed performances. Marianne Faithful, then Mick Jagger's main squeeze, delivers a cutesie virbrato rendition of \\"Something Better.\\" Yoko Ono (with classic violinist Ivry Gitlis) reminds all within memory just how horribly wretched her dying animal, no talent voice passed off as art, can be on \\"Whole Lotta Yoko.\\"<br /><br />Dirty Mac, an all-star garage band featuring the late John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richard on bass, and Jimi Hendrix drummer Mitch Mitchell, resurrect a lost art: the Jam. Lennon's powerful vocals leads the ensemble through a rendition of \\"Yer Blues,\\" while a youthful Clapton gently caresses a beautiful red Gibson ES-335. Richard, surprisingly competent on bass, provides a solid foundation along with the ever meticulous Mitchell. A lose ending nearly spoils a perfect performance, but hap-hazard endings have always been a Rolling Stones trademark anyway.<br /><br />Predictably, the Stones highlight the show with six exceedingly rare performances. The late Brian Jones, an original founding member, who would be fired by Jagger & Co., then mysteriously drown shortly thereafter is seen here in this unique footage. The Stones remain true to the studio version of the now classic \\"Jumping Jack Flash,\\" as the crowd needs no cue to come alive. Richards launches the band into the slow blues \\"Parachute Woman.\\" Mick's harmonica and the honky-tonk piano of the late Nicky Hopkins fill the gaps nicely. Jone's hauntingly beautiful slide guitar, Richards' acoustic rhythm, Hopkins' pounding fills, and Jagger's intoxicating vocals nail \\"No Expectations.\\" The Stones increase the tempo with yet another classic, \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" then launch into the sinister \\"Sympathy For The Devil.\\" Charlie Watts' rim work coupled with guest conga man, Rocky Dijon lend a raw authenticity, later lost in stadium venues.

B000002H2H|5.0|Lately I've been gearing towards more progressive rock, such as metal (not nu metal of course), and I've been listening to this album a lot even though I have new albums that I bought recently that I've also been devoting time to listen to.  So I've been listening to this one, and I gotta say, it's just so amazing that I was inspired to add yet another well-deserved 5-star review to it.  It's just that godly.  It's one of those albums that even if you're not really into metal you can still enjoy and you will CONTNINUALLY play over the years.  It has the longevity of a McDonald's hamburger: it lasts forever.  Words simply cannot describe how brilliant it is.    The good thing about old-school Metallica (no, that doesn't include the \\"Black\\" album, you mallcore moron) is that not only could they play good ol' thrash but they pushed it's boundaries with progressiveness and by expanding its capabilities.  Instead of just being about rocking out and banging your head it could send a message and inspire you.  The lyrics have always been a strong point in old-school Metallica.  The lyricists in this band (I believe James isn't the only one who does the lyrics) are just some of the best in the biz, or at least were.  \\"Death greets me warm/Now I will just say goodbye.\\"  How brilliant is that?  How much thought, meaning and profoundness does that embrace and convey?  How much work would it take an average musician to come up with words like those?  Amazing.  Then there's the catchy riffs which are also very clever, original and even technically difficult (just in terms of riffs--not solos).  The lead work is brilliant too.  I don't know why people like to bash Kirk all the time.  Probably because they're Mustaine fans and think that somehow by bashing the guy who took his place they are making him better.  Yeah, he may use the wah a lot but it's not like he makes it obvious in every song (unlike his later, s**ttier work) and he's still a fantastic guitarist.  Cliff.... Well, we've all said enough about him.  Lars is an O.K., not so bad drummer but could be better.  Still, he has put out some good work and does not suck like the current, nu metal drummers.    Anyway, on to the album itself!  I don't feel like taking the effort to comment on every song just for a (...)review but let's just say they're all either good or great.  The one everyone complains about is \\"Escape\\" but I think it gets a bad rap.  It's not the greatest song but it does have a cool intro.  Reminds me of \\"Seek & Destroy\\".  \\"Fade To Black\\"'s sell-out quality may be a little debatable but it definitely keeps some thrash elements in it.  Besides, they wrote it without their equipment!  I think they just had some acoustic guitars and that was it.  But it's definitely not a sell-out effort like the godd**m \\"Black\\" album.  James' voice is much better as far as production goes on this album than on \\"Kill 'Em All\\", even though it sounds even better on \\"Master Of Puppets\\", but it still sounds a little like he's singing in a cave or well or something.  The only other thing I have always wished would be different on Metallica albums is the bass.  You can't hear it well enough!  You have to strain a bit to hear it, which is a shame because Cliff is such an awesome bassist.    Anyway, I was just inspired to write a review on this album just because I've been listening to it lately and for the fact that it's such a (...) godly album.  Parents, it's not too late.  You may have bought your kid some crappy gifts for Christmas or even got him/her that (...) nu metal or even pop album that they asked for, which made them happy, but it's not too late to save their souls or yours for that matter.  Get them this album if they don't already have it and they have a faint, REMOTE appreciation for good rock/metal.  H**l, even buy this for yourself!  It's an album most people can like even if they're not exactly a metalhead.  The worst that can happen is your or the kids just can't get into it.But it's worth a try at least.  It definitely beats that Seether or Korn or whatever, album you bought them.    Bottom line: ONE OF THE BEST ROCK/METAL ALBUMS OF ALL TIME.  IF YOU DON'T OWN IT, JUST BUY IT.  DON'T EVEN QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT.  I'M TELLING YOU IT IS SO IT IS, G**DAMNIT!
B00097DXZS|3.0|Carlos Santana returns with his third album of duets, All That I Am.  Following the blueprint originally setup on Supernatural and mimicked on Shaman.  The albums have progressively gone down in quality.  Where Supernatural was fresh and new sounding, All That I Am seems a bit tired and long in the tooth.  Michelle Branch who sang the superb \\"The Game Of Love\\" on Shaman again appears this time on \\"I'm Feeling You\\" which feels like a knockoff of the former song.  The normally dependable Mary J. Blige gives a by-the-numbers performance on \\"My Man\\" along with Big Boi from Outkast.  Steven Tyler also gives a pedestrian performance on \\"Just Feel Better\\" and one has to question what Mr. Santana was thing when he agreed to duet with Bo Bice.  Despite these merely okay songs, there are some standouts.  He teams with former tour mates, The Los Lonely Boys on the excellent \\"I Don't Want To Lose Your Love\\" and Anthony Hamilton is at his smoldering best on \\"Twisted\\".  Mr. Santana teams with Metallica's Kirk Hammett and pedal-steel guitar virtuoso Robert Randolph on the instrumental \\"Trinity\\".  It reminds one of Mr. Santana's work with John McLaughlin and it would be a great idea for his next album to sans vocals and go straight instrumentals.  It would add some life to a tired concept.
0788722271|5.0|This is a wonderful and highly original novel about a mentally challenged man named Charlie who wanted to be smart. One day, his wish was granted. A group of scientists selected him for an experimental operation that raised his intelligence to genius level. Suddenly, Charlie found himself transformed, and life, as he knew it, changed.<br /><br />His story is told entirely through Charlie's eyes and perceptions in the form of progress reports. The reader actually sees the change in Charlie take place, as his progress reports become more complex, well written, and filled with the angst of personal discovery and growth, as well as with his gradual awareness of his amazing and accelerated intellectual development.<br /><br />The progress reports are a wonderful contrivance for facilitating the story, and the reader is one with Charlie on his voyage of self-discovery. What happens to Charlie in the long run is profoundly moving and thought provoking. It is no wonder that this author was the recipient of the Nebula Award, which is given by the Science Fiction Writers of America for having written the Best Novel of the Year. This is definitely a book well worth reading.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Diana Krall's first full length Christmas collection is another typical posh and elegant recording from the great jazz vocalist.  Backed by the marvelous Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra, Ms. Krall offers up twelve well-crafted, immaculately arranged and produced songs.  The arrangements stick to the traditional but Ms. Krall's smoky vocals set the right mood for a romantic holiday party or dinner.  Serve up the eggnog and let it snow.
B000001FDQ|5.0|I keep hearing this music categorized as \\"heavy metal\\".  Perhaps I am not as familiar with heavy metal as the next guy but excuse me, categorizing Malmsteen's music as such paints a one-dimensional image of what he has accomplished here.  Before I knew anything about his background, I could swear I was listening to a classical violin concerto and not electric guitar, as I had known.  Only later did I read that he started out with violin and had classical background.  Yes, he's fast and is an amazing technician but that's only the beginning. As far as I'm concerned, Malmsteen has created a new genre of music, a hybrid of sorts between classical and rock.  I wouldn't even call it rock.  It's just using electric guitar to perform classical arrangements with incredible passion and technique.  The more I listen to the complexities within his arrangements, the more impressed I become.  Malmsteen is to be congratulated for introducing us to an entirely unique form of guitar playing.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Don't get me wrong, i have enjoyed Rod Stewart's music in the past, he has recorded many classic rock songs, but this cd is just plain boring.. his voice isnt very strong on this cd, the songs have been sung before and much better, i can understand maybe one or 2 american songbooks but 4 of em is overdoing it...if anyone has listened to some other recording artists doing standards this pales in comparison,, just take a listen to Linda Ronstadt... Sorry Rod better luck next time.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|All bronzed bicep, leonine mane and CG soldiery, Troy is a glut-fest of regal posturing and battle-flavored man-stench.    Coax golden-skinned, Bally-gymed Brad Pitt into a taut-buttocked mini-skirt in your movie, and Homer's *Iliad* be damned. Compressing the backstory of the ten-year siege of Troy into one-week, all deities, dogma and details are eschewed for ant-battles between computer warriors and camera-caressing of Pitt's Achilles.    Hardly-shaving Orlando Bloom is Prince Paris, who steals away a plain-ish Helen of Troy ne Sparta (Diane Kruger), giving King Agamemnon (Brian Cox, elocuting like a serpent) excuse to hurl Greece's full might against the battlements of Troy, the last bastion of the Known World left to conquer.     Performances such as Eric Bana's stalwart Prince Hector, Peter O'Toole's doddering King Priam, Brendan Gleeson's ogreish Menelaus, Sean Bean's astute Odysseus, and intelligently crafted fight choreography for the *mano a mano* duels elevates this movie above that of trite action blockbuster to that of Guilty Pleasure Trite Action Blockbuster.     Still wondering why actors in Greek or Roman movies - in an attempt to sound more \\"authentic\\" - adopt a *British* accent... Guess Richard Burton has a lot to answer for.

B00000JY1X|4.0|Amazingly simple and full of tenderness, these songs drive you through  all known spectrums of \\"love\\" that the human kind can possibly recall. <br />Remaining true to its style, Stephin Merritt exercises on every song with squeaky sounds blended on a melodically, acoustic base.  <br />Accordion, mandolin and flute give the songs a late 60's European feeling.  <br />Take the advice of The Magnetic Fields and learn how to say goodbye to the loved one, steal a meaningless kiss but give it a meaning, make promises to your sweetheart and laugh your heart out... `til it breaks.  <br />
0679422714|1.0|I borrowed the library copy of the book and checked some of the notes.  I swore to myself that I would never buy the book as it is not worth my time reading it (basically Mao was an evil character the day he was born) - and I do not want to contribute my money to make the book a commercial success, because the authors are totally irresponsible to their readers and the book is an insult to people's intelligence.  Here is why: The book's use of documents is extremely selective.  The authors only included materials that would help them creat the very flat image of Mao and left out whatever that would undercut their arguments (sometimes the other half of a sentence).  They also often took quotations out of their contexts, which distorts the message of the sources.  The list of interviews is long, but how much do they really rely on the interviews?  What can we imagine as contributions from Gerald Ford, Henry Kissinger, and George H. Bush to such a portrait of Mao? How likely would these people have discussed Mao with the authors in the terms with which they wrote the book? What is the purpose of such a long list?  The book ends up a polemic that does not show much respect for sources.  It is too ahistorical and simplistic to hold much explanatory power on modern Chinese history.  If this was written for a college history class, it would have received a \\"F\\" for grade.  I wonder what motivated them to write such a sensational book that is so irresponsible to history.  I hope they will share their archives and interview notes with the public someday so that we will know that this is actually a \\"history.\\"  People have been too transfixed by their extensive notes and bibliography, and too busy to check them out and show the extent to which much of this is virtually manufactured by their fertile and conspiratorial imaginations.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This DVD boxed set is the ultimate rendition of the original trilogy.   <br /> <br />The Dvds have great picture quality and sound and the changes fit well into the star wars universe. As a true \\"Star Wars Geek\\" i know more about the Star Wars universe than any of the people who have reviewed this DVD and to say <br /> <br />\\"Mos Eisley was supposed to be a dusty, deserted town. Tatooine is on the outer rim of the galazy. It's an unimportant, dusty, underpopulated planet. What I saw in the \\"Special Editions\\" was a thriving, well-populated town.\\" <br /> <br />IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE <br />Mos Eisley was supposed to be the capital city on the planet and the major starport on Tatooine. It is supposed to be a wretched hive of scum and villany, NOT A DESERTED TOWN. They were unable to fully bring the city to life in the original version and that is what they did.  <br /> <br />The movies are great, stop complaining because you do not enjoy change. Grow with the times.  <br />
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I enjoyed the movie Serenity (mostly the space ships) and then decided to check this out. I think it would have been more enjoyable had I seen the series first, but I didn't think the actors showed as much charisma in the TV show Firefly as they did in the movie Serenity. I like it enough to keep it for when stuck in bed with the flu, and really like the captain, but can see why it was cancelled. For Sci-Fi fans I would not miss it, especially if you are planning on getting Serenity the movie for your DVD collection too.
B000002UAR|5.0|Sorry for those who would like U2, Radiohead, Pink Floyd etc. etc. to have the number one,the throne this place only belongs to The Beatles, stop thinking about argumets why Floyd should be considered the greatest band or why U2 have allegedly done things that Beatles never did, sure,  marketing was the only thing that never Beatles used because it didnt existed at the time, or why Radiohead (according fake pseudointellectuals) is the real thing, stop wasting you energy guys!!!. <br /> <br />Revolver is the follow up to amazing \\"Rubber Soul\\" wich were an album that started a new chapter in contemporary music since albums became with its release collectible art pieces, Stones, Kinks , Who and a number of bands started to make conceptual albums after that.  <br /> <br />A mixture of different influences were put together in Revolver, Harrisons \\"love you too\\" included his love for sitar, Mcartneys \\"for no one\\" were recorded with a little orchestral ensamble, Lennons \\"im only sleeping\\" included experimental sound effects that never before were tried such as guitar riffs played straigth and recorded backwards in the final mix, Starrs \\"yellow submarine\\" is the first song for kids ever recorded by a rock band, after that Ringo became the children favorite Beatle, Lyrics were also an evidence of how gradually this four guys were in a maturity process, worried about the middle 60s convulsion due to the transition in the political and social world situation, lyrics reflect several issues, Taxes, politics but also sweet moments were included \\"and your bird can sing\\" , \\"good day sunshine\\" and philosophic crazy and funny ideas \\"Tomorrow never knows\\" a sentence that Ringo used to repeat often and Lennon found funny, Revolver is also a product of the experimentation with acids and game words that Lennon enjoyed to writte for those who liked to think that they could find hidden messages. <br /> <br />Revolver have been considered often the number one Beatles album of all time, i have those feelings for the white album but i support also those who think that this one is the deserver of that place, that could be too , why not? <br /> <br />HM

B00005JNJV|5.0|This is the best summer movie of 2005 (Star Wars excluded), this is the best Batman movie ever made, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman are all terrific and Christian Bale is the best Batman ever and even makes up for some weak performances in the supporting cast. The effects are flawless in this movie. I highly recommend this movie.
B00005JNEI|1.0|It strikes me as extremely odd that anyone can hate Bush that much. Oh, all right, we all have our idiosyncrasies, but this just tops it all. The very fact that Moore is willing to waste so much time and money one one president is just pointless. <br /> <br />I must admit, the information was presented very well. But it wa so carefully edited you started feeling that no one, and I mean no one, can be that bad. Also, I got a distinct feeling that too many of Bush's speeches were taken out of context in an attempt to ridicule him. <br />  I was also slighlty disturbed by some images shown in this movie. I have major problems with anyone using human pain to further his own cause, something that was done repeatedly and effectively in this movie. For instance, the images frm 9/11 were meant to channel your anger towards a carefully presented target-Bush. <br />  This  is an imformative movie, so long as you think for youurself and realize that this is just about as biased as it gets.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I can say without a doubt that this DVD was the most entertaining musical production I have ever heard or seen. Celtic Woman is made up of 4 singers and one fiddle player. Each of these women have exceptionally beautiful voices. Lisa Kelly performs a solo of \\"May It Be\\" from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Meav Ni Mhaolchatha does a wonderful job with \\"Danny Boy\\". Chloe Agnew sings \\"Walking of Air\\" to open the program, then does a beautiful job with \\"Someday\\". Chloe was only 15 when this was recorded in Dublin in 2004. I was astonished that someone so young could have such a powerful and beautiful voice. The women sing together on \\"Ornico Flow\\", \\"One World\\", \\"Somewhere\\", \\"You Raise Me Up\\", and \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\\". Orla Fallon does a nice job on the harp and sings with the other women. Mairead Nesbitt plays the fiddle and does a couple of instrumental numbers, \\"The Butterfly\\" and \\"Ashokan Farewell\\". Even though all of the women are solo artists, their singing together is truly amazing. This is a DVD that I will enjoy hearing over and over again. This DVD is very highly recommended. I would give it more than 5 stars if that were allowed. It's that good and well worth the amazon.com price!

B000055ZB8|4.0|The accounts of the making of NOSFERATU are fascinating.  I had known of the film ever since my college days in the '70s but have never gotten a chance to see it until Halloween Eve of 2005.  I had seen some Murnau in film classes I took back in the day (SUNRISE and THE LAST LAUGH come to mind) and have always been curious about this \\"original horror film,\\" which many have described as the definitive DRACULA, despite the apparently cosmetic changes made since the Stoker estate refused Murnau the rights to the novel. <br /> <br />Undeterred Murnau proceeded to change names to protect those guilty of copyright violation and pretty much adhered to the outlines of the classic novel.  And in the felicitously (?) named Max Schreck, he pretty much found the personification of the Lord of the Undead.  The first time I ever saw a movie still from NOSFERATU, I was already creeped out beyond measure.  This was no vaguely comic Bela Lugosi figure.  This was the stuff nightmares are made of.  No cartoonized Nosferatu creature would ever grace an American cereal box... <br /> <br />Of course one grows more jaded and, one hopes, less easily spooked over time.  In the years since I first learned of NOSFERATU and actually getting around to seeing the legendary film, I've certainly sat through enough would-be shockers to find out that I'm no longer so easily shocked.  Another reviewer posted (apparently jokingly) a tale of how he got his five year old to watch NOSFERATU with him and  how she has been spooked ever since.  That would be disturbing were it true. We know how THE WIZARD OF OZ's flying monkeys and oversized talking heads can instill nightmares in a child of that age, and we can only imagine what this landmark of Expressionistic horror film would do to one so young.  <br /> <br />Or for that matter, what it would do to an audience in 1922.  Even those of us who are not film historians (merely buffs or even casual fans) have a sense of how differently we perceive film in the21st century than our forebears did 100 years ago (or a bit less).  We study a film like this as much as we experience it--perhaps moreso.  \\"Ah yes, he's using slow motion here, speeding up the film there, and here's some early use of double exposure.\\"  By admiring the film and its place in history, we are able to distance ourselves from the horror elements. <br /> <br />Until we close our eyes at night, that is.   <br />

What are the hidden skills and 'instincts' that let some folks excel at snap judgments.  What are the key bits of information that go into a correct decision and how do they differ from popular misconceptions about how people really decide?<br /><br />With a wealth of real-world case studies, Gladwell takes us from food tasters to the insurance industry and the military.  Good prose and an eye for the captivating anecdote and key detail make Mr. Gladwell a top author.<br /><br />You will enjoy this book and may be unable to put it down.  Go make a snap decision to buy it!

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|I was absolutely ecstatic to finally get a copy of McLINTOCK in a collector's edition and in fully restored, widescreen format.  This is a movie that just cannot be appropriately viewed in full screen. Be sure to get this authorized version as previous DVD versions suffered in presentation format and quality.<br /><br />And McLINTOCK is a John Wayne classic, one that absolutely belongs in any comprehensive Western collection.  Some of Wayne's greatest lines and scenes are here.  But, hey, why limit it to Wayne?  McLINTOCK has arguably some of the best Western moments to be found anywhere in the genre.<br /><br />The movie is hailed as a comedy but don't get the wrong impression.  No, this isn't BLAZING SADDLES or RUSTLER'S RHAPSODY.  There are lighter moments, yes, like the clay slide fight and Maureen O'Hara's romp down main street in nothing but her bloomers.  But then there is also John Wayne's touching scene with Stephanie Powers, who plays his daughter Becky, when he explains to her his take on life.  There's also the scene where Wayne speaks for a group of captured and imprisoned Comanche chiefs.  His words are as applicable today as they were when the movie was made or, more to the point, in the context of period in which this movie is set.<br /><br />And a classic Western deserves nothing short of a classic cast. In that regard McLINTOCK comes through in spades.  In addition to Wayne as the irrepressible George Washington McLintock, Maureen O'Hara is perfect as Kathryn McLintock, McLintock's estranged wife.  Stephanie Powers is wonderful as McLintock's daughter Becky while Wayne's real-life son, Patrick, stars as Powers' love interest, Devlin Warren. Add to that group Hank Worden, Chill Wills, and Yvonne DeCarlo and your in for Western entertainment at its finest.<br /><br />The only drawback with this DVD (and certainly not sufficient to tarnish the film itself or my rating of 5 stars) was a Special Features interview with Maureen O'Hara.  I was totally shocked at the arrogance displayed by Ms. O'Hara in discussing her abilities as an actress.  While she remains Wayne's very finest leading lady, I was stunned at her lack of class in the interviews.<br /><br />THE HORSEMANally shocked at the arrogance displayed by Ms. O'Hara in discussing her abilities as an actress.

B000002J2B|5.0|I remember way back when as a 8 year old all my older brothers and cousins all getting into Genesis, Yes, Elp, it was all very impacting on my life as well, even as young as I was...Of all the Genesis catalogue, this one in particular did something for me. The cover, the music, the melancholy mood of it all just blew me away. Everyone talked about Trick of the Tale as the best post-Gabriel album, but for myself, Wind in the Wuthering was the logical next album for this band, the continuation of the magic, not Trick of the Tail. What I loved about Genesis to begin with, the old of course, was that they were the most melodic of the prog bands. I suppose one can argue that Banks was Genesis because of all those amazing arangements. Those lush melotron chords, the eerie moods on all those albums, but the Rutherford Hackett team, Gabriel and Phil Collins-whose drum work is unparalleled-what amazing contributions...From Foxtrot on thru Wind Genesis was just composing some of the most amazing music I have ever heard. Trick of the Tail was a very popular, but very popish album. I used to associate- all the time -the old Genesis sound as ancient music that resurfaced for this day and age. I mean, Blood on the Rooftops, did you not feel like you were in the same room as the orator, waiting on that cup of tea? How ingenious those lyrics were. The beginning of 11th Earl of Marr and the 2nd part of the instrumental on the second side sound like something not of this time...not to blab on, but What was to be the last story telling, gripping musically Genesis was this album. Hackett's intro to blood on the rooftops could never have fit better on any other album, any other song at any other time. If Banks did say it was his favourite Genesis album, I would concur.. there is so much mystery and mood in this release. And like someone else reviewed, that cover just completes the picture. It is sad this music went away like it did. I always felt cheated by them, at least past Duke. These guys are so incredibly talented and I bet they still could do this kind of music. Well, so I am in that column of those who did not enjoy the later Genesis. But for those who love the old, who have not embraced Wind and the Wuthering, even unto this day, check this out. By the Time Wot Gorilla finishes, and the rest of the album starts to play out, I think you will find yourself as entranced as I have been since I was 8. Where does mood like this ever find it's way on an album these days...\\"Wind..\\" is phenominal and the first/last great post Gabriel Genesis. it's almost 20 years to the day, and like a classic read, Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, it never ceases to deliver...\\"Let's skip the news boy, I'll go make that tea....the arabs and the jews boy, too much for me...\\" <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|YES! Now I can came closer to anyone with a Batman movie and say \\"THIS is Batman\\". I know that because of the lack of interest of some people for comic books and the lack of interest of the previous directors to make a decent Batman movie, many people got the wrong impression about the big bat man all these years. But believe me, like it, or not, THIS is the REAL Batman!!<br /><br />Dark, misterious, cursed with his fathers' death, a man without fear of make justice at any cost. A man that trained his phisic, mind, a great criminologist, detective, scientist, fighter, THIS was the Batman that we waited to see all these years on the big screen.<br /><br />That's very interesting something that Goyer did, in get elements from the firts Batman comics in the late 60's and 70's (Bob Kane, Bill Finger, Denny O'Neal, Neal Adams), like the Wayne family getting off of a Opera House, and the new writers, like Frank Miller (Batman Year One, Dark Knight). The movie is trully inspired on the story in the comic Batman Year One, but most of the time centered on Bruce Wayne/Batman. The vehicle was inspired on the famous minisserie Dark Knight, published in the beginning of the 80's.<br /><br />There's no doubt about it! Christian Bale IS Bruce Wayne/Batman! He was conscientious that he had to play three roles in the movie. The Batman, the playboy Bruce Wayne and the real Bruce Wayne. His voice tone demonstrate what role he was playing at the moment. TERRIFIC!! He got the right spirit and idea behind the complex mind of his character and did an amazing job! He became to be what Christopher Reeve was for Superman! And I would be very unjust to not mention others like Michael Caine (Alfred), Gary Oldman (James Gordon), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) that did great jobs as well.<br /><br />Definitely, this is the REAL and only one adaptation from Batman to the movies. Forget about all the CRAP of the old ones. Batman Begins HERE!!<br /><br />THE DARK KNIGHT RIDES AGAIN!!
0385504209|2.0|Not unlike how many scholars claim that Nostradamus predicted major world events like WWII and lesser publicized, yet supremely significant ones like OPERATION PSEUDO MIRANDA (see best-seller of the same name), what makes this epic-fiction so enthralling is its seamless weave into the fabric of theological history.  Not unlike the two events referenced above, this tale has us trusting and disbelieving what we know to be true about history in an almost rhythmic, reciprocating manner, consistent with the interwoven method of the author's storytelling.  What is extracted from history and what is culled from the author's imagination becomes blurred as Brown deftly manipulates the reader with taught knitting and artificial texturing.  Even though the writing is somewhat pedestrian, Brown's wily method of storytelling would make a flimflam man blush.<br /><br />This is a marginal recommendation for me because I felt it was deliberately misleading, if not downright chicanery.  The book referenced above, however, is a strong recommendation for its surreal, yet brutally honest approach

B0002YJ29O|5.0|What's wrong with pianists having fun? I own a copy of this dvd, and I have to say it's a thrill to see pianists playing with so much JOY and so obviously enjoying themselves. Piano playing doesn't have to be dry, grim, and determined all the time. There are Beethoven sonatas for that. The performances are top rate--how can it be otherwise, with Martha Argerich, Kissin, Levine, Ax, and other name-droppables on the line. Plus, the Happy Birthday variations ROCK! A must-have for all piano enthusiasts.
B000AARKO4|5.0|After a few negative comments (esp. about the acting ability of Orland Bloom) I wondered about this one, but decided to purchase it anyway and I am very pleased that I did.  People ought to give the young man a break.  Not only is he exceedingly handsome, he isn't that bad of an actor.  He does well with the few lines of script that he has been given.  His facial expressions tell all and that is what he had to work with.  This is a good movie with much to interest those who enjoy history. We can only learn from history and we should pursue it.  Ridly Scott really worked to make this as historically accurate as possible and he lets us know (in the great accompanying book) just where he padded a character out to give it more in the movie.  There is a lot of violence (but there was then), very little bad language, nothing else too objectionable.  I am glad to add this one to my movie collection.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I was so disturbed when the box office figures were revealed. This R.S. outing was outragiously condemed but we're living in American Idol times. America's so doomed. BUY THIS DVD and make it up to R.S.!
6300271145|5.0|This is one of my handful of all-time favorites-and I think awarding the Oscar to Paul Newman for 'The Color Of Money' because  <br />he didn't get one for 'The Hustler' is a boxing robbery in the worst sense;real life-and all time great tenor sax player Dexter Gordon's portrayal of an expatriate tenor sax player Dale Turner living in Paris was in a class by itself.The film is dedicated to sax player Lester Young and pianist Bud Powell and is based on the book 'Dance of the Infidels' by Francis Paudras about his relationship with his idol Powell,a genius with mental problems-and by any standard,one of the top few jazz pianists,ever.I still think they should award Dexter Gordon an Oscar,posthumously.
0316777722|1.0|After reading the rave reviews in the front of the book, and then the glowing reviews on here, I thought I was in for a treat, especially since I love humorous books. Unfortunately, this humor wasn't for me. I found the writing self-absorbed and tedious. I didn't need to find a private place to read it since I didn't laugh out loud once. I struggled to get to the end. The first chapters were mildly amusing, but it was a slow tortuous roll downhill after that. To compare this to the writings of Mark Twain is to gravely insult Mr. Twain. Luckily, everyone has different tastes and different things tickle different funny bones, but my funny bone remained untouched by this collection.
B0000399WC|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES.I MUST HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE 20 TIMES.THE PICTURE QUALITY IS TOP NOTCH. THE SOUND IS EXCELLENT CINEMATOLOGY SECOND TO NONE.WHAT A MOVIE 5 STAR RATED
B0000CD5FN|3.0|Yeah, this song alone is worth the purchase. I just got this and I have listened to it several times.  I could do without the Bob Marley cover on the disc; however, overall this is a good CD. I think that it will only get better with a few more listens.

B0007PICEO|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I own.  I listen to it so much, I'm afraid I'll burn a hole in the CD.  Excellent for women in their 20s.  Good soft beats and harsher rock.  Enjoy!
B000BC8TBE|5.0|I truly believe that Mariah Carey has proven to the world that she's a true legend. I think Sony Music is doing the right thing for re-release this album after so many years, because it reminds  people who forgot how great this album was, and to introduce this holiday album to the younger generation.     The songs in this album are really great, Mariah's vocal is simply stunning, and she capture the emotion & the essence of the songs perfectly, it's beautiful, graceful, and exquisite. I believe calling this album a good Christmas album is a little bit understated because I personally believe this is one of the BEST Christmas album I've ever heard! Every tracks got its own charm to draw you in! Please believe me!    With a extra DVD that's full of Mariah's Christmas video, and the original Christmas Album, I have to say it worth every penny of it! By the way, if you wanna buy a great Christmas gift and still don't have a clue what to buy, I suggest you buy this Christmas album.     This is 'The Certification of Xmas', if you doesn't have this CD playing in your CD Player during Christmas, I'm sure your holiday won't be as colourful and wonderful as mine!
B000001GKC|5.0|Several early Amazon reviewers treated this Bruckner Seventh, which was released posthumously after Karajan's death in 1989, as if it foreshadows an old man's passing. But this isn't a slow or reflectively melancholy reading--in fact, the first movement is quicker (if only marginally) than Karajan's two previous recordings for EMI and DG, both with the Berlin Phil. By comparison, the Vienna Phil. sounds sweeter, never bombastic, incapable of a brash phrase. The recording sounds so alive and present that one could swear it was a concert performance, but apparently it wasn't. In any case, the orchestral execution is more animated and fresher sounding than on Karajan's two previous readings.<br /><br />The conductor always favored whispering pianissimos and thunderous, though controlled, fortissimos. Here those contrasts are reduced; The music tends to stay in an average dynamic range until a climactic swell is called for. This evenness of tone gives the reading a flowing quality, which is enhanced by Karajan's refusal to use the start-and-stop phrasing so common with other conductors in Bruckner.  The great slow movement is especially free and spontaneous, not at all funereal even if the composer was moved by Wagner's recent death. This memorial to his greatest hero is sublime rather than grieving.<br /><br />With so many special qualities, it's hard not to declare that this is Karajan's greatest Bruckner Seventh recording. In terms of freshness and a singing line, only the live Giulini performance from London (on BBC Legends) comes close to it in my experience. Highly, highly recommended.<br /><br />P.S. May, 2009 - For anyone who's interested, I've added a more detailed comparison among Karajan's three Bruckner Sevenths in the comments section. It pleases me that so many five-star reviews have accumulated in the passing years.
B00005JLO2|5.0|I know that there are a lot of mixed reviews for a number of reasons, and as every has there own taste so do directors and actors.<br /><br />What I like about this film is the fact that unlike the previous versions there is more consideration for the peoples who were native to the Sudan.  As someone who descends from an area in the world where the British colonized and caused instability to the region I think that it is important to put this as a part of the context of such a movie.<br /><br />I also fealt that the actors all did well in the film.  More could have been done to stress Harry's reasons for being afraid, and also his mind set that made him decide to go to the Sudan and seek out his friends.  Yet, had this been done it may have caused the movie to be to slow.  That is because much of the advertisements paint the film as a desert epic, and taking to long to get to the desert may have caused problems with the story line.<br /><br />All in all, if you are not relying on a comparison between previous versions, and you are willing to allow this movie to stand on its own as a perspective of the book you may enjoy this one.
B000058983|5.0|I challenge any fan of classic rock to find a ballad prettier than \\"Andmoreagain\\" with it's moaning cellos, airy cool arrangement and aching vocals. \\"Forever....\\" is worth owning for that one song alone, but this freeflowing, acoustic based outpouring of melodic treasures is perfect from start to finish.<br /><br />Criminally overlooked for decades, it's finally getting the praise and attention from listeners it deserves. A true masterpiece.
0451529308|5.0|This is a book that once you read it you will never forget it. It is a timeless tale of 4 sisters and their struggle through life. When I read this book I started thinking about the charecters and thinkng would Jo do this or I wish I was more like Beth. Every girl needs to read this book even if you hate to read you neee to read this book. You wont be sorry.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Their music is catchy (its like a blend of metal, emo, punk, with loads of gothicky makeup and dressing to accompany the singing!) Their singer is just charismatic - at first when I watched an MTV of theirs, I thought he was overly-dramatic, but I once stayed on watching a half=hour clip on Kerraang! TV showcasing portions of their live concert and they had a really good energy going on onstage. The singer actually came across to me as a very very convincing stage presence - he's dramatic, but he never lets it go - he's exactly what you see, and more. He actually seems pretty smart and a great showsman. <br />  <br />They have a kind of appeal which might originally attract more teenage fans than anything... but I bet even older fans will catch on to their music once they've gotten a taste of them.  Most songs on the album are good and they will definitely grow on you as you listen to it more often, but some really stand out to me. I especially love Helena, Ghost of You, Cemetery Drive, and of course their very famous single I'm Not Okay (I Promise).
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Oshii said in an interview that when his budget is modest he concentrates on the story. When the budget is generous he concentrates on the visuals. As the second installment of GIS, you would think that they gave the man a blank cheque. I mean, the art in this movie is unmatched by anything I've seen before. <br /> <br />One problem with the DVD is that I don't speak Japaneese. Or maybe that's my problem. I dunno. I can't wait to learn an advanced language before watching this flick so trying to get my due share of the amazing artwork in this movie while reading the script was a burden, to say the least. So I watched the movie quite a few times to get the jist of the story. Now I just watch the damn graphics and translate the gibberish in my head. An interesting experience for a small mind like mine. <br /> <br />Anyway... <br /> <br />This movie is even better after you've read Oshii's interview about what the movie is REALLY about. I mean, a movie about a man with a body in love with a woman without a body is about one hundred years ahead of any American mainstream movie. A dog as a surrogate companion, a doll as a surrogate body, or no...it's humans who now have surrogate bodies. Or something like that. Eitherway, putting humans, dogs and dolls in the same philosophical line-up makes for some pretty good speculation.  <br />Batou, the movies main character is a melancholy cyborg who just got finished looking all over the city for his dog (see \\"The Long Goodbye\\" Novella) and now wants to find a woman he loves who exists only as \\"consciousness\\". The whole gyroid detective thing is either just a job or one hell of a metaphor. Oshii says he wants to make movies no one has ever seen before. Mission accomplished. <br /> <br />Next mission: re-release this damn thing in English!!!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Do not listen to the kid below, jusdging by his \\"must buy\\" albums, he has very little knowledge of good music.  This album is Nightwish's best thus far.  I think many people (including myself) were left wanting a bit more from preivous releases.  They were no doubt good, but not really as heavy as I would have liked.  I think things started to change when Marco joined the band as Century Child is much closer to the sound of this album than the other ones.  It's probably that he's just a more dynamic bass player than  the other guy.  The addition of the full orchestra really takes the atmosphere and epicness to a new level.  Every song is just a wall of sound although my absolute faves would be Nemo, The Siren, and Dead Gardens.  All in all this album is a masterpiece truly showcasing the talent of this great band from Finland.  This is a must buy
0385334206|5.0|\\"Celia had committed suicide, for instance, - by eating Drano - a mixture of sodium hydroxide, Celia became a small volcano.\\" The essence of Vonnegut's style is in that line. He's blunt yet rather casual. If you can get past this voice devoid of classical description you will thoroughly enjoy his themes and storytelling....well...as long as you can get past his story telling style. There's really no structure (at least for what most teachers consider to be structure) and the lines are scattered. But once delved into his stories, just like his style, are very original.  Breakfast of Champions centers around Vonnegut, the narrator, going insane at 50, a car salesman, Dwayne Hoover also going crazy and Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut's brainchild, at the whim of the delirious men who's chemicals are self destructing. The themes are pretty typical for Vonnegut ..... technology = bad, dehumanization and ..... and his newest of looking back on society with a babies eye and realizing how ludicrous everything is. As in \\"Sometimes people would put holes in famous people so they could be at least fairly famous, too. Sometimes people would get on airplanes that were supposed to fly to someplace, and they would offer to put holes in the pilot and co-pilot unless they flew the airplane, to someplace else.\\" No matter how \\"modern\\" But, if one thing truly stands out in Vonnegut (which I'm sure has been said a million times before) is that he's a satirical genius. Who isn't up for a bit of flag-bashing anyways? (Flag in the sense of everything that we stand for and squander)
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Peter Jackson has been re-creating a lost scene from the original 1933 King Kong while working on his $292 million remake.  <br /> <br />The result - a six-minute scene in which a dinosaur chases men on to a log, then Kong throws them into a pit where they are attacked by giant spiders and crabs - will appear in a restored version of the 1933 film to be released on DVD in three weeks.  <br /> <br />The scene was filmed in 1933, but cut because director Merian Cooper thought it slowed the film's pace.  <br /> <br />Other than two pre-production sketches and one photograph, no remnant of the legendary \\"missing spider pit sequence\\" has ever been found.  <br /> <br />Jackson, who cites the original film as the reason he became a film-maker, decided to reshoot the missing sequence.  <br /> <br />He hired Hollywood director and screenwriter Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption) - and veteran make-up and special-effects whiz Rick Baker, who played Kong in the 1976 remake, to help. Jackson directed and edited the six minutes and it has been inserted into the original film with careful weaving of music, visual effects and the right black-and-white film grain, so it appears as it was shot in 1933.  <br /> <br />Though Jackson's King Kong relies on state-of-the-art visual effects to create the giant ape, he deliberately used the same techniques film-makers used in the early 1930s for visual effects. The work included stop-motion cameras, miniature environments, rear screen projection and glass matte paintings. <br /> <br />Jackson has emulated old black-and- white film techniques before. Some people were fooled into believing silent film footage for his mockumentary Forgotten Silver was real when it aired on television in 1995.
B000AGTPUA|4.0|Good In Theater, was with a child. Was enjoyed by both of us.
B000005RU2|5.0|After hearing Highway Star I have to say this is one of the greatest recordings I have ever heard. Perhaps the greatest. Deep Purple had the perfect rock intonation and dynamics that one expects from a band, but their musical intelligence, their sense of abandon, and their intense and continuous concentration was extraordinary. The recording is technically perfect with appropriate channel separation. It sounds like the mix was done by a technical expert.<br /><br />Other highlights on MIJ are Child In Time, Smoke On The Water, Strange Kind Of Woman, Lazy, Space Truckin' and the bonus disc includes the great Black Night encore. I can not believe this band isn't in the rock and roll hall of fame?! What a joke.<br /><br />Buy now!
B000AL5OZA|5.0|Agnetha's producer on this album is Eric Stewart, who had previously been a member of the Mindbenders in the sixties and 10cc in the seventies. He wrote two songs (I won't be leaving you, Save me why don't you) and co-wrote another (I won't let you go) with Agnetha. The album also includes songs by Jeff Lynne (One way love) and Justin Hayward (The angels cry, with Justin playing guitars on the track). There is an eighties feel to the album but the synthesizers never take over (though they come close to doing so occasionally, notably on Click track) - the focus is always on Agnetha's outstanding voice. Of course, this makes it impossible to listen to the album without hearing echoes of Abba and that may be a distraction to some people.<br /><br />Whereas Agnetha's previous solo album (Wrap your arms around me) had yielded three minor UK hits, no singles from this album made the UK charts although I assume that some did in other European countries. Nevertheless, there are many excellent tracks here, especially the first five (One way love, Eyes of a woman, Just one heart, I won't let you go, The angels cry) and the last two (I keep turning off lights, We move as one).<br /><br />This album is unlikely to appeal to anybody who doesn't like Abba, so don't worry about this until you've got a significant collection of Abba music. If you enjoy Abba's music enough to be interested in exploring further, you might enjoy this album although not all Abba fans love this album as much as I do.
B000002C2E|5.0|I know the buzz is always around Blood on the Tracks or Blonde on Blonde... In my opinion Time out of Mind is probably one of the top 10 albums - by any artist or band -  ever!  <br />Dylan sounds ragged and tired and the songs get stuck in your head...
B000AMPZGC|5.0|Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is a follow-up to Nightmare Before Christmas. This soundtrack is Danny Elfman's greatest work in quite a long while. The music sounds like a dark musical and is bouncy, atmospheric and moody. Listen to \\"According to Plan\\" sung by Brit actors Albert Finney and Joanna Lumley. They perfectly capture the ironic statement that the living Victorian people, with their austerity, repression and fastidious obscessions with mores and etiquette, are dull and more dead than alive while the dead in the Underworld are a jolly, raucous bunch. Danny Elfman, from the 80's group Oingo-Boingo, plays a Singing Skeleton and has genuine fun singing \\"Remains of the Day\\" which recounts the tale of the jilted and murdered Corpse Bride. Victor's Piano and the Piano Duet are romantic piano pieces and modern classical music. I even mistook it for some classical piece when I first heard it. This is a great soundtrack but I can't wait until the DVD release.
B000000W5L|5.0|In all honesty, I probably played Beggars, Ya-Ya's and Sticky Finger more than Exile... But Exile feels so loose and represents true rock 'n' roll probably better than any disc past or present by any other artist or band. <br />The Stones truly are and will ALWAYS be \\"The Greatest Rock & Roll Band Ever\\"!
B000BBOUU4|3.0|It was a good film but not great. i found the direction to be great and the visuals to be great. The acting my Depp wasa great as Willy Wonka and all the kids did a great job. The story is where it fell i did not like all the flash back scene's and it did not show enough of the factory. I wish they would not focus as much on Charlie and his life and focus more on the factory. It seemend right when they got to the factory they fast forward the movie and it went by fast. The score was another good thing about the movie but I did not liek the ompa lompa's. Overall the movie was good but not great.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|This is what a live album should be like. Its raw, pure, aggresive and it shows no mercy. What sets this aside from most live albums is the fact it is not made to re-create the studio albums and its contains songs from a dozen different shows including, Dallas,TX; Singapore; Phoneix,AZ and more. The drum solo is also just amazing and to here Skin Ticket (which has never been played live) and Iowa is just awesome. Plus they throw in some rare songs like Eeyore, Purity and Get This. This is a must own for any true SLIPKNOT fan. One of my fav albums now and it just came out today.

B000AYEIZY|5.0|When groups get together after many years apart, you have to wonder whether or not the memories will be better than the current reality.  Especially so when a group such as Cream comes back.  They were, and are the apex of what a power trio is.   <br /> <br />When I received this as a gift, I let it sit on my shelf for a couple of days before playing it, and now it hasn't been out of my changer in nearly a month.  Ginger Baker's power behind his drum kit is undiminished; Jack Bruce still not only plays bass with a passion, but his voice is in wonderful shape, even tho a little ragged around the edges it sounds well lived in.  What I was concerned about, funny enough, was Clapton.  After years of mostly slickly produced rock/pop albums (his blues albums are anotherr topic entirely), could he go back and capture the old slowhand magic?  The answer is yes; his guitar has the old bite and sting that i remember; the notes soar and growl. <br /> <br />The production is very clean, and the blues influences shine though.  This is a great momento of these concerts.  if you like \\"classic rock\\", the blues, and live albums you should add this to your collection
B00005JOGU|5.0|Bennett Miller's \\"Capote\\" is a somber, compelling film about the Faustian bargain that Truman Capote, the most celebrated American writer of the 1960s, made with himself. Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) became fascinated by the murder of the Clutter family in rural Kansas from the moment he read about it in the New York Times, and Dan Futterman's spare, incisive screenplay shows how the writing of what became \\"In Cold Blood\\" became both the making and the unmaking of him. A master manipulator in his life as well as his writing, Capote insinuated his way into the good graces of the police, the witnesses and eventually the perpetrators, saying and doing exactly what he needed to--even lying outright--to get the information he needed to write the book. We all know what happened to the murderers, Dick Hickok and Perry Smith, so it's revealing no secrets to say that Capote didn't do everything he could to help Smith, to whom he was enormously drawn, with his appeals, although he promised to do so. As Capote told his confidante Harper Lee, \\"It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. When we grew up, he left by the back door, and I went out the front.\\" Yet when it came to the choice between helping a friend and having the ending for his book, the ruthless side of his nature took over. And it destroyed him as surely as it destroyed Smith. There are fine supporting performances throughout \\"Capote\\"--Clifton Collins Jr. as Smith, Catherine Keener as Lee, Chris Cooper as FBI agent Alvin Dewey, Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy. But Hoffman, as Capote, dominates the film with a performance that flows from him like water. Of course he captures Capote's ultra-distinctive voice and mannerisms to perfection; but, having done so, he folds them within himself, and builds on them to show the tortured, conflicted soul underneath. Particularly at the end, Hoffman's performance is heartbreaking; Capote--basically a decent man without the moral strength to stand up to the worst part of his own nature, has no second act prepared after \\"In Cold Blood,\\" and no solace except the bottle. Hoffman's performance goes beyond being a tour de force, to become one of the truly unforgettable and indispensable performances of the last decade.tand up to the worst part of his own nature, has no second act prepared after \\"In Cold Blood,\\" and no solace except the bottle.

0156027321|2.0|...no matter how ennobling or inspiring a story may be.<br /><br />Ultimately, a story has to correspond to reality.  The central question in 'Life of Pi' is that of the \\"better story\\".  Well, the 'Star Wars' saga is one of the best stories ever told, but it is only so because it so vividly displays the value of discerning good from evil, struggling for a good cause, camaraderie, and recognizing a spiritual power greater than oneself.  As pointed out by many before me, it is told as a 'myth' - it's not meant to be internalized as Truth.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />I'm not sure where Martel is coming from, but I think with 'Life of Pi' he wants to think he's created a delightful ambiguous story that is so well-crafted and so well-balanced that any conclusions the reader draws during the fateful third part (the end of the story) is derived entirely from their own presuppositions.  Or perhaps he really does think he's created a story that inspires the skeptics, forcing them to reconsider their stance; but if he does think that, then I think he's failed.  Why?  Because other readers seem to think the 'human' story is more likely the true one (not forgetting that it's all fictional, of course, which is going to be my point later).<br /><br />The problem is this: Martel's main story (with the tiger, zebra, etc.) is a set-up.  The story with the animals in the boat on the sea is rendered in exquisite detail.  It's incredible, but not completely impossible.  UNTIL THE ISLAND.  And then, the story gets far too fantastic.  We keep reading because the island story is imaginative, but it's impossible - given the parameters established in the book's Part I.  Part I tells us that this is a story set in the 'real world' (although the comical scene with Pi and three clergymen is far-fetched on its face, but it is possible certainly).  And it's not just that the island (and the things that happen on it, such as the hoop-jumping) is fanciful stuff.<br /><br />Another reader mentioned in an online forum that the island represents the end of the story and the 'loss of innoncence' upon hearing the other version.  Once we hear the 'other version', yes, that does correspond better with what we know from our experience in this world that it's more plausible.  And so, what do we do now with the 'version with the animals'?  Do we say, as the author apparently wants those \\"who can believe\\" to say, \\"hey you have to have faith\\"?  Or, \\"the animal version is so detailed, so inspiring, so ennobling, so full of wonder, that I choose to believe\\"?  Rubbish!  And the bones in the boat that may be meerkat bones (as my wife pointed out to me)?  That, to me, is the proof - but not that the 'animal version' is correct.  No, they're the proof that Martel wants to have it both ways, in other words (specifically, my wife's), there is all this evidence that 'A' and also 'Not A' are equally valid options at the same time.<br /><br />Look, I can dig some elements of postmodernism, but religious narratives (at least in the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic strains) are rooted in history.  Speaking as a Christian - the resurrection of Jesus is a non-negotiable.  Christianity is worthless if the only value of the resurrection is that it provides people with an inspiring story of personal transformation.  Why?  Because if the grave could not be conquered, then there truly is no hope for us as a human race.<br /><br />The 'animal version' goes past the point of credulity because if there truly were such a thing as the island then we would have found it by now.  And Pi's 'animal version' is not analagous to religious narrative because not only could it not be attested to by many witnesses, but also because, in the end, it is ultimately meaningless.  No Spirit could give life to those words (even if they were not fictional, WHICH OF COURSE THEY ARE).

B00008S2VG|1.0|OK, let the unhelpful votes begin but at least read before you vote!  This is not an attack on the artist like a lot of reviews I have read - and reported.  I have followed Madonna since I was 17.  Her first hit - with me and the clubs was Everybody.  Since then I have enjoyed her many offerings.  Ok, so Frozen got old really quick but here Ray Of Light album was still a nice listen even though we find Madonna trotting off into the electronica (dance meets new age) arena.  For Music, she sort of returns to more of what she is known for but bringing in electronica.<br /><br />As for American Life, it IS NOT the lyrics that I am so much up in arms about - but don't even get me started on her American Rap, I cringe at that! - it's the lifeless musical arrangements that are awful.  It has been called electro-pop or techno, well I have heard better techno.  Staying with the 'Music' arrangement styles would have been better as this sounds too robotic and mechanical and, as another reviewer said, simple.<br /><br />Madonna has always been known for getting controversial, so the fact that American Life - the single raised hell once again is nothing new.<br /><br />Madonna, please return to your dance-pop roots or perhaps try some rock alternative like you did in your \\"Pre-Madonna\\" demo... but I guess it was not rock alternative back then.<br /><br />This just in: Confessions on a Dancefloor is said to be a return to her earlier styles.  I hope so!  Nov 15th can't get here fast enough!
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I wonder how I would have felt if I didn't read the novel first. I absolutely loved the book's storyline and horrific mood, and expected something like that in the movie as well. But, to be honest, I was disappointed. Too much romance and too little horror! The story got a little confusing as Christine got abducted and somehow re-appeared with zero explanations. Also, I expected to see much more difficulties in Raoul's way as he goes after Erik to save Christine. In the movie, he pretty much just walks right into the realm of the Phantom of the Opera. Frankly, the Phantom does not have enough power to make the film interesting and understandable(excuse my lack of better words). <br />As for the \\"humanized\\" Phantom, I felt sorry for him in the book even after all his evil deeds. I personally don't think the film producers had to make him all THAT pitiable. <br /> <br />Well... I guess these things happen when people try to materialize at least half-fantastical novels. <br /> <br />One thing I loved from the movie: music! I mean, it's impossible for books to have these beautiful music and songs, so the songs got stuck in my head right away. Now I really wish to watch the musical someday!
B0007M22TI|1.0|First I'd like to say that these womyn have lovely voices.  That being said however, I have to say that this is one of the most boring, vapid, souless performances I have ever seen! <br /> <br />It was almost like Celtic Muzak!  And they even had the nerve to take one of the Divine Sarah's songs, Nella Fantasia, which she convinced the composer to allow her to turn into a song, and take all the passion and pathos that Sarah's voice brings to it and turn it into a real yawner! <br /> <br />It was kind of like watching a group of lovely robots with perfect voices sing. <br /> <br />The only song I even came close to liking is You Raise Me Up, which seems to be the only song that is sung with any feeling!
0802130208|5.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is one of those books you could read several times in a row and each time it would grow progressively funnier, like a wine grows progressively more flavorful. It is one of those books you could flip through, find a random passage to read, and immediately find yourself laughing. It is a hilarious story, to be certain, but the greatest thing about it isn't necessarily its abundant humor. The greatest thing about it is the genuine literary power it contains. It isn't just about cheap laughs. It's a novel, a profoundly well told story that exposes the extraordinary talent of its author as much as the author's sense of humor.  <br /> The main character, Ignatius J Reilly, is the spoiled, arrogant, pompous result of bad parenting and too much free time. He fancies himself a scholarly intellectual, capable of more scholastic achievements and philosophical breakthroughs than anyone else in New Orleans, when in reality he is an unemployed, frustrated college dropout whose only real passion is the lute. Some of the book's more hilarious moments are the confrontations between Ignatius and his mother, whom he still lives with at the tender age of 35. His mother, having decided that Ignatius's overwhelming lack of motivation is beyond her control, is discovering life again. She's going out, having fun, meeting people - destroying her worldview, as Ignatius would say. And Ignatius, having decided that the world is utterly incapable of digesting his gargantuan intellect, is flailing in a string of bad jobs and failed attempts at manuscripts. Ignatius and his mother are prone to having massive arguments, so loud that the neighbors will shout through their living room windows at them, that usually end in Ignatius locking himself in his room with his lute and his wounded ego for hours on end.  <br /> While the story has a host of amusing characters, such as Patrolman Mancuso (determined to bust Ignatius on no grounds other than just general stupidity)and Levy Pants (Ignatius's disgruntled boss), the real enchantment of the story comes from something deeper, something stronger and maybe even tragic. Ignatius cannot find his place in the world and his mother has lost all hope. The city they live in is deteriorating, and even if its troubles are depicted in a comical manner, they are still present. The book may be a comedy, but it has the heart of a tragedy. As we discover at the end of the story, Ignatius is lonelier and even more lost than anyone could realize.   <br />

1932100385|5.0|Of course the usual meat & dairy advocates come on here, trying to claim that T. Colin Campbell has some sort of agenda.  Tell me, does he gain profits when people buy broccoli?  Vegans may care about animals, and you may call that an \\"agenda\\" if you wish, but it is hardly a monetary/profit-based agenda, and certainly people have and will become vegan for the animals and the environment, even if it's NOT the best diet for health (but fortunately for the vegans who eat a whole-foods diet, it is best for health). <br /> <br />I highly recommend the book for anyone seeking answers about how to become healthier.  One reviewer mentioned they \\"couldn't\\" give up \\"steak\\"/eating cows.  I guess you can depend on medications and drugs to keep your health in check if you want to consume such high cholesterol, saturated fat, excess protein items. <br /> <br />And to further refute the anti-soy, meat industry advocators, I'd defer to the studies of the American Cancer Society, the American Institute for Cancer Research, the American Obesity Assocation, the American Association of Diabetes Educators, the Cleveland Clinic, the Mayo Clinic, Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University, Northwestern University, and Tufts University.  I suppose those organizations and universities gain from sales of whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and fruit as well... <br /> <br />
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I went to see this in the theatres and was not expecting much. I could not stop laughing throughout the whole movie. The minute this became available on DVD I had to buy it. This is an instant classic and a must have for any DVD collection. I have watched this over and over again and have yet to get bored by it as there are so many small things going on it the background that you don't pick up on the first time.  <br />The acting is top quality from a great british cast. Its great to see two familiar faces from The Office appear in different roles. <br />The extras included in this DVD are great. Along with deleted scenes there are make-up test and auditions.  <br />I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in british comedies or zombies.
B00000099Y|5.0|Ænima... So much can be said about this epic release. Ænima in my opinion is Tool's best work. With the loss of their bassist Paul D'amour it's surprising that in 3 years, after the release of Undertow, the band can put together such a masterpiece. I love every single track on the album including my all time favorite \\"Pushit\\". The progressive nature of this album shows the detail the band puts into their work. Each track has its own truly unique sound. The progressiveness in Ænima can be shown by how tracks are linked together with segue's making it one big song. Some may call these \\"filler\\" tracks but personally I think they just add to the music. Tool is about atmosphere and that is definitely what this cd is comprised of. My song ratings are below... (Excluding segue's) <br /> <br />1. Stinkfist - 10/10  <br />2. Eulogy - 10/10  <br />3. H. - 10/10 <br />5. Forty Six And 2 - 10/10    <br />7. Hooker With A Penis - 10/10 <br />9. Jimmy - 10/10 <br />10. Die Eier Von Satan - 9.5/10   <br />11. Pushit - *11/10    <br />13. Aenema - 10/10  <br />15. Third Eye - 10/10 <br /> <br />If you are into Alternative Metal, Progressive Metal, or just enjoy good music you should own this album. It's probably one of the best rock albums of the 90's. Not to mention the cool looking cover art. Ænima should surely be known as the highlight of Tool's career.
B0002OOUP0|4.0|I'm just returning to the Stones after many many many years away.  I started with Exile on Main Street, which after years of jazz-laden snobbery I've discovered is truly, without a doubt, one of the greatest records ever released. But enough of that.  Jump Back picks up where Through the Past Darkly left off.  Some of the tracks here I will end up duplicating when I pick up Sticky Fingers.  That's ok.  It's all good fun here, some of it very tongue in cheek.  I have to laugh at the disco numbers although I've always enjoyed Emotional Rescue. There's one or two tunes where you can hear that sappy Oberheim synth sound that was so popular in the 70's dance numbers... yecccch! Only a couple of tunes made me whince.  The rest is really great stuff!  The cheesy stuff must be Jagger directed stuff when Keith was sort of deferring the band decisions to him.<br /><br />Get Jump Back, Through the Past Darkly and then High Tide and Green Grass and I think you'll have all the big hits.  A better way to go than Hot Rocks.<br /><br />Four Stars only because they left off Heartbreaker (Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo) - The b@st@rds!
B000BTJDG2|2.0|For a film that twiddles with the horror genre this must be among the more refreshing Hollywood efforts after a throng of half-nosed Japanese remakes. Yet, for all its production histrionics it ultimately sucks, and sucks boulders, because one never relates to it -- which is of course a blessing given the grotesque world it is about -- but I mean relate to it in a way that would make us care about any of its characters and consequently the film itself.<br /><br />Thematically, it straddles between a kooky courtroom drama and a pandering ode to The Ring/Dark Water crowd. Our eponymous Emily Rose has already succumbed to the devil -- literally, we are led to believe -- thanks to a priest who meant to exorcise her. The film is thus split into a legal trial and some flashbacks detailing a somewhat labored version of what may have led to her death/murder.<br /><br />This sets us up for a plush serving of all the standard-issue thrills one expects from such endeavors: a disheveled protagonist clutched by evil spirits, hectic sound bursts, strange eye colorations, sudden 360-degree cranial rotations, leaden-footed testimonies, and that inevitably sweaty closing from the defence attorney.<br /><br />One soon wonders what the \\"Based on a True Story\\" moniker really accounted for. To the extent that the real life trial may have led to some seminal litigation pitting medicine against theology, it might be true in a WMDs-in-Iraq sort of a way. But there is precious little here to engage true horror fans, with the possible exception of some convincing acting. I have never paid attention to Campbell Scott before but found myself respecting him in this venture. Linney is rather different here from her spate of softie roles as well, she rises to the occasion with a passion.<br /><br />Too bad that the occasion never seems to warrant much rising to. It fares decently for a venture with ace cameramen and predictable imagination, but that is clearly too sparse a reason to recommend a film for theatre or a rental. Anyone but ardent horror fans should do well to catch it when it hits a channel near you.ilm for theatre or a rental.

0553106635|5.0|I read this book for the third time recently just to prep myself for 'a feast for crows' coming out NOV 8(EVERYONE BUY!!!) Now i know putting a recent fantasy series and saying it's the best series ever written may upset many Toliken and Jordan fans(not to mention the salvatore and dragonlance addicts). Yet if people read any of the authors i just mentioned, then I think they know the unique difference between Martin and them. Yes, I am aware Toliken is the great pioneer of the fantasy genre. Too bad that he set off an amazing repetive cycle of unstoppable Protaganists so good, so righteous and so noble, well the antagonists are always some despicable evil crawling out of the very bowels of hell itself. Martin with his series DOES NOT do that. He have arguably the most 'gray' characters in any fantasy series. (Gray characters= characters that show flashes of goodness, yet each have his or her own weak point and his or her own point of view-weather it's right or wrong) So in this way readers are hard-pressed to figure out whos really is right or wrong and most readers end up just picking by perference, instead of being forced to pick certain favorite characters like most other fantasy series. What's even more interesting is that Martin pits all the main characters against each other in a showdown or future showdown and readers once again are pushed to the brink of anxiety wondering which of their characters might end up losing. For instance, many readers are fond of Sir Davos the Onion Knight and many readers are fond of Danys. Yet, it is almost inevitable that Dany's forces will one day clash with Sir Davos and his king Stannis. So one side will be sure to perish. Hence, the forever 'on edge' feeling that the particular chapter you are reading about your character might be his or her last. Martin also does a marvelous job of having such an emoerous array of characters and still keeping most of them fresh, as well as providing 'teasers' for his next book. Much talk of the Ironborn in Book 2 and Book 3 and i can't wait to read about them in 'Feast'. Andrik the unsmiling is a name mentioned that i think we will read about in 'Feast' and i feel that he will be known to readers as perhaps the Iron Islands version of Gregor Clegane.  Dorne is another place mentioned in previous books and it is a certainity that readers will pick up at least another favorite character from Dorne.Now realistically because Martin have so many POV's and characters, he have yet to create a 'classic' character- for those of you that read Salvatore then you will know about Artemis Entreri. Arguably one of the greatest characters created in the fantasy genre. But overall, Martin is still my favorite author and i can't wait for feast
B000BEZPQE|5.0|One of the things I always worry about with live recordings is, obviously, the sound quality.  Whether it's too much of the high end or the low end, live albums are all-too-often unbalanced.  Not this one.  The drums, guitars, bass, and Corey are all clear and present.  The result is a great-sounding live album that captures Slipknot live pretty well.  If you're a fan of Slipknot, get this album; no matter which album of theirs you prefer, this album has something you like on it.
B00000F169|1.0|This movie is VERY similar to the types of things you would see on PBS in terms of video quality, but only this ISN'T funny!

B000AMJDHY|5.0|a friend of mine turned me on to this band because she knew of my love for chuck palahniuk, author of fight club, invisible monsters, etc. for those of you who don't see the connection, a lot of Panic!'s lyrics and most of their song titles are lines from palahniuk novels. if you're a fan of his, you'll recognize a lot of them. <br /> <br />that said, i wouldn't continue listening to this if i didn't think it was good music. it's fun and energetic, with appropriate moments of solemnity without being emo. it's diverse and great to dance to, even if you're alone. have fun with this one, it's a solid first effort. i'm sure chuck palahniuk would be proud at the way some of his lines are being put to music.

Te necesito: una hermosa cancion para dedicarle a tu pareja... el sonido es muy calmo y la letra arrasadora!  <br /> <br />6.

055357342X|5.0|There is no certainity when you read Martin's series of books--A Song of Ice and Fire.  You will find yourself favoring certain characters only to find them killed off.  We have been conditioned to believe when we read a book or watch a movie that the main characters, be it the hero or herione or such, are immune to extreme adversity, yet our heros and heriones of Martin's books have no such immunity.<br /><br />Like always, Martin moves from chapter to chapter switching from the persepective of different characters.  Some are good, some bad, all are shown as being human with human faults.  You can't help but have favorites. My favorites have  been the same since book one--Jon and Arya.  I can't help but skip through chapters to see how long I will have to wait before I'll get to read more. Now I have to wait for book four.<br /><br />Overall, excently written.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|The word \\"persona\\" stands for the roles people assume on stage or in the world.  It relates back to the masks that actors wore in ancient Greek drama.  What happens in art or life when we refuse to wear our masks?  What if we can't keep them on?  How then are we to live?  Persona is perhaps the furthest flight ever made by a filmmaker in search of answers to these questions.<br /><br />Bergman shot Persona in the mid sixties, a time when all the big constructs - personal identity, the nature of art, the role of the individual in society - were up for grabs.  The opening of the movie seems to mirror the intellectual jumble of the times: shots of film stock, a camera, an arc lamp; several disturbing images dredged up from the swamp of the adult unconscious; finally, an adolescent boy in a hospital-like room.  The boy gets out of bed and walks toward the blurry, blown-up photograph of a woman's face.<br /><br />After this disconcerting beginning, Bergman drops us into the actual start of the story.  Elisabeth (Liv Ullman) is a famous actress who suddenly refuses to speak.  She's sent to a psychiatric institution where she's attended by Alma, a young, seemingly naïve nurse (Bibi Andersson in one of the bravura performances in world cinema).  Elisabeth turns on the television in her hospital room and sees one of the sixties' most indelible images:  a Vietnamese monk burning himself alive on a sidewalk as a war protest.  Perhaps Elisabeth stays silent because she refuses to participate in such a horrific world.<br /><br />Elisabeth's psychiatrist arranges for a rest cure in a summer cottage on a small island off the Swedish coast, and sends Alma along to care for her.  Once on the island, Alma's nurse mask starts to slip.  She drinks too much one night and tells Elisabeth about an odd sexual encounter she had several years back with another woman and two boys.  We watch the silent Elisabeth drink in Alma's words like a vampire draining the life force from a victim.  Elisabeth's voyeurism feels almost repulsive, but then we realize it's no different from our own.<br /><br />Alma tells Elisabeth that the sexual experience she described led to an abortion, after which she can no longer bear children.  Elisabeth then casually reveals Alma's sexual secrets in a letter that Alma peeks at on the way to the post office.  This betrayal knocks Alma off center.  The kind, deferential nurse deliberately leaves a piece of broken glass where Elisabeth will step on it.  Alma doesn't know herself any more, which Bergman dramatizes by cutting to a shot of the film stock snapping in two.<br /><br />Social conventions are abandoned.  Alma gives over to primal emotions - anger, violence, lust, cruelty - to try and break through Elisabeth's wall of silence.  Alma attacks Elisabeth for being a monstrous egotist, and accuses her of hating her son and wishing he was dead.  Andersson does all the talking in this scene, but the camera is focused exclusively on Ullman's face.  Then Andersson repeats the same monologue, word for word, only this time the camera stays fixed on her own face.  Now we're not sure if Alma is talking about Elisabeth's son or describing the guilt she felt at aborting her own child.  Alma denies that she's like Elisabeth; at the same time, on the screen their two faces merge into one.<br /><br />From here, fantasy and reality blur even further.  In one gruesome sequence, Elisabeth literally sucks the blood from Alma's arm.  Alma briefly surrenders.  A look of sexual pleasure flits across her face, but then she recoils and slaps Elisabeth viciously across the cheek.  In another dreamlike scene, Alma, back in uniform at the hospital, wakes up Elisabeth and holds her.  \\"It's all nothing,\\" Alma says.  Which is what all of Bergman's authorial intrusions into Alma and Elisabeth's story seem to be telling us: creative illusions are just that, no thing. Yet they signify everything, and great artists will surrender their social and psychological security in service to them.<br /><br />The two women pack up and leave the cottage.  The movie ends with a series of images that relate back to the opening.  There's Elisabeth back on stage - is she cured, or has she succumbed to a worse illness than silence and withdrawal?  We see a closeup of a mask sculpture that we saw before outside the cottage, then a cut to the film crew, including the great cinematographer Sven Nykvist behind his camera.  Alma flags down a bus, presumably headed back to her \\"normal\\" life as a hospital nurse.  We see the little boy from the opening sequence again, looking at images of Ullman's and Andersson's faces.  The film unspools, and we're staring at a screen gone to black.<br /><br />For movie that deals with such abstract ideas, Persona is surprising sensual.  The camera caresses the faces of Ullman and Andersson; they caress each other; Sven Nykvist sculpts the light into pleasing, mysterious textures.  Using only a black and white palette, Bergman turns morning into twilight, sun to shadow, beautiful faces into harpy masks.  The rhythms of physical reality shift and morph like the psychological foundations of Alma's identity.<br /><br />In a sense, Bergman has recast the Icarus myth.  Elisabeth soars above accepted social constraints, but may not be able to return to normal life.  Too much self-knowledge that she can't emotionally handle melts Alma down, as surely as solar heat melts wax wings. In this, as in his other movies, Bergman, despite his own bouts of incapacitating doubt and despair, simply refuses to stop flying right toward the sun.their social and psychological security in service to them.  <br /> <br />The two women pack up and leave the cottage.

0385337388|4.0|I've often heard comments by medical students and non-medics who found this book a little too cynical and unrealistic. I read the book after I finished my House Jobs in the UK (internship) and although there is a degree of artistic licence, I recognized almost every character and situation described on its pages.  <br /> <br />The book gives a truely accurate description of that first year on the job after university and is at the same time both hillarious and deeply depressing. If you are a medical student it's certainly worth a read but perhaps not in the summer holiday before you start working - I doubt you'd ever want to turn up. If you already work in a hospital read it and see if you can spot any of your colleagues in it. <br /> <br />I can't speak for the States but the training over here has changed alot now and interns are no longer subjected horrors of 3 days without sleep or having to make life and death decisions at 2am with absolutely no hope of senior support. Mind you, at times it was also an aweful lot of fun.  <br /> <br />I'm sure that any junior doctor today will be sick of hearing their seniors harp on about how bad it was in their day and so it's worth you lot reading this book if for no other reason than to realise just how good you've got it now and stop your bloody moaning.

And trust me, it's really, really a great movie.<br /><br />Now, naturally being an Atheist, this was all the more funny for me. I was floored (and tickled) to see Carlin as a religious figurehead... it was truly funny- he's about as Atheistic as they come- but not at all surprised to find that he cheated in his golf games by blessing his golf club. That's Carlin for you.<br /><br />It was nice when it started raining black men. Well, okay, it rained Chris Rock. You gotta love this guy, he's hilarious.<br /><br />That's basically what this movie is. It's not PERFECT, but it's pretty darn funny.<br /><br />DEFINITELY worth buying.

After all young Sam lives in Ankh-Morpork, he'll only ever see cows and pigs on his plate.  Instead he should search the streets of the city and discover such characters as Foul 'Ol Ron--at least until Lady Sybill finds out.<br /><br />Just one note though, this isn't a children's book--it is meant to look like one, but you wouldn't read it as a bedtime story to your three year old.<br /><br />If you've kept up with Pratchett's Discworld novels then this is definately the book for you, especially if you enjoy tales of Sam Vimes and the City Watch.  Even the Librarian recommends it with an enthusiastic \\"Ook!\\"  Of course if you're new to Discworld then this makes a great introduction to the humour of Pratchett without many spoilers as to previous books and their varied and sundry plots.  I highly recommend this essential companion to Thud!
B000B9EY2U|4.0|The terms \\"classic\\" and \\"return to form\\" are being handed out so readily that it's hard to take them at face value, especially  considering they are usuallly used by fans and critics alike to describe the latest offering from their favorite artist who has suffered from commercial decline or audience alienation due to extreme experimentation. I would love to be able to describe Depeche Mode's eleventh studio album as such but I cannot, simply because they have never released anything like \\"Playing the Angel\\". It is almost shocking in its simplicity of arrangement and its  rude loudness . Whereas DM's last album \\"Exciter\\" was so pristine in its digital finery as to be antiseptic and practically untouchable ( and indeed, anything but exciting ), \\"Playing the Angel\\" has an urgency, and an immediacy to its sound that is undeniably refreshing. It has a sensual, very sexy throb to it that I have never heard in a DM album, and it doesn't give the listener the impression that it was fussed over to the point of reaching someone's idea of perfection. That is not to say DM have turned into a garage band. Listen to \\"Playing the Angel\\" through a good set of headphones, or better yet, listen to the 5.1 mix through a home  <br />stereo system, and you will find they have made an album that is well thought out but not labored or forced. There is also a very welcome return of 4/4 beats that are dance floor ready without having to resort to the trickery of the DJ/remixer du jour. And, I am happy to say, there is a wealth of really great material here, something sadly missing from the last few DM albums. I was admittedly sceptical when I read that vocalist Dave Gahan would be contributing songs to this release, considering his solo album was intriguing but not exactly rewarding. But his songs stand up very well, and fit in nicely with Martin Gore's latest. From the opening blasts of air raid siren that signal \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" to the slow, grinding dirge of \\"Darkest Star\\" thisalbum has a dirty, raunchy feel to it, probably due to the faint layer of distortion that seems to envelope every sound, from the synths and drums, to the vocals and guitars. The bottome line for me, as a long time fan and follower, \\"Playing the Angel\\" represents a new begining for Depeche Mode, and renews my faith in this band as a creative force. Almost twenty five years after their debut, it's almost unbelievable that  they could make an album like this and pull it off. Very well done, and  Highly Recommended.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|The way Richard Dreyfuss said in `Mr. Holland's Opus' and I quote `It's like falling in love with John Coltrane all over again'.  It's the same for me with `The Way Up'.  The more I listen to it, the more I fall in love with the PMG all over again.  I wish there were more stars in this review to compliment the PMG.  Do keep it going Brother for this is `The Way Up'.  Don't stop now for the sky is not the limit!  Cheers to Pat, Lyle, Steve, Antonio, Cuong, Gregoire, Nando, Carolyn, Rob and the whole crew.
B000063DHL|5.0|straight to the songs.... <br /> <br />Caught Somewhere In Time - 10/10 This song is a masterpiece in my opinion. Opens with cool use of synthesizers and then gets faster as it goes on. The Middle instrumental part is incredibly good.  <br /> <br />Wasted Years - 8/10 good song but its pretty commercial sounding.  <br /> <br />Sea of Madness - 7/10 Not much to say about this one except it is LOUD. <br /> <br />Heaven Can Wait - 8/10 ITs really good except the chorus gets annoying sometimes. <br /> <br />Loneliness of The Long Distance Runner - 9/10 Has some Really good guitar work. <br /> <br />Stranger In A Strange Land - 7/10  <br /> <br />Deja Vu - 8/10 - Great Song <br /> <br />Alexander The Great - 9.5/10 Almost Perfect except for a few parts. The Intro is Superb. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
