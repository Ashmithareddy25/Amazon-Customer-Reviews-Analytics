B000I8ES70|5.0|Action packed sequal.  If your are wondering what happened after see got out of the hospital watch this movie.  It has more characters and events that explain the aftermath.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|Great Cast+Great Filmmaker+Great Story<br />Great Movie, i have watched it over and over<br />Special features go into great detail about film making - art direction & prop design.<br />I can't wait for the next one !!
B007CKNX28|5.0|I have been a long time jack white fan, white stripes, dead weather, raconteurs... and this, his first single album is awesome! I literally love every song! Great buy!
1455502758|4.0|As all of Christopher's books excellent. His perfound intellect is deeply missed. He crossed our sky like<br />a brilliant blazing all too short lived comet.
B001AP11KW|5.0|love jack white! awesome cd! all the songs are great and would suggest this as a gift to fans of jack white and the Raconteurs!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The idea behind the story was excellent but the entire book, not as good. Wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be but still an okay read.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A well written classic novel that everyone should read at least once. I am Looking foward to reading it agian next christmas
B004J64QSI|5.0|Outstanding DVD. Could watch it over and over. The voices were all suited to each character. Original cast was wonderful to hear and see. Enjoy, the best of the best.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Not only a spellbinding mystery but a history of China like I never remember very well. Could hardly put it down.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|This was not a very satisfying book.  The main character goes beyond the capacity to elicit a sympathetic reaction.  It became a chore to finish and I found myself skipping a great deal.  There were some interesting moments that if a part of another book, would have made a very good book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The good:<br />Portable<br />Fun<br />The bad:<br />Hard controls<br />Can't change skin<br />Doesn't have everything from the pc game<br /><br />Remember this is not what you think.But it's great for people that don't have the pc game.
B005LAII08|5.0|I'm a big Disney fan, so it's no surprise that I wanted the BRAVE Blu Ray to add to my collection.  This arrived very quickly and was packaged very nicely!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an excellent movie for the whole family!  It has a very powerful and important message within that everybody should hear, especially fathers.  The DVD was packaged very well and arrived very quickly!
B009EELBIS|5.0|This is a classic.  It's hard to believe it's forty-six years old. I don't purchase many movies, but this one you'll watch again and again.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|A DVD that can be watched over and over again. Not only the youngest in the family but even brother and sister a little older can enjoy.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Probably not a fair assessment since Connelly and Sandford are my favorite writers and almost never disappoint me (as Patterson,King,and Cornwell have lately).<br /><br />This is another Harry Bosch novel, the hard-boiled,often confrontational detective who, nearing the end of his career is just as tenacious and unrelenting as ever in his pursuit of justice.  Harry is in cold case and this case is 20 years old and seems cut and dried-- a visiting photographer ,caught in the middle of the LA riots in 1992, is gunned down in the streets--- attributed to gangs and looting.  However, Bosch sees it differently, and while his higher-ups want him to drop this 'loser' and focus on other things, Bosch pushes stubbornly ahead, uncovering many layers of a carefully planned murder and cover-up.<br /><br />Connelly is a really solid writer who makes his characters believable,sometimes likeable, and always VERY realistic.<br />No &#34;phony&#34; dialogue with cute little comments in the middle of the gunfight--I HATE that --this isn't James Bond or The Expendables!!  If you like quick action,and involved plot activity, buy this book.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I love this album, almost all the songs on it are listenable. The candy pop style of the title song, TGIF, and California Girls soon gives way to more eclectic offerings, including the sweeping, moving Firework with its life-affirming message, the sensual soundscape that is E.T., and the absolute silliness of Peacock. This album is fun, well-crafted... it brings out my happy side and makes me want to dance.
0785156593|4.0|Great comic to catch up on when you have some free time. I carried mine with me in my work bag and would break it out when I had some free time to read. Worth the purchase.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I chose this book because I love science fiction, and also because of the great reviews it received.  Turns out the story did not disappoint.  The characters were believable, likeable, and there was even one that I enjoyed disliking.  I gave it four stars because although I liked the premise, and I was happy to find out what happened next, I did not lose myself in it.  I was not dying to get back to it as soon as I had free time.  So overall, it was a good story, entertaining, and a great value.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|The little prince is my favorite book of all time, and I bought this version to write a lesson plan for my middle school students. The morals and ideas in this book provide a great lesson about childhood, and what is important in life.
B009LH1Y1W|2.0|I am huge fan of Supernatural but have been very disappointed with the season so far. I find many of the episodes are borderline unwatchable and the storlyline is as convoluted as it is cliche at this point. I don't know if there are new writers or what, but very disappointed.
B005LAIISA|5.0|What a great idea for a kids CD, even good for the adults as well.  We laugh and laugh and laugh.
1612130283|5.0|I do not do book reviews because I am not that articulate, but I loved this book.  Some people can not get past the S&M in the book to see the story.  I think you should read the entire trilogy to understand what I am talking about.  There is a plot.  If you are offended by unorthodox sexual experiences, you may not like it, BUT you do not have to be into that life style to like the book.  I certainly am not into that lifestyle and I LOVED the books.<br /><br />My advice:  If you are at all curious about reading the book, read it, but go on to read the other two.  It is more about a love story than it is about sex.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Rent it today!!! we watched it 4 times during our 24 hour rental.  Could not stop laughing! Rent it today!
B00622BF40|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie! funny and clean, it doesn't need vacuuming before u watch it with children or adults:)
B0060ANZ2Y|5.0|Earth Wind & Fire came to play on this set. The mc introduces them and it's on. I never really paid attention to how powerful Verdine White's bass playing was until this concert. These guys are on 'fire' ... you want this ... it's a can't miss disc
B000KFB4PK|4.0|It is a excelent gift to my grandson who love Lego<br />He will love it<br />Excelent<br />That's what I lokking for
B001GCUO5W|5.0|I got this movie on sale for Cyber Monday at a great price. It's a good movie with a wicked twist. Even after knowing the end, I still like watching it.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|such a great show. happy to be able to watch it sequentially. always look forward to the new episodes !
1451695187|3.0|I thought it was ok but I think it was written for sceptical doctors in the main, and not for the general public.
159562015X|5.0|Great start to finding your God given purpose in life! Strengths are surprising but true, anyone who is searching for their calling should first pick up this book
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|Entertaining.  A fun twist to see Halo in live action.  The scenes are beautiful and Master Chief is so cool.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Keeps moving, keeps you reading as to how they are going to get out of this. Could really happen. Go Connelly.
B009YMNVMO|5.0|fun songs, my 1 yr old says Rio all the time, practically one of her first 5 words.<br />cool characters and a lot of neat scenes 2 love stories going on at once<br />good and evil (child appropriate- people trying to get away with stealing valuable items)<br />suspense and comedy
B006LS7DQE|4.0|I downloaded this game onto my son's kindle fire tablet and it's pretty fun. So far it hasn't slowed his kindle down (although we did have to uninstall some previous games that we don't play anymore to make more room for this game on his kindle). Tons of puzzle games and some mini games. It reminds me alot of Diablo for the pc as well, which is a game we all like. I recommend this game to anyone who likes jewel quest/matching, strategy games.. and games like Diablo. You build up your defense, weapons, magic, etc, in order to defeat your opponents in the matching games. I have to say it can be rather addicting and the only reason I gave it four stars is that you pretty much have to defeat enemies at every turn. Sometimes that gets annoying to the point I have to put the kindle down to take a break, but that's what the game is about.
B0091REZMW|4.0|really enjoy, it keeps me coming back.  give it a try you 'll like it too.  looking forward to more to come.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Hunger Games.  I liked it the first time around when it was called Battle Royale.  It amazes me how people think this film is such a unique and cool movie when all the producers did is take a Japanese classic film and clean up the blood so they could release it to a mainstream audience.  It is really annoying that nowhere in the film do they give credit for Battle Royale and for stealing the concept entirely.  Sure they added some nice wrapper material and even got Walter White to help out but if you want to do yourself a big favor, buy the original Japanese film and you will enjoy it a lot more, I promise.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I find it is veery useful and dependable.  I would buy it again.  A good choice for anyone wanting to know the signal strength of their surroundings.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has done it again.  He has drawn us in with the first book and completely captured us with the second.  As always the master storyteller he weaves his story and characters forward leaving you wanting more.<br />I completely recommend this to all who love a good story and are interested in early 20th Century history.
B00914JWSW|3.0|Barbra's voice is wonderful as always but I don't care for the songs on this CD.  I am not familiar with very many of them and I suppose I prefer to hear songs that I already know.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Once again they release a game that isn't finished. More &quot;coming soon&quot; levels like in Space. And if you want to play the Dagoba levels you either have to 3 star every level (means not completing any levels with the Falcon) or you have to pay another $1.99.<br /><br />Done with you Rovio. Already bought the game once. Not paying for it again.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Wish there was an easier way to erase/eliminate notes, but it does work for notes and reminders. I'd recommend it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|love it..it has the sounds of the cards flipping over its easy to do on my kindle I just like it
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Renee Zelweger just does an excellent job, and it is my go-to film when I need a quiet lift.
B004R63MWQ|4.0|Plenty of action and very nice special effects.  Some of the performances could be better.  Overall a very entertaining story for sci-fi fans.
B009ZE27US|3.0|love when people get really mad it is funny. lol. but does not work very while. :-) but its ok not my favert game it could be a lot better.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was a great book in that the author wanted to identify, and accurately record the events that happened to him while in a medical coma.  I get the belief there is a definite God in which the author is referring to.  However, if he's going to go as far as making the claim of God, he must also discuss Christ.  I was expecting a more deliberate discussion on Christ and salvation.  When I was done with the book I wasn't sure of the God he was referring to.  It was almost if he wrote the book to appease many people's view of God so as not to offend the non-christian believers.  I was looking for Jesus and didn't find him in this book.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Like the acting and the action, but found this particular movie a bit confusing.<br />jeremy renner was excellent and the movie kept my interest but feel I should watch it again to fully understand all the characters and their involvement.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie would've been great without Robert Downey. But, with him it is frigg'n awesome! Loved it. PS- the hulk is finally scarey instead of a lumbering, green Robert Pattinson in this one. HaHa
B009NPKTN6|3.0|I love watching Tom Cruise movies and the hype for this movie was over-rated!  Amazon did a good job with the price and delivery.
0307346617|5.0|This is a great book and that is coming from a guy who hasn't read a book since 1994. But, wow.. I couldn't put this one down. I can't WAIT for the movie! Zombie Apocalypse!
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|llego sin problemas! gracias! muy buena pelicula, se las recomiendo, y llego muy rapido a mi casa, solo tres semanas
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book was OK but not as sexy as 50 Shades of Gray, however it is definitely a look alike wannabe!
B001AR4K8K|5.0|llego sin problemas! gracias! muy buena pelicula, se las recomiendo, y llego muy rapido a mi casa, solo tres semanas
B00846REIS|3.0|The obession he has over her is a little scary!  I mean in this day and age with people all over with guns it is scary that he would &#34;kill&#34; for her and actually did.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read all of the Mitch Rapp books - and I have to tell you that this one may have grabbed my interest sooner than any of the others - and kept it throughout the entire book.  The non-stop action and realism was well above par.  The ability that Mr. Flynn has for making his books seem as if they are taken right out of today's events is remarkable.  He knows what's going on in this world and is not afraid to suggest how it should be dealt with.  I highly applaud him for helping us see reality in fiction.  As usual, I can hardly wait for his next book!
B0012FHGCW|5.0|The movie was excellent and the fact that it was a true story makes it even better. I have to give it 5 stars
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I liked the premise but then was unable to pull the vignettes together to form a cohesive whole.  There lacked continuity.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has captivated many people.  I love to listen to her sing the &#34;movie&#34; themes.  Bravo and Thanks from Western Oklahoma.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|The alarm went off as expected but after I turned it off the alarm kept sounding every few hours at random times of the day (and night). I had high hopes but this app did not work out for me.
1419705849|5.0|I have a reluctant reader in the shape of my lovely granddaughter; but I know that anything &#34;Wimpy&#34; will delight her.  Got this when it first came out.  She was so pleased to be the first in her class to read it and take the AR test on it in her school.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|A funny, quixotic movie. Surprise characterizations by Bruce Willis and Edward Norton. Young love beautifully shown. A delightful, enjoyable movie beginning to end.
B00A757EFW|3.0|its not like the real game in an arcade because in an arcade you have more control in it. so I would say its ok
B0086700CM|4.0|i love temple run but it buffers very little though.<br />its awesome.<br />i have a kindle fire and the screen is very big.  you have space
B0083SBJXS|5.0|great movie, new condition, so glad I pre ordered it, now I just want the big marvel cinematic universe set to come out, can't wait til april.
B003YBUSMW|5.0|This product works great. I would recommend it to anyone! It has lasted a long time for me and it is a good buy!
B008D19WBQ|2.0|A lot of people are complaining about the missing extended material. I've never seen it, so I don't miss it. I bought the Blu-ray for two reasons. I really no longer care to watch anything in 4:3 format, and that's all that is availble on DVDs that I can find. Several people have said that's how it's filmed, but that's not true, in fact there is no such thing as a camera that shoots 4:3. They are all shot with normal film and cropped to 4:3 to fit the frame from the original broadcasts. So, the Blu-ray did give me a 16:9 picture and I am happy with that. However, Blu-ray is also about high definition, and again, the original footage is shot with very high definition film. But these cuts were not made from that film and there was absolutely no touch-up, filtering or editing done to bring the picture back to a HD picture. The pictures are grainy, contain many artifacts (brought about when you film a copy of a film) and the sound quality is poor. Bottom line, this is a poor product by any standard. I do not recomme3nd it and hope they one day turn the film into HD in 16:9 and add the missing footage, otherwise, I cannot think of a reason to buy this product. You will most likely be disappointed with the result unless you start with very low ecpectaions. It is significantly better than watching 4:3 versions over commercial TV delived in an analog format. If you expect more than that, plan on some level of dissatisfaction (and this is playing it back on a machine that upgrades the video quality from that on the disk - when I played it on a standard player that doesn't enhance the image it was even worse).
0525953728|3.0|A fairly quick read and not as exciting/intriguing as I hoped. All in all, I'd say this book is ok at best.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|... but if you like to be disturbed, give Season 2 a go!  By about episode 3 or 4 you'll have a sense of what I mean.  I think both seasons are awesome with terrific acting, twists and turns that left me hungry for the next episode.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Remarkable story of survival. You realize as you read Shin's story how lucky you are to live in freedom. God bless Shin for his bravery in telling his story
B004WGIXX4|4.0|I was kind of expecting this movie to be utter crap, and watched it without knowing anything at all about it. But it was a fun mindless watch. There were some quippy bits that were amusing, and there were only a few cringe-worthy moments.<br /><br />The disappointing thing was the utter waste of Kevin Kline and Cary Elwes.  Did Cary even have a SPEAKING role? Why did they waste his time? He can't be that hard-up for roles, can he? And I spent a lot of time watching Kevin and thinking, \\"Is that REALLY him? Is it? Or is it just someone that looks a lot like him?\\"  Just... it was odd.  But I'll be honest - it doesn't hurt my eyes to watch Natalie Portman for however long this fluffy mindless movie is.<br /><br />Go into it not expecting much and you'll have a nice mental vacation with a couple of giggles. A good movie to watch while painting your nails or something.
B001I3SUC8|3.0|It is good generic Christmas music with that great Tony Bennett voice. But it doesn't swing the way you would expect from a Basie album.
0345803485|2.0|I did not like this book and would not recommend it.  I felt uncomfortable reading it.  Maybe I am a prude and don't know it.
B00511PTWM|1.0|I purchased this item to use while traveling.  It broke almost immediately (after using it about 4 times).  I replaced it with a better quality item.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As usual Ken Follet delivers historical fiction in an interesting and real context. As a teacher I use his writings to introduce different eras in History.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Easy reading. Nice story about people. Makes you think about making the most of life and appreciating little things. .
B0027MJU00|4.0|I read Gone Girl  and really liked it and thought I would try another Gillian Flynn  book. I really liked this too . I love the way she writes and since I'm from Kansas City,I can picture all her locations.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Love, love, love The Lumineers! What a truly impressive first album for this band! Great lyrics, wonderful music, catchy and original tracks.  I can listen to this album end to end, over and over.
0345803485|4.0|Honestly, this book is not fine literature.  It is a book for the bored housewife, the woman who is looking for an easy escape.  I feel like so many women read this book expecting it to be a literary great and that is just not why you read it.  It is like eating a piece of cake.  Sugary sweet, not nutritious.  So, if you are looking for stimulation outside of sexy scenes and a \\"Pretty Woman\\" type plot then please don't read this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. . . just wow. . .How do you write a review for a book like this? Books like this change you.  They give you a whole new perspective of life and love and humanity.  I just put this book down and I am hungover with emotion. You know that feeling? When you know the book you just read will stay with you forever? When the characters you just spent reading about feel like your friends. . .your family? It is nothing short of a gift if an author is able to do that for their readers.  Of course I was a fan of Slammed and Point of Retreat already and this book just confirms what we all already know - Colleen Hoover is amazing!!!!<br /><br />Could anyone have created a more perfect Dean Holder? And a more courageous and loveable Linden Sky/Hope? The passion between them left me panting and wishing for pinky holding and non-kisses of my own, yet the heartbreak and loss they experienced caused me to ugly cry more than I'm willing to admit.<br /><br />I am not just \\"living\\" this book. . .I am full on LOVING this book!<br /><br />So stop reading this review and buy it! Buy it now!!!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Stimulating, action packed,  entertaining, thrilling, suspenseful. Nolan at his finest. I felt it was a great ending to the modern Batman saga. Also, it leaves you wondering at the end, like the characters and story keep living. Yes!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Well thought out stories.  Very smart.  I like the emphasis on the clues and build up to the reveal. extra word...
0451196716|4.0|The ending really surprised me because it left me hanging as to where it went from there. Very strange practice.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Have read books 1 & 2 and working my way through the 3rd book.  They are good books.  Hard to put down once you get to reading them.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia Keys is a great artist. I got it for my Mom for xmas and she seems to love it so far. Recommend!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is great!  Definitely a little different but really has a good story line, so good, you don't want to put the book down.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|This was an awesome CD and if your are a &#34;script&#34; fan you will definitely love this one. Thank you!
0802136834|5.0|This is excellently written history, extremely entertaining, hard to believe it really happened!! One of my all time favorite books!
B008XG1X18|4.0|It's just as great as the pc version with one complaint: no 'scroll to top' which it sorely needs.  Great otherwise!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We do not have Showtime on our TV and had heard how good Homeland is from friends.  We were not disappointed!  Marvelous show and we enjoyed every minute.  We are eagerly awaiting the Amazon DVDs of the 2nd season!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Nice cardboard case that holds the booklet and three DVD's.  My daughter was speechless when she opened it; watched it right away and she was already seeing some of the new scenes not in the theatrical version.  She can't wait to go thru the bonus features too.  And can't say enough about the packaging and super fast shipping I have experienced with all of my recent purchases.  LOVE, love, love Amazon.
B000MNP2K8|4.0|Got this for my kid for Christmas.  Been asking for it for a while.  Always love 007 movies and Daniel Craig is great.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I used it the first day that I downloaded it and it worked very good.  good visual and easy functions to work.  very good app.
1416972242|5.0|Got this for my kid for Christmas.  Been asking for it for a while.  Always love to encourage reading books.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Excellent app, Love it, the sound and response is very good.  the visual aspect of the keyboard is very good. would recommend this app.
B006UUK612|5.0|Great movie. Always loved this as a kid and now my kids think it 'is great for an 80's movie.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|This was and still is my all time favorite game and it did not disappoint.  the graphics and actions like the original game.  very very good indeed.
1423113497|4.0|Got this for my kid for Christmas.  Been asking for it for a while.  Always love to encourage reading books.

1423101499|4.0|Got this for my kid for Christmas.  Been asking for it for a while.  Always love to encourage reading books.
0743454537|5.0|I read this book over the course of a couple of months. It felt like it was dragging a little bit in the beginning, but I got to a point mid-way where I couldn't put it down. It's an amazing story, with ups and downs throughout the pages. I love how the author uses flashbacks to help paint the overall picture of this family. It tugs at your heart strings, but makes you feel so appreciative for everything in your life!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|You can never go wrong with this movie.  Even my kids love this as a classic Christmas movie. Merry Christmas.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|what's to say? It's a free app! You get what you pay for, right :) The other, pay version, is a more entertaining app.
1416972250|5.0|Got this for my kid for Christmas.  Been asking for it for a while.  Always love to encourage reading books.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I used the PC version until I crashed my Windows OS, and went Linux. Kindle is a Linux system, but not compatible with Linux PC OS's so I got it for my Android E-reader instead. Very easy to download, easy to use, no problems or complaints so far! Beats the other guy's offerings, ,IMHO.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|It is a cute movie to enjoy with your family.Your child will want to watch over and over again each day
0743277465|5.0|The book came as described and was in perfect condition. I began the book a few days after receiving it and I'm already in love with this book. The book was actually recommended to be by my Sensei and I have already done my best to spread the word.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|I was chilled the first time I ever saw this movie. I think it is a godsend that Hollywood would even do a movie that depicts even the possibility of God and Angels existing. I was sad however, being a Christian myself, that Heaven would not have been enough for someone to be content and happy.... however, being also a hopeless romantic and only having found a great guy to be with at the wonderful age of 50, I understand the lonliness and empty feeling of being alone. I guess you have to decide for yourself. Great movie though.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I'm usually a cheapskate when it comes to games and I try not to spend more than 99&cent;, but this game had such great reviews I decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did because it was worth every penny! Excellent graphics,  excellent story, easy game play,  and SUPER CREEPY!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey is a master story teller and gives the reader a no hold bars thriller with every word written
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it. Great second book to the series. Cannot wait to finish the third and final book ! ! !
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I found the book to be a let down from Grisham's early works. I hope he decides to go back to the format that made him one of the country's notable writers
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The sex scenes got a tad repetitive by the end but I'm still saddened that the series is over! !
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim writes in layman's language about subjects and research that is complex, yet he makes it easy to understand and enjoyable.  His books are very unique and so is he. How does one boil down all of the dynamics of cooking, long distance swimming and the Japanese language into easy, basic and repeatable fundamentals?  Highly recommend this book and 4 Hour Body.
B006TTC54A|5.0|This is a great Blu ray! It has lots of extra features on it including the digital copy. This is a must for the Blues Brothers fan!!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I was excited to watch that because in old days there were no closed captioned or English subtitles back then.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|My wife really likes She & Him & Christmas music so I purchased her this CD & she loves it!
B0018RWMNM|3.0|Felt a little disappointed in the pic quality.... for BluRay. Great Movie though - always has been. Best Western Ever.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always can depend on John Grisham to write a good book. I've not been disappointed in this book. Very good!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What can I say, it is excellent in every way!  The characters, costumes, scenery, all of it, is simply superb.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought this was a funny book just l like all the others but I thought this one was good.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Great special effects but the effects didnt quite capture the original.  I enjoyed the movie for what it was.  Not sure I would recommend the movie.  So that is why it gets 3 stars.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book!!!it was very romantic sweet short and to the point.highly recommend to anybody that loves sweet romantically love stories.
014241493X|4.0|Overall this is a good novel. At times the pace slows & the lengthy search for Margo & Q's obsession with her & the search is tiresome at times. However, it's not a deal-breaker & I would still recommend this to young adults.
B0017HEX76|2.0|I was going to give this as a Christmas gift but I failed to look closely at the details and thought I was purchasing a Disney product. I should have clicked on the larger view and scrolled more to read the full details. The folks I was going to give it to will probably think i bought it bootleg from a flea market.... lovely!! I guess I will just keep it to remind me how assumptive I was! LESSON LEARNED.  Shipped quickly though, so thanks!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I disliked this book. I continued to read it until I reached the final page hoping at every turn that it would improve, but sadly it did not. In New Zealand we spell the colour grey. Grey has always seemed to me to be a dull colour (New zealand spelling also), so it seems ridiculous to have fifty shades of it. Which was pretty much what this book was. So repetitive, so unbelievably dull plot wise. The email correspondence so twee, I think this book was aimed at 15 year olds. The most grating thing was James's choice of Language for describing Anastasias genitalia-what is \\"my sex\\"? Are we in the 21st century now? I'm sure that there is better writing than this dumbed down stuff.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not stop reading! When I started to read this book I thought it was going to be just another book  but it's so much more! This book was so amazing I couldn't wait to read the second book.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This product was way better than other slender games you can buy on the kindle. Most ones cost like four dollars and are the stupidest things in the world. This one way very easy in the begining but it was scary when slender came out I couldnt get away fast enough.
0316228532|1.0|10's of characters, their spouses and children.  Not much of a story.  Just a lot of characters without depth or explanation of their backgrounds.  Seems to be set in white, lower class UK suburb.  A lot of foul language and uneducated conversations between adults and teenagers.  I stayed with it and found it extremely uneventful and downright boring.  Never read the H. Potter series, but was intrigued by the fact it was on the best sellers list.  Good luck find your way through to the end.
B0055S348W|1.0|I got PrinterShare Mobile Print for use with my Kindle Fire HD. However, I was unable to select my Google Cloud Printer from the app. It had installed, let me select Google Cloud Print, but not move forward to select a printer. Writing the PrintShare help desk, they told me that for Kindle Fire, &#34;PrintShare is unable to read your account information, access Gmail, Google Docs, or Google Cloud Print.&#34; It did cleanly uninstall from my Kindle Fire.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Oh kindle Fire, scrolling through the &ldquo;stacked buttons&ldquo; of the detailed 7-day forecast, or of the hour by hour forecast, or of the hourly forecast, is absolutely maddening. A full vertical flick has it move about a twentieth of the screen. So did a slow drag. Unusable. The standard android edition scrolls fine on my two year old Motorola Droid 2, and otherwise appears to be exactly the same.
B004I744AS|5.0|When reading a Kindle book, the imbedded dictionary is fine.  But I wanted a handy dictionary for when I'm reading hard copy.  This is faster than looking up a word via the web.  Also, it keeps a list of previous words looked up - a great way to review words not currently in your vocabulary.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but I love this album so much that I had to write this and give 5 stars. I only wish they would visit my town, sometime! This group is amazing!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This works!  However, it is not integrated into the email.  I have documents in Office Professional 6 and can print them off easily to my HP wireless printer.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I love having Amazon Mobile on my Android device.  I am not a &#34;mall person.&#34;  I think of something I need/want and I no longer have to try to make lists that never get used.  I open Amazon Mobile find the item and either add it to my wish list or put it in my cart.  It makes my life more organized.
1423101499|5.0|It's a present for my grandson so I can't review as a reader.  Just know he will sit and read others in this series and really enjoy it.  Nice change from a video game.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Acting is so-so, story not very inspiring and overworked. Good time filler for one time. Like BDT, but he didn't do his best in this one...
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I had been wanting to see this movie since it had come out in theaters. I had been told how amazing it was and was glad I watched it at home as there are a couple of very quiet parts I had to rewind. I find when expectations are too high I am usually disappointed in a movie... but tgis movie did make me laugh. Enjoy!!!
B000IOM9QG|4.0|Ah, the magic of Boney M indeed! To some \\"serious\\" music listeners this was nothing but disposable, lightweight pop music, but those misanthropes miss the point of it all. Boney M never aspired to be some sort of critic's darling capable of recording complex concept albums with deep lyrical content. This was just very good pop music with a clear tilt towards dance and disco. Fun and catchy, it was hard not to get hooked by songs as good as \\"Daddy Cool\\" ... \\"Brown Girl In The Ring\\" ... \\"Rasputin\\" ... \\"Ma Baker\\" or their classic cover of \\"Rivers Of Babylon.\\" And of course there are plenty of more songs on here that bring back good memories of fun times. One reviewer blasted this compilation for not having the complete original versions, but mostly edits and remixes. I can understand such a complaint, but I didn't listen to this band back when they first released music, so I guess I'm not as disappointed not to have the original versions. But what you get on this collection should more than satify the casual fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was purchased for my daughter, but I couldn't put it down.  Cannot wait to read the new adult book by Collins.
B00ACFL69C|1.0|I love watching sex, violence, etc.  That being said this is one of the highest rated worst movie I have ever seen.  Tarantino did not make this piece of sh_t but should have.
B008MEM24S|5.0|great relaxing game<br />I really like the different tools and the way u have to figure out how to direct the h2O
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is an incredible book from start to finish.  It makes me feel it is believable (sp) because it was experienced by a man who was a non believer in God,  Heaven and an afterlife. He is a neurosurgeon and a scientist and I think they are the worst to try to understand why so many of us do believe.  I wish everyone would read it and discuss it with your friends, I only wish I could experience it .  Love the book. Shirley Reichel
B007JMW46U|5.0|Anytime you read or watch Sherlock Holmes,, you can't help but to wish you could be like him. His extraordinary powers of observation will make you jealous. I really enjoyed  this book  and the fact that it was free just makes it that much better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As the director of a zombie themed seasonal event (The Haunted Trails: Zombie Apocalypse--see us on facebook), I have fallen in love with zombies.  This show is wonderfully written and relies on the relationships between the characters rather than the gore of the attacks (although there is plenty of that!)  The comic books have been expanded and enriched by new themes, new plot points, and new characters.  Don't let the word &#34;zombie&#34; put you off, this is a wonderful drama about people trying to cope with the worst of the worst at what seems to be the end of the world.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Everything I heard about it is true.  Very riveting and keeps you guessing.  Almost makes me wish I had the premium channels.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Along with everyone else, I would like a deluxe edition as well!! Soon!! I actually received this yesterday in the mail. The jewel case was busted, but not significant issue. I now that I have listened to this,. I cannot wait to see the film. Anne Hathaway's \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\"  and Eddie Redmayne's \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" ..WOW. We all know Jackman can sing..and he does deliver as Valjean. I have read several reviews about Russell Crowe not having vocal ability for the role of Javert..dead wrong...which is why you should not listen to the critics, judge for yourself. Sammantha Barks sing \\"On My Own\\" was right up there with Hathaway. I will admit that I was disappointed that the inro to the song was cut.<br />For a highlights album, this was fantastic..thanks Amazon for sending this a day early!!
B007V508CC|4.0|This CD had to grow on me but after listening to it several times I now like it quite a lot.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|I would rate The Lorax as just fair.  It really isn't something I would choose to watch again, but our five- and seven-year-old grandsons seemed to enjoy it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Wasn't sure I would like this CD, but glad I bought it. I like it better every time I listen to it.
B0017KIBAI|1.0|I ordered four of these through Amazon's Marketplace, and every one of them was a Gamecube controller not the Wii controller pictured.  -----  Furthermore they were not even the correct color.  1 was purple, 2 were black, 1 was silver (rather than the white advertised).  None of them matched my console's white color.  PLUS the cord was half the length of the official wii controller.<br /><br />I complained to amazon but rather than deal with the problem, they blocked my ability to file any future complaints or returns.  In other words they PROTECTED THE DISHONESTY of the sellers in their marketplace.  SO BE WARY.  Just thought everyone should know what they will get before they buy.  Of course amazon will probably censor this review.  (If they don't I'll be amazed.)<br /><br />As for the actual Wii controller: I have no idea if it's good or not, since Amazon's markerplace never sent me one!  Four purchased and zero delivered.
B000P2A256|3.0|I have every Maroon 5 CD and this one is my least favorite and the one I listen to least often but I still love Maroon 5 and would buy anything they put out. Songs About Jane is by far the best Maroon 5 CD. I also like Overexposed quite a bit followed closely by Hands All Over.
1451638450|5.0|It's fun, it stretches your imagination,. it's a fast read and she's just a wonderful writer. I love all of her books.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Breaking Bad is an excellent show. I have seen every season so far, it is an absolutely excellent show. Season 4 leaves you hanging and waiting for more!!! Must watch them!!
B00633W614|5.0|This book has all the interest that was created in this first book of Archer's triology The Clifton Chronicles.<br />The development of plots and outcomes makes for late evening reading regardless of the time of night. Couldn't<br />book this book down.  A typical reaction for me and one of my favorite authors, Archer.
B003CHGV74|5.0|This is a very well written and well acted series. It's a visceral and sometimes disturbing experience watching this series.
B0019IB26I|5.0|John Mayer has some great songs on this CD.<br /><br />I love his music and he has several sings that just make you smile!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|There are many people who are alone and can definitely enjoy hours of playing such a very old and fun game.
B0053O89IS|5.0|We love this TV series also and watch it every week.<br /><br />At the end of the season we are always anxioius to see what the next season will bring.<br /><br />We haven't been disappointed once and hope Bones will have a long running series!!
B008476HBM|5.0|A classic for all to read.  A must for all high school students. There are many lessons to  be gotten from this novel.
B003XUKVXK|5.0|i think this is awesome!!<br /><br />I like all the songs and never get tired of listening to it.<br /><br />Kenny Wayne Shepherd is a fantastic musician ans this CD rocks!!!
B0037BB00I|5.0|The best way to describe it...it's Adele. She has the best voice and is the best singer (for me but then again I am biased).
B0053O89JM|5.0|I kniow this is a gift my husband will enjoy!!!<br /><br />We have watched the series over the years ans the final season was fantastic!!!!!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Item arrived early and is a great investment to protect the iPhone. Would recommend this item to anyone wanting to buy one.
1451688091|5.0|While the movie is loosely based on the book, the novel is a powerful narrative of history and this charasmatic leader of the American people.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I finally had enough of hearing about how wonderful The Walking Dead series was. So I decided to get a few episodes on my kindle with some promotional credits I had saved up. Well, I was addicted and ended up buying all episodes! Love it!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Little known facts about former presidents actions and personalities are colorfully brought out that help to better understand these men.

B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Fantastic, way better than MIB2! I would recommend buying them in a set so as to watch all three back to back.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Great - Exciting - highly recommend it - shows the power of bit companies.......Fascinating story (true) and great acting by Russel l Crowe.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Well worth waiting for the DVD and skipping a theatre viewing. This way I can and will watch it again!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The Weather Channel will install but refuses to open.  A message appears:  &quot;Sorry!  The Weather Channel is not responding.  Force close!&quot;  Repeated efforts throughout the day get the same results.  I uninstall..and reinstall.  Same response:  &quot;Sorry...WC not responding.  Force close!&quot;  Any suggestions to successfully obtain reception with this app?  I have a View Sonic g tablet (android os version 2.2, tap u version).
B000GG4Y32|4.0|Reds follows the movies, Nicholas and Alexandra, and Dr. Zhivago, all three together giving the history of the Communist revolution and its terribly disappointing and all too often fatal consequences.
1451673442|5.0|very informative book.  Great price and received very fast.  Used the month long sessions and it helped me out a lot.  would recommend it to everyone looking to improve themselves.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I AM 58 YRS OLD and was actually em barse to syat to read it! I read the firsT BOOK AND COULD NOT STP YILL I READ ALL3 It was with out a doubt the best Trilogy written!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVED Slammed and Point of Retreat, but Hopeless is by far one of the best books I have ever read. Every emotion that I love to have while reading is in this book. Outstanding job Colleen!!
B003XYE7R2|5.0|How can you not like Sherlock Holmes? This was one I hadn't read yet (which surprised me) and it was right up there with all the other books.  A very enjoyable read! You won't know the culprit until the very end!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have read all the Harry Bosch.  It is a bit repetious with Harry.  I really love Mickey Haller & would love to see more of them.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Just amazing music for the stressed out daily life that we have. Only happy thoughts in my mind when I listen to it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|so fun!! this game is long and fun the whole time. totally worth the money. I could play all day and never get bored. sequel please!!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|fun and entertaining. obviously not oscar worthy or indie flick, but it's a good action flick. fun and entertaining. obviously not oscar worthy or indie flick, but it's a good action flick.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was really a great game.  Good story line and the graphics were really good.  You will not be sorry if you buy this!!!!!!
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|While not 'A Band of Brothers', it is a respectable relative with its own pluses. It's always hard to replicate such a well-received production such as 'Brothers', but the effort is readily apparent. It does seem to lack the ability to engage the viewer with the individual characters and their personalities that 'Brothers' was able to do so well, but as an overall epic it does the job.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Wow, what a fantastic read. I'm not a Stephen King die-hard fan but do like a few of his books, most notably my favourite King novel, The Stand. Meticulously researched as you'd expect from King, this is a fast paced read and I had many late nights in a row as I read \\"just one more chapter\\" more than once. It's one of those books I wish I could forget I had ever read it and start all over again.
B004O05NNQ|3.0|As a recording package there is no disappointment whatsoever. However, the accompanying booklet with the songs' lyrics was printed incorrectly, leaving out two-thirds of them, and instead repeated the same few songs THREE times. An obvious printing and binding error that should have been caught by quality control that tarnished an otherwise enjoyable acquisition.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Couldn't stand this book as the characters are flat and I couldn't care less what happened to them.  Didn't finish it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I am obsessed with this show! I got all the seasons & waited for this one to come out. I was so excited when it arrived. Now I have  all the seasons at my fingertips :)
0316098329|1.0|I knew this was a used book, but it was a mess. Several phone numbers written in ink, three old price stickers, cracked spine...you get the idea. This is a mess. It should not have been sold.<br />Too bad, it's a great book and this copy was for a friend...shouldn't have bothered.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I'm obsessed with this show..now I have it at my fingertips at all times. I can watch it when ever I want and the price was fabulous!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I have been a Led Zeppelin fan for a long time and I have been playing and learning their songs on my guitar just as long..............I consider Jimmy Page as my guitar teacher...........and to see them jammin together again was great.
B003O86FMW|4.0|After reading book one of the series I couldn't wait to get my hands on catching fire, I was not disappointed. If you enjoyed The Hunger Games then I definitely suggest you give this book a go. I really did not think I would enjoy this series as much as I have. I can't wait to see how it ends.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|These days, you can't get a better Tosca than this one. All the singers bring personality and great singing to the principal roles. I am less thrilled with the sets but opera shouldn't be about sets anyway.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|I like the easy download. My daughter likes the movie. I would recommend it to anyone. I'll be downloading more movies soon!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I could not get it to move from the first opening page which is in<br />CA. Friends triend and they couldn't do it either. SAorry I purchased it.
B005LAII3U|4.0|I only heard bad things about this re-imagining of Total Recall and I was quite hesitant to buy it, however due to the fact that the new God of War demo came with this I blind bought it and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />First thing, this is not the same story as the original Total Recall and really the story is a little lacking. The main focus is the visual special effects and the intense action and stunts.<br /><br />The PQ is very good, the only downside is the style and filter used for the bright lights streak across the screen, sort of like the trademark of director J.J. Abrams. It is very distracting and I almost thought something was wrong with my TV. The audio is Dolby TrueHD and for the most part it is nice and clean and crisp. It seemed to lack depth and dimension at times with the loud action scenes and gun fire, however over-all it sounds better than most and it was consistent throughout. The dialog was a little cheesy at times, but over-all wrapped up a fun movie.<br /><br />It could have used a little more humor and a slightly better story build up and character development, but for the most part Total Recall is hugely entertaining and a visual masterpiece.<br /><br />Very much deserves multiple viewings and a great action sci-fi popcorn flick.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love the whole movies, waiting to have it for a long time, now is mine :)<br />great movies all of them
B009VB7QQA|5.0|I was apprehensive about this movie until I watched it. It was amazing! The way they weaved historical facts into the storyline was phenomenal!
B000JMKTLO|2.0|The too predictable 'who done it' is in the middle of a lot of really messed up, flawed (grotesquely so) individuals...mainly women.  As a result there was nothing truly enjoyable about it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I was so happy to find this book on my phone, and none the less, free!  I am excited to read it!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I had never even heard of Mahjong, until my stepmom introduced to me a few yrs back & now I love the game!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good thing for occassional boredom.<br /><br />Why do I need to keep writing reviews, this is annoying.  I know I could skip it though, but won't
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Not all games have to be abc's and 123's. My four year old likes helping the animals feel better. good game
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Starting to become frustrated that it keeps crashing or closing automatically while I am in the middle of something.  Becoming annoyed
B007N9FKCY|4.0|Good but repetitive soundtrack. Fun game I played through it but did not collect all the gems or little pink friends. My kids like it but the later levels get too hard for them.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Not even the weather channel can get a &#34;snow storm right&#34;!  I only had a dusting, but like to see what is predicted at least to be prepared.
B0085YNML2|4.0|just because you try to get three stars in the game does not mean you are a complete copy cat but its familiar. My 4 year old likes this game but i found it challenging as well.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I didn't expect all of the other information on accelerated learning.  I'm still trying to get through all of hyperlinks in the book and all of the other website links in the book.  I bought this book on Kindle, but it's a keeper, I need to pick up a hard copy sometime.  I've already recommended this book to several friends.
B000V63BN6|5.0|A great sample of his career and for 2.99 it was a no brainer. Thank you Amazon for helping customers afford such great music.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Their creativity and dedication to quality entertainment portraying real life scenarios with solutions that are Biblically sound both give honor the Lord Jesus while presenting the Christian lifestyle as a viable choice for dealing with the world we live in today.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I think this CD is excellent.  For her, it is a new and different sound.  I like her Jazz but I like this also.  In may haste to order the CD as soon as it came out, I accidently orderd the vinyl, Amazon easily let me return it, but I wanted to keep it just for the big picture of her.<br /><br />If you are a Jazz purist, you probably will not like this CD, but I like it.
0061733199|4.0|Interesting and totally useful in any part of the world. If you're interested in being prepared, this is a &#34;go to&#34; necessity. I keep it on my coffee table!
B00280LYIM|5.0|I would recommend to everyone. It is a great book, that I could read many, many times. Also it is part of a great series.
B0076DELIG|3.0|liked the book.  I like the author and read all of his books.  very entertaining<br />Harry Bosch is some character.
B003TSEL7S|3.0|I love the series but I really missed percy being in the book. Other then that it is a pretty good book.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|best Clancy book yet.  not quite finished but very exciting and definitely a page turner.  Really love the book.<br /><br />Threat Vector is a must read.
B00280LYHS|5.0|The Last Olympian is by far my favorite book of the series. In this one Percy really comes alive and shows his leader abilities. I love how Rick Riordan tied everything together for the finale.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love Demille's books and this one was quite intriguing.  John and Kate are great characters.<br />I want to read anything he writes.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|great strategy game, well worth the wait, im glad its finally here. worth more then 99cents. happy end of the world to everybody!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Most amazing book ever can  wait to get the second. The ending is the best part how she loses Peers is the  worst part.
6304711905|5.0|It was a good price. It came fast and I really appreciate it to be just what it was supposed to be. Thank you.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Goes along with book and I really like actors chosen.  The filming and background is just about perfect.  Ok yes
0684857219|5.0|THis book gives you the history of bodybuilding and it breaks down how to build your body and eat right and stay injury free.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|This product is great as always!  Love The Halo Megablox toys.  My son loves Halo, and legos, great that megablox combines both!
B008476HBM|5.0|All of Jane Austen's writings are exceptional but Pride and Prejudice has always been my favorite. It is so well written; full of such amazing, well-developed characters you either love or hate. The plot is so enjoyable and the humor is so well done it's fascinating! Everyone who loves to read should read this book.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Like it better than regular Angry birds, very fun to play, keeps you wanting to play it more, more, more.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Better than I expected, great set pieces, and just a fun movie. Only thing that I didn't like is how he got his \\"powers\\". Other than that, the movie was entertaining, and isn't that what a movie is supposed to do? Not writing much, just wanted to give my 5 stars and hopefully help someone thats on the fence getting this.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I couldn't pick out just one favorite, although my 9 year old son loves Cello Wars, the Star Wars parody. I love Peponi with Alex Boye on vocals! If your family wouldn't listen to classical music, they will now. These musicians are incredibly talented.
B007HACDLK|4.0|As a function of the secret society, the 'Last Man' has the acuity and the nature to determine the perpetrator of the alleged crimes against the United States.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use these on my iphone in the gym because they don't fall out and the sound is amazing. I will buy these again for my son.
B005QUQP76|3.0|ive had this mouse for about 6 months now i play different types of games but mainly play wow and BF3 the mouse works good when im playing however i am having issues with it randomly shutting off while im in the middle of a game. the only way to get it back on for me is to unplug it for 10-15 seconds and plug it back in. it would be an amazing mouse if not for this issue.
B003DWC6LI|5.0|I've been a fan of the Bridget Jones books for a few years now. I think this is my third time reading it, and I still love it. Would recommend it to everyone.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|this is a must read for any stephen king fan. you will not be disappointed. one of his best works in a long time. go check it out!
B009X011UQ|5.0|For a cover, just what I needed  - lightweight, protective, easy to put on. The stand works well. It won't add added weight to my carry on when I travel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not understanding that the 3 books were sequential with the same characters I was rather put off by book #1 especially the ending.  However, after learning the characters were constant I read the next 2. I then understood that the ending of #1 was necessary for this most unique love story to progress.  The way the 2 people tried to work out their differencesalways focused on their love for each other was most endearing....a real lesson in compromising.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I started reading everything by Gillian Flynn after reading &#34;Gone Girl.&#34;  Gone Girl is far and away her best.  You can see the author working out the style and time shifting in this novel that shows up later in Gone Girl.  &#34;Dark Places&#34; is not nearly as good - but still a page turner by the time you get to the second half.  What I don't like as much in this book is the dark theme - &#34;Dark Places&#34; is the right title!  The main character is a bit hard to like, which also makes the book a bit more of a challenge.  Worth the read, especially if you are a Gillian Flynn, fan, but don't expect it to be nearly as good as &#34;Gone Girl.&#34;
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|the calculator is sooooooooooo awesome.!!!!!:) they don't have fractions but its great. I use it all most every day!!!!!!  I sometimes use it to see how many pages I have left on my book!!!!! :)! its great on KINDLE FIRE
B005IQZB14|5.0|I had a great time reading this book.  Exciting to see how she accomplished her mission.  I loved the different ways she went about her trip.  The money was not always there.  To see how she planned the trip was intresting and educational.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|I bought this particular DVD in order to own one of the most charming moments in Anna Netrebko's career.<br />Her rendering of Musetta's waltz here, in the open air theater, in front of thousands of people, is most endearing, and the public breaks out in bravos even before she is finished.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Kind of tedious read but the ending totally surprised me.  Usually I can predict  endings but was not up to par on this one.
B000F39MAQ|5.0|When I first saw Anna Netrebko in La Traviata in You Tube, it was the end of the first act, and I thought she was electrifying. Many fans of Netrebko agree that it is almost impossible to stop watching her when she acting.<br />In addition to obtaining a copy of the original Salzburg production, I have read many reviews and stumbled upon one written the day after the performance by Mario Vargas Llosa, the 2010 Nobel Prize winner for literature, for El País newspaper. In it he describes Anna's presence in all its splendor and flexibility to reach extremes of passion and drama in a rare way in which the character and the artist blend developing each other. For those of us who experienced Anna's performance as deeply as he did, Violetta will always be Anna's Violetta and &#34;nobody else's.&#34;
0547884591|5.0|If you're already a Tim Ferriss fan you gotta get this book, If you don't know who Tim is, you'll still like it.  Everyone can learn something from this book.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|If you thought this would be like \\"Band of Brothers\\", you were wrong.  This was a very disappointing mini-series, which is not nearly as well done as the other.  It is hard to follow and hard to stay with.  Borders on boring.  Avoid if you can.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|The title pretty much sums it up for me. This book was interesting. I wound up liking the murdered couple and got rather tired of of Mr. Corey's constant smart alek remarks even though they could be very funny at times. The plot has an unusual twist that Mr. Corey eventually figures out even though there are numerous people who try to stop him.<br /><br />The government thinks that the murdered couple has stolen a killer virus from them and goes on the usual CYA ( Cover Your  Asses) but at the same time tries to prevent John Corey from solving the real mystery.

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|enjoy the angry birds and help defeat the pigs to help retrieve their eggs.<br />remember the levels get harder the more you play
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|I ordered this movie as a gift to my family and there is a puncture threw the back of the case. I haven't opened it as I don't have time to re order before Christmas. I also was asked to rate the order a day before it even showed up at the house. Not very prompt on the shipping this time around
0553381695|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone over 18! I can't wait to read the other books as well. 5 stars.
0316069434|5.0|Love Harry Bosch. Could be on any police force anywhere in the US. Great sense of justice and fighting for the little guy. Had to finish the book before going to bed.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Great movie, came as described, and like I said above the extras on this movie are worth the price.  Makes a great gift for any woman
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is phenomenal! I slowly read every single word of this book, afraid that I would miss something and not wanting this story to end! Holder was amazing throughout this book and I just want to entwine my pinky with him! The ending of this book can only be described as perfection.
B00000G3PA|5.0|This is a very exciting and heartwarming movie. Great cast, you can't go wrong with it. The ending will make you cry and cheer.
B009157BWU|5.0|this movie was a real good story love the storyline on the pour little chimp finding his way with the head of th group so good watched it twice
B008YWY0HK|5.0|You can't go wrong with a Pixar movie, so well done and the story is very entertaining and super spellbinding for children. My granddaughter loves it and would watch it every day if she could.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read and I read ALOT! Colleen Hoover's first 2 books, Slammed and Point of Retreat had me totally and completely captivated from the first sentence. I truly didn't think her work could get better, but she has hit me with Hopeless. Out of approximately 250 books I have rated on GoodReads, I think this is my new all time favorite book Ever! I have never been so emotionally struck by a book. I love each and every word written and wouldn't change a thing. I even wrote Colleen Hoover a message, telling her how talented she is! She is truly gifted and I will ALWAYS click BUY NOW without thinking twice when it comes to Colleen Hoover!!
B0098460O4|5.0|Saw them on the You Tube version of Britain's got talent and was blown away.  Charlotte's vocal range has improved in my opinion.  Great CD.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|this video of the stage production is amazing. it blows away the hollywood movie version. the vocals are really good.
B000001DQI|5.0|This has to be the ultimate album he has ever done; especially with his co-writer Bernie Taupin.<br />I have listened over and over to this CD and I find something different to like about it every time.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|This series is going to be perfect for sci-fi fans who have a knack for dystopian tales. This particular series, dealing with zombies, grips you from the very beginning of the first episode which takes place at the start of the disease's spread. Throughout the series, you'll dangle on cliffhangers and surely be tempted to watch it all at once, all episodes back-to-back. Characters are complex, intriguing and far from perfect. I would recommend giving this a shot. One episode will prove whether it's right for you or not.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great book to have on the shelf.  Even a better read.  My First Tim book but I love it!  A real life guide and I am an experienced chef
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game, but there's a few problems. No caves, very small worlds (249x249), and with no caves, Diamonds are near impossible to find. I would get this game while it's in it's current state, because updates will come, and this game will get more expensive. Buy it while it's in its Beta.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another great one by John Grisham. He has a way of drawing the reader into the world and not just into the conflict of that world.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I like that it has an index and you can color code each note.  You can make a checklist or write paragraphs.  Easy to use!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Looks good no complaints , very good price and packaging was great as well . I would have to give it a five star
B0030B624E|5.0|A great movie, a very funny take on zombies. Emma Stone is extremely hot in this movie and Woody is hilarious. Very much worth the money.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Lana is just magic, all the tracks are just perfect, dont walk down to the cd shop ~run down there & get this !!!
B009EAO38C|5.0|Cello Wars.... nuff said. This is a random sentence to fulfill the absolutely stupid and idiotic word requirement.  Two words.
0316228532|3.0|THE CASUAL VACANCY will undoubtedly be compared to J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books but be advised that except for the underlying grimness in both books, VACANCY is a different from Potter as night from day and this novel is definitely not for children or teens.<br /><br />In CASUAL VACANCY readers are introduced to Barry Fairbrother, recently deceased member of the Pagford Parish Council, but a presence that continues to linger via the lives of his many enemies and friends.  In the parish of Pagford the residents are an angry lot, prone to petulant, anonymous criticism of others, each desperate to keep a deep, dark secret permanently hidden while fearful that the wheels have come off the train and something odious is about to happen...........and often it does.<br /><br />The book is timely in it's depiction of the ongoing chasm between the rich and the poor and of the political machinations undertaken by each side in their respective attempts to ensure or overthrow the status quo. Diversity and catastrophe is the order of the day for the children who live in The Fields on the outskirts of Pagford and their lives read like something out of Oliver Twist.<br /><br />Rowling has crammed a lot of layers and complexity into this book with humor, pathos, morality tales and allegories running rampant on every page and many readers, if they look closely, will see themselves or their attitudes depicted in those pages.  I still haven't decided whether this book is thought provoking and uplifting or the biggest \\"downer\\" of the year.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Purchased to replace a VHS tape. Almost wordless movie, uses a child's imagination and the animation  to tell the tale.  One of the few short films I was willing to use at my preschool as a last day before Christmas break treat with popcorn and hot chocolate.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is a fantastic album. The covers are well made and blended with classical masterpieces. You will find yourself wanting to standup and direct the orchestra, or air-play the piano or cello as you listen to this music.
B00275EHJG|5.0|One way to a child's heart is to buy their favorite film.  To capture if forever? Buy all three! The grandkids still love them and enjoy them every time they watch!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was only a few dollars more than just the dark knight rises movie.  Great movie.  Quality is great.  Movie is great.
1401324029|5.0|I was so excited to get this book and it lived up to my expectations! I know Mr. Castle is a character in a TV show, but to have the actual book in print makes it even more fun.
141659521X|2.0|Just not my &#34;cup of tea&#34;.  I couldn't get into the thriller part...slow for me.  Perhaps it went too deep into characters and I lost track.  My busy life kept me from sitting and reading it all at one sitting so I forgot the characters.  My fault!<br />Sorry.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|I had gotten this for my grandchildren who love Toy Story! They were so happy to get this along with the other two in the series!

0547884591|2.0|Wordy but not informative.  In no way is this a  'cook book'.  More a  'self help'  book with a few bland recipes.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|One of the best albums I've heard in years. Equals Adele in each song being killer and not filler. Phillip has a unique sound and a very wide appeal.
B00002Z88D|2.0|In many respects this is exactly what you want it to be.  It starts with the symphony and the metal band slowly kicks in with rising intensity until metal band and symphony are one thick slab of epic sound.  And then, well, um...James Hetfield starts to sing.  Ooh, ouch.  Not good.  Not only is off tune, he can't decide whether to snarl or sing really bad opera.  To make things worse, he relies on the the crowd to sing certain lyrics, which you can only sort of hear.  I'm sure this was a good idea at the live show, but on the recording it just piles onto the sad state of the vocal tracks.<br /><br />Oh and then there's Lars Ulrich's drumming.  I'm sure he tells all his friends \\"those symphony weenies just could keep up with me\\".  Um, I doubt it Lars.  It was Lars that was too inconsistent.  Listen carefully, slight changes in Lars rhythm all over the place put the whole thing just a bit out of sync.<br /><br />Too bad, this was a great Spinal Tap inspired concept.
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|My son did not particularly enjoy it. I think the plot is more grown-up- like Antz. I liked it, but I never get to watch it because my son chooses the movies.
B004UHF51S|3.0|If you really love Michael Franks, then you appreciate this addition to his catalog.<br />Add it so you will not have to by a future box set collection.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I couldn't put it down until I had finished it. Kind of a quick read but your able to fully be immersed in the story.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Donald Fagen put in some studio time on this one.<br />The previous &#34;FM&#34; still takes the cake.<br />Personally, I prefer more of his complex chord changes used with Steely Dan.<br />It is too easy just to vamp on a few chords.
B00APUQJLO|4.0|For reasons I may not have yet fully analyzed, I was drawn into Cosmopolis from the very beginning and it commanded my attention to the very end.  I cannot think of another film in recent memory that has held my interest at such a high level for its duration.  I may take a bit of a different view of its message.  I believe it is about a highly intelligent and successful financial/economic modeler who has made a large fortune predicting the price movement of investments.  His predictions are made using highly sophisticated computer analysis of vast amounts of information leading to \\"nanosecond\\" timing of investment decisions.  While he employs and consults with others, it is clear that he is the brain upon which his success was achieved.  His problem is that his financial models are run in a vacuum relative to human existence and accordingly, his life has been spent in a financial future that does not yet exist, except within his models, and it indeed may never exist outside his models.  Because his models lack any regard for humanity and his continuous view of the future is unreal, he eventually becomes depressed and sociopathic.  However, he has some recognition of what the lack of real human involvement is doing to him and begins to seek out human contact and input, but it may be too late.  He also knows that the manner in which he, and others, have made their fortunes has had a significant negative impact on society because it ignores any human impact.  The movie begins on a day when he has made unusually large investments based upon a predicted currency price outcome which could cause the collapse of his empire if he does not make a decision contrary to his model's predicted result.  I believe much of the film deals with the contradictions between a sociopath and his need for human contact and that his models do not model human existence.  I do not know if this is the gist of the filmmaker's intent, but this seemed to me to be a plausible scenario supported in varying degrees by the film's dialog and visual content.<br /><br />I think Cosmopolis captured and held my attention so strongly because of my financial/economic background and the less evident underlying truths upon which the economic scenario of the film appeared to be built.  However, the film is not straightforward in its disclosure of details leading me to this view so I will not pretend to profess any \\"correct\\" understanding if one indeed exists.  There are reviews of this film that are negative because others found it to be too different, too difficult or lacking a plot and accordingly, the film did not capture their attention as strongly as mine.  While I may not have realized the filmmakers' intent, I remain confident that many viewers will find that it has substance beyond what those reviewers perceived.<br /><br />The best adjective I could come up with to describe the film is \\"interesting\\".  It is far different from the average popular fare and its dialog may be difficult to grasp occasionally, but I thought Robert Pattison did a good job with a good but difficult script.  I did not notice any other significant artistic or technical pluses or minuses.  I rented this movie from Amazon and renters do not get the benefit of additional materials that may be included on the purchased DVD.  I do not usually view much of the additional materials supplied with DVDs because I usually do not need to have a film explained to me and I hold no fanatical interest.  But, in the case of Cosmopolis, some additional material concerning the film's substance might be helpful.  If you are looking for some lighter entertainment, this film does not meet your need.  However, if you happen to be in a pensive or analytical frame of mind, I would recommend Cosmopolis for at least one viewing.  I think it was a very good film.arying degrees by the film's dialog and visual content.<br /><br />I think Cosmopolis captured and held my attention so strongly because of my financial/economic background and the less evident underlying truths upon which the economic scenario of the film appeared to be built.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adele is a real artist.  She does not dance or dress in other characters; which is a great thing.<br />Similar to the true performing artists who actually sit down and write compositions, she showcases her work by performing them with extraordinary presentation.
0385344333|5.0|Error made in my previous feedback to Jacks!! Clumsy dealing with the survey. I gave great review but the stars came out a 1 rating. My error. Jack's gave me SUPER service and high quality product. I hope this will help with the previous mix up.  Use Jacks for both anytime.

B007HACDLK|5.0|This was the &#34;old&#34; Vince Flynn back! Read it in one day as I could not put it down. Would recommend to all his fans. If you haven't read his novels before this is a good one to start with.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Good read on the Kindle but not one of the best books I have read recently.  The ending was a bit of a let down..
0689815816|5.0|This has been one of the favorites for my children as toddlers.  My two year old tries to &#34;read&#34; it himself, and actually recites many of the words in his adorable little way. It's so cute, and the perfect length for a bedtime story.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Mr. Grey and Anastasia just can't seem to get out of your head. If you took the time to read book 1 and 2, then you might as well finish the series. Probably my least favorite of the series, but it does finally put closure to the whole crazy love story.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. This copy while good has a low volume issue that should be resolved before selling any more copies.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|A great classic Trilogy in Blu-Ray. A great way to replace those 3 bulky DVD's in a nice compact blu ray set.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The author is an introvert and knows the subject well.  Good scientific basis utilized.  Leaves one unclear regarding your own characteristic, however.  Seems to be &#34;all or nothing&#34; as to introvert/extrovert.  Left me wondering which I am.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Well if you are considering this book, then you must have read Fifty Shades of Grey. Don't worry if you are at the edge of your seat and upset with the ending of book 1 you don't have to wait long for the story to pick up. There is no lag time between books 1 and 2. It's like you just started another chapter of the same book.  Same basic story line with a few more twists and turns.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I couldn't believe it was this good! 3 very different movies, but this is at least as good as Dark Knight.
B007WFTFG6|2.0|This is a good app for kids under 2 probably but my 2 old got very bored with it and didn't want anything to do with it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Nick and Amy Dunne are made for each other, but theirs is not a fairy tale romance. Rather, their relationship tells the story of a marriage's descent into utter depravity. Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn's widely popular thriller, suggests people can never really truly know one another. The story serves as an extreme example of how the personality we show others is often a fabrication. In this case, the identity struggle faced by husband and wife brings dire consequences.<br /><br />Some of the plot points later in the book seem overly coincidental. Plus, by the time the reader gets to the end of the book, it seems like the story just stops. All in all, the book effectively captures the voice of two completely despicable characters, which is why I can imagine this fairly engaging read also has quite a few negative reviews.<br /><br />Read the full review at JeriWB.com

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical to read this trilogy because I am very picky when it comes to books. I have to get interested within about the first couple of pages to stick to it and this was totally that for me.
0802130208|5.0|This is one of my top 5 favorite books of all-time. If you've never read it, get this book NOW!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Out of all three books in the series this is definitely my favorite. I couldn't put this one down and my family was not very happy about it.
B003M6BKB2|5.0|This series is full of teen problems and drama. It's like an all questions answered for teens! Wonderful video quality too, although, of course, HD is better then standard. Had a fiew network problems, but I think it was just because Charter was adding some new tweaks to our electricity box. :-)

B007IXWL2C|3.0|This is the last book in trilogy and in my opinion it is very rushed and it just seemed like she was trying to end it very quickly because she was running out of ideas.
B004BC7MRM|4.0|It is definitely a departure for Kid Rock but I like the direction.  It has a very relaxed feel and I really enjoy it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second book in the Hunger Games Trilogy and although I'm only half way through I can say that it has me more enticed than the first one.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I'm a sucker for historical novels and biographies.  Follett weaves the lives of disparate nations and families into a compelling read.  I was entralled by his mastery of the written word and expecially, his research and displayed knowledge of history.  I was surprised to find myself sympathtic to the families and people of the Russian Revolution and the characters role in World War II.  I can't wait for the thrid book.<br /><br />Bill  Frankenberger
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is the first book in the trilogy and it really surprised me and I wish I would have started reading it sooner. Everyone should read this book. Even men.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This novel is far from Grisham's best.  It plods through the narrative's twists and turns.  At times it is exciting but more often than not, it is tediously boring.  I have read all of Grisham's novels and I find this one to be the least of the best.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love creating art on this app, my boyfriend loves it, and my 5-year-old son loves it. The app is easy to use and works great on my Kindle Fire HD. We have had it for a few days and have already spent several hours on it.
0470913029|5.0|I wish The Paleo Diet book had been available 40 + years ago when I, ignorantly, destroyed my health by following Arnold Ehret's Mucusless Diet, an extreme version of the Vegan diet. The major problem with most vegetarian diets is that they are too alkaline. The only highly acid-forming (based on mineral ash) foods (substantiated by Mayo Clinic charts on the acidity/alkalinity of foods) are flesh foods, including eggs. Over time, many vegetarians are unable to maintain homeostasis, suffer from a \\"run-down battery,\\" and fall into a low-energy funk.<br /><br />A lacto-vegetarian diet is also far from ideal. No Intelligent person can rationalize cow's milk (meant only for baby calves) as an appropriate food for grown humans. Grains are a virtually worthless food, very low in nutrients, and even these nutrients, because of the phytic acid in the grains, are difficult to extract. The answer nutritionally is the Paleo diet of fruits, vegetables nuts and seed, and, most importantly, the right flesh foods--grass fed beef, low-mercury fish, and free range poultry.<br /><br />The proof of any diet is two-fold: 1) How you feel and function on it over an extended period of time, say several months; and 2) objective medical tests (blood work, cardio, etc.). And based on my experience and that of many people I know, the Paleo diet is optimal diet for most people. You do need to fine-tune it through experimentation, but this book provides the basic framework.<br /><br />Relative to fine-tuning the Paleo Diet, you may find the following books helpful: Food Combining Made Easy;  Ayurveda: The Science of Self Healing; and Fit For Life.

B002Q8GZ62|5.0|Spandau Ballet did the unthinkable and released an album containing different twists to their hits from the 80's. This was an ingenious idea and they deserve major kudos for pulling it off! Chant No. 10 has to be my favorite, along with the title song. This cd is difficult to find, so if you are a fan of Spandau Ballet, I highly recommend you order this.

A fascinating tale of two enemy World War II pilots - an American rookie, and a German ace, who were brought together by fate, for ten frightening minutes, in the skies over Germany, five days before Christmas.  The American, Charlie Brown, was desperately trying to keep his battered plane aloft, and trying to save his crew.  The German, Franz Stigler, could have easily shot them down, and finished them off.  But, his own personal beliefs, and love of humanity is what saved those Americans that fateful day.  Franz became Charlie's guardian angel - he shielded the crippled American plane, and led the Americans out of harm's way, to safety.  And, neither pilot ever forgot their encounter with the enemy.  Charlie always remembered that German pilot who saved his life that day, and always wished he could express his heartfelt gratitude.  And, Franz always wondered whatever happened to that brave, young, American pilot, whose life he had saved that day.  Buy this book!!  It's a great read - an expertly crafted tale of courage, compassion, honor and integrity.  And, it has a happy ending.
015206057X|5.0|I can't say enough about this book, I was given this book prior to having my first born.  I remember crying after reading it, maybe because I was hormonal, I'm not sure, but I loved it.  We probably started reading this book to our son at about 6 months old.  He's currently 16 months and loves, loves this book.  I also love the illustrations!
0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper by Jodie Picoult, is an incredible, thought provoking book about a family that is torn apart by illness. This book's theme walks a tight rope when speaking in terms of what is morally right and wrong, and will have you questioning your own morality by the time you are finished reading. It shows how life's decisions are far from being straightforward or black-and-white, and just how difficult making the \\"right\\" decision can be. This book digs deep into the nitty gritty of genetic testing, organ donation, and end of life care - and will make you step back, and seriously rethink your views. Although some reviewers of this book referred to it as a \\"Lifetime cliche\\", I would have to say that this could not be father from the truth. This novel depicts a real family, and shows just how dysfunctional life can really be.<br /><br />The Washington Square Press published My Sister's Keeper on January 1, 2004 as a book that any reader would enjoy. An easy to understand, informal writing style truly makes it a good read for any audience. My Sister's Keeper is written like no other novel that I have ever read. Although it is written in first person, every character is the narrator at some point. The varied points of view accomplish a writing style that is fresh, and interesting.<br /><br />The plot of this book will make it hard to put down.  Anna, a child born to essentially save her sister Kate's life, is tired of not having rights to her own body. Although Anna is perfectly healthy, she has had blood transfusions, surgeries and shots that are too numerous to count. Anna was a test tube baby, made for one reason only - to keep Kate alive. When Anna's parents decide they are going to take one of her kidneys to help Kate who is in kidney failure, she has had enough. She hires a lawyer in hopes of winning a case to be medically emancipated from her parents. There is one problem though, Anna loves her sister Kate, and doesn't want her to die. Should she continueon the path to medical emancipation, continue to tear her family apart, and have her sister's death on her conscience - or should she give up the fight for medical freedom, and give up her kidney along with it? The real question is; are the bonds of sisterhood enough to trump Anna's need for medical freedom?<br /><br />In the end, I was very impressed with Picoult's ability to create such a captivating story. \\"Lifetime cliché\\", which I would define as a cheesy half baked edition of a good love story - is nowhere near the definition I would use for this novel. This book writes of the chaotic, dysfunctional, heartbreaking story of a family that no matter what front they put on, does not have all of the answers. If you are looking for a fantastic read, then you should read My Sister's Keeper - but don't forget to strap in, because you are about to embark on an emotional roller coaster.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|First time through was for the wow factor. Second time through was to pay attention to how young, untrained Anastasia, turns Christian's life around. She gives him love. She helps him realize he has value. She shows him that he is loveable and deserves love. She brings out the best in this man. Great story...dig beyond the 'good stuff.'
B003ZSI7R2|3.0|Really liked the lead singer's voice, but the repetitiveness of phrases and specific measures became annoying after a while.  It was obvious that this was a low budget recording - a strong horn section would have helped.
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|Never written a review before, but was compelled to. Seriously, this works and is really easy and fun. Anyone can do it.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is an exciting new sure to be a favorite for all our grandchildren young and old. We love it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved it.....and so will you!  I hated for this to end.  More please!  Good job Hugh!  You're my new buff.
630469654X|5.0|This has been one of my most treasured movies, right up there with DR. Zivago, Lady & the Tramp, Dumbo.<br />I love this movie.
B004HYDL1K|1.0|RELAY ON KILLING AND NOTHING MORE. YOU REMADE KILL BILL VOL 1-3, THE MOVIE HAD ITS MOMENTS, THEY WERE FAR AND IN BETWEEN. YOU HAVE THE TALENT, NOW PUT THEM TO GOOD USED.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|This is a fun filled older video that my own children liked. We are hoping that our grandchildren will make it a favorite<br />as well.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|love this game. lots of fun and great time spender. I want more samurai games. definitely worth the download. Cant get enough
B0049M7BDE|4.0|Let me say first off, I like this movie. It is cleverly written and well acted and a delight to watch. However, I still like the original film with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway better. The plot is basically the same in both films with the exception of the ending.The writer saw fit to give the new film a fairytale ending as opposed to the more realistic ending of the first film - is this because audiences are softer now? Idon't know. But, that aside this is still a lot of fun and a great way to spend a snowy winter evening.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|The movie is great and storyline is moving the audience move to deep emotion of loss, unconditioned love. Every characters were perfect especially Oskar Shell. This will be in my toplist of memorable movies.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|I don't know how anyone cannot love this movie. It is one of the most heartwarming films ever made, with an outstanding performance by James Cromwell ---- and I'm not the only one in my house that loves it! My cat, Mischief&#34;, is absolutely transfixed whenever I put it on (she particularly likes the duck that thinks it is a rooster)! Highly recommended to anyone young or old.
075640407X|5.0|Simply put, you should purchase this immediately! I have recommended this more than any other fantasy book I have read.  It is the new standard for Fantasy (one I worry whether the author himself will be able to live up to).  It's really hard to put down, so, be sure to have a day available when you start reading it.<br /><br />You'll want to yell at Kvothe for his foolishness, cheer at his victories, and laugh at his ridiculous situations.  One thing you won't do is forget him.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I bought the 30th Anniversary collection that did not include the model car.<br /><br />I remember years back when the briefcase was released and always meant to pick it up, but then blu rays became dominant and I'm happy that I held out for this version.<br /><br />First, you get all versions of the movie. I was concerned that if I didn't buy the super-deluxe version that I would miss out on some of the versions. I worried unnecessarily as the theatrical, international, director's, and final cut are all included.<br /><br />What's the 4th disc on the super-deluxe version, then? It's the DVD of the final cut, so unless you're a slow adopter you're getting everything in the 3 disc option. Right now it's about a $30 difference, all for a different box, a model car, and a DVD.<br /><br />Look to other reviews if you're looking for specific ratios or values, but I will say that I watched this with a few uninterested friends who were wowed when they saw the movie for the first time. They couldn't believe that a movie this old could look that good.<br /><br />Result: a fine purchase that will keep me busy looking through the plethora of extras. Not necessarily for the collector, it's truly a superior experience.
3836501899|4.0|Definitely worth it... brings me back to when I took photos with a polaroid camera.  You'll see that digital is not the be-all & end-all for capturing time.  Enjoy!
1417709049|5.0|This is definitely my preferred version, which has the hardback and full color. I couldn't imagine reading this book without the heavy hardback and full sized pages.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book ever I suggest every one read this spectacular book right now. Buy buy buy. Don't just stand there, buy it now!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote. I use it almost every day to capture recipes, gift ideas, inspiring website designs and inspirational quotes.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|Only read three pages. Not sure why I am doing this have not read enough of the book to write a review
B0017I1IZA|5.0|This was another wonderful addition to the Stephanie Plum collection. I will be getting the rest of the books in the collection.
B003LPNGWA|5.0|84 Charing Cross Road is irresistible to anyone able to appreciate the goodness of its spirit and its spirited characters.
B0015AARJI|4.0|it is incredible that on top that we have to buy another control,it has no USB cable to charge it. This is ridiculous, just another way on squeezing a few bucks out of our pockets.
B000T433CO|3.0|I think my favorite part of this movie is the way Cameron Diaz looks.  Her wardrobe and her quirky ways work so well together.  Eye candy!  Of course, I love Jude, so it was a no brainer devoting 100 minutes of my time to this chick flick.  The plot is relatively simple and predictable, but still heart warming.  I bought it for my 20 year old daughter who loves movies like this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So glad this was my first Kindle loan!!! Great quick read that is very hard to put down. The rest of the series is just as good I hear.
B005LAII1C|1.0|This movie is nothing more than a 2 hr \\"Family Guy\\" episode, and it's not Season 2 \\"Family Guy\\", it's Season 45 \\"Family Guy\\" (yes, I realize the show is only in its 11th season). The jokes are hackneyed and unfunny. Everything has a been-there-done-that feel to it. Seth MacFarlane doesn't even try to make a new voice for the titular character, it's just Peter Griffin as a bear.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg strikes little new ground beyond his other recent forays into comedy such as \\"The Other Guys\\". He's proven he's a decent comedic actor (he still rocks way more in dramas), but this clearly wasn't his best choice for another move in that direction.<br /><br />I could go on, but honestly, I don't get why this movie did so well and got such great reviews. It's an okay rental, but it's just not worth owning.
0316227706|5.0|I bought this book for a christmas present for someone and loved it so much I had to get one for myself also. It is filled with great quality pictures of dogs doing what they do best, playing! The quality of the pictures is absolutely awesome, so clear and crisp. It makes a great coffee table book, that I think any animal lover would really like to have.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Where is Matt Damon?  What a difference.  I kept looking for him.  Even when he gets old enough to need a cane  he would bring more excitement.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|This show is surprising..I didn't think Id like it...  I did like this season better than the first, and it make me anxious to see the next season...Great show if your into that era...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does exactly what it needs to do without any fuss. No extra junk I don't want.<br />I like the page that shows the times, as in how much video viewing time etc.
1609611543|5.0|Something out there is causing the physical catastrophe that is happening to people today. This with over processed dairy products and pollutants may hold the answer.
B00633W614|5.0|& the saga continues - I can't wait for the final book of the trilogy to come out - Jeffrey Archer is a master storyteller - I was hooked from page 1!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have trouble falling and staying asleep this app has been very helpful for me. its free so hove it a try!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|There was no doubt in my mind about Hugh Jackman's talent as I saw him on Broadway in \\"The Boy from Oz\\" and he was brilliant.  However, I wasn't sure what to expect from Anne Hathaway's vocals. Wow, when I tell you how pleasantly surprised I am. Ms Hathaway rendition of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" is so powerful and moving - it is so rich!!!  Even if you buy this just for that cut you won't be disappointed!
B005ZUR724|1.0|They say that this game is for the kindle fire but after purchasing it and downloading it keeps telling me that I need to update it but there is no update. I am an avid gamer and I am so pissed off that I wasted my money on this.
B0081X40HW|5.0|This album is the perfect blend of fun pop and gritty R&B. Haley's voice is soulful and shines throughout. While I like her pop side, the standouts for me are the bluesy tunes like Undone. This, I think, is her niche. My all-time favorite Haley song is still House of the Rising Sun, which she performed on Idol.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is Great, Great, Great!!! So thankful it' s Free. I believe the word of God is necessary for Life...
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Phillip Phillips is one of the most impressive artists to come from American Idol. His voice is pure magic. He has the bit of grit I love, and sings the lyrics as if he's ripping them from his soul. Not only does he sound incredible, he's an accomplished musician and a talented writer.<br /><br />During the show, I was impressed that he always remained true to himself, rather than trying to fit into a musical mold. Nothing has changed since then. The album he created here is nothing short of spectacular because he stayed true to the unique style we all fell in love with.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really enjoyed the way this story was written.  I thought it was a unique approach that really worked well.  Essentially, each chapter goes back-n-forth between 2004 and 2008.  Same characters, just a different time.  But, the characters are very different - obviously something significant occurred between the two times.  It really sucks you in!
B005XQ973M|5.0|I love the book simply because it reminds me &#34;NEVER TO FORGET&#34;.  Although very graphic, I believe it is important to know that there was a time in our history when there was no respect for life by some.  How could one human being treat a fellow human being so?  History is supposed to teach us a lesson.  Thank you Iris Chang for all your hard work and dedication to keeping this horrific story alive although you are not here to hear me.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|I was hoping this would be fun to watch, but it turned out to be more than just fun. Great movie in my opinion.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once again, love Nicholas Sparks. Always draws you in and won't let you go until the very end. Loved it,
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Haven't read the book yet and probably won't for a while because I've got many books on the list before it, but I had to buy it on principle. Finally, a book released with a price that reflects that it's just a digital copy and there were no extra costs of printing, binding, shipping and storing! I know, I know...Amazon doesn't determine the Kindle content prices, and they underprice the books, yada, yada, yada...but still. I just can't justify buying the digital version when the book is cheaper, and I don't want to buy books anymore now that I've taken the paperless plunge...so I end up getting nothing! So, although I won't read this book right away, and it's even one that I may have passed on altogether, I had to buy it on principle. And yes, I know how petty that makes me, but so be it.
B004X4R49Y|3.0|Good movie but boring to watch on a long flight. It put me to sleep. I think I would have enjoyued it more if I were on a short flight.
B007WFTFG6|4.0|My Grandaughter loves this app she is only 3 and she plays with it for hours it really is good for her age.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|right from the start i really enjoyed this book ,unfortunatly not all are born to run ,at less not starting over 50 as I crashed and burned- bugga ,,but i did give it a go and will try again abit slower this time ,I even got my daughter to read it and she also really enjoyed it
B007HGPBRC|1.0|This is a slim volume, and only makes me miss Mr. hitchens even more. But he faced his death with his classic upfrontness and courage and no nonsense approach that he brought to the rest of his experiences.  And with his usual sense of the absurd.  Worth reading as a last word from CH.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|My son recommended this book to me.  This has already begun to help me with communicating with friends and family.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I loved the documentary &#34;Searching For Sugarman&#34;, and the hard facts of this beautiful man's life - how he embraced life without bitterness, sought so little materially in his life, and how gracefully he accepted fame.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Totally unexpected .  Twists and turns.  Unexpected ending, however i think it was left wide open for a sequel again.
B009ZE27US|1.0|I don't like this at all I know that its supposed to be funny, but its actually really lame and I don't like it at all.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Good raunchy fun.  I liked it.  Nothing else to add, except I have to add 14 more words to review.
B0076DELIG|5.0|For all of us fans of Harry this is a must read.  After so many novels about the same person it's always like catching up with an old friend you can't wait to visit :)
B0099114WO|5.0|My husband and I saw this at the theatre.  If you want to wake up a guy about the fact that you actually do want relations, they need to watch this.  All we ever hear about is men saying &#34;yeah, my wife won't give it up&#34;, nobody ever talks about the women who are wanting to &#34;give it up&#34;-and their partners aren't willing/capable or involved enough to get the hint- this movie gives them that hint in a funny/comical way.  I can't wait until the women that I work with see this movie when I lend it to them, and hear what they have to say.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The rise of Batman and an introduction to Catwoman and Robin.  This could be as long running a franchise as the James bond films.  If you are a fan of the old Marvel graphic novels (comic books to the uninitiated), you will like this new twist on an old theme.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I bought this for a guy at work who loves batman and already has the other 2 in the series (or I would have gotten him the triology).  I'm assuming that he is going to love it!  If I hear anything different, I'll add that to this rating.
B009VA1FN6|3.0|I found this story to be very slow and dull to read, it just seemed to go on and on. The book spent a lot of time on my table. l just could not get into it.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|This is a classic movie that I have watched several time.  I Highly recomment it for all ages.  A must see!
1451627297|5.0|Haven't finished it yet and probably will not for a very long time -- on purpose!  This is the kind of book you can pick up and instantaneously lose yourself.  Wonderful character development, intriguing story, and to my mind, just plain fun to read...my favorite &#34;curl up on the couch book&#34;!
B001DPHDCY|4.0|This is a wonderful movie and my son loved it!!  My only disappointment was that this is the second movie we bought through Amazon in the last couple months that has had a slice in the plastic cover and through the paper cover.  The movies however have been intact with no scratches, we just had to transfer them to different cases.
1847879071|5.0|I earned a PhD in business and have taken at least a half dozen stats classes in my academic career.  I've read tons of those little green sage statistics primers, I've collected editions of my prior favorite: Hair et. al, but Andy Field's text, which I discovered simply by searching on average customer reviews, is by far THE ALL TIME BEST STATS BOOK I'VE READ.  I attribute this principally to the fact that the author is extremely engaging and exceptionally pragmatic in his explanations of concepts, applications, and step by step interpretation of SPSS output.  To my mind, as the author of the quintessential &#34;Soup to Nuts&#34; stats book, Field does for statistics what Julia Child did for French cooking!
B000FBJHT4|5.0|After reading Witness to Roswell I was left feeling hurt that we, the public could be handed such a lie.<br />The Day After Roswell not only explained the cover-ups but many  other fasinating discoveries. The<br />book was an absolutly excellent,not only story but documentary.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|I'm sure he will love it; he's 9 years old and loves any Lego items.  I always ask his father what to get my grandson, and this was on the list.  Can't wait to give it to him.
1612130283|2.0|not well written. This is not your typical love story. Actually, it's not a love story at all. didn't feel the need to read #2 or #3.  a great romance? just wondering what part in the book was romantic?  the part where he ties her up? the part where he spanks her? or maybe when he tells her what to wear and what to eat and when to exercise?  being a submissive isn't romantic. It sounds like a teenager wrote this book.  it is so far fetched. a 27 year old millionaire. really??  c'mon.
0345803485|5.0|This story has much more depth and meaning than most readers give it credit for.  E.L. James clearly assigns/represents metaphorically the main characters in the book: Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. Anastasia Steele is somewhat cold as steel in the sense she does not express her emotions nor is she &#34;allowed to&#34; as a submissive of Greys when in &#34;The Room of Pain&#34;. &#34;Steele&#34; is strong, tough, controlled, resilient and able to stand on her own without depending on anyone.  At first Grey appears this way but as the story unfolds one sees that it is Ana who Grey becomes so emotionally dependent on.  Grey looks to Ana as a way to deal with his own demons of an abusive childhood.  An example of this can be seen metaphorically with Anastasia's name.  Ana as she is known in the story is an acronym for anorexia.  Obviously persons who have &#34;Ana&#34; do not eat and Anastasia is always skipping meals or not eating in this story.  This is a &#34;sore&#34; spot for Grey who was starving as a child and he is forced to revisit this demon of his past time and time again throughout the book.  Christian Grey is always demanding Ana eat.  Is is his desire to feed her and his name Christian metaphorically captures the passage biblically of Christ feeding the five thousand on only a few loaves of bread and fish....  Grey by essence of his name appears in this story to be caught in a &#34;gray&#34; area between control/lust and the struggle to give up control to care, trust and love another person-all indications of internal conflict due to a traumatized past. Grey and Steele are complimentary characters in this book in the sense that steel is the color gray- quoting Christian Grey to Anastasia Steele &#34;....see how good we go together ?&#34;<br />  Clearly there is MUCH more to this story than lustful sex, much more than it is given credit for.
1451695195|4.0|It's a very good book ,sure for scientist and academics, people who needs especial proof about near-death experinces,about conscience outside the brain
B0086700CM|5.0|Very exciting!  I LOVE this game.<br />All you do is pay attention, and have fun!<br />Enjoy, and be carefull!<br />Happy Holidays!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Relaxes the mind, soothes the nerves, makes you want to sing along with it.  &#34;Set Fire to the Rain&#34; has been in my mind since I first heard it.  A really great album,  and the DVD makes you want to listen that much more.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This movie was purchased as a gift for my 5 and 10 year old daughters. They love this movie, and at the current price, I couldn't pass it up! Any Dr. Seuss movie is a winner in my book ;-)
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the tangents and detours.  The many tips covering an eclectic range of subjects were entertaining at worst and extremely useful at best.  If you're reading this expecting a cookbook devoted to recipes, you're probably not in the right place.  However, if you're looking for a lesson plan on how to learn anything, this book is for you.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie was purchased as a gift for my two daughters, as they love Dr. Seuss anything...so I figured purchasing this movie would be a win in their book. And at the price amazon.com had offered, I couldn't lose!
B008YWY0HK|1.0|The DVD protection prevents this from playing on computers and some DVD players. Use another format or netflix for this title. Disney has a reputation for these problems.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|more to it than one would think, there is alot of emotional and realtionship issues.  HOT - if you are not an open minded person with relationships and sex this series in not for you
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I can't stop watching this movie, really well done, alot of action, and explosions.. and to see the m issouri come out and play is<br />just great.. the effects are top notch..and the bass if you have a home theartre system will knock you out of your seat<br /> thumbs up on this
B007IXWL2C|5.0|more to it than one would think, there is alot of emotional and realtionship issues.  HOT - if you are not an open minded person with relationships and sex this series in not for you
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|this would have been a great movie if it wasn't for the factn the jack asses that made it, wasn't doing it through a cam corder..<br />the whole entire movie is recorded with a hand held, which absolutely pulls you away from the entertainment..<br />if they broke the movie up , atleast it would have been more tolerable..to see the whole thing done with a hand held just ruined the whole experience of the show..
B007IXWKUK|5.0|more to it than one would think, there is alot of emotional and realtionship issues.  HOT - if you are not an open minded person with relationships and sex this series in not for you
B00A4A2N6K|1.0|why do i have to re-buy this entire album i just want the new ones. This is a waste. Is there anybody else out there that feels my pain?!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I was hoping all the sex parts would be less and more adventuress. Sorry, but I am 82 and not 40! I would probably have liked it then to pep up my marriage, as I am sure all the women who buy this kind of book are.
0920668372|4.0|I read this book when I was like 8 years old. I'm 23 now and still remember the whole thing because it ripped open my heart and shit in the ventricles. Don't read this to your children! It's tragic and traumatizing as hell. Look at the other reviews! They all mention how sad the book is and how it will undoubtedly make you cry. WHAT KIND OF CHILDREN'S BOOK IS THAT. Read this on your own if you're curious or masochistic but do your kids a favor and read them a story that's cute or funny instead and won't leave them lying in bed at night weeping at the thought of their mother aging and dying.

B004A8ZWW4|4.0|This movie shows the dark side with the family drama piece included.  It is a feel good movie but a bit rough for younger kids.
B007XF0X6G|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this title. Action packed and fast paced. It was an improvement over clash of the titans. Granted this is not a masterpiece or something worthy of any awards. I still enjoyed it for what it was.
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|Movie was a feel good movie about coming together and helping each other.  There are sad parts and a few parts that dragged but overall worth the money and time to see it
B00701897I|4.0|If you are a fan of adventure titles like Indiana jones and the like than you will enjoy this smaller scale family friendly movie.
B003UESJF6|3.0|I'm a will ferrell fan and this was OK but not one of his best. Could take it or leave it. Would rather have seen it on tv rather than having paid for it.
B0058BI896|5.0|Not your typical sit-com. The audience responses are sincere and BIG. The performances endearing, and the writing really fun.  They say laughter is the best medicine. This is a very healthy show. You may need to understand  geek culture a bit to buy in.  Star Trek, World of Warcraft, Firefly (YAY!!), techie stuff, science. But innocence struggling to come to terms with a not so innocent and messy real life is pretty universal.
B004G600A4|5.0|I love this movie, my 5 year old son loves this movie, even my grumpy old &#34;grinch&#34; of a husband cracks a smile and even a laugh whilst watching this one. One for all the family!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I chose this book because i absolutely love the Red Hot Chili Peppers and especially Anthony Kiedis. It opened my eyes and made me have a little better understanding of addiction.
B005R32L66|3.0|Skype is an excellent product, however this version from the Amazon store is an older version, we had to uninstall it and download the most current version from the Google Play Store.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have been waiting for a few books to come out (sequels of some). I love a good love story and just found one.  Looking for a good, keep you reading book......this is it!  Read it in one day and will re-read it.  There were laugh out loud parts, tears welling up in your eyes parts.  You name the emotion, it is in here.  I loved the characters and they way the story unfolded and circled around.  Loved Sky, Six and especially Holder........Holder, what can you say about Holder.  I am in my forties so far from high school, but I still REALLY enjoyed this book......love, endless love, is love!  Any age can appreciate that. The type of love people are \\"hope\\"ing for!
B00005JKG9|5.0|A must see film both for  its wonderful performances and economic education.  Buyer beware the salesmen! and understand their motivation.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|My wife is a fan of Jack White and The White Stripes. After i listened to this album, i too became a fan. It's hard to not love songs like I'm Shakin, Love Interrupted, and 16 Saltines. I recently purchased this vinyl  as a gift for my wife and I'm enjoying it as much as she is.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|This movie is well done. Maybe a few scary scenes for very young children but true to the book. Rent this for the holidays to take a break from the crowds.
B000W93CHC|5.0|i love historical fiction and this book was outstanding! I would suggest it anyone who enjoys this genre. I had never read ken follette before but i will now.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The Marware Graphite case I purchased turned out to be well worth the price.  It is very lightweight but sturdy and looks attractive as well.  Great product!
B000000993|4.0|First tool disc; good recording quality and some interesting tunes.  Should be a good starter for most anyone interested in hearing what Tool has to offer.  Bought another Tool after hearing this one.
B005LAII9O|4.0|not too sure why this got such bad reviews. I loved it. Sure, its a little far fetched but I enjoyed it. Selma and Blake were great. it was not a voilent as I was led to believe, however there was a few grewsome scenes.
B008G59IKO|3.0|this album didnt excite me the way 21st Century Breakdown did.  I hope Green Day is not just putting out songs just to put out songs.  Sometimes less is more.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|very nice game and the progression of the levels and the graphics are unreal. it is always fun to play this game.
B008C1O8CA|3.0|Same as Dos, this didnt excite me.  I will listen to some tracks on Tre, then decide, before buying it.  Sometimes less is more.  Maybe 3 albums in a year is too much.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app doesn't refresh beyond the first page. When it does, the backgrounds don't load - pictures don't come up in the right spots, text is misaligned and its just a very bad user experience!
B000V6U89Q|5.0|One of my favorite recordings, and one i share with my voice students!  It was brand new, a great price and arrived quickly.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Great story, terrific performances and creative writing but a little graphic at times. Not something for younger viewrwers or the faint of heart.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|So much Love for this first season, but the second season is definitely a more exciting season, cant wait for the third
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I like this type of novel - ;lots of insights about deductions as to what caused what.  There was not a lot of mention regarding the Bone Bed.
B0046JPPOC|5.0|Great mix.  I enjoyed the remake of &#34;Time after Time.&#34;  The songs are moody and mellow but are not dull.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I like Harry Bosch novels!  The story line was good and free flowing.  It is very similar to Michale Connelly novels with Mickey Haller.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Let me say something that excited me about this book; it has an actual ending.  Yes!!! Not a cliff-hanger, not a wait for the next book, to get the whole story.  It has an ending.  However, reading this book was like reading two books.  The first halve was full of story building, character development and humour.  The second half was like ploughing through psychology 101 and having someone tell me how I should be feeling and deliberately trying to pull to hard at my emotions.  Let me explain further, without giving the storyline away.<br /><br />Sky was an interesting character, instantly likable and fun to read about.  She had an attention-grabbing history, and you know instantly that everything about her is not as it seems.  The book starts off at the present with her having a breakdown of sorts, and then goes back in time, hence you know all is not as it seems.  It drew me into the story, clearly something was happening with Sky.  I'm not sure if you were meant to guess early on what this was, I thought it was obvious (but this could be due to my profession) what had happened to her, but this did not take away from the story for me.  For me the story always was, how would she react when she realised and what would she then do.<br /><br />First let me talk about the characters.  Sky was a well-developed character.  I liked how a lot of this character development was done through her inactions with her best friend Six and new friend Breckin.  Both Six and Breckin, are the light characters that bring the humour and respite from the heavy topics.  They were interesting, and initially they were developed well. The dialogue and banter between them and Sky was sharp, witty and memorable.  Unfortunately, I think both Six and Breckin could have been taken further because by the second half they were forgotten and just appeared as extra's due to the heavy `issues' .  They could have provided lighter moments that were desperately needed in between all the melodrama.<br /><br />Holder was a mixed bag for me.  His character was up and down, hot and cold, angry and happy.  I know he was `meant' to be like this but it was too much at times for me, and did not feel real.  I don't really think that Sky's explanation of him being `passionate' about everything did not ring true to me.  However, when Holder was given the middle ground rather than highs and low, he was an interesting character.  I liked the development that took place between Sky and Holder.  What I didn't like was how Holder kept on going on about how Sky was so beautiful and perfect.  I really liked how Holder was the lynch pin in the whole story, and he didn't always take the easy road.  What I did not like was I felt like so much of his story was missing, you were told stuff about him and then it was not finished. Because of this I don't think I really knew him truly by the end.<br /><br />So, the first half was great, getting to know Sky and Holder, and watching them develop their relationship, whilst Sky discovers what has happened to her.  This was all well written, interesting, engaging.  It was full of both light hearted moments, laugh out loud moments, but also painful and emotional moments.  I loved it.<br /><br />The second half was missing the light hearted laugh out loud moments.  It was crammed full of emotional heavy long winded inner monologue.  There was also melodrama scene after melodrama scene.  I have not said drama here because it was melodrama. The scenes were all meant to be highly emotional.  I constantly felt like the emotions were being pushed on me and I was being told how to feel rather than just feeling it. In addition to this so much happened in such a short time frame, there was no time for a breath, and yet at the same time it was explained in so much detail that although it happened so quick it felt like it was dragging at times.  In addition, the way Sky and Holder spoke changed.  They no longer read as teenagers, but rather 40 year olds whohad been in therapy for 20 years.  The fact was throughout this book I wanted to know how Sky would react to finding out stuff, that was the whole point of the book for me, but when that actually happened it didn't feel real to me.  It felt forced, everything from the emotions of everyone, and how quickly things happened.  I wish I was writing l loved the end of this book as much as I loved the beginning, but I didn't.<br />Will I read it again? No<br />Would I recommend it? Sure, clearly by the high number of 5 star reviews most reviewers love it.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This app was nice at first now it crashes all the time now. I wish Amazon would just get an official YouTube app. This app is really not worth the frustration
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Like thats it large. Easy enough to see. Easy to work. Numbers are big enough to press and it beats the phone calculator.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Great game except for the fact that the Luke Skywalker bird doesn't work on the Kindle edition. He fires off from the slingshot but his lightsaber doesn't ignite. Kinda takes the fun out of the game, particularly when the glitch didn't change after I redownloaded the game from my cloud drive. Not worth repurchasing.
0756686970|5.0|I love the idea of this for my son.  I bought it and scanned through, what a way cool book and now I have another little child who is asking for one as well.  I did get my little lego figure with it.  Fun facts and great pictures.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|I bought this album because I liked the ET song and Last Friday Night for workout mixes. I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like most of the songs on the album. One of my favorites is Who am I Living For, well written lyrics, nice beat, different vibe than her usual pop beats. My least favorite is Peacock, ugh.<br /><br />I recommend if you like female pop stars like Pink and PCD.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Loved this movie as a child and really wanted it for my own home.  So bought it and watching it then shared it with my child.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great price for a great movie! Can't beat $5 and it was the first movie my little girl ever saw in the theater, so it is extra special to us
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Pro: Nice, good for people with big hands, Changes colors, A lot of buttons, Really good for gaming.<br /><br />Con: not wireless.<br /><br />Overall this is a great mouse but can be made better if became wireless
B003O86FMW|4.0|I completed the first book and now wish to see the movie. However, I was determined to finish the entire series before destroying my imagination. I'm pleased I did.
B009E3EY38|5.0|great sound - great presentation.  I only buy a few albums a year and this was one of them. Very well priced too!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A great series - I'm now open to seeing the movie. I had to read the series beforehand as one needs to have their own imagination. Very gripping and oh so real!
0345803485|1.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already....VERY poorly written! I really think this is more about commercialism, than good writing.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Having this whole set is awesome! I love the DVDs and the carrying booklet is the best idea ever. It is just awesome!
B004I744AS|5.0|easy to use... especially with the history feature.  Wonderful app!!!  Love the big numbers pads that are easy to enter.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|This was bought as a gift and it seems that T.V. series gifts are never a bad buy. Many family members love this series!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|sooooo fun I love the end of this game. although it was hard Elton beat the chopsticks game. and I am over 13
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I loved this book I know there is a movie that goes along with this. I just perfer books. you can read while you sit in a tree stand especially now that I have a kindle on my phone. This book held my attention the whole time. hard to stop once you start.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Just a really good read. No real complaints. I can't wait to read the next books. I am hooked to sure.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the game but when you are playing with freinds it saves all changes so if they mess with your house or castle or whatever you want to call it it saves but besides that it rocks
076115678X|5.0|This is a MUST GET book for anyone who has any type of curl to their hair.<br />I have learned so much by reading and re-reading this book.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Took a little trial and error to get started but great game after i got going.  Would give 5 stars if it was longer and a bit more difficult.  Overall well done game, great graphics, good job coolgeeks.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is reliable, sometimes more so than our local tv and radio stations. Easy to set up and use. Recommended
B006BAEQB2|5.0|an interresting book sharing how the cousin's war affected the history of England.  This book helps you to understand the war of the roses.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|The mounting hardware is a little rinky dink but it worked okay with my 775 mount. This is a very tall fan but fit well in my new gamma classic series atx case (see my other reviews). Temp stayed 40-50 c all the time on a quad-core gaming CPU, very impressive, my next step would have been water cool but not necessary. -1 star for the mounting hardware not being better but overall I'm pleased
B005HSL626|5.0|My ten year old son and myself both love this! Lots of fun for adults and children. Would recommend it.
B005FUJNNU|5.0|Its a good movie, the 3d just adds to it. I would recommend it to a friend, or even an amazon review reader..
B006BOT28U|5.0|This book really helps you understand why a thinking process is so critical to successful planning.  Even if you have a process you go through it is likely that it isn't sufficient and this book really helps you realize that.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Very good time waster. Plenty of options to get more coins even if<br />you do not want to spend money.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you want to self publish your Kindle book, this book will show you how to do it.  Easy to read and the instructions are clear.
B003RV43X4|4.0|I compared it to the original.  Of course, this one a lot different than the original.  It was entertaining.  My 22 and 15 year old boys love it.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Great show. One of the best series out there. I hope they continue to make more seasons. You won't be disappointed.
B007TK77QE|5.0|It was a brilliant read.  Rowling has such insight into human behaviour.  Really believable characters.  She managed to bring a town to life.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My kids have loved finding a new toy everyday. My son loves Star Wars. It has built up a fun little set to play with. We purchased a little box before hand so all the new toys had a place to go. It can be tricky figuring out how each piece goes together. I have to help my 5 year old with all of them but the people. They love the surprise! Fun way to count down without all the sugar.
098478280X|5.0|I have learned something from this book that I did not know before. It is well written and easy to read.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|first!!!!!<br />cool game. not as good as order and chaos but that's.my opinion. lil waka. waka. I lil liklipp jdjd
B009ZE27US|1.0|Seems to just be a random number generator with no hint of guessing or calculating age. There are no options.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book to read. I am so very sad to see the story end .wish there were more!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book and not easy to figure out what was coming next.  Be prepared to feel very uneasy about some of the scenarios in the plot but it will certainly keep your attention!!
0739321005|1.0|I don't think most of this is true.  How does he know what his fathers dreams were, he only saw him twice in his life.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was not my favorite book, altho I read it to the end.<br /><br />You've heard of the saying:  There's two sides to every story.  This book tells both sides in alternating chapters.<br /><br />Two disturbed individuals with apparently no hope of a solution to their mutual problem of hating each other.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My grandson couldn't put the book down.  He wants me to get all the others as he hasn't read them yet.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|a wonderful epic story, well written.  Great characters. I can't wait for the next one to be published.<br />would make a great movie.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|it is fun but when you are done it dose not let you see the city that you just &quot;saved&quot; hut it is an awesome app!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|What a great movie!!..Daniel Craig does a fantastic job in this!!..The picture and sound quality are also amazing!!<br />It comes in a very nice digipack, with a thick slipcover and very cool looking discs!!<br />5 stars overall, a fantastic release!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Expected a lot more from J.K. Rowling. Could not get into this book, very slow paced, and just plain boring.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I highly recommend this movie for kids and adults. It showed what good influence and belief in a child can do for them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put down! This came highly recommended and I see why! Wasn't too thrilled with the ending, but overall very good.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|At 70ish% this book had 3.5 stars from me.<br />Three stars for me entail MCs that I felt compassion for, a plot that had a satisfying ending, pacing that engaged me, and a theme that was fresh and inventive. Minnie and Robert were typical Milan constructs: a witty woman, who was in some way ruined, about to be saved by a man, who for some reason from his past, believes himself incapable of receiving love. I never seem to tire of this construct which is why I inhale Milan's books and stalk her website until new releases come out. In addition to Milan's love-construct, I love how she weaves themes in her writing. Physics and ostriches interweave as a mean-boy tries to 'change his feathers' in Unlocked. Scientist vs fortune-teller with a mix of elephants in Proof by Seduction. Mental illness, spousal abuse and taming a wild horse in Trial by Desire. Love it! Here its chess, healthcare and unions!<br /><br />Robert is a Duke who was a pawn between his hateful parents as a child; Minnie a commoner who hides her true identity because of a scandalous past. It seems impossible that they could wind up together, but the fates conspire. She's witty and captures his imagination, he bumbles in his attempts at love and affection, and you will root for the HEA. Trust that I'm not spoiling anything when I say that the love story is tied into a nice, pretty bow around 70% and, if you're like me, you'll feel satisfied and ready to close the book. But then I looked at my Kindle and saw 70% and thought: What else could Milan possibly have to write about these two?<br /><br />And then she pulls out the big guns!<br /><br />At 80ish% it had 4 stars.<br />I'm not spoiling anything when I tell you that Robert and Minnie begin enjoying their HEA (after the best debacle of a love scene I've ever read!) and then the s*** hits the fan! All Robert has ever wanted was a family to love and be loved by. He's kept this want buried in his being and the way Milan rips it from him I did not see coming. I was torn up about it. I ached for him. That was some damn good writing and plotting there, Milan. There were bits in the beginning of the story that I figured Milan simply threw in there to make the characters' backgrounds interesting -nah unh. She had a point, and she drives it home here.<br /><br />But then that's not the end!<br /><br />At the end of the epilogue is had 5 stars.<br />My first Milan book was The Governess Affair. That's where we meet Robert's father, the detestable Duke of Clermont. Its his actions that brings all the boys, and mothers, of The Brother's Sinister together. You have to read this prequel to truly appreciate what happens this point forward in The Duchess War. I actually applauded!ed for him. That was some damn good writing and plotting there, Milan.

0547884591|5.0|I love Tim's approach to learning. This is more than a book that teaches you how to cook, it teaches you how to learn.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I'm in the camp that was disappointed by this movie. It was derivative and lacked cohesion. Some parts of the script were atrocious, as was some of the acting. Maybe the effects would have redeemed it somewhat on the big screen, but on the small screen it is entirely missable.
B003274QH6|5.0|B e s t  show ever . . . . . . .  . . . Give it 3 shows and you won't be able to stop watching.
B0057UD49M|5.0|I had no idea that I was ordering a graphic novel (cartoon) and was a little upset when I downloaded it but decided to give it a chance since I already paid for it. I was presently surprised and really enjoyed it.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|Great product does what is advertised and does it very well I was very impressed and I was very satisfied.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I just finished the game.. I played on the harder mode and didn't use a walk through... This is a mystery game heavy on the hidden item searches... (a little too much for me) This has a long download time for the kindle fire probably because of the animation... This had great graphics, story and over all look... I really did enjoy this and I am very picky... I only mention the couple of negatives because I think it is something I would like to know if I was reading a review ;-)
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Well paced thriller with great acting but the plot could have used some work.  For instance, the audience is never quite sure why our hero and heroine must travel to the Phillipines and exactly what happens when they get there.  Such a shame.  Still lots of gut wrenching action sequences to keep the viewer enthralled.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I love this movie and got it for a great price. Product was brand new, unopened. Definitely met my expectations.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Simply put, Dexter is one of the greatest shows in television history. This is not a show for people who like their morality tales neat and tidy..black and white . Dexter's explores the dance between darkness and light ..truth is elusive..lines are blurred..morality,ethics,philosophy and spirituality steeped in ambiguity..ever present yet uncertain. At its best , Dexter assaults the viewer's preconceived notions and sensibilities and like its killers, leaves a mark
B0000DCGT4|4.0|Any fans of the American Pie franchise, I would definitely recommend this movie. Very funny and I received it brand new in great condition.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|I am very happy I bought this CD. It is Bluesy, rockin,  easy to listen to, and very enjoyable. Thank you Wallflowers!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A very moving and wonderfully surprising read. Not my typical pick, but I'm so glad I ordered it. I was up and down right along with Harold and completely taken unawares by the ending. Life's a journey:)
B008XCF7Y6|4.0|The core trio (Rico, Carl, and Carmen) make good major side characters to the new group. Not unlike the first Starship Troopers movie. Could do without the unnecessary female nudity though. (It makes sense for Ice Blonde, not so much for Carmen.)<br /><br />Unfortunately not related at all to Roughnecks aside from the core trio but still a fun romp. Some moments are stupid but hey, it's all in good fun.<br />Also I really like the engine room. It's purrrrrrrrty.
B0085YNML2|3.0|This game offers a little bit of a challenge. While playing you have to coordinate to get the little guy to climb, swing and jump in order to finish the level buy &#34;eating&#34; the worm. A fun game
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love this series, for me is great, every day I see more and more,  they recommend from the beginning
B004GVUPFE|4.0|I have been playing this on my new Kindle fire. the first levels were easy, the higher levels not so much. Good game to pass time.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The plot seemed to drag at times, seemed to have too much time spent in the car.<br />Otherwise was a good story with Lee Child's simple twists.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who reads Lee Child
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The app for the Kindle Fire is ok. It does not offer some of the same options as the app for say iPhone. I find that I am only allowed to scroll so far to read posts in my news feed, and it is not enough. Then everything gets kind of jumbled.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Saw Game of Shadows before the first Sherlock Holmes and loved it. I went back and watched the first one and while it was pretty good, Game of Shadows was much better I thought. I definitely recommend it.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|The game is fun and like many others for the Kindle Fire is a great time waster. I wish there was a way to &#34;swap&#34; the ball that is up with the next ball in line.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|If I had to review this album on Twitter, it would probably go something like, &#34;Like recent year Bonnie Raitt, with a horn section.&#34;  The singing and musicianship is quite good and I really enjoy the album, but I will give a nod to other reviewers who complained about tempo.  Dynamically, there are softer moments and funkier moments, but nearly every song is mid-tempo, the only exceptions being the ones that are slow tempo.  I guess I would have liked for them to have thrown in a real rave-up here and there and really cut loose.  That said, if you enjoy gritty, souful vocals and slide guitar, you will like this, but you might not love it.  Personal fave tracks: &#34;Bound for Glory&#34;, &#34;Until you Remember&#34;, and &#34;Learn How to Love&#34;.  Honorable mentions: &#34;Simple things&#34; and &#34;Love has Something Else to Say&#34;.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|Downloaded app without any problems.Took less than 30 seconds. Then another download started \\"resources\\". Forget it. 2 hours later and still not able to play. Only 99¢, but still a waste.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf is an amazing movie. It is truly one of Will Ferrell's best. This movie has the perfect amount of comedy mixed in with that good old holiday cheer. If not already, it will soon become one of the Christmas classics that go down in history. This is a movie that you can sit down with your family and enjoy a nice night of Christmas Joy.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I am extremely happy I purchased this app. It is well worth $2.99.  I create my own melodies and play it every night to fall sound asleep. If you haven't bought it, I highly recommend it!!!!!  Absolutely LOVE IT!!!! ; )
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Excellent Book.  Only one complaint...Too much detail about speeches, not enough detail about the capture of John Wilkes Booth in epilogue.
B009FZZFME|5.0|Whether you love zombie shows, movies, or comic/manga than this is the show for you! It is very deep and complex and will be greatly enjoyed by most!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Great movie. My family and I watch this movie every Thanksgiving evening to kick off the Christmas season. A Holiday classic.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I really enjoy this series.  It has a little bit of everything.  It's great for family viewing.<br />I would suggest you give this show a try--if you haven't watched it yet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Thoroughly addicted. Tons of games that keep me coming back for more! Random generates solid games. Winner is like a puzzle.  Great fun!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Love the music and the group they are amazing. The CD is well put together and love most of the songs.
1932100385|5.0|Wow, this is a wonderful and informative book! I have learned so much, and have really changed the way I do things. My son recommended this book to me, and he follows the concepts in his life. We are both fit and happy!! I don't use meat much at all, but do enjoy fish and cheese. Have really cut down on both. Won't be long before they are history as well. This book is extremely well researched. So happy to have read it.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Bought season one for my parents so they can get hooked on the show too!  This was a great deal!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This was not my fave for sure.<br />Most people I know enjoyed it, but it was not for me. Too many crazy twists and turns. Very unrealistic!!
B0000CABJ1|5.0|VERY HAPPY THIS ITS THE BEST GIFT FOR ME, I LOVE DONNA SUMMER SINCE I WAS A CHILD, I LOVE HER MUSIC
B001BZRUR4|5.0|This is a young author who has a unique writing style. I can't wait to read his later works as he matures as a writer.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|The movie was &#34;Friggen Sweet&#34; - great, dirty humor, with a couple jokes that might be over the top or out of taste, but hey, nothing less should be expected.<br /><br />The effects were also really well done, making it surprisingly believable from a visual stand point.
B008O037RG|5.0|Recently fixed up my record player and realized I have no newer vinyls, The most recent ones are Hall&Oats, REM, and the Dirty Dancing soundtrack. Not very recent at all if you ask me, so I treated myself to the latest M&S, It's weird not to hear the classic scratchy sound of the record but It does play nicer than any C.D I've owned. They've done it again, as this is an AWESOME album...might even walk down the isle to one of these.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Easy to set up. I loaded songs onto an sd card, inserted it into the Soundfly, plugged it into the car and done!
B000I0QL82|5.0|This is the Hipster of Christmas movies, It's what White Christmas is originally based off of. I fell in love with this movie when I was going through cancer treatment and would watch the movies the hospital offered while getting my chemo. One of my all time favorites. Fred Astair has always been one of my favorites, Funny Face, Top Hat, Swing Time, you name it. This one he's not the nicest guy but man was he handsome, you just don't find men like that anymore.
0984999302|5.0|This is one of the best book with solid examples. You get to know a lot about your to be customers.
6305428042|5.0|I remember watching this in primary school and fell IN LOVE with Mr. Binks, love this movie forever and ever.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It is wonderful to read Charlie's words through his innocence. The portrayal of his mind gives you a picture of how someone can be locked in trauma without being able to see.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|My Kindle Fire HD camera is not what I expected.  It is not desiged as a camera.  It has a small circle and you have to hold the tablet in an angel to take picture otherwise you take pictures of yourself.  I'm soooooooooo sad!!

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Endless missions of fun and jetpackness... or something like that. Tons of upgrades, utilities, and - of course -  jetpacks. This is my &#34;go to&#34; game when I'm waiting for unknown amounts of time. You can play for minutes or hours, or until your battery dies.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It's o.k. the one on my i-pod is much better.  It gives me 5-days forecast instead of just one. I
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This little app is handy for finding and testing wireless networks. It's another utility that I don't use often, but love to have it in my collection for those few times I need it.
B004GXL3DU|5.0|We have a zoo of little plastic animals, and they get played with in countless scenarios. I find that kids especially like to have baby animals in the mix, and this little one fits in great!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire to access shared content on my home server and several other locations (i.e. work stuff). It also allows you to browse local files, but I have not needed this ability yet. It's great, it's free... what more could you want?
B00571F26Y|5.0|I really liked this book because it made it clear that there's all kinds of wheat &#34;sensitivities&#34;.  It's not all black and white (i.e. wheat allergies/celiac or nothing).  There's all kinds of grey areas and undetected sensitivities which can have all kinds of symptoms.<br /><br />Also, the information on the glycemic value of wheat products was surprising.  As other books had proclaimed, weight gain is about insulin repsonse.<br /><br />Whole wheat is a scam, surprising to most people!  This book isn't necessarily for dieters, but people interested in overhauling their health in general.  Do that and weight WILL come off.
B004JK61K0|4.0|This little email program is a great alternative to your default application. It doesn't support Exchange connections, so I only gave it 4/5.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is a pretty good challenging puzzle game. It has absolutely no glitches I am aware of. Be prepared to spend many hours trying to complete all of the levels.
B007SGM084|3.0|Not my type of book, read the whole series due to friends telling me how good it is. The Characters pissed me off left and right, they complain and whine so much, one if stupid & controling and the other is just stupid for going along with it. It<br />s KINKY KINKY KINKY!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|If you've seen with one with Arnold, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed in this one. If you haven't seen the one with Arnold, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed in this one.<br />Of course, I needed to see it for myself to judge, and you probably will too. At least you can consider yourself warned.
B007REA93K|5.0|love his voice!  i'ts kind of stupid that I have to find 13 words to leave a review on EVERYTHING.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Do not download this app.  Annoying ads keep popping up.  I instantly deleted this after ads kept popping each time I would play this game

B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It's ok,but you can't play this app more than five minutes.<br /><br />Also,my brother and I,can't figure out how to separate the blocks in our inventory.<br /><br />This app is crappie. You can't do anything,unless you purchase the full version.PS,the full version is 3.99.<br /><br />But there are new animals weapons and plants.<br /><br />I really don't think you shouldn't buy this app,but it has some glitches.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This was my first hidden object game on an Android device and I didn't have any expectations. It did entertain and had enough variety to keep it interesting. The story was simple, but served to tie the elements together in an appropriate way. My only complaint would be the penalty I would occasionally incur when trying to move around (or even zoom).
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I LOVE this movie its a tradition to watch this at my aunts house on Christmas SO hilarious! Will reccomend to you And all my friends! Buy this movie you HAVE to!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Excellent talent. The next U2/Dave Mathews if he keeps it together. Can't wait for the next album. First three tracks are the best!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I love this movie! Watch it every year. I am SO glad Chris van allsburg agreed to make this movie. I will watch this movie tommorow at school.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I wanted great entertainment, and that's exactly what i got. Witty humor, credible fightd, just the right kind of drama.
0375851569|5.0|My husband read these stories to our twins while I was pregnant so the twins would know his voice when they were born. The twins love hearing these stories once they were born.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|... or at least I no longer feel like a Higgs-bozo.<br /><br />I am not by nature a physicist.  I have been able to follow most of the current literature on particle physics, but always had a nawing &#34;Huh?&#34; feeling afterward.  &#34;A Universe from Nothing&#34; brought me a long distance forward in feeling as though I understood the topic, but was still hazy about the Higgs field.<br /><br />This book finally was able to boost me over the last hurdle to my understanding the Standard Model of Particle Physics and to see why the discovery of the Higgs boson particle was so important in providing the capstone to this model.  Dr Carroll has my full thanks, appreciation, and respect for that feat.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Pretty fun and addicting game.  I played a couple times a day and never spent any money.  Once I hit level 40, I can no longer access the game.  I hit the Icon on my Kindle Fire, it trys to load, then takes me back to the main menu.  Since it's worthless now, I'll probably have to uninstall the game.  Maybe you have to spend $$ to go further?  Won't know now because it won't let me in...
B00846REIS|3.0|This was good but not as good as the Fifty Shades books.  But I will still read the series as time goes by.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Nice to have for Doctor visits and car rides or wating for the Movie to start good action worth playing
B005HSL626|3.0|you know how some games on your kindle fire freeze up well you got yourself another type of those types of games but besides freezing up it an O.K. game

B005KJZDXK|4.0|Not the classic Christmas you're going to hear over and over again.....Cosby's &#34;White Christmas&#34;.<br />But it got it's creds...and she's funny!
0446554995|2.0|I have read every book by Preston and Child and am a huge fan. I have waited a long time for this 3rd book in the Helen trilogy only to be disappointed. The writing seems disjointed. There is a tangent story with Corrine that has no place in the book. Unfortunately if you've read the first 2 books you have to read this one just to know how it ends.<br />I was similarly disappointed with Gideon's Sword. So much so that I have no interest in reading Gideon's Corpse.<br />I hope these authors will get it together.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|It requires a minimum of twenty words to write a review....<br />I guess trying to eliminate the tweeter crowd?<br />Wes Anderson has a view of the world that gives it a tweak on the cheek, a laugh that questions and a troupe of actors/actress that bring his world to fruition without bombastic acting.<br />Is that twenty words??
B007SGLZP8|4.0|the pace and the content of the book was very good,its story line kept you interested in what was going to happen
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|A few nice music for a day or two.....<br />Unfortunately it looks like he decided to follow the Swift route and do a few lyrics on failed love.<br />Oooh...Boo-hoo
B007SGM084|5.0|The first book wasn't totally what I had expected, but by the time I was finished with it, I was hooked!  I liked each of the following books in the series as well.  A set of books that will be talked about by its' readers in many ways.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Ive always liked this game took awhile to get the hang of the joy stick tho.  Grand kids love it too.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|the drama, emotions and characters will keep you turning the page....This is a book that is worth owning, and then framing it ;)
145210655X|5.0|Couldn't stop laughing on some of the scenes. A must have for Dad's who have sons that root only for the good guys.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|1 of the best series I have seen on HBO - Besides, I love Jonathan rhys Meyers - everyone should own this!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I like this game and so do my kids. I am 40 and my 4 kids, ranging in age from 6 to 12, like it to. It's very appropriate for them.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follett develops his characters in depth and weaves historical events with fiction seamlessly. The story is interesting and the book is hard to put down.  I hope the third book of the trilogy comes out soon.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is a great app. So far I haven't seen any glitches on this app. If you like too read this app is for you.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, having felt somewhat guilty for not seeing it in the movie theatre, I figured at the very least it would be fully worth it at home. My negative feelings towards the film have nothing to do with me loving the original and making scene by scene comparisons. But if you are going to 'remake' or 'reboot' and then say you are being more faithful to the original story - - then this is a bad example of that approach because the movie seems hell bent on nodding at the original every chance it gets. There are several instances of scenes and dialogue from the original film and it always came off as a cheap carbon copy.<br /><br />This movie is visually cool, from the designs of the vehicles and environments to the cinematography and well staged action sequences. But it has no soul, no heart. The whole conflict is hinged on the idea of an invasion of what's left of the colony in which they never made me give a damn why that was bad. The powers that be seemed to control everything anyway so what was the big deal about bum rushing a little more territory? This was the biggest problem with the film, I just did not care about what was at stake and I didn't for one second by the relationship between Quaid and Jessica Biel.<br /><br />The second biggest failure of this film is that it did not improve over anything from the original. Every choice they made that was different wasn't better in the way of a more dramatic result.<br /><br />If you want to watch a slick looking sci fi film with a lot of action, then this is for you. If you want to watch a slick sci fi with a lot of action and a good STORY, go watch the original, or even Bladerunner.
B001KZG99A|5.0|This is probably the best movie based on an Avengers character. I'd wager to bet it'll likely be best Marvel movie. Way better than all those crappy X-men movies, what a joke.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|The app is nice for free but not worth paying for. It is kind of like Mario Bro if you like that type of game.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are great together.  I look forward to this every week.  I hope they renew it.
0547884591|5.0|I think this is a perfect book for a man who likes to cook and to read.<br />I bought 2 for gifts and I know that they will love it like I do.<br />Tim takes you to a varied range of subjects and you can learn<br />almost everything you want to know, from soup to nuts.<br />He's really quite funny and the book is hilarious.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|How can you not love the combonation of Star Wars & Angry Birds? What a marketing gimick! Milk it you money grubbers! Wish I would have thought of it!
1579128955|5.0|I would give this book as a gift to anyone for any occasion. I read an element a day when I first obtained a copy. Great photos and a history of our recognition of each element. No book like this. I return to it often, as there's always something in the news that will trigger my implulse to thumb through it.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|It was fun to finally catch up with bella and gang. Cant wait for the second to come up for rental.
B0035OC7PO|3.0|Bryson is funny, and he has a knack  for describing the most mundane of the situations with a very acid humor. In this book, however, too many joking gets a bit tiresome (may it was the begining of his carreer, and his style was not so sharp yet)
0553801473|5.0|A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5) It came very fast! Great job in getting it out so fast
B004FEL6GO|3.0|I expected the product to be bigger and other material, in the photo it looked bigger. But for the price I guess it is in accordance with the product.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This was an unexpected great movie. Very well done with several unexpected twist. I would highly recommend it. It is sad how inhuman civilized people can be, and still are!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's Good. There is no bad Bible :) Recommended reading for everyone. This is the book that saved my life.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Great to have on hand to look up the spelling of words and to research words that I am unfamilar with.  Love that it will pronounce the word for you.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|DO NOT GET THIS APP IF YOU WANT TO PRACTICE WINNING!!!!! I got this to practice my moves. I won chess champ 5 years in a row at my school and I could never win againist the computer. First it wont let you make moves if your gonna win and second they rigged so you never win!!!! Don't get this on your kindle fire!!!!
B00913P6G0|5.0|This guy is amazng. Kendrick is young and extremely talented. He definiely put these bubble gum rappers of today to shame. The word play on this album is witty and the beats are sick.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I can only give this one a 4.  I've read all of the Harry Bosch novels and I give every other one a 5+ but this one is a bit slow and never really picks up much speed.  There is no twist to the story and no real action till the very end and even that is not very exciting.  But, I'll still read all the Harry Bosch novels that come out because, well, he's Harry!
0743270754|5.0|Last year my husband almost passed away and while sitting in the hospital I get an email asking for an amazon review and quickly wrote experience....not a review of the book. An outcropping of angry readers wrote comments because I neglected to review book.  Below is how gracious AMAZON was... While fighting off death...fighting over a review is counter intuitive.<br />My review is as follows: First and foremost I met Doris while she was still writing Lincoln in Balt. while promoting her book on the  Dodgers (she is warm and funny). I was very excited to finally read/hear her book which is nothing like the movie because the movie is a snippet of her research. The book provides well defined Cabinet, Senate and family, et al other political characters surrounding Lincoln during his limited political career. Her usual fast paced writing and sardonic humor makes Lincoln a good read or listen.<br /><br />Dec. 2012: Sent back book without a hitch, the only good thing about the purchase.<br />We already had the book, but my husband is in hospital and we wanted him to relax and listen at his own pace.<br />AMAZON understood completely....NO Problem with return ( they were out of CD's)...so they sent the book...
0307346617|5.0|a totally differ spin on the zombie genre. worth ready and passing onto a friend...hope the movie is good w/ Brad Pitt.

B0042KZJR8|5.0|I ordered this as a replacement to one I had lost. I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Michael Buble. Great CD. Even bought one for my mom! Def would recommend.
B00000253N|5.0|I had this album back when I was a kid, but it got so scratched up several songs were not playable. I bought this so I could then rip all those songs onto my personal mp3 server archive so I could get those songs back.
B00622BF40|5.0|Everybody has one! this is mine. ALWAYS makes me feel better. Lighthearted, loveable charicatures, delivers an improtant message: A life lived in fear is a life half-lived!
B004ZN9R6G|5.0|I gave this a 5 star just cause its  SOOOOOOOOOO PINK FLOYD its one of the best CD's out there. I love every song on this CD. This CD is a must have if you love Pink Floyd. I am listening to it right now!!!  I wouldn't buy from the seller again because it took forever to get here and when it did get here the case was torn. Very unhappy about that as I bought it brand new
B004GJDQT8|5.0|user friendly app....quick, convenient and easy to navigate....product comparisons for all items...easy transition to alter orders....would recommend for all shopping needs :)

B00008S7KC|5.0|I have not had time to watch this yet but I watch it online every morning. A good one to add to your collection
B000244FDW|5.0|How can anyone resist Jane Austen?  This is a very good adaption of Jane Austen's &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;.  I enjoyed it very much.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is my favorite CD she ever made I love this CD.  tho I find it sad that the rest of her music after this went downhill and is trash
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Who can argue when Tom Hanks takes the parts of the conductor, Santa & who else in this timeless classic for young & old?
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Found it challenging earlier assumptions which I may or may not have had.<br />Have recommended it to many friends but not readily available in NZ
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is one of my favorite singers.  She is such a true and down to earth person & I believe it comes through in her music.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|Recommended to me by several people I know. Read many of the reviews<br />Certainly a great read. Renewed my enjoyment of reading.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|Another wonderful series from PBS.  I enjoy watching Cranford & Return to Cranford over & over.  Set in old English countryside.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|forrest gump is born in scandinavia and visits the world. the first few year are fun but a century is over long.
B00867GJYK|5.0|I grew up with this movie, so I was pleased to buy it for my kid. Also pleasing to me was the inclusion of an audio description track for the blind. It's nice that audio description is on more and more movies that are released on DVD and Blu-ray, and not just in the theaters. So five stars for the movie, as well as the inclusion of the AD track by Pixar.<br /><br />Accessing the track:<br /><br />If you have an audio button on your DVD/Blu-ray player's remote, simply press it once the movie begins. Otherwise, you must unfortunately go into the menus to turn on the audio description.<br /><br />Hopefully Amazon will consider adding the AD availability to their description next to closed captioning. Until then, I'll be writing reviews on movies I pick up with this feature.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I absolutely love this game!  Some people say that you need to pay to continue the game.  But you don't!  The graphics are awesome! No complents! :)
B000YHG72E|5.0|Sure, Will Farrell plays just about the best naive little kid in an adult body.  Great holiday fun for the whole family.  Well, most all of the family.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|came in as was described not a bad price and i still love the i guess you could say movie.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|Don't expect this to be your typical Tom Cruise movie.  It's meant to be a cheesy stereotypical musical, and it is.  The storyline is the stock &#34;naive Midwest girl moves to LA to become a star, falls for boy who becomes a star while greedy manager takes everyone until he gets his due in the end.&#34;  The only different take is the cheesy incorporation of all your favorite 80's hits into the storyline and the chorus.  If you liked 80's music (any of the styles), then you'll probably enjoy this movie, even if you're not a fan of musicals.  Tom Cruise's character is wholly unreal, but that's exactly what he's supposed to be.  Just have fun with it.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|loved these games. have played 1 and 2 waiting for 3 to come to kindle. will be first in line loved it
B009PF93LS|5.0|Bought the cd last christmas and I really love this chistmas cd very much.. Michael Buble is a awesome singer
0345529057|5.0|I have a hard time putting these books down. They are incredibly well written and both the characters and plots are enthralling. I wish I had started this series years ago.
B00962341U|5.0|Another perfect set of music.  Wish she would tour USA.  Each song is lovely.  Love the acoustic versions.  If you enjoy Leona, you will love this!
B007JWKLMO|4.0|Love the Beatles and all the solo stuff as well. This is a nice ride down memory lane. He was quite the spirit.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|All her hits, just wish there was more new music.  Kelly is always perfect.  Wish there was more of Kelly in this, it seems to be a simple package for an artist getting ready to jump label.  Music however is perfect.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game for Ppl who like basic style and want to play a 101 games plus 31
B009P5S11G|1.0|Rihanna needs a rest.  All of her music is starting to sound the same.  Nothing special here.  Want something different from her.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|How can I say this? I love the detail of the web this author is spinning. I feel like a ton of thought and research went into the making of this series.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Great read for those who like Brandon Sanderson's books. Only criticism is that its a bit short, he could have spent some more time developing characters and exploring the world a bit. Seems half finished as it is.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|If you are dead-set on reading this book, read all the other lukewarm reviews first. I recommend either buying the paperback and passing it to your friends (the narrator is also lukewarm and her imitation of male voices is laughable) or getting it at the library. My clit, pubic mound, and labial lips are not collectively called &#34;the apex of my thighs&#34; and if the author has a phobia about these other words she should stop writing &#34;erotic&#34; books. I also do not want to think about the amount of money she has made from this book. That being said, I suggest the reason there has not been a popular book similar to this is because most people realize that promoting men to sexually 'punish' women (and to wholly believe ALL men can ACCURATELY GUESS and control the amount of emotional and physical pain inflicted) borders on social irresponsibility. God help all woman who have sex with a man who attempts to choke her (without warning) because that's what he thought she wanted!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Excellent adaptation from the graphic novels.  I wish they could film and release episodes at a faster clip.  Looking forward to more seasons.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had heard down at the day spa that this was a really steamy novel so, of course, i wanted to read it.  I could not put it down.  I was shocked and educated and titilated and, well, you get it.  What a story line.  It is really one book in three volumes -- I don't think any can stand on its own.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I bought this for my grandson.  He is reading it as an assignment for school and he loved the book.
B003NX76BM|4.0|This is typical Nora Roberts with twists and turns to the plots and still full of romance.  I enjoyed it.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I can't really fault the app for the fact that I bought it, and the picture quality is so poor I refuse to use the camera. My cell phone can take better pics than this, with a resolution that looks great on my laptop. This camera can't even take pics that look good on the small kindle screen.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|My 7 year old grandson is loving this advent calendar.  It was a big hit.  I bought 2011 and am looking forward to 2013.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Michael Jackson left us too soon.  He was getting ready and looking forward to this tour.  I am so heartbroken over this, especially for his children.  OMG, he looked so good and his voice, AMAZING.  Michael will forever live in my heart.  I love that this dvd was released.  His fans could remember his drive and determination to give his very best to them.  His talent: AWESOME AND UNIQUE.  I will never forget Michael Jackson.  Great addition to any collector.
B0091QSNEE|3.0|This app is much like Dr. Panda's Hospital in that it's geared toward 3-4 year olds. Dr. Panda's restaurant doesn't have as much content as the hospital, but if you offer the 2 together, kids switch back and forth for variety.<br />Kids meet customers as they are dropped off at the front door and proceed to prepare what the animal patron has on their mind for dinner. This is followed by more customers and then the table has to be cleared and the dishes have to be washed. It teaches them procedures just like the hospital.<br />Take a few minutes to walk them through it and they'll take it from there.
6304479689|5.0|Very nice addition to my Elvis Presley collection.  You will travel with him on this tour, go backstage with him and rehearse and sing along as well.  You will feel the love his band and background singers have for him.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I was putting together a set of anime movies and this was one of them. Love this movie it is so cute. Very child friendly, and all together a great family movie.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This was an excellent movie. Normally non fiction biographical movies can be dull but this was very captivating. I was also impressed that the parents were willing to speak the truth about their role in the course of their son's actions. I would recommend this movie to anyone over 15 especially young men struggling to find themselves
B003CSV7TK|5.0|loved watching this as a kid, never gets old!  like it much better than the updated version.  ! ! !
1608871045|5.0|This book is amazing!!! It was the perfect gift for my friend and I'm thinking about getting one for myself!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|True to form.  As I expected. I just hope Hollywood can see the $ signs and allow Mitch to appear on the silver screen. I believe the screen would turn to gold and the air in some parts would turn blue. I doubt they will do a Vince Flynn movie because this country has gone down the tubes with all the political correctness BS.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I've been using a very plain calculator on my fire, and was frustrated when I'd have to start all over if I entered the wrong number or screen blanked out/went to sleep.  this app has an error correct key and if I close app it shows everything as it was last time.  very nice!
B000NM46PA|5.0|I was absolutely stoked to get this, and at such an awesome price! The record arrived within a week,  and The seller even reimbursed me for the extra postage owed when it arrived! Which is great!! My husband is soo excited to hear the album on vinyl!!!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Always enjoy this during the Christmas season! We purchased it for our 3yr daughter this year, and it was such a pleasure watching her face during the whole movie. Wide-eyed amazement! I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Was intrigued by The Hunger Games descriptions, so I first read all three books. They were excellent, well written and they grabbed me and kept me turning pages. I really looked forward to the film, but it was so insipid and disappointing compared to the books. The opportunity for great visuals in this day of CGI, especially with costuming and sets, was totally wasted. Time constraints seem to have forced too many cuts to the story line, which looses important details.<br /><br />As is generally true when translating books to images overall, the film did not have half the impact on me as the books. The underlying messages however, are still relevant and powerful, making it well worth watching.
B009GENZKS|4.0|I like all the Resident Evil media including the Movie series this is a good watch.<br />If your a fan also go for it.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|You must be an Anglophile to understand even half of what is going on in this novel.  It is cumbersome, wordy, frustrating , and I am getting close to not caring what happens.  The protagonist started out to be likable and is now just an airhead.  I have a tendency to finish novels even when I find them torturous. I am being tortured.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great little game. The instructions for each game are clear and the games move rather smoothly. I havent had any freezing or play problems. All and all, a good way to pass the time.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Can't watch it normally but the DVD is awesome. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in this type of program.
B00004TS0E|1.0|I am a huge fan of the original movie, so didn't have hopes for this remake. The saddest part is that they changed the reason for Santa Claus being acquitted.  Instead of the cute, wonderful approach of the post office delivering the mail, it had to have a religious reason instead.  Too bad.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|my son asked for this. he has a friend with it on their kindle. I play it sometimes as well.
B009A87ZQU|3.0|It seems that my disc is loosing sound quality.  It was that way the minute I got it.  At first it happened only once then it started to progress.  I would have appreciated it if I was warned before hand. Aside from that it isn't scratched and it came on the right time.
0880793082|5.0|Great cards, highly recommend! These is the second time i bought these cards from this seller, and they are just as beautiful as the first pack.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|I love this disc.  It came on time and in great cøndition.  No scratches, no damage because of shipping.  It was a Bond flik that makes the double 0 into a man with a broken heart.  I had to watch it a few times to get its real meaning.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I loved this book. It is not vulgar, even though the topic is quite tough... Very sensitive reading, good written.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Purchased this item as a gift for Christmas.  This deluxe edition was very nice since it included more than I expected.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I ordered this applacation to be able to check the weather before I go flying R C airplanes and all I get is not workings
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|This is a fun game but I wish it lasted longer. It would be better if it had more than one story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story!  I loved the little twist at the end.  I can't wait to see the movie!  I highly recommend this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an incredible story.  So touching and intense and I loved every bit of it! I read it overnight and could not put it down!  While I have to admit that I figured out the \\"twist\\" to the story, I didn't care because it all unfolded in such a wonderful and masterful way.  Colleen Hoover really told an incredibly intense and difficult story and it invoked such emotion from me throughout.  Loved these characters and all of the emotion that went along with them.<br /><br />Just. Fantastic.
B0026PA05M|5.0|Harking back to the Lita Ford fem rock days, Halestorm is even better.  With soaring vocals, great guitar riffs, and songs that are both hard but still have a great melody that will leave you singing them to yourself in the shower.
B0092C2X7U|3.0|It's OK I guess. But you have to start back at the beginning every time which makes it hard to practice the harder jumps.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My favorite science fiction author is Jack McDevitt.  Not just because I am a fan of the mash-up of mystery, archeology and hard science fiction, but because he believes his readers to be intelligent -- he plops you down in the middle of a fully realized, three-dimensional world that has a past history and will go on after you finish reading. No big exposition set-pieces, just BAM, you are there and immersed and he trusts that you can catch up.  He is the best at that.<br /><br />Or, I should say, he WAS the best at that.<br /><br />Hugh Howley is better.  The Wool Omnibus was just like that.  Better, even.<br /><br />Fully immersed from the start.<br /><br />So good that the universe creeps up on you.<br />And seeps into you.<br /><br />Complex characters, with rich and detailed back histories that are hinted at and left for you to imagine and fill out.<br /><br />Thank you, Hugh, for trusting in my intelligence.<br />This was a joy to read.<br />I will remember it for the rest of my life.<br />And will re-read it over and over again.
B009LK6JS2|2.0|I can't figure out how to land. Is that a throttle? And flap controls (hard to see the flaps)? Nothing is labeled. Not sure if it's working right or just super hard.
B005CFWH22|1.0|In addition to the strap being of a very rigid plastic, with sharp edges, the shoe seems especially narrow and difficult to balance on.  It also looks cheap.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|ive been playing this for one day and cant put it down now! i have everyone in my house playing :) we have a competition goin on on the timed ones!
B003KRJNBW|3.0|I expected more, story was long and cliche'.xxxx  x xx xxx xxx xxx xx hate when you have to use more words than you need to.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|THIS WAS A CUTE STORY, NOT ONE OF MY BEST PICKS. I AM MORE OF A MYSTERY GIRL. MY DAUGHTER LOVED THIS PICK.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|How can you beat the deal, it cost basically $20.00 after delivery. 6 discs loaded, I enjoyed watching every movie.<br />The delivery was on time, no hassles what so ever. An excellent addition to my collection.<br />Very interesing interviews and behind the scenes.
B001JIDE3M|4.0|If you're older, you'll notice a few parts that are unabashedly cheesy, but the story is good, and it's visually solid. There's a word play off of schist (metamorphic rocks), but it's not offensive and there's no profanity. Some action scenes in the center of the earth may be scary for very young or sensitive kids (involving a big dinosaur and killer fish), but I think most kids would probably be fine with it. I also liked that everyone from the female guide to the male professor to the young teen got a chance to demonstrate their bravery and cared about each others' well being.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Really now? What's not to love? Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is a delight for all ages, from beginning to end!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I really enjoyed it. It moved along well and had a good story. Not what I expected, which was nice.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Oh, what a wonderful app! When a friend introduced me, I just went nuts when I realized the possibilities! Back up! Sharing! It's all there. Get Dropbox if you need a place to back up documents and a way to share specific items with specific friends!
B002ZG999U|5.0|have'nt seen as of yet. looking forward to a weekend of nothing but good old entertainment for a change. maybe some of the oldies.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Once again Clancy delivers a very solid story line with well developed characters that we love to root for. I am a very big fan of Tom Clancy and can say without reservation that if your a fan you won't be disappointed .  This book will also appeal to the new to Clancy fan and most likely have you go back and read all of his other works.  Very entertaining read!
B001FTIKAC|4.0|my four yr old daughter enjoys this classic. I'm just grateful I got this at a low price....was a steal!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Nice layout. Decent free data usage plan - allows up to 60MB of transfer data per month, which is more than enough for textual notes and the occasional small photo or image. Available on all the major platforms - I use it on iOS, Android, Windows (a full client installation), and the web (in multiple browsers, mainly Chrome). Useful for keeping to-do lists, shopping lists, itineraries (particularly for accessing details during an actual trip), notes for work, and much more. Photo and document capture built-in.
0143038583|3.0|i love listening to michael pollen, but am unable to read the long winded explanations. don't get me wrong, non-fiction and higher level reading is what i love, but i just could not get into the book. start with the movie Food, Inc, and then go to supersize me then move on from there. the subject matter has changed my life.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|I could sit and type for a hours on the great points of this DVD,  but no need when one line says it all \\"<br />it is Casablanca \\"  where a kiss is just a kiss............As time goes by..........
B0095MVOMC|5.0|My grandson and I both love the Hidden Numbers and Hidden Letters  we bought from Amazon.  It is hard to put it down.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This effort lacks the intensity of his Lion series.  The pace and impact of his previous effort was far more compelling.  I will, however, look forward to his next novel!
0060899190|5.0|I have been very pleased with this book.  I have followed PostSecret online for quite a while and been very impressed by it.
B008TTPQXA|2.0|I was not convinced  that Dr Alexander's  experiences are genuine NDE. For a correct interpretation of anything possibly genuine see The Soul After Death by Fr. Seraphim Rose. I also get the impression that in some of the experiences presented, the personal convictions of the author are subtly injected.<br /><br />From the writing point of view, there is an alteration of chapters of the family experiences juxtaposed to the &#34;metaphysical experiences&#34; of the author. A lot of blah blah that is not necessary, becomes tiresome.
1932735410|5.0|It's written in readable manner, minimum memorization requirements unlike PMBOK and this book links practice project management with PMBOK theory. Easy to remember and good tips and tricks for passing exam. I just passed this Tuesday :o)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book is so much better than the movie. I'm so interested to know more about Katniss and Peers and how they will continue to survive The Games.<br /><br />On another note, how could anyone think that Rue wasn't black? Her dark brown skin and the fact district 11 is based completely off of American slavery is evidence enough.
B008LY9AWG|1.0|I was disappointed that when I finished the reader said I was only 47% finished. The only time I've been disappointed though.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Game of Thrones  Unbelievably vivid and entertaining.  Kept me 100 percent involved every second.  Can't wait for upcoming series for a phenomenal experience.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What a beautiful voice. This was a gift for a younger person and it was very well received. She specifically asked for this cd so I couldn't go wrong.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This sounded like a typical silly novel about waking up in Vegas married. Been there, done that.  I was very suprised by this novel.  I really enjoyed it!  It makes you feel like stealing when you find these books for free.
B00A757EFW|3.0|You can only play two levels. The controls work great. I just wish the game was longer. I will be purchaseing full app.
B00000IQV7|5.0|this shows the heart of a real person that shows his character through love and laughter. It is an inspiring story.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|It was very well done.  A good mix of action and humor.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Five stars.
B008F9E306|4.0|T.I. embraces his `troubles' on his 8th studio effort, 2012's [[ASIN:B00AL1ONN8 Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head [Explicit]]], which proceeds 2010's underwhelming [[ASIN:B003RDPYEO No Mercy]].  T.I. released multiple singles to various digital outlets prior to the official release of the album.  The overall results of Trouble Man is that T.I. delivers some solid cuts, sounding much more compelling than his previous effort. The biggest drawbacks include some less necessary cuts and the effort's extreme length (70 minutes).<br /><br />On introductory cut \\"The Introduction\\", producer DJ Toomp samples Marvin Gaye's \\"Trouble Man\\". The sample foreshadows the narrative of the album.  DJ Toomp's production characterizes the southern rap idiom intact with solid production work with buttressing hip-hop drum programming, present bass line, and southern rap organ.  T.I. Scores memorable moments, most notably the  catchy hook which both asserts and confirms T.I.'s status as a trouble man.<br /><br />\\"G Season\\" featuring Meek Mill essentially writes off fake folk who aren't true gangstas but just wannabes. Cardiak delivers exceptional production work noted for its malicious brass and hard drums. T.I. asserts himself with a fiery delivery while Meek Mill complements him well on a sound second verse. \\"G Season\\" proves a strong start for Trouble Man.<br /><br />DJ Toomp's top-notch production returns on the anthemic \\"Trap Back Jumpin\\", easily T.I.'s attempt at 2006's \\"What You Know\\". T.I. asserts it is time for him to show how things are really done, hence his addictive, aggressive hook: \\"It's time to get trap back jumpin/get [...] back poppin [...], I show these sucka [...] how it go...\\" Always on autopilot, T.I. delivers a valedictory effort on \\"Trap Back Jumpin\\"<br /><br />\\"Wildside\\" initiates with a skit, followed by a lush, southern rap cut sporting an equally lush hook.  T.I. delivers two solid verses while A$AP Rocky closes out on a third.  Less stellar than \\"Trap Back Jumpin\\", \\"Wildside\\" still packs some punch.  On the uptempo  \\"Ball\\", T.I. & Lil Wayne aim straight for the club celebrating the excesses of partying: \\"This club so packed, [...]so drunk [...] I got a bottle, got a model [...]ball, ball, ball!\\" T.I.'s verses are similarly irresponsible while  Lil Wayne adds to the carefree experience on  the final verse. \\"Ball\\" serves its purpose, but isn't nearly as deep as \\"G Season\\" or \\"Trap Back Jumpin\\".<br /><br />\\"Sorry\\" finds veteran Andr&eacute; 3000 (OutKast) outperforming T.I.  by playing up his eccentricities (\\"[...] round the time the [...] wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost/that's that [...], I mean, I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off...\\" T.I. doesn't fall flat (\\"Ay, never mind what the blogs say/this what my mind and my heart say...\\") but Andr&eacute; 3000 is the star of the show.  An argument could additionally be made for R. Kelly's contributions on \\"Can You Learn\\", which begins with an interlude and transforms into something of a love track of which Kelly sings: \\"Oh baby could you learn? Could you learn to love a troubled man?\\"  T.I. pours out his heart on the verses, though a soulful R. Kelly is hard to outperform.<br /><br />\\"Go Get It\\" gives T.I. another solo cut, though it doesn't outshine the valedictory \\"Trap Back Jumpin\\".  \\"Guns And Roses\\" atones for impropriety, featuring captivating production work from T-Minus (Drake, Nicki Minaj) and strong vocals from the pop star Pink. Pink shatters the chorus: \\"Should've known it from the start it was already over/we were just too dumb to notice and we'd pray but even love couldn't save us/we'd wake up on a bed of guns and roses/and we don't know which one to choose...\\"<br /><br />\\"The Way We Ride\\" possesses unique production work from 1500 or Nothin'. Featuring the standard southern-rap cues, \\"The Way We Ride\\" is enjoyable and makes you nod your head to the groove.  \\"Cruisin'\\" keeps the tempo slow and produces more of a contemporary R&B vibe. \\"Cruisin\\" is over-repetitive and it is uncharacteristic (save for \\"Whatever U Like\\") to hear so much singing from T.I., but the lushness and sensual hook are appreciated.<br /><br />\\"Addresses\\" continues to find T.I. deliver some truly aggressive moments lyrically, but suffers from possessing a somewhat unimpressive hook. On \\"Hello\\", Pharrell Williams provides eclectic, soulful production work while Cee Lo Green seals the deal with a soulful hook (\\"Just keep going and don't look back/and look forward from where you're at/there's some jealousy in your rearview/wave hello, hello, hello...\\")? \\"Hello\\" is not necessarily the cream of the crop, but delivers more than \\"Cruisin\\" or \\"Addresses\\".<br /><br />\\"Who Want Some\\" showcases more of that initial grit T.I. showed on cuts like \\"G Season\\" or \\"Trap Back Jumpin\\". DJ Toomp's production work certainly helps to shape this.  The biggest detraction is a six minute duration.  \\"Wonderful Life\\" finds guest Akon borrowing from an Elton John classic on the hook: \\"And you can tell everybody this song...I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind/that I put down in words how wonderful life like...\\" T.I.'s messages on his verses have much more substance than some of the previous cuts, which is a pro. \\"Hallelujah\\" closes the standard edition, lifting from the childhood classic \\"Jesus Loves Me\\" and Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\". Previously released singles  \\"Love This Life\\" and \\"Like That\\", both solid, conclude the deluxe edition.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AL1ONN8 Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head [Explicit]]] ultimately is an enjoyable affair.  There are some flaws, but also more than enough triumphs to atone for these.  T.I. is at his best when he embraces his harder side and pairs up with strong collaborative partners be it mainstay producer DJ Toomp or guest artists like Andr&eacute; 3000.  The album is perhaps fifteen minutes too long, but easily more inspired than 2010's lackadaisical No Mercy.and it is uncharacteristic (save for \\"Whatever U Like\\") to hear so much singing from T.I., but the lushness and sensual hook are appreciated.<br /><br />\\"Addresses\\" continues to find T.I. deliver some truly aggressive moments lyrically, but suffers from possessing a somewhat unimpressive hook.

B008LZHA3G|4.0|Very tight professional performance; vocals seemed artificially strained at times. Title track lost my attention at times and &#34;Roll on John&#34; seemd overly filled with obvious references to Lennon. &#34;Duquesne Whistle&#34; is Dylan at his best.
0385536828|4.0|Reads similarly to other novels by Ian McEwan. Wordy, sometimes where unnecessary, but overall good story. Read for book club and most of group enjoyed.
0786962984|4.0|Took my 11y.o. about 8 hours to complete the game but it's a great into for Pathfinder. Everything you need is there.
141659521X|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my husband. He LOVES Vince Flynn and we have every book he has published.  I know he will not be disappointed and I can't wait for him to finish reading it, so I can.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND for great reading experience!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I know this is a series, but this book is incomplete by itself. That said, I did really enjoy the read.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Since we had trouble with the power cord, this app was very helpful. It always let us know when we were charging properly.
B00A757EFW|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE PAC MAN. This is an awesome game, a game that never gets old. Great stress reliever.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Love this!!!!!! It helped me be able to use the camera that the Kindle Fire HD already has. But without Skype I couldn't access.
B0000AFOHH|5.0|Wakeman was a virtuose of his instrument back in 70's. White Rock is also a good tool to adjust your audiophile equipment, even more if you have the vinil too.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|dragonvale is a great game. ive had it for quite a while, and had no problems whatsoever. this is a great game for anyone. no ads, no nothing. really a GREAT game!!!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I admire Johnny Depp and the transformations he makes. In his films, he plays the innocent and caught of guard personality well; however, this movie was typically Tim Burton and although I enjoy his earlier works, I have been less than satisfied with this recent films (i.e. Willy Wonka, Alice in Wonderland, etc).  I want to like these movies, but I just don't.
1607066017|5.0|I got this book because of the cover art and the blurb.  I am so happy I did, because it is a fantastic story, so far. It has great characters, good pacing, good dialog, and good artwork.  Buy this and you won't be disappointed.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I am a loyal fan to the MIB franchise. They came out when I was in junior high. I really enjoyed this take on the characters. Josh Brolin was right on with his manifestation of young Agent K. Will Smith was delightful as usual. The villian was menacing. I can appreciate this film including some of its flaws. At times it appeared 'CG,' but I didn't mind. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing a bit of the past from these characters.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|for her fans this is terrific. Great voice, great songs and you will enjoy immensely. Also for gifts to friends
B00A7ZX4RO|3.0|Ive only given it one go-round and my first impression is that she might be in a competition with herself to see how many times she can use the f-word. Even on the first go round it's an ok album, so it will likely get better the more I listen to it. Glad I waited for it to go on sale though
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|one of his best recordings. If you are a fan, purchase it and enjoy a great recording and buy his others.
B009K72G8I|4.0|One of the best clone wars, and we enjoys it very much.<br /><br />Darth-maul is so great. This season contain many star wars character that we loves

B007STXHTM|5.0|Nice to have a flat front lens. Finally has a lens cover too. Well built as well so I'm looking forward to putting it everywhere. I just with the gopro didn't have a rolling shutter. Oh well.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|if you a fan of this group you will find this highly enjoyable and great listening music. Highly recommended to buy
B009UMTMKS|5.0|No matter how cool your idea is, or no matter how big or important your vision is, read this and follow it. You may find yourself doing pivot on your idea/vision sooner than you expected, and by the end of the day, it may save you years of your life building 'cool' product nobody needs.
B002RD4UZ4|2.0|music too slow, disappointed, could not even listent to whole recording. I don't think you should wate your money unless a  fan!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Hated the ending, but loved the book.  I just wish she had been delt with better.  Maybe, like, eternity in a psych ward?
B001EZ78T6|5.0|Legend is a legend. Terrific recording and you will play over and over again.Buy it for gifts as well and add to your collection
B003UBTX6S|3.0|SO, for sequel this was pretty darn good. There was plenty of the suspense that we all loved from the previous book Beautiful creatures. I liked where the story kicked off and characters were the same ones that grew on us. BUT after reading a book with a sweet storyline this just made me uneasy. I know that after a death of a loved one, there is bound to be tension and some backing away, but it almost made me cry. Ethan throughout the book is so kind and understanding and willing to listen,but Lena Is not throwing him a bone. Both of them were lost and I just wanted everything to be OK. Everyone is shaking their head and wanting Ethan to kick Lena to the curb. But hope is not lost. Being the determined cutie that he is, Ethan chooses not to give up on Lena and goes on an adventure to help her. SO WILL HE SAVE HER? You would think, but there are plenty of twists to keep you guessing. I did not really like the new girl Lib (no be supposed to be a v at the end). She does help Ethan and deal with her with a certain loss of her own SO it's hard not to feel for her. There are some fun moments between her Link Ethan and Ridley. Yes, Ridley comes out in this book too. Could not forgot her, could we? I thought it was a satisfying sequel. It was still lacking in the urgency department, but I Can not get enough. Readers who fell in love with the first will love this. A good solid read overall. AFTER You read this, you will want to see where it goes.
0316056863|5.0|Loved this book and could not put it down. She is not only a great comedy actor, but writer and jack of all trades. You will love reading this book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It may not even compare to the Pc version, but there are soo many cool things to do! you can spleef, or race in a maze.you can build a fort and try to stop your friends from getting in. this amazing game has unlimited possabilities.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|for loyals fans ofSade, you will love this recording as it is one of her best. Add to your collection
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This is an extreamly astounding book, with many historical aspects to it. However, the one thing i enjoied most in this page-turning novel was the names of the books the main charachter recieves. Fantastic for grades 7 and up.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Good acting, good plot and a well made movie. Way out there but entertaining in the same was as the Indiana Jones series.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I enjoyed this a lot, even though most of the actors are too old to be college students.  The plot was thin but attractively clothed.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Its a nice break from Facebook but its hard to get used to typing a limited amount.  But I like it better than FB :P
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|This is one of the best LOTR LEGO sets.  I have multiples, because it is a great add on set.  In the Star Wars LEGOS they have what they call Battle Sets.  They have 4 minifigs and some accessories.  And, you can get multiple battle sets to add to your collection.  They typically sell for about half of what the Urak-Hai set sells for, but they have less minifigs and less accessories.  So, I think of this set as a large battle set.  Buy extras.  Add to Helm's deep and make the castle larger and add to your army.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I ordered this and received exactly what is shown.  It's a great series about the different area's & type of habitats across the world.  I thoroughly enjoy watching this series and have not completed them all as it comes with all of the different series all in one package.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|Will become a collector set.  Get it while you can.  That is, if you aren't too late.<br /><br />A great set for display.  From a distance it doesn't look like a LEGO set.<br /><br />This set replaces the previous LEGO shuttle set 10213, because the prior set has some stability issues.  This set is almost identical to the earlier set.  It just has some additional braces, etc. And, the engines are a bit different.<br /><br />Will take about 10-12 hours to build, based on how quickly you build LEGOS.  There are 2 instruction books.  The build is pretty fun.  Building the two holding tanks is a bit redundant, but overall the build is great.  Especially when you think about building a piece of history.  It's not a difficult build, not like a Technic set<br /><br />The shuttle program has been retired.  Having this set is a great way to continue the memory.  It is very realistic, has opening bay doors and some astronauts, one male, one female.  Unfortunately, they aren't too scale with the shuttle.  But, to make the shuttle to scale with a minifig it would have been too big, in my opinion.
B00A856U7O|5.0|A great album! Thalía did a excelent job! The voice of Mexico come back to us! The only one! I loved all songs!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|this game is fun and challenging.  the puzzles are sometime simple and sometimes quite complex. it so fun to draw just the right thing st the right time
B005HSL626|4.0|I play this game almost daily, more from my phone than my tablet. I have it downloaded for both though. It's simple but can be challenging and gets harder the higher your score climbs like any good game should.
B005LAII3U|3.0|\\"Total Recall\\" is a remake of the 1990 sci-fi film that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Because of its success, Hollywood decided to dust it off, reboot it, make a few changes, and present it as a summer action alternative to \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\"<br /><br />Based on the Philip K. Dick novel \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,\\" the current \\"Total Recall\\" is set in a future world comprised of two superstates, the United Federation of Britain and The Colony.  The Colony's inhabitants must travel from their bleak, overcrowded neighborhoods to their factory jobs in the wealthy Federation via the Earth's only remaining means of long-distance travel -- the Fall, a huge elevator/tram that drops through the core of the Earth and deposits its passengers on the other side. The entire journey takes a mere 17 minutes, far better than a daily commute across the GW Bridge in 2012.<br /><br />Because life is dull, a company called Rekall offers to provide customers with vivid memories of pleasurable experiences. Colony-dweller Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell), dreaming of a more exciting and glamorous life, ignores the warnings of a co-worker and visits Rekall, where he pays for a chemical implant that will give him an artificially induced memory of an exciting past. In the midst of the treatment, however, all hell breaks loose when armed robot police break in and start shooting the place up.  Miraculously, and for reasons unknown to him, Doug manages to destroy a pile of these deadly adversaries in breakneck time.  How can he do this?  Where did he learn the skills?  Is this reality?  A memory?  A combination?<br /><br />So goes the rest of the movie, an above-average action flick with more than its share of twists and turns.  As you watch, you'll notice borrowings from other sci-fi films. The sunless, rain-soaked landscapes are right out of \\"Blade Runner;\\" the white-clad robot police are clones of the \\"Star Wars\\" stormtroopers; a gravity-less sequence is reminiscent of the hotelcorridor sequence in \\"Inception;\\" images of the Colony's occupier, Cohagen (Brian Cranston), appear on giant screens everywhere, in clear homage to \\"1984;\\" and the daily drudgery of the workers comes right from Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis.\\"<br /><br />Farrell plays Quaid as a nondescript Everyman. Farrell's cinematic stature does not yet match that of brighter lights Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford, and that helps us accept Doug as the poor schlub next door who gets himself into a pretty complicated fix.  Hitchcock never did science fiction, but he'd likely enjoy the plot -- an innocent gets involved in an immensely sticky lethal mess and must work his way out of it. The story draws us in and holds us, and director Len Wiseman keeps the pace brisk and lively with enough action for two pictures.<br /><br />The standout performance in \\"Total Recall\\" is from Kate Beckinsale as Doug's wife, who has an agenda all her own. The role has many intriguing facets, which will not be revealed here.  Ms. Beckinsale does so much running, fighting, chasing, and shooting that she resembles a computer-generated video game avatar, but gets to convey enough human emotion to keep her character reasonably grounded.<br /><br />The dialogue in Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback's script is frequently pedestrian and ordinary.  The 1990 version had humor, even campiness tossed in, making it a unique experience.  The present \\"Total Recall\\" takes itself far more seriously, with tremendous effort (and money) devoted to elaborate action sequences.  When it comes to an award for cleverness or sparkle, the scriptwriters might as well stay home.<br /><br />The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos is striking.  The Fall, in particular, is impressive and includes lots of interesting details that make such a contraption plausible. The intercutting of live action and real sets with the CGI imagery is smooth, and when the computer-generated shots are shown, there is always a slightly panning camera movement to make them appear more authentic.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for violence and language, \\"Total Recall\\" is a journey of the mind set in a futuristic time.  When compared with other sci-fi movies, it doesn't rank with the best.  As an action film, however, it offers a two-hour thrill ride.<br /><br />Bonus extras on the two-disc Blu-ray edition include several behind-the-scenes featurettes, digital copy, and gag reel.  There are also single-disc and three-disc Blu-ray editions. The latter contains all the extras on the two-disc edition as well as a DVD version.

B009POCG0Y|2.0|\\"Killer Joe\\" is an adapatation of the earliest work of Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Tracy Letts, directed by William Friedkin (\\"The French Connection,\\" \\"The Exorcist\\").<br /><br />When drug dealer Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) loses his stash of cocaine, he winds up in serious debt to some violent thugs.  Chris comes to his father (Thomas Haden Church) with a plan; they should hire someone to kill Chris' biological mother so that his emotionally damaged sister Dottie (Juno Temple) can claim the life insurance.<br /><br />The hitman of choice:  depraved Dallas detective and part-time murderer Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey). Because the plan is crazy to begin with, there is no place to go but down.  Amid loads of NC-17 violence, the scheme spirals out of control, with one unforseen event setting off another as the bodies pile up.<br /><br />Blu-ray bonus extras include a featurette about adapating \\"Killer Joe\\" from stage to screen, Q & A with the cast, introduction by William Friedkin, and audio commentary with Friedkin.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I really wanted to love this movie - I am a big fan of the first and greatly enjoyed the second. There was just something off about it, and I couldn't place it until about 1:45 in and realized I've barely seen Batman. All in all, it was just a strangely paced movie - taking the first 2 hours to lead up to the third act that attempted to resolve 5 months of time in 45 minutes.<br /><br />On a positive note, the performances were great as usual, as well as the cinematography, just wish the plot wasn't so contrived.

B009AZZEU2|4.0|I enjoyed this cd. Love using this for my kettlebell workouts. Good music to work out hard too.  Everyone who hears it with me likes it also
B006ATJXQW|3.0|That about sums up the majority of this book. I really liked how the author describes Mark's feelings and the gamut they run. What a person would  do to protect the ones they love and what happens to them when they feel their losing that battle...A world destroyed by Sun flares...the burned and melted people were not the worst consequences. It was the depth which the remaining population went to to insure their survival.<br /><br />3.5 stars
B000UX6THK|5.0|I was disappointed when this series was actually on TV and was not continued. Season 2 did lose my interest a little, but not enough to not watch. I think it would be great if they did this all over again and made another series from the beginning.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Great CD!!!!! It  has all of her best songs on it! I have seen her new show in Vegas and wanted all<br />the songs she sings, this has all but &#34;Today is Your Day&#34;. But she wrote that later.

B002ZG997C|3.0|I may have just gotten a bad egg or the seller was selling bootleg copies or something. As far as the movie goes: outstanding! All else aside, this movie deserves a 10. However, I did not watch the movie until about a month after I purchased it, and it turned out that instead of the top and bottom of the screen being black in widescreen mode, they were white. This was incredibly annoying watching in the dark. the brightness of the screen was burning my eyes and made watching the movie uncomfortable and distracting. That is why I rated 3 stars
B004U52VPS|5.0|I actually bought this for my cousins for Christmas, but my brother and I (we're 17 and 15) got it out and started playing and now we kinda wanna keep it! Haha it's actually kinda challenging too
B004TI5N38|5.0|This was the first book I bought for my Kindle. I really enjoy David Baldacci and this was no exception. Great details that are always well researced and accurate and always great plot lines with unexpected twists, no matter how many of them you read.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book has it all .  A continued story from Bared to you with the same wonderful characters:  Evil women you just have to hate.  Murder.  Great erotic sex.  I can't wait for the next book to come out.  This series just gets  progressively better with each book Sylvia Day writes.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My 6 year old daughter and I are hopelessly addicted to this game. We love my little pony the show so this was a fun thing for us. It's basically the Sims but with ponies. The only thing I don't like is that it appears some of the missions require you to have friends via facebook or game loft. I would prefer to be able to play the game without being required to link up with other player. That is my only critisism of the game. Very entertaining with out being too complicated.
B00846REIS|5.0|If someone asked would you read this book again? I'd have to say yes, and I have.  Love the characters, good story<br />line, great erotic sex.  What more could a reader ask for except maybe when does a sequel come out.
0802130208|5.0|When a true genius appears, you can know him by this sign: that all the dunces are in a confederacy against him.  Jonathan Swift<br /><br />Swift's quotation describes Ignatius J. Reilly better than you could possible imagine. The entire world is filled with idiots interfering, cheating, manipulated the misunderstood genius, or so it seems in Ignatius's mind. Ignatius is over-educated, under-motivated, overweight, and socially deformed in his quest to, well, to do nothing. His mother is over-bearing yet sympathetic, but she is running out of patience with her TV-watching son. The story begins with a small car accident in New Orleans, forcing Ignatius to seek employment to pay help pay for the damages. The results are pure comedy.<br /><br />Ignatius hops from a clerk in a failing clothing company to a hot dog vendor to a political organizer in an effort to bring his intelligence to a much lower element of society. Lucky them. The story is filled with flawed characters: a hapless police office, a detached business owner and his condescendingly liberal wife, a busybody neighbor, a stripper with a heart of gold, a flamboyant party organizer, a cruel strip bar owner, an elderly clerk with dementia, and female college activist with a penchant for bad screenplays and petty antics. And, of course, is Jones, a Black janitor for the less-than-reputable Night of Joy strip club. Jones is the least educated yet the sharpest character in the bunch.<br /><br />But the real story is Ignatius himself. His \\"Oh my God!\\" gasps, complaints about his heart valve, and his sophisticated turnings of a phrase make this a funny, funny book. As readers we both love and despise Ignatius. Either way, we watch him with car wreck-like wonder.<br /><br />The story behind the book is interesting: the book was published posthumously after his mother nagged Walker Percy to read it. Toole committed suicide in 1969, and the novel was published in 1980. It won the Pulizer Prize the following year.<br /><br />I've wanted to read this book for years now. Mark read it this year, and his review nudged me to start it. I alternated reading the book with listening to the audio book. I'm glad I listened to it, because this is the best production of any audio book I've ever heard. The performance of Ignatius and Jones is unbelievable.<br />I've wanted to read this book for years now. Mark read it this year, and his review nudged me to start it.

B000GCFG7E|4.0|Another great book by Lee Child. I keep checking to buy his next one for a good read - cdp
B001KT71XY|5.0|The Thornbirds was a novel I picked up on my own when I was a junior in highschool. I was completely enamored with the Australian outback and the characters McCollough brought to life.<br />This book is something I can read over and over again, each time learning something more about the characters and of myself. It is intriguing that the three generations of women are focused on instead of the men. It truly speaks to the expectations of women, their roles, and the transformation as time progresses.<br />I also liked the mother-daughter relationships that are discussed. The Thornbirds is a novel for everyone. Whether you are interested in a forbidden love, the legacy of women and the progression of womens roles throughout the years- this book has it all.<br />Please do yourself a favor and read this book. You may not love it as much as I do, but I ensure that you will be enveloped in the story and the intriguing characters that are followed.

B0039HR5QS|5.0|I usually don't watch older movies (this one was released the year I was born) but am I glad I didn't skip this one.  Its just really good!
B001EBWITA|1.0|I did not like the movie as the dialogue was whispered and it was difficult to understand what was being said, and to make it even more objectionable, the audio level would overwhelm when the scene cut to an action event. The audio level had to be constantly adjusted and the picture was not very sharp even with a Hi-Def monitor. It is suggested Amazon get a limiting amplifier or one of the old CBS Audiomax units like TV broadcasters used in the 60's to prevent the commercials' audio levels from annoying the viewers. Run ALL movies through an audio processor and get this under control.<br /> Jim
B003VANOFY|5.0|it pretty good . the sound is pretty loud . and i will recommend people what want to go wireless
B0092QITO2|5.0|Being a big fan of the original Total Recall, I was skeptical at best when hearing about this remake.  I was worried that they were going to stray too far from the path of the original.  However, I was also really excited about it because it looked like it was going to be good...with some great action & special affects, and the cast overall caught my fancy.  I thought maybe there was someone better they could have maybe cast instead of Colin Farrell for the role, but he was actually pretty good.<br /><br />My dad and I were going to go and see this in the theater together because we both enjoy science fiction movies but in the end we never were successful in making it out to catch it.  I had heard good things from a couple of people I know and read enough good reviews here on Amazon so I wound up just buying it on Blu-Ray after it came out, and I wound up scoring a free demo of the upcoming God of War Ascension with it for my Ps3 as well, so that was pretty cool.<br /><br />I was told by someone when going into the movie not to compare it too closely to the original but instead just enjoy the movie for what it is.  It is very much the same as far as concept and it follows the same kind of idea & storyline, but at the same time it's very much it's own movie, and brilliantly so too.  The acting is well done, the action & special affects were outstanding, and movie is just all around a great sci-fi action film!<br /><br />I do not wish to say too much about the plot, the only thing I will say is that it takes place on a post nuclear Earth as opposed to on Mars and there's no alien type stuff or anything.  If you have seen the original film the plot is very similar though in many ways(there's even homage to the 3 boobed chick in it) but I will say this for all of you...don't compare it too closely to the original though.  While it follows the same plot and concept, it does stray to it's own means with a lot of it.  Try to just have an open mind though and enjoy the movie for what it is...a very stylish, updated, thrilling reimagining.  For all sci-fi lovers that have never actually seen the original, definitely see this movie.  I would recommend checking out the original too...just be forewarned of a few cheesy 80s type bits in it but it's an overall worthwhile experience too.e for what it is...a very stylish, updated, thrilling reimagining.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have been thinking about it for some time.  I won't destroy the ironies, and I wonder if the insights into animal behavior are true or not.  It is not quite good enough to make me want to research some of my questions, but I am looking forward to seeing how it is handled in the movie--certain sections specifically.  A good read.  A good vacation book.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Book one was wonderful, with the kind of potential that could make it a classic (think a sci-fi O'Henry or the surprise ending of an Ender's Game). Had the rest of the five books maintained the same level of excellence, I would have given it five stars. Which is not to say the remaining 500 pages weren't good. But as the story progressed, some flaws emerged.<br /><br />The author has a tendency, at least early on, to kill off point-of-view characters--in itself not a fatal flaw, but nevertheless annoying. Secondly, a large percentage of the surprise occurs in the first book. And while there's a lot of world building to come, it's spread over many more pages and lacks the impact of the first book. Sure, there's lots of action throughout. The book was fast paced and hard to put down. But there were too many scenes of people running up and down stairs --a limitation of life in a silo. And some places had pace but little tension.<br /><br />Hemingway said never confuse movement with action. Some scenes consisted mostly of people we hardly knew shooting at each other. Contrast those with the part where Juliette goes underwater to fix the pumps--much less violent, but with far more tension.<br /><br />The writing overall was good, but the editing became sloppier as the story progressed. Book five, which is 35% of the total, seemed to ramble a bit.<br /><br />One final peeve. After reading The Hunger Games, Divergent and now Wool, I'm sensing a trend toward ever increasing gratuitous violence. I'm reminds of the scene in the spoof movie Hot Shots, where a Rambo-like Charlie Sheen is mowing down enemies while a video-arcade counter shows the growing body count. The display finally declares a new record when the count exceeds that of Total Recall. I'm starting to feel that way about the latest crop of dystopian novels.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|My kids loved it. They are 10 and 6 and thought it was very good.  It was a little dark for me though

146500632X|5.0|My daughter is totally into One Direction. When I saw this the other day in the store, I knew I had to get it for her for Christmas. The only problem is I brought it inside and left it on the kitchen table and got distracted. She saw it and flipped out. So, Merry early Christmas to her! The quality of the paper is nice and she is really happy with the picture selection in it. I never liked any boy bands when I was younger, but I must admit, when I hear these songs on the radio, I actually like them. So I guess if she has to be crazy in love with a band, thank goodness it's one that doesn't drive me crazy. If your daughter likes them, this would be a great Christmas or even a New Year's present for them. You are likely to hear shrieks or squeals for a thank you.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|From the first book and the youngsters I know who read it, I expected &#34;young adult&#34; fiction.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Ok, so I love reading the reviews people post for the books I am thinking of buying but I have never taken the time to actually write a review myself, needless to say this is a first for me. Hands down this book and story is one of the best I have ever had the privilege to read. I am a reader, an avid reader. The best gift I have ever been given, hands down has been my Kindle. I read a lot before the Kindle but I have read ten times more with it. Hopeless is my most recent Kindle purchase, I read Colleen Hoover's two other book and I loved those stories, but this one was different. I loved the main characters of this book, I hated the heartache that each one felt but I loved the choices that they all made to repair the damage. This story tugged at my heart strings for every person who has gone through something similar but I am infinitely glad I chose to buy this book. I picked it up mid-morning on Monday and finished it by 11:30 that same night. I literally could not put it down. Thank you Colleen Hoover, I appreciate you and your stories and can't wait for more. Happy Holidays!

B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Cant' believe these women are suffering this cultural hardship even now.<br />Interesting, compleling, I would read it again.<br />I recommend it.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Great movie slick and lively!!!a very worthy sequel to the series.Action scenes a little better than previous films in that the camera work isn't as frenzied as the other films and you can focus more on the action.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is the best show I've seen in a long time, the acting is great and it's so realistic and it always has us on the edge of our seat!!!
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Love this show, can't wait to get season 2! It's great for the whole family, and very kid friendly. Love!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I've had a lot of fun with this one. It's a little bit pricier than other game apps, but there are tons of puzzles which make it worth it to me. You do need to zoom in on smart phones to make sure you are selecting the right square.
B009K45Y62|5.0|If you love batman I would highly recommend that you buy this collectors edition its the best purchase I made this year.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Much better than I expected, comes together as a funny all ages movie. This is a good way to end the trilogy.
B003102JDM|4.0|As Coen brothers films usually, it was long and it was dark. I kept waiting for something good to happen for the main character, but that's kind of the whole point of the film. However, I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday since it is his favorite movie and was forever complaining that he couldn't find it anywhere - got it at a good price and fit the bill quite nicely.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This series smartly builds over the five parts building upon the earlier issues, with an excellent first section as an attention getter. There are excellent story arcs and characters that you are never sure will make it or not. While not wildly exciting in all aspects, it does visit an interesting apocalyptic future that reminded me of the opening scenes of fallout 3, and explores the seldom seen science fiction concept of living in a vault and the politics that can quickly explode in a confined space.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Why, you may ask? Well I don't like the dictionary anyway. So I think you should make a better version of it. Even though it will stink up the whole room. This book made me want to die. If you can delete this stupid dictionary from the webernet, I sure hope you have a darn chance to do so. I really enjoy criticism. So I hope that after reading this review you will too. As many others as well may, I se d my regrets to this stupid dictionary review. Ha Ha Ha, to you. Suckas
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Great movie! If you like Wes Anderson's movies, this one is a classic. Fantastic Mr. Fox is another Wes Anderson movie
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book is so awesome! I can't wait to read the next one. If you make more books don't hesitate to tell me,because I will definitely read them.  I have finished the first book and I'm currently saving up for the next book, Reached. When I read some parts I was just like, OMG! This is SOO good! I hope to read more good books by Ally Condie soon enough. Thanks for reading this review! THIS BOOK IS DA BOMB! Its so awesome! I love(<3) it so much. Next I'm gonna get the new book reached. Thanks again and always.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love it!  I would and have recommend this game to anyone.  I have let others play it on my Kindle.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It was hard to use because you couldn't type in the word and then it would go to the word in the book. I hope you can change that soon.<br /><br /><3
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I recommend this to everyone because of its good story. It is the continual zombie flick. Each season gets better.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to you,<br /><br />I loved this book, starting the next one can't wait.  You just can't stop once you start reading this.
B00A6I87UQ|4.0|Very handy to have on night time walks or drives. Useful information to make stargazing a fun activity. Better then one would think date.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I doubt E.L.James was trying to write something for Pulitzer or Nobel prizes when this work hit the page. Without giving anything away I'll say it's main characters are more than a little kinky--well he's kinky and she finds him irresistible in spite of it.I'm sure 50 Shades written as a jump starter--turn on reading--it works. I'm fairly conservative and don't care for porn movies--no good story line in them, but this book does (simple, but there and the imagination can do wonders with written word). 50 shades is a turn on. Granted some of the replies/thoughts the characters have are trivial, but again--it's a book to get folks thinking outside the box...NO pun intended, but like I say above, don't expect more. Men, read it and then give it to your partner.
B009329Y30|5.0|The Lucky One is a sweet romance movie.  I read the book first and the movie really dipicted the book.  The message is straight to the heart.

B008ASLNN2|5.0|I love both movies so I think I have to label each one on its own merits with five stars.  I like it enough to see again.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Wow  wow wow.  This is also a must have in 3D.  I can watch this movie over and over again.
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|This was a different kind of story...I like different, so it was good.  It's not your typical comedy, but it's not a real drama either.  Obviously taking place in a psych ward of a hospital, it's got both humor and serious moments that were well done by the actors.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|The price was right and the movie is great.  We watched it on Holloween and it looks great on our new televistion.<br />I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B0064J6P8W|4.0|I like Ryan Reynolds in comedies.  He's a funny guy and the movie is pretty good.  I'd watch again but don't recall the specifics having viewed it a while ago.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|This is a must have.  The colors are great and the grandkids and myself were really excited to watch it in 3D.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very unique and interesting. Would recommend to anyone who likes adventure but isn't bothered by killing and a what at times is gruesome. Love the main character and her 1st person point of view. This book is inspiring yet sad. Would highly recommend!

0307279189|4.0|By pure coincidence a hard core runner gave me this book to read just before I went to Namibia. Tarahumara runners still fresh in my mind from the pages I  was fortunate enough to spend two days with a Kalahari bushman. What is the connection? Read the book. Did we evolve vertical so we were better at moving horizontally? Read the book. I had long thought that we humans unable to outrun a mouse and with less vertical leap than most lapdogs were the wimps of the animal kingdom only able to survive because of our superior brain power. I was wrong.
B008B68IEA|5.0|My daughter received this bed set as a gift, she was beyond excited to start using it with her favorite MH character, Abbey.<br />As a parent, I'm pleased with the durability of this item, we also have the MH house and its quiet flimsy so it's nice that this play set is made well.<br />It's nice to see Mattel is making more MH play sets.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is better than the movie for sure. It is a really good read. Don't forget the other three
B006O6F932|4.0|My daughter was beyond thrilled to get this for her birthday. Easy to put together and also easy to store.<br />The product itself is very cute with a ton of detail and thought put into making this house a MH fan dream come true, but as a parent and someone who spent close to $100 on this product I would have to say that I wish I would have waited to buy this at the $50 mark that amazon had it listed as few weeks ago due to how flimsy the product is. For instance, when using the doll to \\"climb\\" the stairs you have to be somewhat gentle because the stairs will detach from the base.<br />They will probably come out with a better house soon I'm sure.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game!  Makes you think without the pressure of a timer, for one thing, and somehow makes it relaxing too.  Great graphics, nice music.  Might be nice to have more than one music option - sometimes I play for a long time!  Totally worth it.  Get Quell Reflect, too!!!  Keep on making these kind of games, people!!
B0095R76EW|1.0|I felt like I was living through their five year engagement in real time. The pacing of this film is glacial.
B007RX32TY|4.0|I have to disagree with some of the reviewers dislike of the mellow, instrumental passages. These are just quieter (certainly not silent, as one reviewer claimed) 'atmospheric' segments and not 'songs' per se.  For me, they're actually some of the better parts of the album. Yes, they do require being taken within the context of the album as a whole, as opposed to played on shuffle, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Overall, the album makes great late-night, headphoned listening. There's a few poppy songs (reminiscent of the Raveonettes), but the overall feel is probably closer to the XX.  I personally found it to be similar to David A Stewart's soundtrack for Lily Was Here in places, and could also quite imagine it soundtracking something like the Death Wish movies, or some '90s Jan Hammer tosh. So a little dated, but still a satisfying listen.
0786956291|5.0|Son absolutely loved this item.  He has been playing this with his friends without the starter kit.  Now they enjoy the game even more.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|First, I am a John Grisham fan, so I'm inclined to like his novels.  However, for a while there it seemed as if he was &#34;stuck in a rut&#34; with his story lines.  However, &#34;The Racketeer&#34; notches up the interest a bit. I was never quite sure what was going on until near the end as the answers to the questions started rolling in. The narrative kept me wanting to read more, and I found it hard to put down. The story line is unique and a definite departure from previous Grisham novels. It's fun to read a mystery novel that doesn't require death and gore to make it work.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|try and keep the flowing going and connect the tubes in all the cames in the least moves. it a challange
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works like it said it would.  Did not need it after all since the problem was actually with my Kindle instead of the charge cord but it does charge the device really fast
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really cool. the theme is where Santa catches you doing graffitti in a subway. then he starts chasing you through the subway where you have a bunch of obstacles such as moving trains, barriers, and other cool stuff. in my opinion the idea ofthis game was really creative and innovative. this game is really awesome and i almost never get tired of it.....
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I am not usually one for either &#34;kid&#34; movies or comedy and putting them together is usually an &#34;avoid at all costs&#34; for me...this Moonrise Kingdom is an exception to that longstanding rule.  I just loved it.  If you need a chuckle...enjoy.  That being said, my 17 year old daughter hated it...but my 14 year old loved it...so who's to say...perhaps my 14 year old had more in common with these wacky characters (and so do I).
0061969664|4.0|If you have made it this far in the series, then this is a must read.  Just like the others though, this book leaves you ready for the next one.

B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This is not as good as the Mahjong on your computer, but it suffices to help pass time.  Pictures are a bit small.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I play it on all devices.... but on my kindle fire it wont let me connect with other people. Im not sure if its just my kindle or do others have this problem? if it could be fixed ill give it a 10 out of 5 if I could!
B00A77II0U|4.0|It is a good game, but a bit too easy.  I had it completed in a few hours.  It was still interesting.  Graphics were okay.
B00005RDSM|5.0|I love that my kids get to use their imaginations and play make believe after watching this movie! Such a great movie!
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|Reading over the book, it makes you think you can hook your Kendle up to the computer and share data.  This is wrong.  There is not a driver for this from what I can tell.  Definitely false advertising in my opinion, unless someone can show me something different.
1416955070|4.0|The plot is well-balanced, nicely paced and managed to hold my excitement and anticipation for what was going to happen next throughout the whole story. There is a huge plot twist at the end of the book which is so unexpected that it had my mind stuck in a repetition of  \\"HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?\\" How the characters will deal with this development, well, that is for me to find out in the sequel.<br /><br />The characters are definitely my favorite part about City of Bones. Their interactions are absolutely hilarious and had me laughing out loud at several occasions.<br />Clary might not be a kick-ass demon slayer like Isabel, but she is without a doubt a girl who is strong in her own right. She likes to draw, an artistic trait that has been passed down from her mother, and I really felt like I was seeing things from the eyes of an artist.<br />Jace is probably the biggest smartass you will ever meet. He is bold, sassy and has a strict rule of never telling lies. He is a brother, a protector and the one who makes everybody laugh even in the darkest of times. I can guarantee that you will adore this guy.<br /><br />The dynamics between the two characters is phenomenal and I loved that Clary was able to stand up to Jace and be just as witty in her retorts as he was.<br /><br />To sum it up, City of Bones was a delightful read and I've got the sequel, City of Ashes, ready and waiting for me in my book shelf.
B00AHSGNJM|2.0|I wanted to download (and purchase) this children's video to install in my iPad so that I could project with a pico projector during a trip to remote places in South Pacific next month.  Amazon Direct provided video, but unfortunately, the download was not compatible with Apple. Product was OK, could play, but could not project. Amazon Direct is not for me.  But, they did refund purchase price.  I have removed Amazon Direct from my system.  Will stick with iTunes and Apple store for electronic downloads and forego Amazon in that category.
0525478817|5.0|Sometimes we get to read a really good book.  If we are lucky, we might even get to read a great book once in a while. But then there is also `that kind of book'. You know what I mean. The kind of book that you swore you was only going to read a couple of pages of that evening, but by 3 am you had flipped the final page and realized you had read through the whole thing. The kind of book that your thoughts keep returning to, even though you have long since finished reading it.<br /><br />The Fault in our Stars by John Green is just `that kind of book'.<br /><br />The voice of Hazel, our lovely main character and narrator, is sharp and witty and you instantly get the impression that she is very wise beyond her years. Hazel has a very straightforward and clear view of the world she lives in. Hazel has no pretenses about her decease and she knows she will never get well, but, as Augustus points out to us in the story, her strong personality shines through in everything she does and makes her more alive than any of the characters I have had the pleasure to follow in a very long time.<br /><br />Augustus, a boy Hazel meets at cancer kid support group, is charming and just as witty as Hazel. They are two very compatible individuals and their relationship helps them both to really get out of their shells. When Hazel and Augustus interact with each other, we get to see everything that they are, everything that they wish to be, and at times even what they might become, and that itself takes serious masterful writing.<br /><br />I might not have read that many stories about people with terminal deceases, but I have no doubt that The Fault in Our Stars is as authentic as it is going to get. There is no sugar coating or glorification of this book; It is just about a seventeen year old girls with \\"lungs that suck at being lungs.\\"<br /><br />I will be perfectly honest with you though, I cried like a little girl when I finished it, and yet this is a book I will return to and re-read many times in the future.<br /><br />John Green, I thank you for sharing this amazing book with the rest of us and I look forward to reading more of your work.d many times in the future.<br /><br />John Green, I thank you for sharing this amazing book with the rest of us and I look forward to reading more of your work.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one mystery novel that kept me thinking long after I read it.  The last three chapter gave me the chills
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love a romance even if they are a little bit unrealistic and they're based more on fantasy then reality!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was outstanding. It kept my mind racing trying to figure out who was good or bad. Turns out it was a bizarre mx of human dysfunction that drove these characters.  I highly recommend this book.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|I know the Rolling Stones have released many &#34;greatest hits&#34; prior, but this one is all one could ask for and at the price at the time, I couldnt resist. Long Live MIck, Keith and the rest. Their music is timeless
B009CPEOC4|5.0|This movie was fun to watch especially because the music was great and Katy has the most amazing and creative costumes!
B005K0S2SW|5.0|I really enjoy music from this artist.  My son is a trombonist so I can truly appreciate what it takes to be able to play this instrument.  Great sound, great arrangments.  I loved his last album and this one is just as good.
0425263908|1.0|This was not a good book. I'm not sure I made it to the end and I skipped over half the book cause the intimate scenes seemed as though the auther copy and pasted them; very repetitive, and very \\"basic\\". People say 50 Shades is unrealistic and seems as though a \\"young, teenage girl\\" wrote it. People who say that obviously have not read this book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another excellent Harry Bosch book. It was Harry at his refuse to back off for any reason until the case is solved best. Thank you Michael Connelly for your excellent writing and character.

B00AL1ONN8|5.0|This is an awesome cd by my guy Tip. He always come through in a major way and Trouble Man is no exception.
1452110581|5.0|Not only are the poems very clever, but the photographs are excellent - very expressive. You can tell what some of the cats are thinking. I've had several cats over the years, and the poems truly capture what I'm sure some of mine were thinking.<br /><br />I love dogs too, but I laughed out loud at \\"Man's Best Friend\\". \\"A Cat Like Me\\" reminded me of a Siamese I had years ago who, when he first saw himself in a mirror, looked behind it to try to find the other cat!
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Several of the songs are excellent and are as pleasing as the Broadway soundtrack but sad they took many of songs I really enjoy out of this soundtrack<br />I would have loved for them to include Lovely Ladies, Who Am I and Do You Hear the People Sing.<br /><br />I also feel like they did not do a great job on Master of the House.  It seemed lacking especially for Madame Thénardier part.  I love this musical and it just seems like the singer does not convey the true spirit and fire of the character in her singing.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is excellent in his renditions of Jean Valjean's character and Anne Hathaway really does a great job expressing the true torment Fantine feels in trying to provide for her child.<br /><br />While this album is making me more interested in watching the theatrical release, I think I will go back to listening to my more complete, more professional broadway soundtrack.  As a huge fan of Les Miserables, this one is just lacking too many songs and has weak vocals on some of the songs that are included.

B0067RQYNW|4.0|Although I just recently downloaded Kingsoft Office onto my Kindle Fire, it appears to be just what I wanted. We use a spreadsheet to track financial information. When we travel, we usually bring along a laptop. We are hoping to lighten our load by using the Kindle Fire. So we're experimenting prior to taking our Christmas journey.<br /><br />I attached an Excel spreadsheet to an email, (using Windows Live Mail) and sent it to myself. I used the Fire to open the email, then copied the file to the Kingsoft Office app and opened it. All was OK, Even the columns on the spreadsheet copied/pasted just as they were.<br /><br />I haven't gotten into the complexities of working with this software. However the few experiments I tried have me feeling that this Kingsoft Office will be user  friendly.
B009ZE27US|1.0|It's very simple. Put finger on screen, it randomly guesses your age. That's it. I'd give it 2 stars if it said I was younger, but because it says I'm older, it gets 1 star.
B00138KEZ4|4.0|I'm not the biggest fan of Sarah's &#34;First Noel/Mary, Mary,&#34; but I like every other song on this album.

You won't be disappointed.
1936608898|5.0|Lots of scientific information on the &#34;why&#34; behind their philosophy of what a good diet should be. The best part is that it is easy to understand and fun to read.

B0095VPAVE|5.0|Built a rig for my wife using this APU and a GB FM2 motherboard GA-F2A74M-D3H and it went together perfectly smooth.  No video card, just the built in version from this APU and it works just fine. Low cost, very low power rig that can play WoW and GW2 just fine.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|If you like games which are nearly totally HOG, you'll like this.  There are several variations on the hidden object theme, and the artwork is decent.<br />On my Kindle Fire, I found the &#34;find the difference&#34; scenes hard for my middle aged eyes to see since you can't enlarge them.<br />I wish there were more parts to the game which weren't simple hidden object searches.  I get bored trying to find random objects which have no relation to the story (which is minimal in this case anyway).
B00AH8VU0Y|1.0|Ill start by saying I love the series.  It isnt the series that gets the one star, its Amajoke.<br /><br />Episode 8 aired on December 2nd.  Today is the 20th.  Where is episode 9??? Why does it take this long to get them posted up here?  Im better off just DVR'ing them rather than paying Amajoke all this money then having to wait nearly THREE WEEKS to pick up and episode.....<br /><br />This is the last current season Ill ever buy-----just isnt worth it!!!!

B009HEJXFS|3.0|The previews were great, but those were the only laughs.  Obviously they ran out of stories and this edition is a dreary mess.  Josh Brolin gets a few small laughs as a younger Tommy Lee Jones, copying his voice inflections well.  Too bad there wasn't a story to hang it on.
B006J420UE|5.0|I loved this processor from my first pc build and now another build another processor and im still very pleased by it
B00A80SHFM|4.0|*****FOR THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING OF THIS ALBUM LACKING SONGS, IT'S A \\"HIGHLIGHTS\\" ALBUM, NOT A COMPLETE RECORDING.  KNOW THE DIFFERENCE<br /><br />Like other reviewers on here I have to agree that this is for those true Les Miserables film.  Those of us that have been eagerly anticipating the release of the soundtrack and of course counting down the days until the film's release.  That is not to say that others will not enjoy it, but probabaly won't be on constant repeat as it will for Les Mis fans.<br /><br />Now for the review.  Overall the Soundtrack as a whole is great.  The standouts are of course Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway.  You probably have never heard a version of I Dreamed A Dream like this and probably never well.  Also, it (thankfully) almost erases the memory of the travesty that was Daphne Rubin-Vega singing it on Broadway a few years back (if you have not heard this, go to youtube and you will shudder).  Samantha Barks is also amazing as I expected her to be (I am a little biased as Eponine is probably one of my favorite characters).  Eddie Redmayne as Marius, for me, lacked a little, I mean, he is not a bad singer, but he didn't do anything exciting for me.  One person I think that gets overlooked is Aaron Tviet as Enjorlas, I have enjoyed his voice since his stint on Broadway in Next To Normal, I enjoy his approach here and think he does a great job, (I think he would have made a better Marius).  Now for the disappoinments, Russell Crowe is pretty bland, boring and flat (not pitch-wise, vocal/acting choce wise), without any visuals, vocally he sounds like he is just standing there like a piece of wood.  Amanda Seyfried, all I can say is i'm glad the grown Cosette is not in the movie very much, her voice is aggravating and gets on my nerves. She sounds like a shrill goat, her vibrato is insane and not pretty.  As for the Thenardiers, they will do the job and it'll be fine, but just like Marius, not much excitement, just kind of there.<br /><br />The orchestrations are lush and beautiful as expected for a Soundtrack.  I look forward to hearing a complete version of the soundtrack.  All I can say is, 3 more days!!!!!!!!!
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|I don't review too many things, but this I feel I must. I've read the other reviews here and do understand where everyone's coming from on each of their views. However, I saw Buddy live in Cleveland in the summer before this album was recorded. This new Live at Legends is the real deal; this is how his show sounds, right down to the mix. The sound on this is a bit more clubby than what I heard, but I saw him in an old theater with better acoustics. That one time I saw Buddy Guy live in concert was the highlight of my concert-going experiences in the first decade of the new century and this recording reminds me why. Some cool originals, some Muddy standards and some short cover medleys (two Cream, one Hendrix and one John Lee Hooker), which Buddy uses to teach on how tracks like the Hook's Boom Boom led to blues-rock. Three studio tracks are bonus, fill out the CD length and all solid. If you are a Buddy Guy fan, and want to hear what it's like to actually catch him live, pick this up and crank up the volume!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|the game wont download I bought it for no reason it was supposed to be a Christmas present I'm mad I mean really mad
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is really cool. Anyone who enjoys war games will like this. It takes a while to build up money if you are not wanting to shell out real cash but still very fun.
B005HSL626|1.0|Way too many adds, every few minutes a video pops up and you have to wait for it to finish before going back to the game.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Book two was way more interesting to me than book one.  The storylines were more exciting and there was more action. Overall, an easier read and kept me interested longer than the first. Really excited for book three.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Great movie with a good message. My 7 year old loved it too. I would highly recommend this movie. Also gave it as a gift and they loved the movie as well.
B00471TLZS|5.0|(no spoilers--that I know of)<br /><br />Spielberg has been the king of special effects films for many years,<br />but you could argue instead for Wes Craven in the horror genre. And<br />now the Lord Of The Rings producer Peter Jackson. Eileen Moran very<br />recently left us, and she worked on LOTR and on Spielberg's Avatar.<br />Plus lots of different media that incorporates special effects.<br /><br />Besides the special effects in Spielberg's Poltergeist, there is<br />an appealing trademark to all his flicks, and that any fan of his<br />should know is family. They are feasibly family movies, and up until the<br />90's in a niche not Disney. After the 90's Disney movies became<br />more contemporary, a little more adult. Spielberg's movies have<br />a lot more action, and what's known as \\"sci-fi violence\\". A curse<br />word, occasionally. In Poltergeist, much macabre action occurs, like<br />the swimming pool scene. I'm not convinced that the scenes containing<br />the cadavers were filmed as I've read. There is definitely spiritual/<br />afterworld discussion as one might expect. The \\"cleaning woman\\" comes<br />right out and lays it on the line to the Freelings--they have been<br />presented with forces otherworldly and have no choice but to believe<br />it. Now they have to believe they can get their daughter back from<br />an evil being in their own house.<br /><br />A sad and tragic hallmark to this movie is the violent demise<br />of the actress who played Carol Anne's sister. I will let you<br />do your own surfing for that story.<br /><br />,
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a fun way to view a story through a dogs eye. Very unusual and well written. It will make you laugh and cry and hug your pet to think of how much you love them and they love you.

B002GYS1FO|4.0|Was turned onto this cd by one song but found that I ended up enjoying most of them. Worth picking up.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This show has everything. Great Characters, Good Plot, no Digression or Diversions, and Zombies! I would Highly recommend this show.
1416575464|5.0|It's adorable on the outside, and the inside is even better. It's complete with great pictures to inspire you, plus tips for just about everything you could ever want to do in your home.<br /><br />This is a book you always see in Anthropologie and they WAY overcharge. So glad i got mine on Amazon.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this port/remake. Coming from somebody who has already beaten Persona 4 on the PS2 and loved every second of it, I knew I was going to love this version of it too. What I didn't know, however, was that I ended up enjoying this version much more than the original. As much as I loved the original P4, I still had some nitpicks about it. I felt like the lack of being able to go outside hurt the experience a bit and further limited what I could do in that game. That was one of my biggest gripes of the game because I felt that Persona 3 FES had more to do than the original P4. Persona 4 Golden fixed that big complaint and I ultimately came to the conclusion that there isn't really a single flaw in this game for me. At all. I would've preferred the original voice actor of Chie, sure. But the new one does just fine and that's no longer a complaint for me. Here are some of the additions to the already awesome game that is Persona 4!:<br /><br />- New character Marie who is just full of awesomeness.<br />- A few new Social Links which delves deeper into the story than the original version (and it actually molds perfectly with the original story).<br />- New Personas<br />- Lots of alternate costumes!!<br />- An online multiplayer thing of sorts. SOS.<br />- A whole new dungeon, which is actually pretty interesting.<br />- A few new tracks which are absolutely AWESOME.<br />- Enhanced graphics compared to the original. Don't expect PS3 leveled graphics. It's just much more polished looking compared to the original with vivid colors that pop because of the OLED Vita screen.<br />- New events such as the Ski event.<br />- A few new endings exclusively for this game!<br />- A TON of Extras. A quiz show, pictures, live music, school lessons by a certain someone from Persona 3.<br />- About 3/4 weeks extra time to raise your Social Links or Stats.<br />And  much, much more.<br /><br />Coming from somebody who previously beat Persona 4 on PS2, this is more than what I could have possibly imagined for an updated version of the 2008 classic. If you've never played Persona 4 and have a Vita, then what the heck are you waiting for!? GET THIS! I've not enjoyed a game more than this in a very, very long time. It's my personal Game of the Year and I won't go into anymore detail about this game. You need to experience it yourself. The story, humorous dialogue and ridiculously lovable main cast of characters help shape this game into one of the best RPGs of all time. Don't miss out on playing this game. It's well worth the $40 if you have a Vita and you will not go wrong with this purchase :). Thankfully I will have this to tide me over until Persona 5 gets announced :D.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I have only watched a couple of episodes upon recommendation of close friends and they are right, I'm hooked. My husband is not so enthralled though, so not sure we will be viewing this series together...
B004LWZWGA|4.0|The husband and I saw this in the theater and loved it.  It was a definite must have for him.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a must have video collection item to explore through mother nature beauty.Excellent video to watch with family or for kids.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is great! I'm 15 and it's a fun challenge to try to collect as many coins as possible, all the while completing missions and buying power-up and fun costumes. I've never had any problems with losing any items, either. I thought the simple, easy to pick up gameplay would get stale fast, but I've enjoyed hours of fun and still enjoy this game. I highly recommend downloading this FREE app! (Plus,the &quot;Over 9000&quot; easter egg is kinda funny!)
B0084IHVGG|5.0|Came in perfect timing and it was shipped in the original wrapping. I couldn't find this movie around my area so I was very happy to find it here!
B0053O89WY|5.0|This season of episodes continues to provide the &#34;laugh out loud funniness&#34; that I found in the earlier years' episodes.
044024630X|4.0|The Affair is a prequel to the Reacher series. It tells of how Reacher, the oft mentioned ex military cop, came to leave the military after more than a decade.<br /><br />The story takes place in Mississippi with Reacher going undercover in a small town next to a base. Tensions are high as a woman has been found brutally murdered in an alley on the town's main street. The military base and the people of the town are both pointing the finger at one another for blame. When Reacher arrives in town, sent to provide information that clears the soldiers on the base, he finds out that the base has been locked down so no soldiers can come into down. He also meets the local sheriff and a former marine, Elizabeth Devereaux, who is suspicious of Reacher's sudden arrival in town but allows him to work with her in order to solve the murder. Its a crime that, like in all Reacher books, has more to it then meets the eye and Reacher's attempts to solve the crime bring him head to head with the military brass who sent him there in the first place and makes him question his place in the military after all these years.<br /><br />Its an very thrilling read which I found to be a lot better than the most recent Reacher novel A Wanted Man (which I read before The Affair). The story is about Reacher reflecting back on this event so he also provides random commentary about the difference in time periods, the story takes place in 1997. Like when he brings up the different things that occurred with military and law enforcement pre-9/11. You also get little hints that lead into the book that chronologically follows this book, The first Reacher novel Killing Floor, with Reacher looking to his brother for assistance a couple different times in the book but not being able to reach him which leads to some concern about his whereabouts.<br /><br />You also get some excellent moments of Reacher executing true justice. Reacher takes on a group of local trouble makers a couple of times in the book aswell as encounters as a military force in the woods around the base that may or may not be responsible for executing civilians. Each encounter leads to Reacher laying a serious beat down on the guilty parties.<br /><br />The only real disappointment for me was the reasoning they went with for why Reacher left the army which was a big part of me buying the book. The murder plot sees Reacher do enough things to make him fall out of the military's favor, but that is not the reason why Reacher leaves the army. Its also brought up at various points in the book that the military is going to suffer budget cuts (Reacher minds us a few times that this story takes place before 9/11) and that he may be on the chopping block. But in the end that isn't the final factor in Reacher becoming a civilian. Its the only letdown in the book for me cause I hoped that it would be something more grand and important.<br /><br />Taking out Reacher leaving the army, its still another great crime novel from Lee Child and another solid addition in the Reacher series. I recommend checking it out if you have the chance.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Enjoyed this second making of this series as much or more than the first! Hope another is to come! Good ole' fun action and adventure from start to finish..
1118026470|3.0|Great info in the book, but the walkthroughs tend to require outside tools. Would be more useful with perhaps an educational copy of Burp suite tossed in or free access to some of the labs.  Or maybe charge $300 for he boom sn include a full Burp license, if you dont want to disappont readers. Also, I felt it was a light on some theory. All said though, it still had some useful things to know.<br /><br />I'ld love to see a book like this that focused on using freely available tools, including perhaps Google Gruyere.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|i know that more and more kids are becoming brats, but Disney seems to have decided to endorse the same behavior.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that the writing and performances are as good as they were in the First Season. The show manages to cover serious issues without laying on the saccarine, and it's a lot of fun. I appreciate the complaint that the musical numbers are dubbed, but considering how pricey it must be to do a show with a cast this large with such high production value, I understand why that's the case. So, really impressed with Glee once again.
B000VBIGD6|4.0|Always fun to watch, just the Winter scenes alone are worth the while!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a cool calculator..lol.. no more counting on my fingers,everybody...I use it all the time for solving my mathematical problems,dealing with the house -whole budget  or work-related matters.

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|My husband & I purchased this & are very happy with it. There is not a bad song on it.
B00AMSLRAC|3.0|It is a nice application for little kids, but with some fruits there are a problem, the display turns blank and you can only see the back or return key (Kindle Fire HD).<br /><br />Es una excelente aplicación para los más pequeños, pero esta primera versión tiene un problema, cuando se selecciona algunas frutas, la pantalla se pone totalmente en blanco y sólo se puede ver la flecha de regresar  (Kindle Fire HD).
B008J34466|5.0|This is a Christmas gift, for my brother. I buy him a lot if music. He just likes to listen to his music.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />cozzimajor
B009NH6AOQ|1.0|Looking at other people's reviews I'm clearly in a minority. After all, what could possibly be more wholesome than yet another TV series in which the good guys blast away at all & sundry with a never-ending stream of Hollywood rounds (the sort that keep on coming long after the magazine is empty...)? Best of all, we don't need to feel even a pinch of remorse because - now this is the Really Good Part, honest - the victims are already dead! What could be better than that?? Needless to say the acting is average, the script is wooden, the plot is essentially non-existent, and the verisimilitude likewise missing in action.<br /><br />But, if you are in need of an effective diet plan then apparently being turned into a zombie is just what you are looking for, because although the series is set in & around Atlanta GA where 86% of the population is either fat or morbidly obese, everyone in this series is straight out of Central Casting Los Angeles. Realistically this show ought to be about The Waddling Dead but here in TV land being a zombie means you're pretty darn lean. Not that it matters - gore is gore, blood is blood, and in the end they're all just targets. Remarkably, whereas in the real world people have to train extensively to manage head shots with any degree of consistency even against static targets, here even kids can make special-forces style shots with total accuracy. No one ever gets hit by blue-on-blue, there's never a negligent discharge, and the concept of a ricochet is entirely alien.<br /><br />In other words it's basically boring repetitive mindless violence for the over-two crowd. Presumably the series appeals to couch potatoes who simply haven't anything better to do with their lives. As for me, enough is more than enough. This is tedious and violent rubbish - the mental equivalent of eating junk food. Avoid at all costs.
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|this was very stupid movie. I wouldn't waste my time.  We eventually turned it off.  Was star packed, but dumb.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|This series is always going to be some of the best films to me since I grew up with them.  I just wish we had the uncut versions available as well.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Wow!  This book was amazing!  I thought I knew where the author was going throughout the story, but suddenly he threw in twists I wasn't expecting and they were amazing.  The characters had great depth and had something they were fighting for.  I love everything about this book.  When can I read the next one?
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|With its lack of instructions and targets, the repetitive Bird game is a pure waste of time. Better to read a book or magazine.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I loved this story.  I have read it twice already and I'm thinking about reading it a third time.  If you haven't read it, please do.  You will love it!
B006TTC54A|5.0|My two HS sons had never seen this movie - my parental duty was to pass on this classic as part of my legacy.
B00A757EFW|5.0|My grandchildren are just fascinated with the game.  I can't get my Kindle away from them.  I enjoy playing it also when they leave.
B0087GF8ZG|2.0|This shipping for this product was great. It arrived ahead of schedule and everything was there and in working order. The light is simple to use and easy to install. The motion sensor on mine works great. It picks up movement from about 10 feet away, turns off in about 30 seconds when there is no longer any movement, and actually does sense when it is day or when other lights are on so you do not waste battery life.<br /><br />However, the light itself is not very brite. I purchased this light for use in a closet that does not have power ran for a permanent fixture. Unfortunately, this light is not brite enough to distinguish the color of my clothes. I can't tell which shirts are which, so the light is basically useless for my purposes.<br /><br />If you are looking for nothing more than a simple nite lite with a motion sensor this will do the job. However, you can buy a plug-in nite lite for less than half the cost and still get that job done. If you want to really light up an area, like a closet, you should not purchase this light.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I had never seen these before, and was excited to get them on Blu-Ray. They arrived within two days and in perfect condition! Great purchase if you like anything to do with aliens!
B000641D2Y|1.0|I was very disappointed when I went to play this DVD and realized it was a bootleg.  The quality is horrible and the picture size of the film only shows up as a 12 by 12 square on your screen.  Not quite sure how people get away selling these, because it is completely illegal and they should be prosecuted.  Do Not Buy movies from them. !  A complete waste of money!
B002WJI65S|5.0|I got this Mario plush to go with the 5&#34; Angry Bird Star Wars plush as a Christmas gift for my 7 year old and they are going to be a great addition to his collection!!  Very nicely done!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book got me hooked on this author. Now I am reading her other novels. This is a look into the complicated world of feelings and thoughts, and what motivates people, a little disturbing, but keeps you turning the page can't put it down
0810996596|5.0|I got this as a gift for myself and absolutely love it!  As both a huge music fan (and Metallica fan) and a collector of horror based toys it was really nice to see such a well put toghether book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is a great app. I enjoy how chalenging some of the puzzles are. Get this app if you enjoy any type of brain games.
B002WJI66C|5.0|I got this Mario based plush to go with the 5&#34; Angry Bird Star Wars plush as a Christmas gift for my 7 year old and they are going to be a great addition to his collection!!  Very nicely done!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story consumed me from the start, it held my heart and just squeezed it to death!!  Colleen has done it again, she somehow takes a very emotional topic and helps her character work through it with such a realness.<br /><br />This book blew my mind in so many ways, and I am not going to go into details an give anything away because you just have to read this to find out what you are missing.  It has so many things to offer a variety of readers.  There is realness, sadness, trust and most of all love.  The characters are so lifelike that you would never know that this wasn't a true story!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Typical Clancy, one of my favorite writers.  Lots of action & intrigue to keep you turning the pages. Clancy never dissappoints!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Great item and great price and super delivery! My kids love it they can take a shower with their phone and have their music play! Whoo hoo!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a quick read and very entertaining. I highly recommend it. I want to see the movie, so I will have to rent it now.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Let's take a Broadway show, which already features too much Foreigner (and I love foreigner), and turn it into a movie in which main stream actors do terrible jobs at lip-syncing. And stop ruining Foreigner!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book, I haven't seen the movie so I son't know if the story line includes this  or not. Quick read.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This is probably my all-time favorite Christmas movie! The acting is great, and Mara Wilson is adorable as the character of Susan. I highly recommend this movie(:
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Wow.... might have been credible if it had been written by a gay atheist from San Francisco instead of a bible belt brainwashing victim.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I love every word of it. Got me interested in cooking, which I had trouble believing. Cool looking and well written. Was way too excited to buy it.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|my 3 year old loves this movie and did since he was two years old. Everything as expected in advertising.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|Overall this was a depressing book that failed to repay me for the time I spent reading it. Maybe it was supposed to be a &#34;coming of age&#34; account but none of the characters seemed to have matured at all as a result of their generally flawed understanding of their situation in life. They just made one bad decision after another and then you had to read of the disastrous consequences. On the other hand, if the book was supposed to be some sort of black comedy, I must have missed that point.
B003G4W49C|2.0|Limited action.  Lame sci-fi &#34;effects&#34; and very expected outcomes.  This book was very hard to make it through.  I won't be buying any of the others in the series
B002MQYOFW|3.0|maybe my expectations were too high, when I started reading this book. From the word-of-mouth reviews I had heard, I guess I was expecting something of the calibre of Harry Potter..<br /><br />the book starts off very well..a bit slow in the beginning, but picks up speed as we go along..<br /><br />but towards the later part, there are a few &#34;slips&#34; - unanswered behavior, predictable events, other characters behaving too conveniently for the protagonist, rather than according to their vested interests, etc.. some scenes also felt very drawn out - far too much drama and far too much introspection for my liking..<br /><br />read it once -  but don't think I would re-read it ever..<br /><br />read the reviews of the next book in the series - Gale was probably the only character I would have liked to read about and explore more - and that would have been the motivation to read the next book - but the reviews seemed to indicate that that character did not get much spotlight in the next book, and that some of the introspection seems to be repeated - so will be skipping the remaining books of the series..
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this is a good app for all ages. I highly recomemend paying all $15 for it no mater how old you are. googoo gaga
B004EKCNMA|3.0|thought it was A Liltle bit scary for the young ones and Probably would not see again but worth it watching once.
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|This movie is an all-time classic.  It's a &#34;feel-good&#34; story line and exceptionally acted.  Every home should have a copy.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy has done it again!  His grasp of how the military works is amazing.  His action sequences are spot on to what actually takes place.  I recommend this book to anyone who knows how military tactics actually work.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|We enjoyed the series so much that I have sent the first series to my son who will no doubt enjoy it as much as we did
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I found that it is hard to put the game down especially after I had put some puzzles together.  I enjoy playing this game.
0312641893|4.0|The only bad thing I can say about Cinder, after finishing this audio book is that I wish I didn't have to wait for book two because I want to read it now.  To some this may look like a classic tell of Cinderella but with a sci fi twist and while it has some elements of Cinderella but it is more of a political thriller.  This book starts off with Cinder meeting Prince Kai right away and she ends up getting entwined in his political intrigue and the machinations of the Lunar Queen.  While all the elements of Cinderella are in this tale: the evil step mother, unlikely fairy godmother, and instead of lost slipper its an android foot.  This tale also has an evil queen, a deadly plague, and a secret that will shake Cinder to her core.  I felt the pacing of this book moved quickly and I was intrigued by all the characters.  While I felt the secret of Cinder's past was a little predictable and I had it figured almost at the beginning I am excited to find out what is in store for Cinder and how she will use her new found secret to save all of those she cares about. While the romance between Kai and Cinder doesn't come to a happy ending by the end of book one I feel there is potential and Cinder has not lost Kai completely to the queen's diabolical plans.  Cinder's story isn't all about the romance anyway its about girl power and coming to terms with who you are.  I thought Rebecca Soler did an excellent job on the narration and she really made the characters come to life for me.  I especially liked the way she voiced Cinder's saucy android friend.  I highly recommend Cinder Book one of the Lunar Chronicles and give it four stars.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This is a beautiful book. As good as, if not better than the movie. The description of religions is outstanding (not covered in movie).
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a horribly written book.  The characters are too predictable and the story line is boring.  I am glad I only purchased the first book in the trilogy because I will not be reading books 2 or 3!
B004SC8YB8|5.0|I just do. I always loved Rory's playing as well as his enthusiasm. He loved performing for people. I saw him twice in San Francisco in the early 1970s.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was an intriguing book about a mother daughter relationship.  I keep looking for more Gillian Flynn books to read, but I think I have read them all!

B000FC2PKG|4.0|I enjoy reading the series with D.D. in it. An easy read, nothing too heavy. I like following this character.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|It is neat but hard to get out of sometimes. My children love it. It is relaxing and fun to do.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I had to play catch up on this series. Getting it on a lightening deal was bonus! Great series, a must see.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Not much else to say but a great series. Read first two when first came out. Heard that when Larson died third book not finished. When movie came out (us version) looked back to see about third book. Very happy I did, well done
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book but was quickly drawn in and could not put it down. Cannot wait to get into the next book.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Reacher fan. Lee Child can really do no wrong in my eyes. Already have next book on my wish list.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I love this book!  My son's kinder class read this book to us for our Mother's Day Tea Party.  It really touched our hearts.  Every mom should read this to their child

B007SNMYNS|4.0|The author spends the major portion of the book convincing you how bad today's modified wheat is for us.  I believe this is an important message however it could have been covered in 2 short chapters.  I kept waiting to read about how to eliminate it from our diet.  That came in Part Three at the very end of the book and was a slim portion.  It left me wanting much more information on how and what to eat because he states gluten free products are off limits as well.  I am now looking for a good cookbook and have heard the author is coming out with one soon.<br />I would recommend this book to those who want to learn more about what's been done to the wheat in our food products and what the health consequences are.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved every minute of this book. Would recommend everyone download it or purchase it. I was just talking about the wonders of Las Vegas.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|Downloaded to get me caught up on the classics. Always good to read Jane Austen. Timeless read that all should do.

B004XQO90E|5.0|This movie is full of action and science fiction. I enjoyed it and would watch it again. You try it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hard to believe they could think of a sequel to hunger games, but this was a pretty good book, even as a sequel. Can't wait for the movie. I thought they did a great job on first, kept true to the book
B001EMS2Z8|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch. I love cary grant. He is funny and sly in this movie and it just reminds you of a pure time in life

0670026182|5.0|What Katie Ate's beautiful blog comes to good old fashioned life on the pages of this book.  With design so tantalising you want to cook and eat pronto.  A great gift (five of my loved ones are receiving it this Christmas) as an old fashioned cook book with a modern twist.  So beautiful would be a great coffee table book.  Well worth the wait Katie!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|But still very entertaining. A total guilty pleasure. It's almost at the point if you don't read these books you are out on a bunch of water cooler talk.
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|This did not work at all. This might work for others if you know how to troubleshoot it, but we were not able to get it working.
0316017930|5.0|the author is commynicating practice practice practice. What all americans should hear, nothing comes easy even for the very smart or the very gifted.
