1607744104|5.0|I own the first edition, and when I saw a second edition available I bought it immediately. There is so little known about these plants that any hints are valuable. Many new hybrids and species are discussed in the book. These are spectacular plants. Many are slow growing and show their spectacular impact after a few years. Once you are captivated by them, they are magical.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Quite awesome! Fun new characters and places and magic and all new enemy's to battle! I might read it again!

B002G1YPH0|4.0|Very compact efficient cooler.  Cooling temperatures were in the mid 30 degrees C once the computer booted up with Windows 7 Ultimate 64.  It was installed in a mini case; however, had some doubt that it would fit, thereby preventing the side cover of the case from going on, but it worked out just fine.  Needless to say, it would not fit in a micro-case.

B003UESJH4|5.0|Fantastic movie Came In Great condition another keeper...Need to start searching for more good movies like this one Thank you A +++++++
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a really good book. It starts out slow, but the setup is important and it ends up being a real page-turner in the end. I have it 4 stars, because a book has to be extra special to get all five, but this is a special book and is worth reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got Minecraft for the PC before this because my friend showed me Minecraft I thought it was so awesome I decided to get it. And then I started multiplayer games and its just epic then I got the kindle then bought Minecraft PE and I love the new update keep on making new updates Mojang !!!!!!
140006922X|5.0|The historical Jesus is far more fascinating than the Christian Jesus. It all makes far more sense too and wipes away all the cob webs that used to exist about the man. Now there barely is  any evidence that he even existed, so in combination with the scriptures and the historical environment at the time, Aslan weaves a narrative of not only Jesus of Nazareth but the Jewish cult under the dominance of the Roman Empire.<br /><br />Now I'm not biased against Christianity, because I think any religion can be exposed as a myth if we analyze it's historical background, and because I don't carry a bias, I was able to enjoy this book for what it is. I know it's difficult for Christian's to swallow this book, but the Jesus of Nazareth was actually a very fascinating man and nothing to be ashamed of. Even the author carries a lot of admiration for the man. Christians should be proud, even if none of the myth was true.<br /><br />I think it would be awesome of they made a movie about this book, because it's clear who the good and bad guys were and with the corruption of the Jewish temple and the plight of the poor and downtrodden, Jesus looks like a super hero in the midst of it all. And you end up really appreciating his brother James because of his principles and beliefs as well.<br /><br />Read this book, you will not regret it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I remember this game was considered educational when it first came out decades ago. it's a cute take of that idea. I enjoy using it as a time passer now.<br />Maybe I can introduce grand kids into some history.  Played on iPod and now kindle fire.  Still enjoyable
0812415051|5.0|I love Agatha Christie and I am never disappointed in her.  I love her movies and books! You can never go wrong with Agatha!  :)
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|The product arrived quickly and in excellent conditon. I had checked out some of Ben Howard's music before purchasing the album, but I had to have a hard copy for myself. This album is excellent. There is no denying the skill and talent that is put on display both lyrically and musically in this album. Ben Howard is a skilled guitarist and vocalist who pairs his musical talent with lyrics that are deep, yet relatable to the listening audience. 'Every Kingdom' is one of my most satisfying purchases as of late, and it is nothing short of fantastic.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|The book is very well written to make any non-financial person understand what led to the mortgage crisis of 2007-2008 and how it unfolded.
B001O1O71C|2.0|I'm giving this book two generous stars because it does address the topic of the Holocaust.  It is important to remember even unpleasant parts of out past, lest we repeat them.  Another reason I grudgingly gave it a two is because it does warn the reader that it is a 'fable'.  Other than that, there isn't much redeeming value to this story.  I would not recommend it to others.  This pacing of this book is too slow at times.  The story itself leaves one with a bad feeling.  The ending is simply for shock value and adds very little to the story line.<br />In the beginning of this book the main character, Bruno, is a selfish, spoiled, oblivious little boy.  At the end of this book he is still a selfish, spoiled, oblivious little boy.  There is basically no character development.  Even after everything the character witnesses, he has absolutely no idea (or refuses to acknowledge) what is going on right outside his window and to his friend. As we progress through the story, there are several aspects that are absolutely unbelievable.  I am willing to suspend a little of my belief because it is listed as a 'fable'.  For example, the one place that the two boys happen to meet is the only place in the fence where it is not properly attached, or the fact that they boys have the same birthday. However, I am not willing to change the facts of the past.  The author simply cannot expect us to believe that the nine year old son of a high ranking German official has never been in the Hitler Youth, which begins at age six.  The author cannot expect us to believe that Bruno's school would not have taught him about the concept of the 'fatherland'.  Schools and lessons were filled with propaganda at this time.  And I certainly cannot believe that Bruno does not know what it means to be a Jew or that he has never even heard of the word Jew.  Additionally, the Jewish friend in the story sits along the fence for long periods of time with no one noticing.  This is inconsistent with life inconcentration camps.  I feel these inaccuracies take much away from what could have been a very interesting story.<br />On a side note, I listened to an interview with the author about this book.  The interviewer asked about some of the improbable things in this story.  He addressed only the fence and the birthdays.  I would guess he had no explanation for the other items either.<br />In short, don't bother reading this book.  There are far better stories about the Holocaust.
B0090EIILU|5.0|This is not for the sensitive types. The jokes are over the top; don't search for logic or you'll be lost.
1451696191|3.0|This book was a sincere disappointment.  It was like the author was trying to shove as many horrible things into the book as possible so that he could relate to everyone at the same time.  With the rare exception, no one in life has this much to deal with, so I'm puzzled by people that say they can 'relate' to this book.  Really?  I don't know anyone who has dealt with abortion, rape, molestation, sex, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, suicide, a friend persecuted for homosexuality, extreme social awkwardness, violence, counseling, etc in a year's time.  If you have, I am very sorry.  But most people are much more ordinary than this.<br />Also, Charlie was a bit unbelievable as a character.  His character is supposed to be in Advanced English but, his over use of the words very, really, and incidentally along with his poor sentence structure lead me to believe otherwise.  Additionally, I found it annoying that he failed to use contractions.<br /><br />Overall, I felt this book was just OK.  I would not recommend this book to high school or middle schoolers.  It is simply too heavy.
B006YGC7KK|5.0|For those who saw the old series, you will enjoy this new re-make.  In a time of unending re-makes, this one pulls it off exceptionally well.
B000SINT52|5.0|Moore's brilliance is his ability to find all sorts of ironies in the great dung heap of truth about the world we live in and has the guts to bring it all into the sunliight.
B000FC130E|4.0|I really must apologize for this review because I read this book a few months ago and have since read several others.  I do remember enjoying this novel and certainly found it interesting.  It has just gotten lost among the other books I've been reading!
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Once again, Moore captures the ironies of life by taking a close look at probably our largest American institution, the national economy.  The economy is one of our sickest jokes yet within the Western hemisphere.  We hear politicians, mostly Republican, who extoll its virtues without thinking of how it can be seriously reformed.  In the documentary film, Moore makes us see that other institutions have a vested interest in keeping the economy the way it is, because they are making money off of the system too, thus keeping ordinary working citizens chained to an unending cycle of endless debt and product consumerism.
B008EEZ64Y|3.0|This was okay.  I decided to read this after hearing so many teens say they loved this book.  I took a break from reading so many Ted Dekker novels and read &#34;The Giver.&#34;  Going from so many thrilling novels to this was just a change for me and may be why I give it only three stars.
0316789720|5.0|I have used this for years. This is great for teaching kids of ALL ages<br />to draw. It is so easy, even adults are not intimidated.
B0027LZ4CE|5.0|This is Bruckner for meditation, for mountain mystics and bedroom dreamers, the kind that induces hypnotic states and might be dangerous for driving. One might easily think of a compact Celibidache while hearing this, or even Morton Feldman.<br /><br />This is an orchestra that knows how it wants Bruckner to sound and succeeds, blended and recorded so well it disarms criticism - drama and virtuosity are not the point here. Tempos are relaxed, free of excess rubato (anti-Jochum), and good for the long haul. Balance is well-judged between stasis and momentum. As others have noted, the early symphonies are especially listenable.<br /><br />This is how one might hear Bruckner live while touring Alpine towns and villages. I recall one concert in an old Swiss church with a back wall so far behind the stage the echo sounded like a bad case of crosstalk. But that is not the case on these recordings. If anything the live ambience enhances the impression of Alpine atmosphere, and the lively applause confirms that the audience likes what it hears.<br /><br />And this is the price one might like to pay for a fine &#34;alternative&#34; set of Bruckner symphonies, making it one of the best bang-for-the buck deals I've found in a while.<br /><br />But, you may ask, am I being too generous? Does this vague upstart deserve a 5-star rating? Perhaps, in the last three symphonies, where Bruckner reaches the loftiest of musical summits, the Wurttembergers can't match the best from Vienna, Berlin, or Munich. But their strainless dedication to Bruckner's idiom gives their interpretations a special place in a limited discography.<br /><br />At a somewhat higher price, from another corner of the Bruckner Universe, I also recommend [[ASIN:B005JLN94E Knappertsbusch Conducts Bruckner & Wagner]].
B009JBZH54|4.0|Its a great boxset, i love it, the resolotion is great, the sound amazing, the book amazing too, can say much about the extras because i didnt see it yet
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app...a lot of options and settings...I have a free version...there are ads between every game but you can just exit most of them as soon as they come up.  Good version for little ones to learn to play as there are good help options too.
3836538725|4.0|Taschen publishes quality fine-art books and the &#34;economy&#34; version of Sebastiao Salgado's new body of work is an excellent value.  My only gripe is the tactile feel of the book page paper stock -- which in my opinion was a bit lacking.  But then again, for the modest investment, the book is a masterpiece.
159562015X|5.0|Great book to help push your leadership to the next level of awareness! Love the personalized report you get after you take the online assessment to determine your strengths!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|For the most part, this game works well. Occasionally, it has trouble linking with Facebook and then you're stuck. There are plenty of opportunities to earn bingo cash, credits, power ups, and keys, and no need to spend real money.
B004JHYRAE|1.0|This is a very dated and written from a professional mental health worker's point of view.  We didn't find it that helpful at all.

B004SBB0LU|5.0|Since some of the descriptions are tough to understand, this specific set comes with the first five Queen albums. Queen, Queen II, Sheer Heart Attack, A Night at the Opera, and A Day at the Races. It also comes with a poster of the band themselves. In addition to having all 5 albums on CD, this also includes unreleased and extra content such as live performance recordings of songs on each album. This collection totals 10 CDs, with each CD case housing 2. Each CD even includes a cover booklet with the Lyrics for each song! Great buy for Queen lovers.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|I liked this book a lot except maybe too much history. I would definitely recommend the whole series to a friend

B002ZG983M|5.0|I had originally dismissed this movie as being just plain dumb when i first heard about it. But just last year, something kept telling me to watch this movie. So finally I watched this after watching Scott Pilgrim. I did not like Scott Pilgrim like I thought i would, but after watching Kick Ass, I not only became a fan, but i completely embraced the idea of the movie. Kick Ass adds a lot more depth and poses the question: What does it really take to be a superhero?<br /><br />Directed by the brilliant Matthew Vaughn (review for X Men First Class coming soon), Kick Ass stars Aaron Taylor Johnson as the titular character Dave Lizewski \\"Kick Ass\\" and he was excellent. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays Chris D'Amico who later becomes Red Mist. He did a great job. Lyndsy Fonseca plays Dave's love interest Katie Deauxma, Omari Hardwick stars as Marcus Williams, Mark Strong portrays the villain Frank D'Amico, Nicholas Cage gives a very admirable performance as Damon Mcready \\" Big Daddy\\", and the person who I feel gave the best performance Chloe Grace Moretz as Mindy Mcready \\"Hit-Girl\\".<br /><br />The story line is a whole lot of fun; albeit, there is a heavy dose of violence, and a moderate amount of profanity, but then again, this movie is rated R. Kick Ass is not like any other superhero movie in<br />recent memory. It does have its similarities with a FEW other superhero movies, but it is completely original. It has humor, drama, action, and the right amount of good in all 3 of its acts.  And yes, it DOES Kick Ass.<br /><br />To close, I gotta say, I am not only impressed with director Matthew Vaughn and actor Aaron Taylor Johnson, but I am still amazed that after 3 years, this movie still feels like a new release every time I watch it. It is a great feeling when watching a certain scene in a movie, (that you have seen 1000 times) even when you know whats going to happen next, you still find yourself getting goosebumps. Whenever I watch Kick Ass, I still get those same goosebumps. It may not be considered \\"epic\\" or \\"classic\\" to everyone, but in my opinion those words fit this movie perfect. My review for Kick Ass 2 (and reviews on a slew of other movies) is on the way. I rate the movie Kick Ass:<br /><br />4.5 Starssebumps. It may not be considered \\"epic\\" or \\"classic\\" to everyone, but in my opinion those words fit this movie perfect. My review for Kick Ass 2 (and reviews on a slew of other movies) is on the way. I rate the movie Kick Ass:<br /><br />4.5 Stars
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because it keeps me awesome and entertained. I play whenever i am bored or have nothing else to do because it keeps me occupied and it really is just a great game.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|I had purchased this movie because I had ordered the final destination 4 in one set(which I got a good deal on here) and wanted to complete my series. I have seen this movie before and wanted to own it. I'm glad that I bought it. the seller is one that I trust. I believe I bought it from Go Hastings. I have ordered from them a few times before and had been satisfied. The shipping on this item was fast. It always is when I buy from them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use it every day. Inspires me and feeds the creative space for me.  When I need inspiration for a card or menu I can always go to Pinterest. When I want to plan a party, I go to Pinterest. When I want to sew something or try some new hairstyle and makeup, I go to Pinterest.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|This is a good one. If you like her than you will like this movie. A lot of action and thrills. It also shipped to me very fast.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Beautifully rendered prose in a short novel touching on childhood, the nature of memory and reality. This story will be particularly enjoyable to hear on CDs, read by the author himself. I plan to do a second reading in that format.
078322933X|4.0|I bought it, and I really liked it. Witherspoon and Wahlberg were very young in this movie. I like Wahlberg and have liked almost every movie I have seen him in. It was worth it to own it and it shipped to me very fast.
1421550644|5.0|I saw the animated adaptation of this when I was little and it has stuck with me as one of my favorite cartoons. As it turns out the manga is much better. So much better that it actually knocked my appreciation for the movie down a peg or two. The story is much deeper and and much more nuanced. Without getting too spoiler-y the conclusion was also much darker. The art and physical composition of the two volume set are great but while I was reading I was too engrossed in the world, the concepts and the characters to notice.<br /><br />I don't read much manga but having read this I feel confident that I've seen some of the best the genre has to offer.
B00008G8M4|4.0|I never did buy this when it first came out so I bought it to add to my collection. I like the actors in it and I like the storyline. The shipping was also very fast.
B00AEVU2HQ|2.0|I bought this book because I thought it would give me some background material on the legal issues discussed in the Garrow's Law TV series, but it was basically just a summary of the plot of each episode of the series, with one or two extra facts thrown in.  I was very disappointed and felt that I had wasted my money.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I have no idea on how to play this game. There are no instructions to explain this to me. I would like to get some help.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have always been a sucker for these types of 19th / early 20th century British drama, but the story, casting, and play are superb in these series (I love the last episode of the 2nd season and, specially, the last shot of castle while snow falling).<br />I am totally hooked on Downton Abbey and the only reason joined Amazon's Prime to watch the 2nd and 3rd seasons since you can only find the 1st one on Netflix (although I am still w/ Netflix as well).
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Have this on my kindle fire. Every time there is an add I click out of it and it opens anyways. Fix this and get 5 stars

0060512806|5.0|A book to savor -- and that's easy to do.  It's 1100+ pages long.  Wonderful reading for those knowledgeable with respect to World War 2, some interest in cryptology and in computer technology.  A masterpiece.

B00CATSONE|3.0|A good portion of the book was the author's research into genius. While a few pages are interesting, I did not buy a book on genius but a bio of Tesla. This book goes into a small part of Tesla's life. It is about his inventions. Fascinating but not a biography. One can read the info in this book on Wikepedia.

B0089XH38M|5.0|Product downloaded easily and you can't beat the price.I wanted to protect my smartphone and AVG does the job. Have not experienced any negative issues.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a quick game, it only took me about an hour and a half to play. There are no hints, just touch everything till you can put the clues together. If your looking for dazzling graphics and sound this is not the game for you. It's pretty boring, no story, no music, just moving from room to room.<br />For me three stars is a game that I wouldn't play more than once and would delete to save space.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I wanted a simple flashlight utility and I didn't want an absurd amount of permissions. This application does the job and is lite (minimal).

B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I had originally read this story many, many years ago; however, it had always left me with a haunted feeling about humans being more than we appear.  I really enjoyed it again and place it up there with Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy as seminal books dealing with man's future in intriguing ways.  Quick read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best run game ever. you can beat your friends in real time. the minigame is cool. the things that you pick up make the game funnier

B0012GMUZY|5.0|These are not audiophile recordings. Audiophiles hadn't been invented yet. Still and all they  sound fantastic. What a miracle they even exist. Unlike Robert Johnson recordings that survived, these are easy on the ears and more important, the soul. MJH plays from a place few folks can. Can't teach it, can' t buy it, you just have to be born with it. If a laser chiped away at fidelity like a needle did after numerous plays, this CD would be swiss cheese. Buy it and be grateful you can.
0345803485|1.0|I picked this book up at my local library because I had heard it was good and was looking for something to read. The book starts out with incredibly clumsy grammar, and only gets worse. I even noticed some spelling errors. The thought went through my mind \\" did the author even proofread\\"? This is so obviously Twilight fanfiction, what should never be attempted again. The main character is extremely silly and unwise, and the main plot has to do with having sex, constantly, and getting deeper and deeper into a dark dangerous relationship.
0749953357|4.0|What you see is what you get. This book is a self-help/business book and the contents, while enjoyable, were nothing beyond what you'd expect to learn. I always appreciate the reminders of business fundamentals and feel motivated by this genre, and would recommend this to a college business student or other young professional.

0316044938|5.0|Love this movie. Peter Jackson is a master of his craft, certainly. Brian Eno's sound track is highly evocative. Stunning visual effects. I've seen it over a dozen times and still look forward to seeing it again--there aren't many movies I can say that about.

B000V5ZIBU|4.0|his sums up the sisko character ...On how he felt about the ending of \\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\\" (1993): \\"The show ran for seven years. It was a long, long road. I did have some reservations initially when I read the script [for the series finale \\"What You Leave Behind\\"], because I thought they were going to really kill Sisko. I took that very literally, and asked the producers, \\"Why are you killing Sisko?\\" The Producers told me, \\"Look we thought you'd be thrilled because we had made him a God!\\" The difference, of course, is you have Sisko with another child on the way. You still have Sisko with a young man [Jake Sisko] trying to find his way, and you make him a God! That wasn't fair.\\" (Sept/Oct 2006, Star Trek Magazine issue #1)<br /><br />His advice to aspiring actors: \\"Hold on to your dream. Don't let the people shake you from your dream. Don't let form become more important than the substance of your heart and mind. Don't let commerce determine what you do exclusively\\" (Sept/Oct 2006, Star Trek Magazine issue
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the first book &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and this book kept drawing you in with every chapter. Might as well buy all 3 books at once cause you will want to read how it all comes together in the end.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|I couldn't  put it down.  It was nice to be where the TV series hadn't been and I am not distracted by the screen play differing from the books.  Having said that, Mr. Martin has me developing strong feelings for several of the characters.  I have become especially fond of Arya, Sam, Jon and Tyrion.  And the there is Dany, the mother of  dragons.  If I could slip into the fantasy and head for Slaver's Bay and.......

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't remember when I read and read and  fell asleep at night with my Tablet in my hand.  I also don't remember shouting at the characters, while I was reading, like, Dany, use the dragons, let them out of the pit and toast the slavers and sellswords.  Arya never disappoints and more than any other character continues to grow and develop her potential.  I can't wait until she realizes that she is a skinchanger and reunites with Nymeria.  I also found myself shouting at George Martin, when I realized that there were only 200 pages left and there are more things up in the air  than could be concluded in 500 pages.  I called the two people who got me into the series and said, &#34; I thought this was the end.  Now tell me when the next book will be published.&#34;  George, please stay healthy and keep writing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|30 Day Shred is a really good program for beginners or those who still want to get in a goo workout, but don't have an hour to commit! The videos are 20-30 minutes long, go from Levels 1, 2, and then 3 (so it gets more challenging as it goes along), and she uses a circuit method of strength, cardio, and ab exercises. I worked up just as much of a sweat with these 30 min videos as I did with hour long videos in the P90X program. There will definitely be workouts you hate, but you feel great at the end (and there are modified examples of exercises for beginners, so any level could do this).

B000FC12Z0|5.0|It was a very good book. It was better than any other Agatha Christie book I have read before now
0374533571|4.0|I wondered at first.  In fact, it was more like 'very unsure' about the book as I read the early chapters.  I found myself getting blue and wondering if I should put the book down and forget it, perhaps myself more akin to those who have labeled it as depressing. I know myself well enough to understand that I tend to feel things more deeply than the average person.  I have journeyed through my own dark places in life. But I read on and finally hit my spot about halfway through the book where I was engaged, intrigued, and even cheering for the main character, Pat Peoples. I am glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />Life is messy.  It just is. I greatly appreciated Matthew Quick's work as he  adroitly reveals all the complexities of life's messiness.  Yet, not messy for sake of cynicism, but a story that also offer's hope.  A story that forces the reader to understand problems at a much deeper level than the drive by judgement-passing of which most of us are so inclined.  As the saying goes, we often only see the tip of the iceberg in a person's life. Matthew Quick skillfully reveals what is below the surface in his characters.<br /><br />Remarkably, we all know real life characters in Silver Linings -<br />Pat Peoples:  The regular guy who makes a some sloppy or careless decisions, doesn't understand the depth of life a young age, and is also shaped by the emotional damage from his family life while growing up.  One event flips life on end, and life becomes a true survival journey.<br /><br />Mrs. Peoples (Pat's Mom): The sincere, sensitive mother who just wants love to reign supremely in the family.  A genuine peace maker who isn't exactly pleased with her lot in life, especially living with an insensitive, self-centered husband who is gripped with his own insecurities and place-in-life issues.<br /><br />Mr. Peoples (Pat's Dad): Life has hardened him; made him bitter, withdrawn, and his insecurities have prevented him from learning how to love.<br /><br />Jake (Pat's brother) and is wife, Caitlin:  Young, newly married, talented and ambitious...and yet wrestling with their role in how to manage the problems in the extended family.<br /><br />Dr. Cliff Patel (Pat's psychiatrist):  Wise, insightful, a bit peculiar, but also paradoxical as he lives such a normal guy's live outside the office with his passion for football.<br /><br />Tiffany: Pat's mirrored character. She has her own complex problems and carries a very heavy emotional load, makes bad decisions, and yet displays a remarkable amount of transparency and honesty (in the midst of dishonesty!)<br /><br />There is also Ronnie, Veronica, Danny and lesser characters - all familiar in real life; all with issues we have experienced or seen; all crafted into the story in a meaningful way. Quick's character development is superb and consistent throughout.<br /><br />Anyone with a heart and sympathy will appreciate the many positive aspects of the book, even in the middle of the life-is-hard realities of the book. It is not a difficult read, and yet it is not predictable because of some unique plot twists.<br /><br />There is a feel good ending, but not necessarily a happily-ever-after one. One of my best take-always: Crazy people sometimes understand life better than the so called normal people.ther) and is wife, Caitlin:  Young, newly married, talented and ambitious...and yet wrestling with their role in how to manage the problems in the extended family.<br /><br />Dr. Cliff Patel (Pat's psychiatrist):  Wise, insightful, a bit peculiar, but also paradoxical as he lives such a normal guy's live outside the office with his passion for football.<br /><br />Tiffany: Pat's mirrored character.

This really is a exciting game with lots of star and confusing maps.<br /><br />TAKE MY ADVICE AND GET THIS GAME.........:);)
0062082353|5.0|A great read by a Navy SEAL. A great story written by a SEAL sniper from his begining of his Navy career tothe end.  He and a friend was murdered after release of this book by an ex soldier he was trying to help. Support his his family by buying this book.
B008JFUO36|2.0|I was not impressed by this movie,I fought to stay awake through most of it<br />I was at A loss as to what the plot was supposed to be, so I had to go online to find out,reading the DVD jacket didn't even help, I received this the same day as Olympus has fallen, which, is shaping up to be A good movie, but, that's another review, all and all, Oblivion was A stinker, I was more impressed with the packaging
0399162097|5.0|I just finished this book a few hours ago and found myself texting my sisters and friends and telling them they had to read it.  WAACBO is an incredible story and Rosemary (our storyteller) is just one of many amazing characters.  The writing is just so GOOD.  As a reader, you're aware of it... but it's always serving the story, the voice is perfect.  I'm just so glad that the author felt like telling this story.  It's touching and raw and so real...and lovely. So far, this and Life after Life by Kate Atkinson are my two favorite summer reads of 2013.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|App has has started crashing when I turn a page in my documents.

It does not crash on my documents.  Why is the version in the Amazon App store not updated?
B009LMTDL0|3.0|went into it prepared to dislike it, but it proved to be a good aggregator of all the issues that plague women in the workplace. although few people will be able to identify with the author, a very accomplished and ambitious person, she brings up good points.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Good quality, no issues in receiving it the first time.  Easy to use, makes the transition from one area to the next much simpler.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Interesting plot line, but really slow to develop. Even with Morgan Freeman, this movie just never made it to the &#34;good flick&#34; category. Without spoiling the story, it's hard to describe why I thought the movie failed to be good. Let's just say the atempt(s) at providing the old &#34;Ah HAA&#34; moments failed to do so. I'd pass on this one.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great product, good packaging it performs perfectly so far at least. It's good to have all the bluray discs in such an easy package.
B00BEEKN26|5.0|Two UK top actors, David Tennant and Olivia Coleman, are at loggerheads from scene one of this excellent tv series from the UK.  She returns from vacation, all set for her promotion to occur, only to discover that an outsider, Tennant, has been given the job instead. Right from that opening scene, you doubt she is up to that promotion as she is obviously caught up in the minutae of her small return gifts for the staff.  He, by contrast, is as serious and obsessed as one can get in police work. But he is also ripe for atonement because of the murder case which got away from him in his past.<br /><br />When they show up at the murder scene of her neighbor's eleven year old son, this becomes even more evident as he has to restrain her as much as the boy's mother. nevertheless, can she can talk to the people as an insider in this seaside community whereas he is a stiff outsider wholly lacking in people skills.<br /><br />Your sympathy for her character grows as you meet her husband, whose sole contribution to their household seems to be babysitting their eleven year old son. In short, she carries all the weight of pulling their family along.<br /><br />The murdered child's family is also brilliantly rendered here, parents, a grandmother and a daughter.<br /><br />I highly recommend the series.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0307476073|5.0|I loved this book. I think there is something beautiful and universal about her story of loss, sorry, despair, and, eventually redemption. Whether it is on a hike or through other experiences, we have all had these moments in different ways. (Although the hike makes for an exceptionally great story.) Also, the way she writes is so raw, so real, it just feels like she is baring her soul.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Da' bomb!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this whole series. So glad I had the chance to watch the whole series on Amazon Prime. Well worth the purchase.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|For any of us who love our dogs, but are NOT Cesar Millan... this book is a MUST READ. I have a FAR greater understanding of the silent communication that occurs between humans and dogs than before reading the book. I didn't realize how easily I could UNINTENTIONALLY send signals to my dogs. As you know, they seem to pick up on everything. Since human and dog body language is so different, this book really helped me interpret my dogs' behavior... AND it helped me avoid unintentionally sending undesired signals TO my pets. Excellent book!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I don't write many reviews on apps but this one is an exception. I liked it enough to upgrade to the Pro version as a way of letting the author know that he/she should keep up the good work. There's nothing in the way of necessity here, but the simple graphical interface along with the breakdown of how much time can be expected based on the user's activity does make \\"Kindling\\" more appealing. I'd highly recommend the free app version to everyone the uses Kindle to see for themselves. Then, if you feel as I do, that the author's work wasn't a waste of time, upgrade.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Piper has given the reader a glimpse into life inside a minimal security women\\"s prison. Although at times interesting, this is for the most part a superficial account.
B0041KKYCY|3.0|It's not as good as the original! The original will scare you more! Be sure to turn out the lights!!!
0857685848|3.0|This book is really great, but do not buy it from this seller, it took nearly a month for it to get to my home. In all of the dealings with different sellers, I have NEVER had one totally ignore my e-mails. This to me is great disrespect and I did report them to Amazon. Amazon, handled the matter well, and I am grateful, for the courtesy shown to me by the Amazon representative. I usually do not give bad reviews, but I feel I owe all of the good people a friendly warning about this seller.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I loved this movie because of all the special effects, and seeing it on the full screen in hd when it first came out.<br /><br />I especially liked the film because it shows that some people are willing to risk their lives at the ending of film, to save mankind.<br /><br />I was expecting another ALIEN but was so surprised at the writing and insight this movie showed.<br />At the end of the movie everyone stood up and applauded the film, as did I.<br /><br />I hope there is a sequel to this movie..<br />I'm glad I pre-ordered it so I got it earlier than anyone else.
B00CF0ETBE|5.0|I was not old enough to appreciate this in 1991 when it first came out and so I passed.  I don't care if it's re-mastered or re-furbished, as long as it's re-released.  It sounds great and I have been absorbing it all week and have been waiting for it a long time.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I got fed up with trying to maintain a connection using a USB cable between my laptop and Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" tablet for doing image and other file transfers. You'd think a USB cable would be more reliable than Bluetooth, WiFi, etc., but that wasn't my experience. While connected via a USB cable (one provided specifically for my Kindle) I found that the connection would often drop and I'd have to fiddle with the cable trying to get it to reconnect. This would happen WAY too frequently, making file transfer a frustrating, and at times impossible, task!<br /><br />So I decided to try to find a way to connect wirelessly. There's quite a few apps that will do this via WiFi, Bluetooth, etc. and as I began to review them I discovered that an app I already owned had this capability - ES File Explorer.<br /><br />I had been using ES File Explorer for file management on my Kindle (works GREAT for this!), mostly deleting no longer wanted images and downloaded files. Now I know that I can also use this app to view and mange my Kindle files via Bluetooth, LAN, and FTP as well.<br /><br />To connect via Bluetooth to my Dell Precision 4400 laptop (running Windows XP 64-bit), after opening the ES File Explorer app, I tapped the little icon in ES File Explorer's top-left corner and chose \\"Bluetooth\\". Then I selected the \\"New\\" icon in the top bar. The app searched and detected my laptop's Bluetooth and displayed a popup with my device name (M4400LAPTOP) and a passkey. My laptop's Bluetooth then picked up on the connection and displayed a popup with the same passkey to verify the connection. I accepted the popup on my laptop and tapped the \\"Pair\\" button in the Kindle popup. I chose \\"ActiveSync\\" as the next option.<br /><br />Once the two devices were connected, I went into My Computer > My Bluetooth Places on my laptop and double-clicked the icon for my Kindle. This put me into Windows File Explorer showing the folders and files on my Kindle.<br /><br />Now I could treat the files onmy Kindle Fire HD just as I'm used to doing with any other files in File Explorer - copy/paste, delete, drag-and-drop, etc.<br /><br />Note: If your Kindle displays a message saying that an app wants to make your Kindle discoverable by other Bluetooth devices for 300 seconds, select \\"Yes\\". I had this happen quite a few times. Apparently the Kindle (or maybe it's the ES File Explorer app) maintains the Bluetooth connection only for a period of 5 minutes at a time. If you are in the process of copying files, they will pause until you select \\"Yes\\".<br /><br />File transfer from Kindle to laptop, and visa versa, is now a quick and relatively painless experience!<br /><br />Thank you, ES File Explorer developers!!!<br /><br />**NOTE** USE CAUTION! You'll have access to system files! If you don't know what certain folders/files are, DO NOT move, delete, etc. You could cause your device to stop functioning properly or even make it unusable!<br /><br />The only files you'll likely want to handle yourself will be located in these folders on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\":<br /><br />Documents<br />Download<br />Pictures<br /><br />Any other folders and files - MODIFY AT YOUR OWN RISK!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Well we all know you can't go wrong with a Jodi Picoult.  A thought provoking story that I shed plenty of tears over. A sad story on a difficult subject.  Well done.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book sets the stage for one of the most influencing moments in American history.  In school, we only scrape the surface of this historic period but this book explains all aspects leading up to the 1860  Presidential election. The book is very readable, introducing Lincoln, Chase, Bates, and Seward simultaneously so that the reader does not have to jump back and forth in time.  It is also a nostalgic look back at how important written accounts were kept; in both diaries and letters. It is a long book but well worth the patience to finish it.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Graphics look solid and it was enjoyable to play for a little while. However after a few hours of doing nothing but collecting money off the near dozen of habitats I had, I realize that the game is just a continuous grind of buying one expensive habitat after another. Normally I don't mind that because that's all that build related games are but it just failed to suck me in like the other build apps I play. It's not a bad app, It just doesn't hold my interest.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|When I first started this game I loved, loved it. Couldn't wait to play. I spent hours and a lot of money on this game. Then..... the updates started. The first one came and I couldn't open the game for 3 months. I had to to take off my kindle and then reinstall. I contacted game loft and they said they would refund back to the game. It's been almost a year and I'm still waiting.  Download after download and the game is no longer fun. It takes days to get land, now everything is so expensive and it takes so long to get anywhere that I think it's time I give up on my favourite game. It's boring and a pain. It's fun for about a week, then you have to commit months of your time. I wanted to finish and then maybe start over for a different look. I'll never be able to finish. It takes 60 hours or more to get a piece of land. Now with the newest update, I lost the piece of land I just waited 48 hours to get. All in all, it's fun for a little while but then you'll just get frustrated.
B00C3MKCIS|3.0|Searching today to see if Simon Collins had been working on anything new.  Really enjoyed the U-Catastrophe from 2008.  Discovered he had a new band, SOC.  After two listens through, I'm still not sure.  Expecting a lot because U-CAT was fantastic, and I am a Phil C. fan forever. And, do hear the family gene similarities in voice, drum & style.  Not digging too much on this CD so far.  It's O. K.  A bit mundane.  I was expecting something ... sharper maybe ... or different...  Not sure this is a step forward ....
B005COO1X6|3.0|I'm a huge Stephen King fan, but this one left me a little cold. It ended way too soon with more questions than answers.
B00076NYFU|5.0|I know Status Quo has 30 great albums that include dozens of hit songs.  They are a very solid, consistent and talented (and sadly, not well-known) band.  What's criminal, though, is that &#34;Hello&#34; is one of the few Status Quo albums that cannot be downloaded digitally.  I assert that this album beats out the other 29 and is a must-have.  That's why I hunted down the CD version while it's still out there.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|For whatever reason, we only caught a few episodes when this show first aired. Now that we have it on Amazon, we can watch the pilot and the series and not miss anything, which is important for this program, because there are threads that are connected in later episodes.<br /><br />As for the show, it reminds me of an updated X-Files; instead of unexplained paranormal activity, they have an explanation for every weird happening because Dr. Bishop either invented it or knows who did.<br /><br />Still, we are hooked and watching every episode.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Glad I watched it! Adds to the story of The Avengers and how it started. Stan Lee is a genius!
B001PCOSW8|4.0|I found this record in a \\"junk bin\\" at a local record store.  I have always liked Europe, but I know them only after Final Countdown.  Yes, they have always rocked but in a Bon Jovi-way.  But after listening to this record, it was like DAMN! why didn't they continue like this?  This is an excellent record.  They allowed themselves to become almost a joke.  I almost feel guilty admitting that I like them.  Detractors should listen to this record.  They will change their minds.<br /><br />Recommended.  4.5 stars<br /><br />  [[ASIN:B003W77SEO The Final Countdown]]
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is well thought out and keeps your attention.  More detailed than some escape games.  Fun to play.  A nice,  short escape.  Just wish it kept going a little longer.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Awesome! It is one of my favorite movies! We tried to buy this at all the video stores and couldn't find it! Amazon had it! Yeah!!!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This is a great insight into one's self as well as to other people.  It confirmed some thoughts as well as offered some new ones.  I recommend it.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I played the trial version first and liked it so much that I purchased the full game. I am someone who doesn't pay a lot for games, so the fact that I did says it all. Great story, graphics, puzzles. I like having a map, a diary, a hint book. I was happy with the length of the game, and will not have a problem buying another game from this company.

B00005N6KG|3.0|I at one point was giving these headphones 5-stars.  After my probably third pair in 2-3 years, I'm not so happy with the durability any longer.  I don't recall the headphones breaking this quickly before, but it seems that the wiring isn't as good possibly.  I just replaced my last pair and do not plan to get another pair again anytime soon...even though I really like the design of these for running since they don't fall out of your ears.  The last pair I purchased the right ear keeps cutting in and out with sound, frustrating when you want to work out and not mess around with headphones!
0393061310|5.0|This book makes the devlopment of agriculture the key ingredient in the development of the civilizations of the world and therefor reinforces the efforts to make agriculture even more important.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I almost didn't get this movie, because the critics tore it apart.  However, after reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to buy it.  I am glad I did.<br /><br />Everyone agrees that this movie is visually stunning.  It is, but let's get past that.  Right off the bat, you are made to think about what is happening.  You have the strange feeling that something isn't quite what it appears, but you don't know what.  Funny, but that is exactly the feeling of Tom Cruise's character.  Throughout the movie, it takes twists and turns that you didn't expect.<br /><br />The video and audio are excellent.  The casting was great.  Look, if you need a guy with an intense stare that doesn't quite know what is going on, Tom Cruise is perfect.  If you need someone to project that he really does know what is going on, Morgan Freeman is the natural choice.  The rest of the cast Was excellent, each portraying their characters to a tee.  Special credit to Melissa Leo for adding some incipient creepiness which was fun to watch.<br /><br />Now, why did I ignore all those one-star reviews?  First, those who said the movie was bad because they didn't understand it, put the blame in the wrong place.  Second, those who cried, \\"bad science\\", need to understand that the movie is entertainment, not education.  Sure, hydrogen is the most available element in the universe, but that does not prevent some visually interesting ways of obtaining it.  Yes, the story borrowed from other works.  The final destruction of the orbiting platform was straight out of ID4, but it made sense in the context of this movie, and that is what really matters.

B00002646X|5.0|Courtesy of Sony UK, we finally have our own Piece Of Sky!  The \\"Yentl\\" Soundtrack was initially released in the U.S. on CD in 1987.  Its sonics were fair at best (and I'm being generous).  Much analog noise was present; Barbra's stellar vocals were EQ'd to death, creating what I term a syrup-like wall of reverb -- and let's face it: the lady really can sing, so this is hardly necessary.  The soundtrack would be quietly restored and reissued in 1994 along with several other titles (sans the fanfare of her 11 Essential Albums released in 1993).  Even then, Sony got it wrong (but this, sadly, is not uncommon).  The sonics were still flat, wonky, Barbra still awash in obsolete reverb, etc.  Finally, in 2004, this British reissue would see the light of day.  Far superior to any \\"Yentl\\" soundtrack before it, the CD provides clean instrumentation and much cleaner (albeit still steller) vocal performances by our Miss Streisand.  So, this is the one you want, folks, if formally frustrated by the lack of sonic clarity and depth that plagued prior soundtrack issues:<br /><br />YENTL  Original Motion Picture Soundtrack  COL CD 86302

B001OQCV6A|5.0|Glancing at some of the most useful reviews which head the evaluations of the movie, I find them saying about all that needs to be said on the subject of the two questions which must be asked (by some of us) about it. First, is this a good movie regardless of whether we consider it to be a Holmesian descendent  or not.  From my viewpoint, as a mystery-thriller, it could hold its own, whether the detective is called Holmes or Smith. I would go further and say that it is a good movie with a screenplay that is well in keeping with the requirements to be recognized as within the latitude allowed by the original Conan Doyle stories. Second, if it is a good Holmes story, does Downey make a Holmes we can accept (and a Watson as a secondary consideration). On the latter question, my view is that most of the Watson's  who have appeared in recent films, theatrical or television (since the end of the Nigel Bruce era), have been allowed to be better than was Nigel Bruce. This is not  a criticism of Bruce, who was a fine actor, capable of doing an excellent job as Watson, the bosses decreed that there should be a contrast between the brilliant Holmes and a doddering, constantly bemused, Watson--and that's what he was forced to do. As others have pointed out, that image is not the one Conan Doyle created. In this movie, the Watson certainly makes the grade as true to the original and in line with most post-Bruce conceptions, a good strong character. As to Downey's, Holmes, it certainly lacks the particular qualities and demeanor we have come to expect in A level productions; nevertheless, as a tentative judgment, I will have to see the movie again, and, perhaps, more than that, to feel confident in my views, I lean toward saying that the screenplay's delineation, with the strength and skill he brings to the part, not only opens us up to this as an acceptable modernized conception, but as one which can stand with the best of previous conceptions. I do not mean he can replace the best of them, simply, that he can stand with them as an equal.<br />None of this matters much to the non-Holmesians; for the general public, I will simply go along with the crowd and advise seeing it for a very entertaining couple of hours.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|nice to listen to real music i'm glad he is keeping the old style of singing alive for everyone to hear
B009H7SCMA|4.0|Well written prose and rapier wit bring the erotic comedy of 'Gabriella' to life. It balances moments of shock with beautifully wrought character insights, and multiple levels of readability-the interplay between Gabriella and Jim could be simple sexual warfare between teenagers, but there is a deeper level speaking to class, so it is possible to read the course as an allegory of social warfare, all on a cricket field.<br /><br />The comedic timing of the book is wonderful, and the delivery sharp. There were moments I found myself laughing out loud at the dialogue as well as the antics. Even when some moments seemed over-the-top, the plot and characters were served.<br /><br />The ending was beautifully wrought, leaving just enough unanswered questions to make you wonder how long forever really is. All in all, a success of the genre.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman....can you go wrong? It is a well-acted action movie and good entertainment. Definitely worth watching. Highly recommended.

B0045INTVA|5.0|One great movie.  Everyone was playing their A game for this one.  I have seen three different endings over the years.  Who cares.  I like them all.
B000I9VON0|4.0|This movie is kind of endearing. It suffers, as all movies that hinge on high-end tech do, from the passage of time -- the equipment being used to monitor things now looks hilariously clunky -- but there's nothing to be done about that. In 20 years, we'll all be laughing at the ridiculously outdated tablet computers and cell phones in films of the 2010s. A solid script; Redford is playing that &#34;aw gee shucks&#34; good looking-but-doesn't-know-it pleasant fella with commitment issues. Mary McDonnell is a little bit bland. Otherwise, the supporting cast is great - Sidney Poitier has a remarkably light touch with comedy. River Phoenix is oddly uncomfortable delivering his lines -- which I suppose may be what the director and he were striving for -- and strikes me as sad here from the vantage point of 2013. David Strathairn is the standout here, but he has the most to work with. You'll probably talk about his character if someone ever asks you about this film later on. At any rate, it's a cute, clever caper. The only violence is quite cartoonish, time passes quickly, and it's worth a rainy afternoon's-worth of your time. I would not hesitate to watch this with a teenager in the room - there's some slightly squirmy hanky-panky between Donal Logue (who I had forgotten was in this! He looks like he's maybe 20!) and the whatever-her-name-is Natasha Fatale plot device gal, but nothing really horribly cringe-inducing if you're watching this film as a family. I liked it, but then, I like low-key movies. Oh, yes, also: Timothy Busfield plays a bad guy in this one, just like in his other Phil Alden Robinson movie, &#34;Field of Dreams.&#34; I had kind of forgotten that he used to be cast as the squirrely, mean, self-absorbed smart bad guy in things. Anyway. A fun little movie, worth watching.
0345803485|3.0|It was predicable and very repetative.  How many times do you call some one the same name and make it new and exciting.
014241493X|2.0|...because everyone reads them at a different place in their lives. I'm a 16yo pretty well read person, I love John Green, I love his vlogging, and I loved the chunks of this book that reminded me of him. But this book --written for teenagers-- just went completely over my head.<br /><br />The best part was by far the secondary characters, mainly his friends and the random popular girl who turns out to be layered and a quality person. They earn all the stars on this review. I totally agree with what others are saying: they're hilarious, one-of-a-kind, entertaining.<br /><br />Also the road trip in the end was really funny, cute, sweet, and interesting to read.<br /><br />But honestly, most of it was boring.<br />-Q's obsession with finding the girl gets annoying quickly because it completely takes over his life. He became really one-dimensional (\\"Margo. Margo. Margo.\\" I was shocked his friends didn't ditch him in the first few chapters.)<br /><br />-There are dense paragraphs of description and searching, and I couldn't picture the places in my head, so I just skipped large chunks of text.<br /><br />-I didn't understand a lot of things. John's main characters are always more observant and smart than your average kid, which I'm okay with, but it went overboard in this book. He kept contemplating big ideas like why we are here, what the poem meant, Margo's \\"strings\\", paper towns, abandonment, leaving, idealizing people, love, life, friendship, loyalty...and on and on until I was bored by the big-ticket topics and wondered why I was still reading. It also didn't seem true to Q's character. He was extremely mature and ahead of his time for a senior in high school.<br /><br />-The end was alright. I didn't feel sad for either character because by then I felt sort of robbed.<br /><br />It could have been so much better. Like I said, I'm a huge fan of John's but not of this book. Disappointing.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|I loved the acting of the two child actors, and Matthew McConaughey is great, and in a different role that usually seen for him.  This is an authentic portrayal of a different way of life and is very entertaining.

B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Nice shooter. Easy to pick up. Can be frustrating at first when you try to manage or acquire resources but once you get the hang of it, frontline can be hard to put down. Battle scenarios do get to be repetitive but there are surprised. Overall, better than most other games of the same genre.

0345803507|3.0|There was a lot of hype.  It was a good read, but I have been more moved by other romance novels.
014241543X|5.0|I have found myself reading more and more emotionally dramatic tales and this one is at the top of my list of all-time favorites.  Rarely does a book have me by the heart, but not to be cliche...I couldn't put it down.  My only criticisms are that it ended suddenly and I want to know what happened to Teddy.  If the author saw this review, she would probably think I was dumb for not picking up on the clues, but maybe that was her intent??  Being a writer myself, I know it adds to the tension of not fully knowing what happened, but the book never really comes out and says it.  Otherwise, it was very gripping and I just noticed there's a sequel, which I will be buying as soon as I can :)

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this book.  Civilization living in a silo.  Who to keep it working.<br /><br />Great science fiction requires realistic imagination .  Writing that allows the pictures to appear in your brain. Thought out detail that makes the story believable.  A classic.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Best thing about this is the easy snap on connection you get from it.  No plugging in to a port and if you hit it accidently it just pops off.  Great!
0061122416|5.0|I might even say this book is a motivation book in disguise. Simple yet deep good to read when you want some strength in ur heart
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This was in interesting premise, but somewhat strange.  I am still wondering why this novel has been so highly recommended.  I liked it but hesitate to recommend to others.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Ellen is great with her show.  It is funny, it is refreshing, makes you happy when you watch<br />, you can't wait for the next show, BUT this book was a different Ellen, as is written by her evel twin. Not funny.
B00005JNS0|1.0|The dvd that I just received in the mail for my son gets stuck at chapter 4 and I am really disappointed that I can not return it or exchange it for a different one.  This is the first time we are watching it!
B004SVM7BW|5.0|This is my app of choice for PDF reading and editing over all the others.  Great stuff,  keep it coming.
1439130833|5.0|Here on time and delivered in excellent shape. A fantastic product! Everyone should have one it is the best material I have had in many years!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This case was easy to install and offers great stability and protection for my Kindle. Love the bright color...easy to locate.
B00005U152|5.0|this is a great movie. husband really likes movies that Gina Lollobrigida plays in. he would tell people to buy this movie
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app!!! Numbers are big and can see the math which a lot of calculator app don't allow!! Definitely recommend to others :)
0345803485|5.0|But prepare yourself, this isn't your Grandma's read.  It's R+--that being said, the plot intensifies, the suspense picks up, and it winds up being a wild ride.  Definitely buy & read these...but be prepared for some intense sexual situations!
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Cloud Atlas SUCKS!!!! Don't Waste your $$ or time! I wish I had not wasted my time or $ on this disjointed, nonsensical book and the corresponding film. After watching the previews for the film prior to it's release I bought the book, I wish I could get a refund it is horrible!!! We (my hubby and I) watched the film after it's release, thank God we waited until it came out on Redbox, if I had paid more than $1.20 to watch it I'd really be irate. I have read some pretty iffy books and watched some snoozers but this was the ALL TIME WORST!!!!! A part of my life I will never get back, ugh!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome!!! One of the best apps here!  And finally updated to 1.7! Defenatly worth buying You'll never be bored again! :D
B00004WEJZ|5.0|this is a great action movie. I have all the james bond movies in my collection. you need to buy these movies.
B00005JNS0|2.0|This is a great movie, but the disk is very poorly produced. The one I received won't play from the beginning, and the sound and the pictures are out of sync. I have requested a replacement. We'll see if the replacement is any better.
0307742539|5.0|And a great trilogy.  It's a page turner, extremely suspenseful!  I recommend every book in the series. Lizbeth will make you love her, quirks & all!
0783110871|5.0|No one plays the bad guy like Ray Liotta.  Love this movie.  Suspenseful and exciting throughout.  This movie arrived in good condition.  I am very pleased.
1401937519|5.0|I found this to be an incredible book.  What the author experienced in her NDE and the message of living fearlessly afterward, was very powerful.  She had a unique experience and has a unique voice that can open all people to their own value and the beauty of life.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle is a witty, warm hearted show that is not all about violence and gore. The characters are wonderfully seen and grow as the episodes progress. I really look forward to receiving this in the mail sooooo sooooon.
0446693804|3.0|The book came all bent and the pages were wrinkly. The pages were stained as well. That's why I gave it 3 stars which means it's okay.
0307949508|5.0|Because after you've read the first book and dived into this one, you won't stop until you've read the trilogy.  The suspense is amazing.  How Stieg Larrson can turn Lizbeth Salander into an offbeat heroine is nothing short of brilliant.  This series is worth the hype.
B0054SMID0|2.0|Good movie over all but the soundtrack to this film almost killed the whole picture for me.  Next time skip the crappy sound track and keep the decent story.
0156027321|3.0|The Life of Pi is an engaging story of the feel-good kind, rather like Jonathon Livingston Seagull. It is not an allegory but it has a moral, again rather like JLS (but the seagulls stand for people according to their qualities). The tiger is a tiger and does not stand for some quality: it is dangerous; it demands attention to keep it in its place and, above all, to keep it fed. This is an element of plot and it is enough to keep Pi's interest for the 227 days it takes to reach Mexico, thus promoting Pi's survival while providing a framework for adventures--and incidentally maintaining the reader's interest. Pi's spirituality is self defined. He ignores the essential mystery and promise of the various religions. All he needs to do is to go through the motions of worship without understanding the implications of what he is doing in terms faith involved. Truly a creed for our the self-obsessed times.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I love this version of &#34;Phantom of the Opera!&#34; I believe that Gerard Butler's portrayal is conflicted and hauntingly beautiful. Who knew his voice was so good!! You can sympathize with him as the Phantom, hoping that someone (namely, Christine) would love him. All of the actors are great, the sets are sumptuous, the costumes superb, and the music??? Sigh...Andrew Lloyd Webber really shines with these songs. Emmy Rossum does a wonderful job as Christine and Patrick Wilson's Raoul is fiercely protective (the long hair though...?)<br /><br />Overall, the film is fantastic from start to finish. Buy it. You will love it!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This is nothing but Lady Gaga singing about how let fans keep her alive even in the hard moments. Lady Gaga is such a devoted REAL artist who understands fame and k les how to handle it. Her love for little monsters is endlessly. A true talented woman + her fans can do anything. This song is amazing, can't wait to hear the rest of the album.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I cannot wait for the next chapter.  The room is a breath of fresh air in a world of puzzles.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Love Love Love it!!!!!  Can lay in bed and read even with my head side ways, I can adapt the case to my angles!!
030789701X|5.0|its great tells you everything you ever wanted to know about the game it explains everything very clearly, its great
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I Really enjoyed this movie especially the ending, sucker for a love story. Excellent story line, good suspense, nice twist.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|I liked the first one, it was silly and fun, but all around well made. The second one pretty much died with Duke. It's not a matter of suspension of disbelief; i said &#34;this is stupid&#34; out loud waaaaaay too often. All the lame elements of the first one with none of the strengths.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|I haven't listened to any other daft punk song, so cannot comment how it compares with their usual style, or how a fan of their previous albums would take it. On its own, I liked the album, especially the songs &#34;get lucky&#34; and &#34;lose yourself to dance&#34; (both pharell contributions).
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was really excited my Chromecast finally came in.  It was easy to install the software on my computer and get it working but that is about all I can say about it.  The picture really is poor on the TV and sometimes it hangs up.  Quality of picture is poor and reliability is poor.  Oh and the content to choose from is pretty limited.  Wish it could play HULU.  It really is not ready for prime time but it holds a lot of promise.  I have a powerful computer and newer TV and still it did not work very well.  Most everything except for you tube is pay per view. If I knew what I know now I would not have purchased it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best game ive ever played u vet to build stuff and explore the world and play multiple player with a friend
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|A tale of an era I lived through but did not participate in that way. The movie explains many old attitudes. The ending shows that the parochial biases may never be erased.
B007XGJK4G|4.0|I was very impressed about the life of Bob Marley.  He certainly was a talented and generous individual.  I did not know that he had given so much of his time and money for Jamaica and Africa.  He cared about all people and you could tell by the music he produced.  Unfortunately, United States did not accept his music as equally as other countries until later on in Marley's life.  But what counts is that he made a difference and people will always remember him for that.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Fun game that's sort of a cross between matching games and adventure games.  I had to be careful because I could easily play for several hours in a row!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I had been using advanced task killer, I like Clean Master MUCH better.  I rely on it to help me keep the useless bloatware apps at bay.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This lady has such an incredible voice. I never tire<br />of listening to her. Nice variety of songs. She' come a long way.
0425252868|5.0|One of the best WWII books I have read... All WWII History buffs should read this. Great perspective from the German side, and well written.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love all the characters in the book.  They all seem so real, so much like people I have met in my travels!
0767812166|3.0|This is not a eat your face science fiction. It has a little bit of violence, I like this movie.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|The first was and still is totally addictive, this is the next step!  It's a different twist that needs a good phone or tablet CPU/GPU to handle the 3D effect in it, even though it's not huge nor a resource hog.  Worth a look!
0547572298|4.0|This is the craziest PKD book I've read yet. Reality crumbles, re-configures and reverts into itself, dead people live on in some kind of technologically extended, shared limbo. Psychics and counter psychics engage in broad, corporate warfare. Dick sort of unwinds and re-spools the basic fabric of existence around his characters, as they grope blindly trying to come to grips with reality(s) which they can't quite guess at, even if they know something is amiss. And like his other works, it's grounded by all of these extremely mundane, material details which makes it all the more unsettling
0785153942|3.0|The artwork and colorization was decent, but the overall story didn't really expand upon much back-story if you've already seen the movie. I think this comic would be a great introduction to someone who hasn't seen Pacific Rim or knows very little about the story, but if you're looking for more delicious Pacific Rim after the movie - you may be left a little disappointed after reading this.<br /><br />Although, it does offer some interesting insight into some of the characters of the movie and you do get to see some more Jaeger battles. So it is worth a read ultimately, if you're a big fan of Pacific Rim - but it might not be the continuity continuation you're looking for - but it's a fun little journey that I definitely found myself wanting more at the end.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this book it's a book you just can't put down it's a great series to read if you love mysteries, romance, and adventure
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Very satisfied with the purchase. I had used LL Bean bag all 4 yrs of high school, with heavy books and things I carried it withstand the test of time.  The Ibex backpack material is better quality, has nice compartments esp. for my laptop for the same price. Truly a great investment. Will highly recommend !!!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|You'll get it just to see what the Minions are up to now...<br /><br />But you'll need a hotter CPU/GPU to run it as it's big, overbearing and intense on resources.  It's great to play, but it has in-app purchases galore that'll nail you continually even if you play to the point you don't need them.  Good gameplay though and as always the Minions are hilarious!!
1611761069|4.0|I liked the book.  It was very suspenseful.  Kay was certainly troubled in her private life and it was as much of a storyline as the actual mystery.  I love the woman who always reads Patricia Cornwell's books.  She has brought Kay to life so well in all of her books.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Had not played for a few years. Glad to find it again and now I have Kindle HD so can take along with me.
B004SIP9VA|5.0|The dvd arrived in very good time and was in very good condition for being used.  The price was good considering it is an old movie, but it played with no problem.  I would use this seller again.<br /><br />I am purchasing movies that star Philip Winchester.  I am looking for a movie entitled &#34;The Heart of the Earth&#34; that was made in 2007.  If this seller can find this dvd that would play in the US in English, I would purchase it from him.  eBay has one for sale from Turkey and one from Australia, both of which will not play in the US.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is extremely addictive.  I couldn't put it down - and then when I managed it haunted my thoughts and dreams.  Great game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Well written, honest, and page-turning!<br />I recommend this to every person, especially those who are living with illness in any way.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|This game is similar to some of those Facebook games where you have to wait for energy to refill or buy energy/coins/crystals.  I am un installing it.  I'd rather pay for my games and enjoy them.  I don't like having to remember to go back to a game every so many hours (or whatever the time frame) in order to continue playing.  Also, it seems that you spend a lot of time doing the same things over and over again.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Ugh.  What was the point.  My 15 year old daughter and I could not quite get into it. She kept asking me what was going on and I just shrugged my shoulders.  Really wanted to like it, but never got attached to the plot or characters.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love the wire hangers I use them frequently and amazed family.  It's good to see immediate changes occurring as a result of your thoughts.  I want the author to be In my field potential!!!
0061122416|4.0|My son was assigned The Alchemist for summer reading this year.  As I read the book description on Amazon, I thought it sounded good, so I actually read the book before giving to my son.  The Alchemist is one of those works that can be interpreted on several levels--the &#34;face value&#34; story of the boy (main character) as well as a story about exploring and finding the true self.  Coelho masterfully changes the narrator perspective many times throughout the book, at one point speaking as the wind and the sun.  Overall, a great story by a very skillful author.  Should prompt some great book reports and discussion!
B000002OZY|5.0|Went to Stratford to see the theatrical production of Tommy so I thought I would warm up using the original soundtrack by the Who.<br />WOW, what raw talent for such young performers! (I mean the Who).  I would of loved to see the Who perform this entire set, would have been a musical marathon.  You should give it a listen if you haven't done so recently.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Don't hesitate to invest in another great book by Hosseini. His ability to transport readers to the perspectives of his characters is astounding. Characters that one may not initially like become understood - that is powerful!
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|And I had to get it again to listen to it in the car.  I can't get enough of the band.
B002361MLA|4.0|An interesting perspective presented here and worth a look at if you are unhappy and want a different approach at life. It can be very heavy at times and will take a while to digest.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I don't really care for the &quot;pay to cheat&quot; format of the bonuses,  but the game is fun,  just like in rl!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Extremely well written and acted. Wonderful cast and amazing setting. Very engrossing had to catch up to date.<br />I Love it.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|Is good, but 2nd better and third is currently doing awesomely.  Like Harry Potter, it keeps getting darker every series.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great story of the way the help and the elite in England function separately but together.
B00EI6E17A|4.0|It's got a good beat & you can dance to it. If you're expecting more, you will probably be disappointed.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I am enjoying this game my grandson is helping me and it is fun to watch him play he is only two years old fun game.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Received this as a replacement for the original that came w/ my kindle keyboard. It had stopped charging and/or was not holding the charges. Given it was still under warranty, the problem was solved quickly and pleasantly.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|As a fan of the books and LOTR this movie did not disappoint.  The special effects were spectacular and the parts were well played by the actors.  Preciousssssssssssssssssssssssss
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Two of my favorite genre when it comes to movies. The acting was excellent for this type of movie, Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina just to name two veterans of film. The storyline was even better than the acting. What truely surprised me was the fight/action scenes, they were far above the norm for fantasy films in general. This is a movie that you and the family will enjoy year after year. There is also a two part love story interwoven in this film. This is a win win movie for all ages.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James has done it again with an edge of the seat romp around the world race to save the world story.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'm addicted to this game; it's fun, relaxing and luring. Great game. Try it out, give yourself some time to get used to how it goes and i think you'd really enjoy it.
B00CCEHX5W|1.0|This is the most illogical step for Black Metal. If you absolutely have to have progression in Black Metal then pick up the new Watain or latest Darkthrone record. Not this hipster garbage. It lacks everything that makes Black Metal what it should be; ideology, image, and last but certainly not least the sound. Even if you absolutely hate both of the bands mentioned above it doesn't change the fact that Emperor and Enslaved have already gone the \\"experimental\\" route 10+ years ago. If you love the album, good for you! But please stop trying to promote this as some genre changing, revolutionary release that will change the face of music forever.
B002HL3PN4|4.0|Good family entertainment, safe for kids of all ages.  You don't need to be  a Harry Potter fan to enjoy or appreciate this movie.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Good but is lacking in multiple playablility it could be better but a solid game for free and the changing of locations around the world mixed things up
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Without being long winded, if you like Gaiman books you will love this one.  Very well written.  Would recommend without hesitation.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It's not a really big love story in fact it's a abusive relationship. The storyline is very unrealistic, their relationship isn't really loving, it's all sex and she continues to be blindsided by Christian's antics because he is so sexy (which is related over and over again). The book didn't really go as deep as it potentially could've, it gave you the ending you wanted (and expected) but not the ending it needed.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Normally, I cannot get past level one on these games. I made it to level five before they asked for a review.
0307951154|3.0|Since I am Norwegian by heritage, I always jump at a chance to read a Norse best seller. I wish I hadn't jumped at this one.<br />Nesbø paints Norway as a dark, dismal place full of druggies and other people you'd sooner not meet. The sun never shines.<br />Gentle breezes never blow.<br /><br />I enjoy reading stories that have a protagonist I can like a lot or really dislike. Harry Hole was neither. He just kind of slumps along,<br />living with his regrets, talking to people he disrespects, visiting places he can hardly wait to leave. When the denouement finally came, it was something of a relief. I could quit reading. Perhaps I exaggerate. But one thing for sure -- I won't fall into Nesbø's<br />hole ever again.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|My first Gillian Flynn. Creepy and well written. Definitely going to grab a copy of dark places for my next read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Cannot write a review without giving away the experience of reading it. I can say that 700 some pages could have been even longer and I would have been happy as I hate it when I'm done with a book I so enjoyed. Because of that, I immediately went to the next one - Shift, and finished that (only 600 some pages) and today I got my preorder of Dust and when I finish the book I am reading now, will start that one. Can to wait, but need to finish what I started.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i love playing the game and would like to thank my cousin who introduced it to me.<br />The game expands your imagination and is lots of fun
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Good game pretty smooth great for a free game has multiplayer but no one is on line need more players to see what this game is like so get the game
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I have not seen this movie, for my child. She likes it and it plays fine so I guess its good.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|One of the best games I have played. Better than poppitt  and other games I  have played. Very challenging and exciting.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Encouraging to read how checklists can make a difference in Healthcare and beyond. My hope is that the desire and discipline to develop and follow checklists will prevent harm.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|I've always liked Superman.  The action is good.  I didn't like the Man of Steel being arrested, even if it was to save earth.  The movie helped me to understand General Zod (and Lord Nor) better; he isn't just a bad man but he was trying to preserve the established order.  I liked some of the earlier Superman movies better where Superman is always portrayed as a good guy, well-liked by everybody, always saving people.  If the Man of Steel had not been arrested, I'd probably give the movie a 5.  But there is a lot of violence.
0062124293|5.0|A must read for women AND men. SO good! It is hilarious and poignant and simply fabulous. That is all.
0375851569|5.0|The books arrived in perfect condition, on time and we began enjoying them immediately.  The set was a great price and the covered the classics we want to share with the next generation. I highly recommend this item and seller.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Very poignant story.  Will read others by this author.  Seemed more like non-fiction, it was so real. Good, good, good.
B007REV4T8|5.0|The latest series of James Bond movies with Daniel Craig are prequels to the early Sean Connery films. As such these are some of the best Bond films. Skyfall is a well made story of Bonds earliest missions. He gets shot and loses his confidence. He has to find a way to come back to become the Bond we know and love. There a few surprises along the way.
B0091QS88K|5.0|When I am bored I would go and play this game, I am older then younger kids, but I find this entertaining
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Need to make it a little easier. Gets so fast. Other than that I love it. Very fun game. Can't wait to level up.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|A lot of reading for little kids though. Educational too. Fun facts on reef life. Awesome game. I would Definitely recommend it.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It's a ok game but it could better the controls need a lot of work that's y I think it's a ok game
B000059QYB|5.0|I was in high school in the 80s and Billy was my favorite by far. this a great flash back album for all those aging 80s rockers out there.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Such s good movie. Worth seeing multiple times, which explains why I bought it. Great buy. Thank you so much
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is based on subway surfers but it doesn't upgrade every couple weeks. I like going into the lab and the streets.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|watch the director's cut for added scenes and an alternate ending! or the theatrical cut for the version you've seen before. great price too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is AWESOME! I cannot believe this app is free. It is totally worth downloading. I love El Macho's lab! It is also fun to defeat El Macho, Vector, and Meena.<br />Love this app. Keep up the good work!!!!
B008XG1X18|1.0|I love pinterest but have been unable to pin anything while using my kindle for several weeks now.  My boards are not available and the app freezes. Very frustrating!  I really don't enjoy using my phone for Pinterest, but it is not usable on Kindle Fire now.  Please fix this!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Be careful about touching the screen in the correct way. It will draw a card when you're trying to simply pull a card from your own hand.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Excellent cd.  Bocelli is just a beautiful voice and it is tremendous listening<br /><br />i think i will order the DVD of that concert if Amazon has it.
B002K0WBYG|5.0|I totally enjoyed the movie, romantic and funny at the same time.  I love the blue ray version as it shows a better picture.
B006AN78XS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  Great one to chill or relax to.  Beautiful Paris scenes and a touch of nostalgia.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started this book with the intention of only reading a chapter or two a day. That didn't happen, I started and couldn't put it down! Loved it!!
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|This movie is a great addition to GI Joe Collection. I bought the 3D Version and it was better than most. The two best changes is they got rid of the Waynes, and replaced him with Dwayne. Bruce Willis was also a great addition.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made every emotion come out of me. I recommend it to everyone if you want to experience an amazing book
B006LSZECO|1.0|this book went back & forth so much I couldn't follow it.  it did not hold my interest I would NEVER recommend it
B000UGZTQO|5.0|It's a Ram, so it works, what more do you want. Bah Bah Bah and so on and so forth.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|This is a sweet movie.  The acting is great and characters are totally relatable.  Mother's should watch it with their grown kids...because many of us have the same type of relationships.  Streisand and Rogen did a fabulous job.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is kinda like subway surfer but better because its despicable me. GET IT NOW! suitable for all ages.
B0084B5TK8|2.0|such a vague, slow read. Jonathan's journal is very captivating in the beginning and everything else is seemingly dead, and incredibly dragged out. the flip-flopping back and forth between the dates was annoying and unnecessary. stoker could have also put much more detail. the counts feature did not display much of a picture in my mind.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is an awesome game works great on.my kindle and on my phone I highly recomened it for users get it
B008XG1X18|5.0|or hours.... This is the best app, sites, since myspace. I have had enough of facebook...too many people expect too much of your time. this way I can check out the things that interest me, not what someone thinks of someone else. I have a few close friends on it and follow those people and things that intrigue me.  love, love, love, this app...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|great, nicely written story. felt real and relationships were genuinely faulted but beautiful at the same time. i wish it never ended!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|If you like HO adventure games then you'll enjoy this game... it's your typical HO &amp; mini games combo... G5 does a good job with these games &amp; I look forward to the sequel...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A great read if you're interested in the subject matter. I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. Written by a Carolina boy.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Not really a great app, I think it was something that my son saw that he thought was going to be really cool & it's not.
0446585025|4.0|It was a great read.  I love the humor.  It's a book you can put down and pick back up and not have to remember plot or anything.  It was great!
1433210428|5.0|this is a very interesting book. I listened to it on a long road trip. It gave me a lot to think about. It is worth reading or listening to.
0393334988|5.0|Although this book tells of unspeakable cruelty, it becomes a beautiful uplifting story at the end.  Good writing, great story!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great game!!!  Everyone in my house loves to play it!!  Lots of fun and it's minion's so of course it's great!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It was very fun to play. I loved the competitions, the ability too dress your horse in real horse tack, and the variety of breeds and colors.
078324228X|5.0|ANTHING that Denzel Washington touches is good. I enjoyed this movie...gives a lot of information on Rubin Hurricane Carter's past life, on how he got to every single stage of his life.
0062059963|4.0|WARNING: There will be spoilers. I can't write this review without them.<br /><br />To be honest, I have dreaded writing this review in so many ways. I've seen a lot of the blurb about this book, and while it didn't make me any less excited to read the book, it made me scared of what I'd think and how I'd come out of it feeling. I still don't know what I think. So forewarning, this review is probably gonna be incoherent as I try to sort out what I think. Commence rambles.<br /><br />There is only one illogical thing that sticks out to me as I read this book. Now, there are rebels right? And a few times throughout the book, they come attack and they[the royal family and the Elite] have to run to these hideouts so that they'll be safe. Well apparently they get into the castle and the grounds pretty easily. There are at least three attacks in this book. Soo, if that's the case, then why the heck don't they guard better?! If this is a threat, do something! Build a wall or a gate around the castle for crying out loud! Post more guards OUTSIDE, I don't know! But it makes no sense to the logical side of my brain how they didn't do anything. Any. Thing.<br /><br />But that said? Let's ignore logic and talk about my feels. The romance. WAAAH the romance. I don't even know who I am anymore. The foundation is built and now Kiera gets to have fun and play it and confuse us. Curse writing fun that kills readers! Maxon is still swoony, but then their relationship gets all confusing and I was like MAAAXON. Stop being a stupid teenage boy! I know you have a right to be a hormonal guy, but can't you be perfect all the time? Seriously? *headdesk* I mean there were totally some times when Maxon did some stupid things I didn't think capable of him. Let's refer back to the \\"Maxon being a teenage guy\\" bit. BUT STILLLL. The relationship between A and M was just unraveling and confusing to my heart and I just wanted a break from it all! I still don't know what to think of him[being Maxon]. I really hope he makes up for it in book three. I want the REAL Maxon back.<br /><br />And then there's Aspen. I never liked the guy, but now I don't even know which boy will get her. Do you know how much this infuriates me?! I mean he obviously has his perks. I won't deny that. But COME ON. Can't we make Maxon good one this book instead of Aspen? Cuz that's what Kiera is totally doing here. Maxon is the swoony face to make Aspen's jerkiness look uber bad in book one. Now in book two, Aspen is the hero to make Maxon's dumbness look worse. I seriously don't even know what to expect from The One anymore.<br /><br />America has totally grown in this book. We see a lot more of her rash and honest side. She stands up for things she believes in and has some pretty dang great moments. But one thing I didn't like about her this book? SHE CRIED SO FREAKING MUCH. Sure we got lots of her verbal kick-butt, but when *cue relationship feels* emotional drama showed up and affected her in a sad way, too often I felt we were rushing back to her room to sob on the bed. Get a GRIP girl. After the third time I was just getting annoying. Put your strong will into your emotional life will ya? Fight for him as much as you fight for your beliefs. But despite these sob sessions, she really does grow as a character and I'm very eager to see what she's up for in book three.<br /><br />Bringing me to my next bit of brain vomit. Along with our reels we have quite the buildup of the society that so many people criticized in book one. We get more history, and we see the tensions and problems of the current society That's where A's kick-buttness comes in. HOWEVER, I feel like Kiera could be taking this in so many ways, that I'm worried what it will mean for book three. I loved all the insight and how it was inserted to give us breaks from the horribly wonderful emotional feels, and yet so much is built up that I feel like what's needed is an epic smack-down. Which I'm not sure Kiera can deliver.Maybe I'm feeling hopeless right now, because I don't even know if my boy Maxon will win America anymore. But I expect serious greatness from The One.<br /><br />*takes deep breath* Wow. I'm going to shut up now. You're read my rantings. My worries, fears and likes. I really did love this book. I flew through it and sucked it up and just eep! It filled that little place in my heart for guilty pleasure books that needed filling. Now I just get the after-feels and trauma of wondering and analyzing and freaking out to death. If I don't make it till The One, please inscribe the following on my tombstone; \\"Maxon? If America won't take you, I'll see you at the pearly gates.\\"<br /><br />Content: Milderate<br />[kissing, a couple mild language instances, some light innuendo]Maybe I'm feeling hopeless right now, because I don't even know if my boy Maxon will win America anymore.

B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Both my Husband & my 5 year old son love the game they fight over getting to play it!!  They enjoy it so I would recommend.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed his other 2 books so was looking forward to this one.  Seemed to just get started when it was over.  The price was too high for a novella.  I double checked the number of pages on my Kindle and thought they miss-judged or the type was extra big.
B000UGZTQO|5.0|I use RAM products for many motorcycle Farkle installations.  They just plain work well and in so many different applications and locations.  Love 'em.
B005SV9X22|5.0|The vocals are very nice live, the show is extravagant and amazing. The show can be explicit at times but it's never offensive. This woman, Lady Gaga, puts on one Hell of a show; the dancing is very good, the singing is good, and beautiful especially during \\"Speechless\\" performance. Behind the scenes is very interesting as well, I love it! Highly recommend, Gaga is very unique in everything she does.
0606147195|5.0|I have read many of John Grisham's novels but somehow I had missed this one.  When I read he had a new book coming out that was a sequel to A Time to Kill, I decided I should read it.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to Sycamore Row.
B0058X67OM|5.0|You have to appreciate the efforts in getting any older sound and video stuff together and then asking the modern public to accept it. With Blu Ray and Hi-Definition, even some of the best recorded  stuff looks bad. The technology was not as advanced, but I think it's well done and thank those who did it.
B00BLSAM3A|3.0|a must have for anyone who likes the post apocalyptic movies.. on the down side. I was hoping blue-ray could have made this movie a little bit crispier.. oh well.. great efin movie..
B008220B0C|1.0|The songs are horrible, the plot is fake and scripted just like everything in the media about this so called \\"singers\\" life. Everything is done merely for attention as for the music in the movie itself it is awful. These live performances [what is even live, in the concert it's just the studio versions being played with the singer singing over them and sometimes not even doing that] and the studio songs are not even good to begin with. This is awful and made for people with absolutely NO music taste whatsoever. Avoid at all costs.
0307744434|5.0|After reading several reviews I fell for the hype of \\"The Night Circus\\" and I am not sorry at all. The author makes this such a fun and entertaining read, I read it in a week and I am a slow reader. There is an air of mystery and suspense as the novel goes on and this gives it a nice twist to keep things interesting. I loved it, you will love it so read it!
B008MM9630|5.0|Under 24 hours and I am crazy about the game. I can't seem to put it down, my kids say it is worse than Farmville was for me years ago.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Excellent. I love it makes my Kindle able to have a word processor. Get it YOU won't regret it. At all.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|Despite being a relatively long movie, it was a very superficial interpretation of the book, cutting too many corners, and skipping too many crucial parts. Retains some of the suspense at times, but often misses. Also very poor sound editing. Despite having the volume up, I couldn't discern a lot of the dialogue. Mara was impressive at times, but she seemed to be confused about her accent.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|Filled with enough inaccuracies and stereotypes to intrest just about every Abolitionist out there. Anachronisms abound -almost as bad as the contrails of a jet showing up in the John Wayne/Kirk Douglas film The War Wagon.  The best part of any Leonardo DiCaprio film is when his character dies - hopefully horribly.  Jamie Foxx must have really needed a paycheck to stoop this low.  Blight 'em. Cowboy!  Yippee Kai Yay....
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I don't know how I missed this back in the day, but nowbim hooked. Sure, elements of the plot are thin, but its better qualities win out.
0316056871|5.0|Tina Fey is such a comedic talent.  I had laugh out loud moments while reading this book. I loved reading stories about her childhood and her time at SNL.  I can't wait to see what she does next.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|Just another early years Spielberg blockbuster!<br /><br />And the cellophane wrap was easy to open and believe it or not... NO security tags or tapes to have to peel off and leave that awful residue.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I ordered new dvd with the dvd status &#34;new&#34; follow the title, but I got used one with &#34;used and very good&#34; status. The new one's price is about $2 different from used one. I don't bother to return it. Who care about paying extra a couple dollars.
B004MPESSY|3.0|Here is my problem with this movie, I don't like drawn out, graphic rape scenes.  Everyone knows what is going to happen, I prefer when movies &#34;gloss&#34; over the actual rape part and this movie did not.  I never saw the original so I can't compare the two.<br /><br />Some of her revenge is a little far fetched, other parts still a little too graphic.<br /><br />I wouldn't watch it again, but wouldn't tell anyone not to watch it either.
B001NHNG64|3.0|I love the idea of jack reacher.  I love how the author walks you through his thought process.  The problem is that sometimes he goes on for pages describing something and it isn't an integral part of the plot...it's just pages of &#34;over description&#34;.  It's not going to stop me from reading the rest of the series!
B00APYKXFS|2.0|Found it useless; but, it was free and sometimes it's true that you get what you paid for! Maybe you'd have better luck with it on an iPad.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|This is an amazing album. Lzzy's voice is amazing and powerful backed up by a sound that is amazingly diverse from one song to the next.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|This toy was just what the kids ordered.  They really enjoy it.  The only problem was the corner of the box was messed up.  They say they can live with it.
B00782O7IY|4.0|In Fred Astaire's first screen test, the judges wrote: \\"Can't act. Can't sing. Slightly bald. Can dance a little.\\" Astaire went on to be the most famous dancer of all time and won the hearts of American's forever.<br /><br />We've come a long way since silent movies, the dancing musicals of the 1930's, the gangster movies, the perfect ending romantic movies.<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" gives us a hint of where the motion movie making industry started.  But it also has a plot within a plot which makes this much more interesting.<br /><br />Because \\"The Artist\\" was made in 2011 it can add a little more \\"oomph\\" to the plot.  As society grows so do our movies.
B006S086AM|2.0|I really wanted to like this, but it's so cookie cutter. The main characters (played by Jesse Eisenberg & Kristen Stewart) lack depth and any unique perspective. Half the side characters are miscast (especially Ryan Reynolds). Bill Hader & Kristen Wiig are sadly unfunny and I typically really enjoy their performances. I could go on, but why bother. The only redeeming quality is the softly stylized cinematography.
B0063M22QO|5.0|JUST GOT THIS AND I AM ENJOYING MY TIME PLAYING.THE LAYOUT OF TILES A NICE AND THE SOUNDS ARE GOOD.I
B00AEBB63U|1.0|Does not work on Kindle for the Win8 RT - but you don't find this out until after you've paid for and downloaded it
B0063IH60K|3.0|What can you say about a game?  It works fine n the kindle fire.  Not real exciting, though.<br />Will probably play it occasionally.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the entire series.  Definitely liked how they flowed from the first boom to the last book. I would recommend to anyone.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|this product really does an amazing job at everything it does. i'm so happy with this and I've had the Nike fuel band and the fitbit. I'd recommend this over either one of those products.
0345495004|2.0|I do not remember ever seeing this book, much less reading it.  the title does not even suggest I gave it as a gift
B006MW3V6U|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST SERIES TO EVER COME OUT.  I AM SO HOOKED ON THIS SHOW, AND FEEL LIKE I AM LIVING THE LIVES OF THE CHARACTERS.  I LAUGH, I CRY, AND I WANT TO BE AT DOWNTON ABBEY WITH EVERYONE!  BRING ON SEASON 4!!!! I AM READY.....
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put this book down .  The story of Katniss and all she loves dearly are in danger and her survival is heartbreaking. Who can she trust?  How does she protect her loved ones? Cannot wait to read book three.  Mini
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This is my favorite electronic version of Sudoku, because when you select a number to fill in, the game highlights where else it shows up on the board and turns red when you have conflicting values. If you need a little help, it also offers handy hints to move things along.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun and realistic.  wish they would do away with gems and trying to make you buy game credits with real money!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love it . Its awesome. I wish the updates were faster. Other then that it is totally awesome. It Rocksssssssssssssss
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|This is a page turner that will keep you interested right to the end. Very good characterisation. A great Summer Read.
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|I downloaded this app thinking that I could read (and maybe edit) Google documents on it. I couldn't. I'm really not sure what use I would have for this since it doesn't do what I was expecting, so I see no reason to keep or recommend it.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Its all  what you believe in I guess..... Interesting reading, but I'll leave it at that. I'll stick to Low Carbs. That works
B0097HC8MK|5.0|Life presents many interesting challenges along the way. Nicolas Cage presents a character whose life appears out of control with alcohol. We move toward things that give us relief from pain. His character becomes an alcoholic to deal with real pain. His choice is not good, but he find love in an interesting way which he finds difficult to accept. I hope the movie will inspire anyone with pain to find an effective, conscious way to deal with it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Unusuall characterisation in that its difficult to really feel for the main characters but is a very good read all the same.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft so much. cant wait for the updates :) Ps............ u should buy this game its a very good game ;)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Our son read this book for summer. I found it so moving that I went back and read it myself. I talked about it with other parents that stated they did the same. I recommend this book to any age.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|So a bit of background on me so you can know if you relate with me or not. I do enjoy games, lately I've been so busy I really can't get into many games, and once I stop playing a game I rapidly lose interest. This game is a great one because it is a simple yet complex and changing game.<br /><br />Big hit games like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope don't even hold my attention like this game has. Both the previous mentioned games are good in their own way, but the difference is once the awe of the new has faded the repetition sets in. And perhaps at sometime this game will do the same eventually, but for now the game is one of only a few that isn't going to be removed from my phone for a good while.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|Nice twist in this story. Wonderful setting and good characterisation also. Keeps you interested to the end. Delves into small town mindset.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It was so fun. I loved the games they had in there it was so addictive . I play it almost everywhere.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|This is my favorite so far out of all of Demi's CDs! Absolutely the best, she is my idol. Buy it you won't regret it!
B005544V6A|5.0|People climbing up the ladder of success become entangled in deception and trickery to advance or be promoted.  A fast paced adventure that is filled with intrigue and excellent actors portraying their roles to perfection!
1781162646|5.0|i always enjoy mr. king.  this book was very interesting.  loved the end...a real stephen king twist.  what i would expect from him.
B00AWBYA2G|5.0|I'm not a big fan of musicals but I love the Beatles and this movie. I enjoy the covers and purchased the soundtrack.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This 3rd in the series is so exciting I couldn't stop reading. I have to quit for a while because I don't want it to end. Although I haven't finished it yet I would definitely recommend the trilogy to anyone who likes this type of book. I will read more by this author.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Reading this book I wasn't sure what I was in store for due to never reading anything else by the author. Yet, through the book the writing style twists and turns and eventually brings it all together. It was a very easy read but something I didn't want to put down.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|Anybody who loves rock'n roll should buy this. Although the quality of the film isn't great, the concert is just awesome! It really shows the stones at their finest in performing concerts. Let us not forget that this was after the making of one of the greatest albums ever.<br /><br />A must see for almost anyone.
B000002HH9|4.0|Well, what a diverse record.<br />The diehards will tell you this is a bad record and not vintage cure, but I tend to disagree and I am a fan.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong this record has some stinkers, but amongst the stinkers are some beautiful songs among some of the cure's best<br /><br />The songs to seek out<br /><br />1.Treasure (Lovely melody)<br />2.This is a Lie<br />3.Want<br />4.Jupiter Crash<br /><br />All of these are worth the price alone, enjoy
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Truly outstanding! Not so sure about Olga who played Julia. Though it is highly unlikely, a prequel would make the pair an effective team.<br />The movie stands alone as an impressive total package: sound, production values, imagery, acting.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Dancing was good, acting was good. The plot was boring. I would not recommend to friends. A bit to sexy and revealing for my taste.
0143038583|5.0|A wonderful look at where our food comes from and an education on how our food is processed (and over-processed) to make our lives easier and cheaper, as far as feeding ourselves.  I am trying to make changes in the food I buy so I can support healthier food production, but gosh it is difficult.Highly recommend this book!
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Bruce Willis is back again!!  I love to watch his movies, and this one is just as entertaining as the others!!
0615782043|5.0|I was highly impressed with Revenge of the Orgasm, I must say this is a skillfully written piece of literature.  GPA takes you on an intellectual ride with the poetic tales and words chosen in this book.  You are captured, and intrigued mentally as you read the lines. I have so many favorites, just to name a few Pose, Merging Saturday into Sunday, and the Westin Incident. GPA truly takes you on a sensual journey, so much that I could not put the book down. Everyone must have a copy of this book; He is a very talented author, definitely Greatest Poet Alive. It is Bonus, if you ever heard him recite, because as you read you will hear his voice deliver each poem only as he does. ~LaDonna
B0013V2UU8|5.0|Sadly, Lego discontinued this set. If you want to make buildings, you need it. I intend to use the assortment pattern on the side of the box to use as a guide in the &#34;pick a brick&#34; on the website to copy it in others colors.
B00BLSJI80|4.0|i so love demi lovato's voice. there are a couple of songs here that are my faves.  Without The Love and In case are my top choices here. :) i love the song In case since it displays powerful voice and the song is endearing and heartbreaking at the same time. :)
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Action, good acting, great plot - overall really entertaining movie!!  It's easy to apply the plot to real life events, and we all sort of wonder about our local government's operations.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't stop. Really works your brain. Can't wait to get to the next level. You are on your own to figure out where to look for clues and where to use it. My sister and I have made<br />a contest out of it to see who finishes their level faster.
B001AITGWE|4.0|This is a lesser known movie that more people need to see.  Good story, nice drama, solid acting and great stylistic choices.  All around very enjoyable film.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best app I have and I love ot the most fun I can have with an app like this.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|The movie is long, and well worth watching every minute of it.  Great actors, entertaining plot, with surprises around every corner.
044655667X|5.0|The Fifth Witness by Michael Connelly is another excellent legal thriller with defense attorney Mickey Haller at the top of his game as he provides his client with the best possible defense. From one revelation to the next with plenty of subterfuge, backstabbing, and shady legal maneuverings, Connelly keeps the pages turning and the reader guessing. However, the joy of reading a Connelly novel isn't merely found in marveling over the expert execution of his procedural work, but in the progression and development of his main characters. In this novel, Mickey Haller is in rare form as he manages his professional life and his ever more complicated private one. The greatest conflict, however, comes when the jaded lawyer confronts a crisis of conscience as he slowly begins to understand that he is actually representing the rarest of clients--one who is actually innocent. How it ends makes me wish Connelly would hurry up and write his next Lincoln Lawyer novel because this one changes everything for Mickey Haller.
B001VLBDD0|4.0|T1 was great, and T2 is just as good. If you are discovering these movies for the first time, and you want face-paced thrills, a relentless bad guy, and action, action and more action, this is your movie.<br /><br />If you have seen it before a long time ago, and are checking it out again, it still works. It's still pretty fun to watch.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I absolutely love this game, it's so much fun to play. The graphics on it are amazing. It's actually kind of addicting lol
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Has open my eyes to how habits form and the best part how to change them. It has given me a understanding of myself.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I am using this in the downstairs hallway of a split entry home. This light does a great job. When the front door is open ( 9 feet away) and light from the outside is coming in, the light stays off even when you walk by it. I tend to leave the switch in the &#34;off&#34; position during the day. I am an early riser and when I walk by the night light, with a coffee in hand, the light goes on and I can navigate down the stairs safely.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow, this game is sooo much fun.  I love the fact that it can be adjusted for different ages.  My kid plays her kindle game for her age and I play on mine with more difficulty.  Beautiful color and addictive.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|The Belkin Classic Case for the Kindle Fire 7&#34; HD model is a good, basic carrying case.  There's nothing fancy here.  No bells and/or whistles, just a good, solid protection case.
B00422LESO|4.0|I have read this twice and loved it both times. All my friends have loved it too. We are going to the movie together and hope it won't be to different!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As with all Mr Follett's books, it was hard to put down.  Again I was there in every scene as an observer.  Anxiously awaiting the third book.  Thank you.
B0076NAVNA|5.0|This is excellent cd, amazing musicians, nice lyrics, music powerfull!!! I'm already wating their second job!!!!! Portnoy is incredible!!! One of top  five drummers!!!
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I thought that maybe Bruce Willis was getting too to do another action movie.  I was wrong.  Yes the plot was thin but the action was incredible.  Almost wall too wall.  The Blu-ray transfer was excellent.  If your a Die Hard fan or just like action, I recommend this movie.
3899554698|5.0|One of the best maps book I've ever seen! Amazing and beautiful maps. Highly recommend, for children and adults =)
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Reading 50yrs after the first time and having ridden a bicycle the full Alaskan Highway camping out for a month Jack London was right on with this book.
B00DSY8D36|3.0|I've tried several pdf aps. This one works the best for me. Had to learn the hard way, though, to hit the back arrow when done or all my editing would not be saved. Am able to underline one word rather than the whole line like some apps. But it will often highlight or underline completely out of the area so I have to be really careful not to go past the word and into the margin of the page. Edit buttons are easy enough to access.<br /><br />I have experienced several crashes with this ap using my Kindle 8.9 HD. One time I couldn't go to the previous page without a crash. So I went to the page just before and then to my page. Crash. Used the select a page feature and went to that page, Crash. After an hour it started working correctly.<br /><br />Overall, it gives me what I need and is much better for me than Adobe. Adobe was ok, just not enough features for me. It did not allow you to underline just one word, Had to underline the whole line or between punctuation. Better than ez pdf pro. Edit buttons on that one too small and crashed all the time.<br /><br />This ap is not exactly what I need, but comes closer than others.
B000E1MTXQ|1.0|I'm &#34;tech smart&#34; , everybody's TV and dv player is HD. In fairness there is a &#34;product info&#34;, but it really doesn't mean much to anybody. What it should say is &#34;this product is in a format that was discontinued in 2008, only 600,000 HD DVD players were sold in the US. The chances that you have one is less than winning the POWER BALL&#34; This product info would actually mean something to people. Amazon is not doing it's customers even selling these. When people make reviews, the generalize and aren't specific to an item, therefore the  good reviews are not for this item but DVD and Blue-ray products with the same name.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The game is very addictive. I just wish coins would regen more quickly, but other then that it is great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 7yr old son downloaded this app on my kindle. I'm not sure he knew what to expect. He asked for my help and never got it back. Great time.
0688014291|4.0|Quick and easy read.  Had to read this for management continuing education.  Good managing skills means spend less time micro-managing and more empowering employees.
B000QEIOTO|1.0|I'm &#34;tech smart&#34; , everybody's TV and dv player is HD. In fairness there is a &#34;product info&#34;, but it really doesn't mean much to anybody. What it should say is &#34;this product is in a format that was discontinued in 2008, only 600,000 HD DVD players were sold in the US. The chances that you have one is less than winning the POWER BALL&#34; This product info would actually mean something to people. Amazon is not doing it's customers even selling these. When people make reviews, the generalize and aren't specific to an item, therefore the  good reviews are not for this item but DVD and Blue-ray products with the same name.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great story that shows John Green's capability in creating characters that deal with tough issues while remaining true to friends, family, and self. Great read!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Not to hard. Give it a try. If you don't like it you can delete it. It was free so I can't complain.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wasn't even interested in reading the book at first, just read the first part because it was there to past time in a park, but then I couldn't stop reading and became invested and read the next two. I loved the story line and fell in love with the characters, definitely a good read.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|This is probably one of the best board games I have downloaded. The size ( under 4MB ) makes it a keeper. It runs very well on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 without any issues. I agree with all the other 5Star rated reviews. THIS IS ONE GREAT APP.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great app with a variety of quick and easy games. Especially great for those with little attention span like myself. Can't beat the price and that's the best part.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Game is great just wish Facebook wasn't so involved with it... I would rate this 5 stars if u could earn credits and coins another way. Overall will continue to play..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game! My 6 and 9 year olds truly enjoy playing it!! It is a race to see who can complete the rooms first and move on to the next phase!!!  Please continue on with more levels soon!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has everything you want on a horse game, it's brilliant. The only bad thing is I don't like the player names they give you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We Love it!! Can't wait for Season 4 to start. It is such a refreshing change from Reality TV. The actors & actresses are fabulous.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Sherlock is always a good read. This collection was perfect for those times when a short story like s light lunch is all that is required. Greatly enjoyed.
B00005J6T1|5.0|As Sire Records owner Seymour Stein pointed out, the musical bed that Madonna built on was the post disco dance music that that coming out of the black club scene of the period. Of course this was also a sound that was appealing in gay clubs at the time as well. 1983 was a critical year in terms of 80's pop. Prince was just beginning to become a major crossover force. And [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ Thriller]] ruled the world that year. This period was ruled by three '58 babies',meaning three characters all born in the same year. And who all become major and as its turns enduring pop icons in the decades to come. All of them were from the mid-west,two were make and African American and they both operated firmly in the soul/funk crowd before getting pop crossover. Yet another was missing from this '58 baby three headed 80's pop hydra: a dancer/singer/songwriter of an Italian American back round named Madonna Louise Ciccone . After two less then successful singles in 1982,Madonna entered the studio with Mtume guitarist Reggie Lucas to produce her debut album the following year. And with that,an important pop music connection of the decade was complete.<br /><br />  \\"Lucky Star\\"-based heavily around it's strongly funky guitar/bass line has an extremely strong melody and a beat that was perfect for the urban dance club scene of the early/mid 80's. \\"Borderline\\" ups the tempo just a tad bit with a somewhat more major melody but really its a very stripped down song created with different layers of bass keyboards that I personally find even more appealing today. Recognizing the then fading new wave explosion,the pulsing beat,bass synthesizer and glassy rock guitar of \\"Burning Up\\" represents what I believe to be Madonna's debut single-recorded when the new wave style was still at its commercial peak. For a long time I didn't like \\"I Know It\\" at all. But taking away the chirpy voice,though typical of Madonna in this early period,used somewhat to excess on this album, its a nice electronic/dance type update of the early 60's Brill building girl group sound. Jellybean Benitez took over to produce \\"Holiday\\",another stripped down guitar/percussion type dance/funk-pop groove. \\"Think Of Me\\" and \\"Physical Attraction\\" are two highly underrated grooves with a full on electronic type sound whereas \\"Everybody\\" ends the album with another spare electronic type dance groove..<br /><br />  Hearing the bonus tracks in addition to the album,including the guitar free and more synthesizer oriented 12\\" mix of \\"Burning Up\\" one realizes that this album is not exactly a disco album as many claim it to be. I suppose the closest anyone at the time could get was post disco,since in the early 80's the term disco was extremely taboo. Today this music is referred to as boogie funk. The fact that Reggie Lucas,a chief architect of the boogie sound,produces and plays here and Gwen Guthrie,another vocal icon of the genre sings backup, that is no surprise creatively. Madonna's vocals,alternating here from girlish to torchy,actually manage to underscore how strong her songwriting actually is at this point. There might be many naysayers who insist Madonna hogged songwriting credits and had little creative control over this. But hey,its Madonna: she is always far craftier than people give her credit for. As time marches on,I am finding this album equally as creatively satisfying as I do enjoyable. It consists of nothing but uptempo material,strong writing and production that is very funky for something aimed at the dance and pop crowd. Also interesting is that this album wasn't that commercially successful until her second album took off. That's an entirely different story. Still this is truly a debut album to be remembered.nic/dance type update of the early 60's Brill building girl group sound.

B00005J6SZ|5.0|Madonna's self title debut album would eventually go on to spawn three major hits. But that really would'nt happen until after this. Honestly in 1983,she was in a transitional period and so was her respective musical genre. She had no real competition. Suddenly in 1984 there were all these other enormous albums following the transition from the new wave era including [[ASIN:B000002L68 \\"Purple Rain\\"]] and Cyndi Lauper's [[ASIN:B000051Y0G She's So Unusual]]. If my own musical history fantasies have any basis in fact,I have this feeling that Nile Rodgers-shortly after closing down shop with Chic after the failure of their very Madonna-like [[ASIN:B000JVSWE6 Believer]] album had heard the debut album [[ASIN:B00005J6T1 Madonna]] and heard the strong influence of his music with Chic and volunteered to produce her second album. Wikipedia may tell me I have that all backwards. Regardless Nile did produce this album,and both bassist Bernard Edwards and drummer Tony Thompson of Chic play on it as well. Whoever played on it,or whatever the circumstances around this partnership, this is the album that made Madonna the female MTV generation icon she is today.<br /><br />  Of course \\"Material Girl\\" is one of the albums mega hits,but its not actually my favorite song on the album-again a but obviously retro girl groupy. Yet the glassy guitar/bassline does have a mild new wave flavor. The title song is actually quite a lot better musically. The melody is much stronger and the slower dance/funk tempo and heavily arranged synthesized melody gives it a bit more of a tangy flavor. Two of my favorite songs here were actually written by the artist herself-for the most part. \\"Angel\\" is a wonderfully dreamy synth/dance song with an entrancing melody and Madonna singing in her stronger (and most preferable) lower vocal range. Its actually one of my favorite Madonna songs ever actually.  \\"Over And Over\\" is not too far behind it-similar musically but more upbeat melodically. \\"Pretender\\" and the shuffling R&B influenced closer \\"Stay\\" are right in the same league,as is the upbeat synth pop of the hit \\"Dress You Up\\". Madonna gives a tour de force on an updated version of Rose Royce's classic \\"Love Don't Leave Here Anymore\\"-showcasing she is a much stronger singer than most may want to admit. And on \\"Shoo-Bee-Doo\\",the second of my favorite self written pieces by her,is a beautiful played and composed mid tempo contemporary soul ballad.<br /><br />  Extended 12\\" inch dance versions of the title song and \\"Material Girl\\" round this set out-the latter with its more robotic sounding male vocals and added synthesizer accents actually betters the original I think. Somehow Madonna managed to get over commercially with this album that somehow upped the dance/funk ante of her music as well as her pop accessibility. That's a hard balance to achieve. But considering Nile Rodgers' musical savvy and Madonna's own brash confidence, they managed to achieve exactly what Madonna was looking for on this album. Lyrically her trademark wit and tendency to delight in pushing society morality buttons come to the fore here. The title song of course even describes first time romance \\"like a virgin been touched for the very first time\\". Still interesting to imagine teenage \\"Madonna wanna be's\\" singing this on a school ground with no idea what they are actually saying. Especially with what would happen later on,Madonna's image at this point was still (for her anyway) relatively wholesome. Enough so that even Sesame Street did a skit based on her entitled \\"Cereal Girl\\". That is one example of the power Madonna,who had been recording for far less a time than her fellow 80's icons Michael Jackson and Prince,held with the public and those involved in music culture at this point.he shuffling R&B influenced closer \\"Stay\\" are right in the same league,as is the upbeat synth pop of the hit \\"Dress You Up\\".

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book in the trilogy of the Hunger Games was a great read.  I found out about these books from my teenage grandson.

B008133MDK|5.0|I love sherlock in this form.  he is so acerbic...dry and so funny at the same time.  He needs help
B006SV2LWA|4.0|Not the most &#34;exciting&#34; movie experience, watching Contagion is still a brooding what-if meditation on a global viral epidemic whose suspense and fine acting keeps you glued to the screen and wondering, who are the &#34;bad&#34; guys? This is one movie script that doesn't scrimp on posing questions of being responsible. Even then, the bug can get you. Perhaps, Contagion is the most &#34;realistic&#34; depiction of how government medical institutions respond to disasters...deliberate (&#34;slow&#34;), sensitive to public opinion, and, sometimes (in this movie), very effective. If there is any clear &#34;bad guy&#34; in Contagion it's, well, you'll see....
B009WUBERW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, I would definately recommed it to family and friends.  A good action movie with big name stars.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved the ride. Always interesting and worth watching.  Can't wait for another season to begin. I can't imagine where they will go with the story now.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Once again Nicholas Sparks has captured the essence of beauty in people, that there is hope for people who have experienced the worst in war. The story only strengthens our belief in destiny, in the power of lucky charms...something to hold on to when everything else seems hopeless and bleak.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed this book. In some ways it reminded me of Starship Troopers...the novel, not the movie abomination. I was drawn into the story and satisfied with the ending.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My grandson told me to read the three books in the hunger game series.  I enjoyed this second one in the series very much.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|Love Back to the Future. Love Legos. Was pretty excited when this was announced. Great packaging/box art. Not giving it 5 stars cause the DeLorean looks a little boxy. Could have been a little more detailed. Still nice though. Like the idea that you can build it based on all 3 movies. The minifigures are awesome looking. They're the stars of this. Nicely details. Like it comes w/ a skateboard for Marty.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I did not finish this book.  I found it confusing trying to link all the characters together from the start and did not have the patience to read on.  Worse than reading a book on statistics.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|You have to connect the different colored dots without crossing the lines, sort of like a maze.  Challenging and fun.
B00CQW9TR0|4.0|This movie was surprisingly good. The only thing i personally felt could have been better was the in-film music score.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Nice insight into this famous studio and the acts that recorded classic albums there. Also interesting story on the famous Neve console, now in Dave Grohl's home studio.
0312427999|4.0|This book is important because we have no free press and because she makes the strongest case yet for a world wide coup d'etat by multinational corporations who treat govts. as co-conspirators at best and as impediments to be destroyed by any means at worst in the name of what is called laissez faire capitalism which is anything but the hands off working of the free market.  There's no free market here and we are all being victimized in one way or another.  Democracy is an empty shell and the wealth of the world is not going to the most people but to the smallest percentage possible.  This book is really frightening because this so-called philosophy of economics as applied is completely predatory and we are the prey.
B005HSL626|3.0|It's fun because you have to slice the fruit and cut it up in cool shapes.  There is another version of this for the Wii.
B00CKOQC9C|4.0|Sometimes a little flowery ,but otherwise well done. This is a loosely connected group of stories,about Earthlings landing on Mars and how events begin to spin out of control on Earth and Mars. This is a must for everyone's  science fiction collection.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Does a great job of letting me know the status of the battery.<br />God to see the percentage of power left at top of screen.

B004F1F32A|4.0|This movie is non-stop action. I was surprised it turned out to be as good as it was. Some of the stuff was over the top but in a good way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I mean really the updates are cool but the only thing it takes to long to update<br />but I really like
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It was a wonderful book, held my interest, coulldn't put it down! I learned things i did not know, ie....the French Police were so instrumental in the persecution of the Jews.  How awful! The grief that so many went through, so needlessly!  What a tyrant Hitler was! I pray we never see anything like it again, though the radical muslims, Alquida,(sp) seem to be akin in their beliefs of the persecution of women and Christians.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|it's like Photo Shop. Buy it, buy it, buy it, buy it really it's that good. I do not know what else to say about it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really sets the tone for an emersion into the romance and style of the times. Always entertaining and deeply engrossing
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Nice implementation of a classic logic puzzle.  Pleasant graphics and SFX with no invasive permissions.  Good job by the dev!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This is a good game.  Somewhat challenging, but still winnable!  Check it out at Amazon.  I highly recommend it. Hope you like it.
0446693804|5.0|It really &#34;reached me&#34; deep down. I had to put it down in able to finish it. Exhausted when I did finish it.

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love this series and cannot wait for the fourth season.  I am hooked.  I cannot believe how much I have enjoyed this show.
1400049628|4.0|How great for a gift choice for a person who has everything,it's different and I know my brother who I bought it for will enjoy it.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Excellent drama with richly portrayed and interesting characters.  The plot is sophisticated and never predictable with many unexpected twists. I am enjoying it.
140006922X|4.0|This is the first book I ever ordered online the day of its release.  I heard an interview with the author on NPR and was so intrigued I had to read it.  I was raised Roman Catholic, but from the time I was old enough to think for myself I have been suspicious of any organization that claims to have an exclusive line on &#34;truth&#34; and the person who seemed to be the weak link in the chain was Saul of Tarsus (aka St. Paul).  Whenever a fire and brimstone preacher quoted the New Testament to make us feel guilt about our human nature it was usually St. Paul, as opposed to Jesus who was mostly critical of hypocrisy and abuse of power.  Now Reza Aslan has used deep scholarship and an open mind to help me understand the my suspicions were justified.  The book did leave some questions unanswered, but then the author doesn't pretend to know all the answers, only what is documented, what is likely, and what is not likely, such as the idea that a man of no scruples like Pontius Pilate would defend Jesus or that there was ever a policy of releasing prisoners during Passover.  He shows how SOME gospel writers, in attempting to appeal to Gentiles, blamed the Jews for the Roman practice of crucifying its imagined enemies.  I just loaned the book to my still Catholic brother in law who will, I'm sure, make use of the notes in the end of the book that pertain to other scholars opinions, both in agreement with the author and not.  I would give the book 5 stars, but I reserve that for the classics.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a long book that I do not want to end. I thought I knew quite a bit about Lincoln, but reading this has both humanized him and made me see him in an even more awe-inspiring fashion than I already suspected. Well worth the read if you are interested in American history.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Such a great series, so well written and entertaining with a a heart and a mind, and its intelligent too.
B009CG8SIO|4.0|The Game is a ride worth taking, but it asks the viewer to take a leap of faith at the end that is difficult for the viewer to safely make.  But when you think about it, how else would you end the movie?  The film makers had very few options.  The viewer comes way overall satisified if somewhat flabbergasted.
B00992CF6W|3.0|When my son tries going into messaging it shuts down his whole kindle . This has happened multiple times. Any way to fix it?
B000CNESU8|5.0|This movie brought a lot of attention to what media can do, and the power behind it.  Well Done, sad what people can be driven to do however with power.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The plot seemed predictable and maudlin, but the story wound up being just plain delightful. I loved it and was sorry when it was over.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I thank God for our service men and women  who fought this war. The things they have seen Will never go away and will always invade their memories / dreams forever. I'm surprised we don't have more soldiers coming back from this war with PTSD (post traumatic stress disorders)! It is so ironic that his life was lost trying to help his fellow soldiers.<br />dmrisse913@gmail.com
0743527305|5.0|It has been said that this work is on the shelves of almost all behavioral therapists. I can easily promote this as it has already helped thousands of individuals. Dr. Peck has written to an audience consisting of young adults and mature men and women. It probes questions many of us have about life in an easy to understand language. The case studies are reflections of real encounters,true lessons involving social psychology. Please read or listen and judge for youselves. I review the contents from time to time because it can lift me when I search for inspiration. There are so many excellent passages that should be explored. The theme is spiritual growth but science and its dogma are not brushed aside. The two are equally remarkable in the author's eyes and could be heading to a point of conversion.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book kind of explores ideas and emotions which are too deep to put into words but the author does it brilliantly. Good read.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Of course I loved it. I have been watching a version of Star Trek since it began in the 60's. Sure beats most of what is showing of prime time for right now.
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|My nephew absolutely loves this easily recognizable character.<br /><br />Pros: strong vinyl construction for excited toddler dropping and throwing.<br />Nice Large design, about the size of my open adult palm.<br />Good detail and tactile stimulation.<br /><br />Cons: None.<br />Word of caution: Beware potentially thrown hard weighted vinyl toy. Can be quite the missile.<br /><br />Overall: Well constructed detailed sturdy vinyl character. Resilient to toddler play and one of his favorites.
081297381X|5.0|The Black Swan stands out as one of the most entertaining reads I've come across over the past few years. Taleb steps up as a sort of V against an establishment full of people comfortably sitting on their fat bottoms and ideas (both the academics with their sterilized models, and the practitioners with their cluelessness). The more I read the negative reviews on Amazon, the more it seems that people did not get the point.<br /><br />Detractors can invoke all the theory they want: statisticians know this, extensions XYZ have been made to the original model, etc., etc. Bottom line is in today's world there are any number of models, produced in academia and used in day-to-day practice, which are far too disconnected from what actually happens. Most people are too lazy a thinker to realize that this disconnection is happening: academics keep producing tidy papers, practitioners use the software in which these are packaged. And yes, the underlying fundamentals are not originally Taleb's, but who cares? The whole point is that the pitfalls abound everywhere you look in real-world decision making.<br /><br />Extremely recommended to anyone interested in reflecting on the gap between how we assume the world to be, and what it really shows us (in any number of domains). Not an academic source, only a starting point for reflection.

Minus the super powers, some people try to make<br />like the cartoon heroes we grew up with, including names and<br />costumes.<br />A lot of fun.

B00000J048|5.0|Something without a battery, durable, colorful, and easy to use.<br /><br />I bought this item almost a year ago and grandchildren continue to create with it.<br /><br />It is attractive to child's eye with different colors and designs, the gears continue to function well after many little hands playing with them.<br /><br />I noticed a comment about concern for little hands - My two year old grandson and 4 year old granddaughter learned how to use them and while them may have had a finger in gears, little harm comes.  The wheels are not fixed in the pegboard in a way that if a finger is in way much harm can result.  As there is no motor or battery, it is the child turning the gears and they just move the hand or finger is what I noticed.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I really enjoyed Azada. I picked it up when it was the free app of the day and was hooked from the first. I loved the varied mini puzzles and the fact you could earn orbs to skip games that frustrate you. I will def look at other Big Fish games to get and will play Azada again.

It was fascinating both for what transpired while she was in that state and for what happened to her as a result.  She was changed forever, and lifted completely away from her fears and conflicts toward a life of joy.  Wonderful.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Star Trek was the beginning in the 60's of serious science fiction TV series. I watched the first shows as they appeared for the first time on TV & almost 50 years later they are still fun to watch.  Many of the gadgets on the show then are in use today, and many things in the 21st Century are better than imagined by the writers back then. Even by today's standards though it is still far in the future and the possibilities are exciting. I hope younger generations continue to daydream over Star Trek and dare to reach for the stars as it encouraged me to do. I doubt I would have become an aerospace engineer without good science fiction like this to grow up on. Live long and prosper.

B007FRHZ4A|1.0|My 6 year old son recieved this as a birthday gift. At first he was really excited and couldn't wait to play. However, we quickly found out that the structures were way to hard for me even as a parent to build without frustration. The way the bricks were build was not thought out well at all. The deep grooves and non-squared edges may it nearly impossible to play this game. I think the birds, pigs and catapult will end up in the toy box and the rest in the trash. My son has no interest in the game aspect of this anymore.
1909313033|5.0|I've seen Gemma Correll's illustrations on Tumblr and Twitter, and knew they were adorable, but I don't think I was quite prepared for the onslaught of cuteness that assaulted me when I cracked open the first pages of this book. My little monster is quite the gentlepug according to this fine guide to etiquette.<br /><br />I loved this book so much that I actually just bought a copy for a friend of mine with pugs. Buy this book. You won't regret it.

0307476073|1.0|For one thing, you just don't play around with heroin.  So I don't believe she ever took heroin more than maybe once.  Right there, everything else was read with a grain of salt.<br /><br />For another thing, what if someone young reads this and gets the impression that you can take heroin without consequences?  That is really dangerous.  Oprah is stupid for recommending this book.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Great documentary, its people like Dave Grohl who make wonderful music and has one of the most creative minds in the past 25 years. This movie has some of the best music as its soundtracks, I would recommend this to any fan of music doesn't matter which genre.
B00499NHLC|5.0|A modern classic - loved it. The actors are superb and the writing holds up very well.

0143119680|2.0|I was painfully bored with this book.  I'm told the second is much better.  I haven't gotten the nerve to try the second one.  I was really curious about this book and I waited almost a year to read it because I admit...I'm cheap...I like to buy books used.  It seemed like it took forever for &#34;action&#34; to develop.  I guess it was just too slow for &#34;me&#34;.  It was quite a looonnngg book...by the time it got to a level I liked...it was over...I haven't read the second book...not sure if I will.  It appears to be a very popular book...the characters were done pretty well but for me...there was way too much time between &#34;action&#34; scenes.

B00957T6X6|4.0|This is a great saga, full of intrigue and mystery. The plot starts diverging in book 3 as multiple characters spread out across the world created by the author. By middle of book 5 I am getting the sense this divergence is beginning to feel like a frayed rope, I hope GRRM will pull it into a tighter weave in his forthcoming book 6. Please note, the great JRR Tolkein only needed three volumes of Lord of the Rings, it was The Silmarilion that was his undoing. Any plans for a prequel history of Valryia George ;-)

B005LAIIMG|5.0|it's been almost a week since I saw this movie and all I can say is--Wow!. It is still with me even now. I can't get it out of my head! Action, excitement and horror all mixed into one movie with very few contrivances (Except For Israeli Airplane Sequence).<br /><br />This movie now has me wanting to buy the book and I will do that as soon as I complete my other readings. There is not much that I can say except that this movie was a remarkable production! Brad Pitt knows his stuff! I can't believe that there originally were problems with the production and script. In the end I can tell you this movie is a more realistic version of 28 Days Later, and if one has an imagination, an addendum. Buy this movie on DVD and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />A.

0765348780|4.0|Summarizing a novel like Gardens of the Moon is a daunting task (or as Tool would say, \\"futile\\"). Perhaps just as daunting is actually reading it, which is at times obtuse to the point that less patient readers are sure to give up before the first hundred pages have been 'surmounted'.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by the book's length, either, which at first appears standard for epic fantasy. The novel's density is unparalleled in the genre, with a confounding mixture of detailed, but at times obscure prose. In fact, Erikson's writing often eschews exposition in favor of concise descriptions of character and action, with a tendency to ponder the philosophical ramifications of the events and psychologies of his many characters. If you're looking for casual, light reading, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Unlike most works in the epic fantasy canon, Gardens of the Moon begins in the midst of a great conflict between opposing forces, with the Malazan Empire, under the rule of the Empress Laseen, threatening to conquer the remaining cities of the continent of Genabackis. Much of the novel's first half revolves around the siege of the city of Pale and its aftermath, with events in Darujhistan, the last free city, covering the second half. Throughout, readers should expect to have characters, place names, and bits of lore thrown at them at breakneck speed, especially in the first half. Observant readers will find subtle hints as to what's going on, but it's almost a guarantee that nearly every first-time reader will be lost in the layered, complex storytelling at various points. Perseverance, and perhaps even some note-taking is key to enjoying this work to its fullest, as there is little hand-holding to be found here.<br /><br />To describe the storyline as 'complex' would be a great understatement. The plethora of characters, events, histories, perspectives, and lore are such that one could probably choose another fantasy series in its entirety, and find that Gardens of the Moon alone manages to exceed it in terms of detail. Additionally, Erikson takes many of the conventions and tropes associated with the genre, and undermines them in a way that is at times sly, and other times surreal. Even the dreaded deus ex machina device is used to distort our understanding of the world, working simultaneously as a sort of parody. There are also numerous references to other works of literature, ranging from Greek mythology to Vonnegut. Nevertheless, it's easy to see how many could find the novel incomprehensible and pretentious, rather than immersive and 'fun'.<br /><br />You might wonder; 'is it worth the trouble?' Yes, but as with most works in the genre, there are some caveats that need to be observed before taking the plunge, for the waters here are deep. First and foremost is Erikson's prose, which has a flavor that is more 'literary' and less transparent than that of most fantasy authors. There is a grittiness and moral ambiguity here that grounds the characters and action in a way that feels authentic, and is similar to Martin's Ice and Fire novels. Unlike that series' low-magic world, Erikson's is rife with magic, fantastical creatures (many of which are intelligent), gods, demi-gods, and powerful artifacts. Additionally, displays of god-like powers are common, with epic battles being waged by high mages, demons, dragons, and so on. The descriptions of these battles and their scope is impressive to say the least, though I couldn't help but feel at certain points that the novel's sheer ambition seemed to buckle somewhat under its own (incredible) weight. The reasoning for this is elusive, but there were times when the tone of the novel felt inconsistent, as if Erikson's many influences didn't always converge in an agreeable manner. At one moment, for example, we may be experiencing a small, intimate moment with a character as they muse on one of the novels many themes, with a decidedly reserved and mature atmosphere contained therein. Suddenly, within the same chapter, we switch to another character's POV, in which an action sequence or bit of hammy dialogue might undermine said atmosphere, sometimes coming across as a page out of a pulp fantasy novel. The effect is jarring, since there are moments of subtle brilliance sprinkled throughout the text (sections that language geeks will want to mull over in contemplation), followed by the aforementioned 'over-the-top' action scenes. While this phenomenon is not indicative of the novel's entirety, it occurred enough to make the book's many threads at times feel more frayed than refined.<br /><br />Detractors also like to point to the novel's supposed propensity for a large cast of 'shallow' characters, written with minimal characterization. While Erikson doesn't explore his character's psychology to the extent that Martin does (few authors do, in fact), to call them generic would simply be false. Far from being shallow, characters like Paran, Whiskeyjack, Tattersail, Lorn, Crokus, and Kruppe are multifaceted and compelling, with complex motivations that go beyond simplistic good and evil posturing. Again, Erikson relies more on dialogue and action than exposition, leaving readers to interpret the characters and events at their leisure.<br /><br />Gardens of the Moon is surely an acquired taste, whose outright inaccessibility will prove too much of a roadblock for some, but ultimately its greatness lies in its willingness to go beyond the confines of 'ordinary' fantasy. Readers who pay attention to detail and take their time doing so will be rewarded in the end, since despite being the first entry in a ten-book series, it stands admirably on its own. Many of the plot threads and character arcs are wrapped up by the end, with strands leftover for future installments.<br /><br />At times brilliant, frustrating, surreal and bizarre, the novel is, if nothing else, ambitious in scope, style, and theme. It's not without its shortcomings, but thankfully, most of them are simply overwhelmed by its many strengths. It is often compared to other works of 'mature' fantasy, but even having only read the first entry thus far, I am convinced that Erikson's voice is unique, if peculiar. Recommended for patient, detail-oriented readers.

It details how to change things within business organizations, realizing that change is often met with resistance and fear.  The book uses the are you an elephant or a driver throughout the book.

B00CDSIMI4|5.0|The Last of Us, which is easily the most brutal and horrific vision of a post-apocalyptic world (even more-so than Fallout 3) brings us a simple score that is grand in every way. Composer Gustavo Santaolalla, known for his music on Brokeback Mountain and Babel, takes us into the world where Joel and Ellie are struggling to survive in after a viral outbreak, turning some humans into fungal-ridden  monsters that devour living creatures. The game is incredibly violent and depressing, with beautiful scenery and set pieces that most filmmakers would die to capture; the score reflects this world perfectly in all its dark and eerie bleakness. After very intense sequences, or a decision that will leave both Joel and Ellie traumatized, a foul stillness creeps through the air; the music reflects this. Santaolalla wouldn't have been my first choice to score The Last of Us, but I am eternally grateful that he did. His work here is better than both Brokeback Mountain and Babel combined, and sounds similar to Marc Streitenfeld's The Grey, which is the only musical soundtrack I can truly compare this to.  For anyone who listens to video game music, or instrumental/classical music, you must add this to your collection. From the very first track, &#34;The Quarantine Zone&#34;, to the somber sounding &#34;Home&#34;, and the hopeful but mysterious ending &#34;The Path (A New Beginning)&#34;, The Last of Us is a memorable score that will never be forgotten. A Titan among video game scores

B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I read some of the negative reviews, but I tried it anyway.  I'm glad I did, this is a very well done Checkers game.  The graphics are nice and polished and the gameplay is as it should be.  The game looks great and runs great on my 10.1 inch tablet with Android 4.1.2.  This game appears to play by the rules I've always known, so I don't understand all of the complaints about the rules.  After all, it's not like the rules of Checkers are that complex.  The CPU opponents range in skill from 1 to 10, which is nice for any level of Checkers player.  I played a few games on 1, the default, because I hadn't played in years, but I need to try a harder level, I think.  I'm also looking forward to playing two player, once I find an opponent.

B0030B621W|4.0|\\"moon\\" is surprising most of all because it generates interest and plot momentum from what is a very limited opening premise: \\"sam\\" is nearing the end of his three year shift as the only technician supervising a robotic mining operation on the moon. at first the film sets you up to expect a hall of mirrors mental dislocation (three years in solitary with a robot that sounds a lot like kevin spacey can do harsh things to your sanity), but there is a fascinating series of scenes near the middle of the film where that premise is gradually reassembled into something more substantial and ominous. from there the plot is a mystery of clues and unraveling secrets, and finally a stark human choice in the face of painful disillusionment. without risking a spoiler i can say rockwell gives a wide ranging and compelling performance: he held my attention and sympathy throughout. not at all your typical sci fi film, and well worth seeing.

I do suggest that you own this album in one format or another, because it is a great album. I do not suggest picking up this album reissue by &#34;Plain Records&#34;.  This album, along with every other record I have by &#34;Plain Records,&#34; sounds like a poor quality mp3 recording. Don't by vinyl pressings by &#34;Plain Records&#34;, they all sound bad.

B0067R0APK|2.0|I tried this app after the Weather Channel app was revised into a piece of trash and although this one is better, it still has some annoyances.  The lack of a quick multi-day forecast screen is disappointing and having to know the date (instead of Monday, Tuesday, etc.) when looking at upcoming forecasts is simply ridiculous.<br /><br />The maps look fine and there are some other nice features but it's always frustrating when the most basic elements of an app are poorly implemented.<br /> This app is a valid example of that trend in my opinion.  The effort it would take to make it a superb app would be insignificant but it's not there yet.

B0081336FO|5.0|An interesting show for sure. Video and production quality is that of a feature-length film. Each story can be independent, but best viewed in sequence. Well-acted, complex plot that is sol easy to follow. Character motives are easy to surmise. Fast paced and well written to the point where you wouldn't think you're watching a full hour and a half show (no commercials). Enough information is given about each character without blatantly speaking it that you feel immediately attached to each of them as if you've known them for a long time, probably b/c the script doesn't introduce you to characters so much as assumes you already know them already, which lets them reveal more intimate details about the characters than blatantly stating them.<br />While a serious show, there are some moments of comic relief, particularity the relationship between Sherlock and Watson. (personal note: I don't agree with fans (aka fanatics) that force two characters to be together without their consent.)<br />The downside to this series is that each season is only 3 episodes long. Even if you broke each show into 45min segments, that's still only 6. But then, as they say, \\"quality over quantity,\\" and they certainly deliver on quality.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|I always enjoy things British so I did enjoy it, however, I may have expected too much.  There really was not much story here.  I felt the story line was lacking. There could have been so much more.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Filled with charming nostalgia this album seems to be The Beach Boys final album.  If not, all the better, as Brian can still write the songs with the achingly beautiful hooks and I do hope he continues beyond this album.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was a great series and will continue to be one.I feel amazon has presented well and thanks for bringing to the USA.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|As stand alone movies and for people who are not die hard fans of the Star Wars movies.<br />======================================================================<br />This movie trilogy is pretty good - a 8 or 9 out of 10. It has great music (I think John Williams wrote the scores to all three soundtracks - I might be wrong). The special effects are great for the years they were produced (1977,1980,& 1983).<br /><br />Considering that the moves are science fiction and the they were probably marketed towards adolescents when they were produced, they movies actually have a reasonable plot. If you want true drama and plot, then you should look into other movies.<br /><br />For the more dedicated fans...<br />========================<br />I thought the series was a little disappointing. I watched all three movies as they were originally released in the theater. So  I was not impressed with the new CGI effects for the explosion of the Death Star in Episode IV: A New Hope. Also I was disappointed that they inserted Hayden Christensen's image in the final sequence involving Anikin, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Yoda.<br /><br />I only watched the movies, but I don't recall a deleted scenes option when I watched the movie. I think the DVDs I own have this option. I 'm not a big fan of commentaries, So I wasn't impressed with the fact that they were there - in fact, I didn't even listen to them.
0312330537|4.0|This is one I recommend to others.  I bought this for a friend.  Although the ups and downs and adventures the main character has are very intense,  I still laughed and smiled at least every other page.  Its a. Long book, but is divided into three parts so its approachable.  Enjoy!
B005SAP45I|5.0|Cars 2 was a great family movie to watch. I love movies from Disney and Pixar. I rented Cars 2 because I really liked Cars, the first movie.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My wife needed a cable to connect her Kindle to the PC to download books from our library system which could not be downloaded directly. The cable did the job ... no problems and an extra benefit, the cable can now be used to power the Kindle from a USB port at home or in the car.<br />I would also like to give a thumbs up for Prime membership. I was skeptical about signing up for Prime but it is great!  I buy \\"stuff\\" I might not otherwise buy due to shipping cost, but with Prime I don't hesitate. Why buy something for $10.00 and pay $7 shipping!  A no brain'er! Then there are the other benefits like viewing show on my TV !!
B000JIHP88|5.0|This is the second rainforest mobile we have purchased.  The first was for grandchild number one 7 years ago.  The second was for grandchild number three.  It is a great value and both babies loved the animals, music, and lights.  It helped to soothe many nights.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I've only seen the first episode, but when it was over, I looked around. I didn't know where I was for a few seconds, I was that engrossed. Its very fast-paced, engaging, emotionally draining (that's a good thing). The characters are deep, they keep you wondering what their back-story is, and the acting is superb. It did take a little time to get used to David Tenant in this kind of role (after loving him in Dr Who), but after a few minutes he WAS Detective Inspector Alec Hardy. When the episode was over it left me with wanting more, much more.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is one of the better apps I have on my Kindle Fire! I think it is a great app for all ages. I had a lot of problems the first time I downloaded it on my smartphone it crashed and I had to delete it, but after I got my Kindle and downloaded it I have had no problems with it at all, in fact it has been problem free!!! I recommend it for everyone it is a lot of fun!! I play it several times a day, everyday. I guess you could say I am drawn to it like white on rice. THANK YOU ALL!!!
B003E74B24|5.0|What a great insight I have gotten from this magnificent read!!!!  Gordon is not just a great chef but writes from his heart and I look forward to the next autobiography he write.  I wish I had a better<br /><br />means to cook as my mom and I live very simple and I so love to cook.  Thanks again, Gordon, for entertaining my life.  You are an amazing man!  Bravo!!!
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|Fabulous movie, keeps you on the edge of your seat!  This original is much better than any other psycho movies produced after it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This new version is horrible,very difficult to get to the information you are looking for. You need to go through several hoops just to see a forecast for the next day.ridiculous
B00785P2QC|5.0|when play this game for a time waster you could play all day but theres way to much adds so if you don't have a facbook you cant complete challenges
B003O86FMW|5.0|I luv this book so  much ok think this is the best one there ever made I can't wait for the movie
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|I like this app because it comes in handy when I don't have a piece of paper handy while I am out.
B002RRWWQ4|5.0|...And I think it was done well, regarding the film itself; I think it handled all of the much darker subject matter tastefully, while not completely abandoning its charming beginnings.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Good for getting the brain in gear.  I think this version is a bit friendlier than the original.  Try Oz for even more fun!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It just did not work for me because the way the entire thing just worked was confusing and UN usable for me
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|In this 1990 true film adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's 'Wiseguys\\", director Martin Scorsese takes us on a wild ride through Henry Hill's life mainly from Hill's point of view starting in the 1950's. Ray Liotta is excellent as Henry Hill, an aspiring young hustler starting out making good in his neighborhood fast lane gang and seemingly riding high with the infamous Lucchese crime family. Eventually Hill's and the \\"family's\\" ride ends in numerous deaths and prison sentences when Hill turn's into and FBI informant in 1980.<br /><br />Scorsese could not have picked a better cast in Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco as Karen, Henry's beleaguered wife. The cinematography is fantastic and the music practically makes the movie.<br /><br />It's a fascinating point of view look at what happens to hoodlums as a result of their own self destructive indulgence and arrogance and that there may be real truth to the saying that \\"there is no such thing as a free lunch\\".<br /><br />PWN
B009KG7EOK|4.0|It's like the old TV series - lots of stars, wink wink at their most memorable characters, bad guys get what they deserve. Enjoy it for what it is.
B0063IH60K|5.0|really fun when you only have your Kindle to keep you company.<br />less boring than Tic Tac Toe, for sure!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game within an hour I went level 12...my only wish is that I would get more coins.....  highly addictive
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. Challenging but too short. Not enough levels  not for the colorblind or profoundly stupid.  Waiting for more levels
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game is great. It has very good graphics, a good repeat value and some hard levels deep in the game.<br /><br />What makes my blood boil is the ignorant folks who say you have to be online to play... Guess what, you don't. You might have to be online to DL the game, but that's it.<br /><br />Giving an awesome game one stars because of your ignorance is borderline re tarded.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it so fun and addicting but it does freeze sometimes so I have to restart my kindle but other than that it is a great app.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very well written.  Obviously heavy sexual content, but extreemly well written.  You can feel the emotion of the characters.  Easy to read.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This is a truly fascinating look at the music biz from a musicians perspective. A joy to watch. It reminded me of why I became a musician.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|This is just an excellent and well done film, well acted and excellent special effects for the time. It's a must see film
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|It was exactly what I wanted it fit my camera perfectly and I have lots of pictures to show from my vacation.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded this game for my girls to play on my kindle fire . It downloaded but when I open it to try and play it just keeps saying \\"Loading\\" and nothing happens . I have tried too many times and finally gave up .
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook I talk on it all the time it is my contact to my friends because I'm only 14
B005YDLJ76|5.0|ANYONE WHO IS A BEYONCE FAN WILL LOVE THIS DVD. I FIND MYSELF WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER.I RECOMMEND IT.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing. It took me on am emotional rollercoaster that only went up and I loved it. I would gladly read any book by John.
B002AWX6UM|4.0|I'm not into these sort oh books but it was truly inspiring, eye opening, and saddening. It gives you a new perspective on life and how drastically different it is from your childhood.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Interesting but not terribly original concept. It probably would have been better as a short story. As some other reviews have noted, there is way, way too much filler material. The treks up and down the silo are monotonous, tedious, and for the most part entirely skipable. I'm a huge Peter Hamilton fan, and he is known for the length of his books and the often overly described scene setups he uses. But they at least make you feel like you are there...part of the story yourself. This is just repetitive filler that is at times painful to get through and it never really gives you any sense of immersion.<br /><br />I'm not sure what some of these other reviewers read, but character development is almost nonexistent. 5,count them 5 books and at the end you still know next to nothing about the characters other than what's happening in real time. There are hints of the existence of backgrounds, but we're never told anything that makes you feel anything for anyone.<br /><br />The ending is so predictable that the only reason I kept reading until the end is that I thought for sure there must be some kind of twist. Sadly I was mistaken.<br /><br />On the positive side, it's an easy read grammar and spelling wise compared to most  books in the same price range. That's really about the best thing can say about it.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Love this show!  Wonderful characters!  Great plot lines and I mostly love the humor.  Will be ordering more seasons on DVD!!!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|This is a great free game for anyone who is bored and wants to have some hack and slash action the biggest flaw I have seen so far is there is no character customization like no new classes or races witch is a big part to most fantasy rpgs so I feel that takes a lot of my own experience out of the game. I hope this review will help you
B0069GRIHW|5.0|L.A. Woman is my favorite song, though the Changeling is an underrated song;  just consider the intensity of Morrison's singing.  Chills every time.
B006QPX7UI|1.0|I wanted to download this movie to my ipad to be viewed offline when traveling.  I believe it is possible, but Amazon offers no direction or provides an accessible place to get information.  I couldn't even cancel the movie.<br />August 18, 2013<br />Amazon did get back to me and the problem was solved.  Their service representatives were excellent.  The difficulty is discovering how to get in touch with them.
0802798225|4.0|I really loved this book. It was such a cute story about an unlikely pair falling in love. This book is packed with emotions and almost had me crying at one point. The only thing that fell a little short was Alex's drool factor. I think he was just a little too rough around the edges for my taste, but overall I really enjoyed his character. This book definitely reinforced how much of a huge fan of Simone Elkeles I am!
B0024FAR5W|5.0|At our house, we enjoy watching Sons of Anarchy and so purchased a Season 1 (Blu-ray) DVD as a gift for someone we thought would also enjoy the series.
B006BQNJR8|3.0|It's Conan, so anyone looking for deep, meaningful drama = not your movie. I thought it was way better action than the arnold Conan from years ago. Mamoa is great with the action, body-type etc. Thought maybe there could be better depth in writing for all characters..but I thought it was entertaining.
B004BSAEQC|3.0|I picked this up mostly on the strength of &#34;Moment for Life&#34; and &#34;Superbass.&#34;  In retrospect, I probably should have just bought those two singles.  Many of the other songs are harsher or else forgettable.  Minaj has great talent, but I think the album is just a dying art form.
B00002N9ER|5.0|yes great product for wherever you need to keep control of 4-6 cell 'D' type maglite in place great for car truck mounting. nice
B00377Z0Y4|4.0|If you like Jethro Tull, there are no surprises here and you'll enjoy the album.  If you find flutes annoying, skip it.  If you don't know the band Jethro Tull, or only know &#34;Aqualung&#34; and &#34;Locomotive Breath,&#34; this is not likely the album to start with.  Jethro Tull has always maintained a balance between &#34;rock&#34; and &#34;folk,&#34; and this one moves heavily towards &#34;folk,&#34; as most of the songs are pretty mellow and...well, Christmas-y.  For me, that is perfectly pleasant (my favorite album is &#34;Song from the Woods&#34;), and this is my favorite Christmas album ever.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|***** UPDATE to my previous 1-star rating and review.<br />The Amazon search engine apparently has this book listed under Christian Fiction, even though the author never did so.  I find this to be a strange and unfair practice by Amazon, as this will inevitably lead to poor and unfair ratings for the author.  My rating would have been a 3-star had I NOT been searching for Christian fiction for my mother.  Therefore, I'm hoping Amazon will allow this rating change.<br /><br />Also, the 2nd book in this series does show somewhat better editing, 'though if I had her editor I'd send him/her to Writing Boot Camp. :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an interesting, new dystopia, joining a long and venerable tradition.  Fortunately, she also avoids many of the downfalls of others by giving us believable characters and the real psychological effects of this kind of violence and trauma.  I highly recommend it.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|The song sounds so good. You really should listen to it on high quality speakers or headphones. It sounds even better.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is very cool to play. I'm on level 9 it is very awesome.<br />what level are you on. bye
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Red is fun. Not much plot but a lot of fun watching old favorites work together once again. Well worth the price.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are good books written every day. Books that are sweet. Witty. Happy. Sad. There are even books that get you thinking about things that you don't typically think of. I really like those kind. But best of all, there are these rare books that take you to another world that makes you feel like you're experiencing something special. Like it is some undeniably spectacular moment in time that you are blessed to be of the few who experience it. This is one of them that is worthy of all, and more. Okay, okay.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|pretty cool app. takes out files left after an uninstall. makes kindle run better. fl and try for yourself today
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|big checkers buff i can see hours of fun with this app. Was a great player when i was young and soon saw i still was.
B00CJGP116|3.0|I did listen to the samples from this CD on Amazon and thought I'd like this more than I do.  It just seems to me that the different songs sound somewhat alike, but maybe that's just me.  Overall, for me it's just ok!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the mods and the updates and the adventure maps they are really FUN! But that's not it it's most of the building I built a machin  on pe and it worked!!!!.
0399160744|5.0|My friend and I had seen this artist before and so I bought it for her for a gift it's fantastic!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was an exceptional look at compassion in combat. Most of the books I've read concerning WWII are told from the American and British point of views. All Germans have been lumped into the Nazi category. It was nice to read about honor and compassion within the ranks of Germany's greatest pilots. Be sure to go to the Author's website and see the video after you read it. It will do your heart a service.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|5 stars all the way. Once I start to play this game it is hard to put it down.  Awesome!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great writing and acting. Love the storyline. I'm already watching Season 3 and can't get enough! Thank goodness I have Amazon Prime and can keep streaming.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|5 stars all the way. Once I start to play this game it is hard to put it down.  Awesome!
B008GJV8BW|2.0|Why are you asking me to review a purchase.  I Just watched part of it as free viewing as a part of my Prime membership.  Hope I am not being charged a &#34;premium&#34; for this!!
B005OCFGTO|4.0|My daughter requested a set of the Harry Potter movies for her birthday.  She was not looking for anything fancy -- no collector item type sets, she didn't need any of the many &#34;extras.&#34;  She just wanted the movies.  And that is what she got with this reasonably priced set.  Only (small) complaint was that the case for the DVDs was a little broken on the inside. Didn't affect the movies at all, but it did make it a little less than worth a 5 star rating.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Matthew McConaughey's best performance to date & the young male actor was wonderful - but, it was as slow as the Alabama Delta!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Good rapport between actors, but not quite as good as &#34;White Collar&#34;.  Luis is a stitch, likable, but then not.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Its a good show, but I had forgotten that I saw it a couple of years ago.  the acting and comedy were good.<br /><br />SharonJoy
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is My daughter's favorite game - let's her use her imagination! She says it is Awesome! She's 10 years old.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|I've been a fan of Kanye since day one. However, this album does nothing for me. He's always have been a little on the \\"weird\\" side, but that characteristic alone is what makes him \\"KANYE.\\" Every one of his previous albums have had at least one track that stood out and I enjoyed, but I cannot say that about this one. So disappointed...
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find myself playing this game all the time and I love playing it.  Soooo much fun but beware the time really passes the time by quickly.
B00136Q342|5.0|One can hear that Mr. Cash savored this performance.  And this is 1968 when Rock ruled the charts. Nonetheless, this album was a huge hit.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this when I attend Church Service on Sunday.  It is more convenient than carrying the traditional Bible Book.  Also, it works better for my aging eyes.  I love it.
055358202X|4.0|There is several problems with this book. That most everyone has already covered on the reviews here. My problem is iv invested so much time in these books. that id hate not knowing how it ends. Which seems to me that its not going to end anytime soon. since he's bringing so many new characters in to play so far along..im just hoping for his fans sake. That George R.R. martin wraps the story up so that us (the fans) are not left disappointed. however if you have came this far I wouldn't recommend just stopping your reading.
1579128955|5.0|I purchased this book for my son when he was 8 years old and it is about worn out now. This is actually the 2nd copy - the first one was taken to school and lost... tears and pleading resulted in a replacement. This is a favorite book. Not just one to be looked at and then put on the shelf, this has been read, reread, and then read again.<br /><br />The images are artistic, sharp, and clear with descriptions of the elements including symbols and atomic weight, and the way the elements work intermixed with stories and humor. Each page includes an image of the raw element and several things that are made out of it. I think the humor is part of what engages my son so much, but even my mother found herself leafing through it several times when she was here. I've read it several times as well.<br /><br />One of the main things my son says is that no matter how many times he has read it through, he learns something completely new. He's reading it right now actually.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the periodic table. This would make an excellent teaching guide. The hardbound makes a great coffee table book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is such a fun game its very challenging and keeps me preoccupied and wanting more!! Way better than Temple Run.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|I could watch this film every week. Gwyneth Paltrow is lovely and charming. It's a movie i watch when I want to watch something to just feel good.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome just awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />  It's so addictive just awesome fun fun fun sweet great cool  good the best  fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It love this game! I can't wait for a newer version to come out... I like the reality of the horse. It would be better if I had control of the horse.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been playing minecraft for a while now and have figured out how to update your amazing game, just go to the app store and look up minecraft pocket edition, then tap update and five minutes later you have an update!!! Or it will update automatically if you are connected to internet
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing this game when I was t to wind down. It's really great when that last card finds its place.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is a well told parable of the challenges of IT operations and a model of optimization. I highly recommend it.
B00007KWHG|5.0|THERE IS NOBODY LIKE FRANKIE VALLI! I HAVE AN OLD CASSETTE THAT I MADE OF HIS SONGS WAY BEFORE CD'S WERE EVEN HEARD OF. SO I TREATED MYSELF TO THIS CD. BOY I AM SO GLAD. THIS CD IS THE BEES KNEES!! HAHA! I AM AFRAID OF WEARING IT OUT. THIS IS FANTASTIC!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a real page turner. It definitely lived up to the excitement of the first book. I just hope they do the book justice when they do the movie, which they are working on.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game there are so many types of cool animals you can get I totally would recommend this app
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This works great on my Kindle Fire 1st generation. An excellent strategy game and never the same twice. I've come to hate Greenland though as it is so hard to infect!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This movie was entertaining and ok to watch. I really don't have anything to say about this movie just wanted..
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a very challenging and entertaining game. I can't seem to put it down! Must stop so I can get some other things done! Samsung Galaxy S4
B006VREHRS|5.0|I can't just watch a few episodes, its that good. The plot is brilliant and the actors/actresses do a great job with thier characters.
B008OOYALE|1.0|So, while I found the game to be initially fun, I eventually found it extremely frustrating. Why? Because it has a glitch when connecting to Team Lava's server, as they describe as the following after being contacted (yes, these are the company's words)...&#34;This can sometimes occur due to a &#34;Sync Error&#34;. When this happens, you may notice your coins disappearing, items you just bought or crafted may appear to be lost, or you may lose Collectables you just picked up. This usually happens because your game has reverted a couple minutes back to a previous save of your progress.<br /><br />As a temporary workaround, we recommend that you first restart the game before resuming play on your device. This can be done by restarting your device, or manually stopping the app.<br /><br />After you've done this, please restart the app. Your game should be displaying the correct progress now.<br />Unfortunately, we are unable to restore any lost coins, items, or collectables during Sync Errors.&#34;<br /><br />SOOO THIS MEANS, the game app creators are aware of the issue...oh, AND WON'T GIVE YOU ANY MONEY BACK, WHICH THEY LITERALLY STOLE BECAUSE OF A COMMON GLITCH!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />DON'T BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE A TON OF MONEY!!!!<br /><br />Team Lava, you suck! Seriously, you should be charged with theft. Hmmmm, there's a thought ...lawsuit or class action anyone?
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great nice game like it lots it is a good game I like it a lot fun to play<br />Real good game.  Good to play blah naw
B005LAIH2M|1.0|I am glad I did not see this at the movies. It was kinda....hmmmmmmmm....let me see......I did over pay for it....don't waste you time
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A higher calling shows both sides of a terrible war.  Wars are always started by the politicians not the man in the street.  However when you are called to defend your nation's ideals, you have to go.  In the case of the M 109 pilot Stigler, his was compulsory where anything less than full compliance was execution.  Both sides prayed to the same God, loved, lived, had family and friends all who suffered from their losses.  I would recommend this book on a social level of WWII.  Forget the battles and glory, this is the real story, the story of people caught in the crossfire.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Pros:  Great for Netflix and YouTube viewing.  Clean image, no lagging.  Easy to set up.  Nice small form design.  Portability excellent.  Good price point.<br /><br />Cons:  Google Play Music does not stay connected once you select a song to play.  Chromecast software not available for Kindle Fire Hd so no casting from that device.  Browser function only works via PC, not via mobile device.  Casting video via PC is lousy (lip-syncing off, etc), as the software allowing PC casting is still in Beta testing mode.  Availability (as of this writing).<br /><br />Overall, the device shows a lot of promise.  Once more content developers get on board (Hulu, Amazon Prime, Pandora, etc), this product will shine.  If you need Netflix or YouTube access while travelling, this product is perfect as long as you have a good WiFi connection. You will not be able to browse the Net unless you have a newer PC or Laptop with you running the most recent OS.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Coolest game ever. Played for about a minute and already have the guy next to Jake, the one with the mask. In short words, awesome game.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I have not yet seen this movie and had no idea what the book was about. Very original. Overall a compelling story. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c the beginning is a bit slow. As I read farther into the book, I realized it was necessary back story. Be prepared for an ending that does not give complete closure. It is a satisfying ending, just not neat and tidy.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Swipe down to see menu then click on the more tab. Then select device. Then you will see a setting that reads “Allow installation of apps from unknown sources\\". Set that to on. Open browser and go to [...]. You will see the game and get it from there. It works very well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. Fun for any age. Time flies while playing. Can't beat the price. Stop reading, start playing.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is so adorable I love it and so do my 12 girls i play it on occasions my daughter's absolutely love it thank you gameloft

0062255657|5.0|I have been writing reviews for such a long time now. I almost always try to write a review that is detailed, concise and balanced. As I sit here, I feel extremely lost; stuck for words on how I can best write a review of this very strange, but very brilliant book. This is the very first Neil Gaiman book I've read, but I've heard he is extremely popular and more often than not, his books go on to sell millions. In fact after looking the book up just now, this book, The Ocean at the End of the Lane debuted at the top spot on the New York Times Bestsellers list.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane tells the story of a man who leaves a funeral, back to the place where he grew up. There, he meets a woman he once knew, but can't quite remember how and why? Upon staring and reflecting upon the duck pond in the back garden, he starts to remember his life when he was seven. He starts to recall the events when he and his friend, Lettie Hempstock who lived on the farm at the end of the lane, banished a supernatural entity back whence it came.<br /><br />Being brought into the world by the suicide of a lodger, the evil takes on the form of a new babysitter - Ursula Monkton, who begins to antagonise and scare our protagonist, yet also `give' everybody else exactly what they have always `wanted'. With the help of Lettie's mother and grandmother, the man's seven year old self and his friend take on the monster, as well as other scary horrors that present themselves.<br /><br />I found it extremely hard to classify this book. Children's story? Adult? Fantasy? Contemporary? And I still find it hard now. For this is a book that can be read on so many levels. At its core, I think it is a complicated story about life, the unknown and sacrifice. It uses the unknown as a sort of fantasy, so I guess it will suit fantasy fans, as well as readers who dislike epic fantasy. And did I mention nostalgic? It seems to conjure up your own memories as you read.<br /><br />And to sum up this book, you could very well say that it is clever, very clever indeed. For the innocence and naivety of a child is questioned, and tested too. It takes the surreal and intangible and tries to give it form. We can easily relate to the boy in the story, and we ask the same questions he does. But he has Lettie and her family, and although they may not answer his questions, they certainly know what they are doing. And I loved how wise they came across, for `the oldest can remember the Big Bang.' In fact all of the Hempstocks are brilliantly imagined, and it is Lettie who our protagonist looks up to, and turns to for help. It's a beautiful relationship, one built on safety and understanding.<br /><br />Gaiman's writing is compelling and full of heart. I found the lengthy sentences Neil Gaimanand the simple nature of it to be very fitting of the seven year old lead. And when I say compelling, I truly mean compelling. yet it is quite hard to say why. I found myself picking up the book and reading further any spare moment I had, whether it be the time it took me walk down the stairs, boil the kettle, even take the bins out. And surely that explains my point exactly. Although, I did find the slight repetition a little frustrating.<br /><br />One of the themes I loved in this book was how when we become adults, we lose that little bit of magic, that adventure, that understanding that only children seem to latch on to. As Gaiman effectively tell us - adults will follow the path exactly, whereas children will form their own path, look for the secret gap in the fence. And this is what this book is all about, discovering your childhood to seek your own identity.<br /><br />The story did slow a bit in the middle, but I loved the references to the stories our seven year old lead took solace in, which links to our own connection with the story. I also felt the rather `adult' bits of the story were a little odd - the unnerving sex scene, although I understood the reasoning behind this, even though it may not of been made clear - for how can a seven year old really understand?<br /><br />This book is magical, it has multiple messages throughout and will undoubtedly pull on your heartstrings, because I have to admit, as I read the last chapter and epilogue, I felt myself utterly at mercy to the story. It's a little story, but full of character. I loved the abstract approach at exploring the dark nature of things, and if you want to read a story that is original, different and utterly complex in such an understated way, then throw caution to the wind and have a stab at this. I promise you, you won't regret it. And you'll be rushing to give a second read through, to pick up on all of the charming nuances.
B00DL47RQ2|4.0|Woody Allen, now 77, has been on a hot streak in recent years with excellent movies like last year's \\"To Rome With Love\\", 2011's \\"Midnight in Paris\\", 2010's \\"You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger\\", and 2008's \\"Vicky Christina Barcelona\\". Now comes his latest movie.<br /><br />\\"Blue Jasmine\\" (2013 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Jasmine (played by Cate Blanchett). As the movie opens, we see her arriving in San Francisco, moving in with her sister Ginger (played by Sally Hawkins). We soon learn that Jasmine is on the 'rebound'. The movie from there on intercuts between flashbacks of Jasmine's previous glitzy life in New York with her husband (played by Alec Baldwin) and how Jasmine is adopting to living with her sister. To tell you much more about the story would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several comments: first, writer-director Woody Allen is ageing like a good wine and in the last 5-6 years seems to have found a second (or is that third? or fourth?) wind in his career. Second, this movie bursts at the seams with outstanding acting performances. Yes, Cate Blanchett is getting a lot of press and Oscar buzz with her brilliant performance of tormented Jasmine, as well she should. But there are lots of other notables, for starters Sally Hawkins, an English actress whom I had seen before in a couple of movies (including \\"An Education\\") but for the first time really blew me away in her role as the insecure younger sister. Then there is Bobby Cannavale as Chili, the hot-headed boyfriend of Ginger. in an equally surprising role. And how about Peter Sarsgaard, this time in a very much restrained role as Dwight, Jasmine's possible next husband. As it happens, I just saw Sarsgaard earlier this week in another movie, \\"Lovelace\\", in a head-turning role that couldn't be further away from his role here.<br /><br />If it sounds like I am gushing about this movie, I am. This is one of the very best movies of the year for me so far, right up there with \\"Frances Ha\\" (I imagine Cate Blanchett and Greta Gerwig will be duking it out for the Best Actress Oscar). Woody Allen, never one to rest on his laurels, is already shooting his next movie (set in Southern France), set to be released in '14. The screening I saw \\"Blue Jasmine\\" at today at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati was PACKED, and this movie has all the makings of a runaway hit on the art-house theatre circuit. If it wasn't clear yet, \\"Blue Jasmine\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!vies of the year for me so far, right up there with \\"Frances Ha\\" (I imagine Cate Blanchett and Greta Gerwig will be duking it out for the Best Actress Oscar).

B005GY0Y8S|2.0|my first book on the kindle....just chose this at random...not good writing nor good twist for the ending<br />of France
B005BGBPBG|4.0|I would have liked a bit more romance at the end, it was entertaining.  Colin is a smoking hot-but doesn't seem to know it leading man.  Love Ginnifer Goodwin, not quite sure I buy her as the &#34;plain Jane&#34;, serious type.  She is luminous.  Kate Hudson plays her part well.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Out-freekin'-standing! Okay, a little cliche maybe, but it fits. I'm not prepared to give you a track by track audiophile synopsis of this masterpiece.  What I am going to attempt and convey to my fellow rockers is the feel and flavor of \\"13\\". Its vibe totally takes me back to my misspent youth, when Sabbath was new and fresh. \\"13\\" gives the fan the sense of the \\"way back when\\", all the while the sounds are new, fresh and driven. Tony Iommi really explodes into his role as \\"riff meister\\" yet again; bringing all that his time playing has produced, and now taking what he created and bringing it forward, while not forgetting his past. Ozzie's vocals are something the original band fans are going to enjoy, no matter how thrashed they have become with all the abuse. Geezer's bass work is timeless and heavy as always, you can't play Black Sabbath without his bass work as a foundation stone. Speaking of solid foundations, the drumming was good and solid, the fact that it was not Bill Ward is a bummer, but Brad Wilk is no slouch when working them bones! Getting Ward's drumming on this would have been the final touch, but nothing is ever perfect in this fractured world these days.<br /><br />In short, I find \\"13\\" to be a strong work with the definite feel of early Sabbath, while embracing where \\"metal\\" has gone since these guys created it all those years ago. Oh, by the by, the track \\"Damaged Soul\\", has some of the coolest harmonica work I've heard in ages; adding a bluesy felling of despair to the track. All in all, I am very jazzed that all the issues were put aside, and this album got made; it's killer!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|More than just a puff piece, director Soderberg (sp?) captivates while ent..ertaining the eyes.  Those men are certainly worthy of screen time! So caliente
B000J5XS3C|3.0|There are a couple of features that I don't like, and one of them is that it doesn't have an on/off power switch, and you have to either unplug it or connect it to a power strip that you can turn on and off. Also. the power adapter is connected by a six pin connection, so if something happens to it, you have to replace it. In other words, you can't just use a power adapter adapter that you have or can buy anywhere. You have to buy one like the one it comes with. I have done a few recordings with it, and it works well for me. I am not a specialist in this area, but it sounds good to me. I like being able to turn the knobs this way and that way to adjust the sound. There are a lot of them to play around with, which I think is cool. One more thing, just like one of the reviews I read says, it doesn't sit flat on a level surface, which I find odd. Well, It's cheap, so perhaps that explains why.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used many weather apps over many years. All apps have little nuances that make the apps incomplete. This app is no exception but the apps itself is the best I've ever come across. Let me explain a little more in detail. The apps it self is 2nd to none. The server is the problem. There are small errors in the way it accesses the servers at Accuweather. The accuracy of this little app is incredible and the mapping weather updating live is very good. Unlike Weather channel.com this app is much more advanced in predicting the weather. I have used Weather channels app for many years as well as to name a few like Weather Bug and Weather Exchange as well as the USEtoday and Cnn weather. I give this a 5 star for one reason. It does what it was intended to do. Routing to the server could be part of the problem, because i have noticed loading the app itself for the maps section is when it really gets slow. In all due respect to the company, i can not find a better app and that si why this one is without a doubt the best.

140006922X|5.0|This book should be of interest to anyone concerned with the history of western culture. It is extremely well-researched and well-written, and is an unbiased account by a Muslim author.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I downloaded this to my Samsung Galaxy S Tab 2, and it works really well. Very intuitive and easy menus to navigate and a lot of editing options as well. It would be nice to have more font choices for text, but overall very pleased.
1451668945|4.0|Maybe an overabundance of characters to absorb, but ala MHC it moves and keeps you turning pages with surprises. Great.
1439127700|5.0|WOW, what a compilation of facts and information!!  I had to buy the book, this is a keeper for future reference.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|My spouse was worried about what to do with her old slides and reviews of some of the units on line were not good.  This met all expectations at the right price.  Just be sure to get an SD card if you don't have a spare around the house.  Pop the card in, scanning is easy and before you know it your old memories will be digital.  The instructions are good enough to get you started, although I wrote a simple step by step for my spouse to deal with her specific tasks.  The quality is good so long as the slides are clean or you clean them gently.  The flip or mirror functions work.  Our computer is set up for SD cards - if yours is not you might get the SD to USB adaptor from Amazon, cheap.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This is the most practical, generous advice I have ever come across about the creative process. It's elegant in its simplicity and wisdom as Kleon lays out a navigable way out of the artistic doldrums.He is someone who has obviously been there and back, and the nuggets of treasure he's packed into this little wonder WILL inspire you to get off your butt to make things, whether it's a painting, a screenplay or a business plan.
B007WV05GY|5.0|This was a really good movie with wolves and stuff. I was a little disappointed though. I thought it was a Lord of the Rings spin off.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I've seen this book many times on bookstore shelves and it drew me to it until I finally bought it here.  It's not at all what I expected...in fact, better.  Three generations were impacted by what a father and son found on this isolated island, a small, strange community and a seemingly abandoned mansion.  Loved it.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I can understand why Amazon made the first episode free. I really wanted to know who had done it. I was surprised and I am excited to see the new season.

B004UNX1LS|2.0|Don't get this app. It's slow to load. Also I don't like the results it gave me when I searched something.

B0013D69YE|5.0|i bought this album when it orginially came out and lost it over the years. had to buy it again-and it's just as great as i remember
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|SGU's fans sincerely hope that directors, producers or someone within the industry finally come to the conclusion that a NEXT SEASON is absolutely necessary.  The sooner the better!!!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I never heard of this movie until my wife made me search for it on our streaming services.  Out of the gate, it seemed edgy and I thought it might be a depressing drama.  I wasn't in the mood for a tear-jerker or a wild ride through misery and misfortune.  That impression was way off, but the edgy start did get me engaged in a hurry.  The characters are well-played, and you feel their emotions.  Special effects played no role -- how refreshing!  Here is a movie that pulls you in and carries you along based on the human story.  I loved it!<br /><br />It is a crazy romance, among other things.  'nuff said.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Wow what a movie for me to. But for real this guy wow what a movie love it and can not say any thing els
B000QY9WOU|5.0|I loved the show but i find it very hard to understand her when she sings. She puts on a great show..
B00D8RYV52|2.0|I wish I would have listened to the other reviews. Not worth buying. The other ones are better. Worst of the bunch.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I loved seeing all the marvel characters come together for this movie. It was great fun for me to watch.
B00371QQ34|4.0|Very good movie, full of twists and turns. Worth watching over from time to time. Both actors did a great job portraying the parts they played.
030758836X|5.0|This is one of those books that was impossible to put down! The story was very well told and I highly recommend it!
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|My daughter wanted to see this so I was up for it. Glad I was, since now I know what she is all about. Cannot believe the # of performances involved in a tour. Very hard on relationships.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Plot was all over the place.  Can't believe Channing Tatum came back for this mess.  What was the point of bruce willis' character?  The first movie was better.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|To me, this was going to be the movie of the summer. Alas, Pitt decided to rewrite the entire last 3rd of the film to make it \\"family friendly\\". So a promising beginning ends up with a feel good ending that has more holes than a made for TV movie (the original ending was much darker and MUCH truer to the zombie canon). Pitt was an artistic coward, and in the name of \\"family\\" chose to neuter this film down to an enjoyable but seriously flawed action picture that happens to have zombies. Perhaps the unrated version will at least show us a zombie actually killing someone instead of just running around aimlessly.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Was all set to leave a 2-star review, given the game's over-emphasis on in-app purchases. However, a recent update (which also included a new level, El Macho's Lair) has dialed back the necessity of either IAP  or Facebook spamming to advance in the game.<br /><br />It's a fun game with a good flavor of Despicable Me. Difficulty ramps well as you run.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and could not wait for the third book! The characters are great and the story line was entertaining.  I hope there is a fourth book and look forward to Gideon & Eva's journey.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A great game for everyone! Everyone should try this game. It's fun for kids and adults. The graphics are great and minions are funny!

B0084B1T8Y|2.0|I didn't really like it. This book was confusing and boring. I liked the white seal though. Otherwise I didn't like it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Although I was disappointed with some of Season 7, Season 8 more than made up for it. It was refreshing, exciting and kept me wishing the new episodes ran twice a week. I can hardly wait to see what Season 9 brings. I love Sam and Dean and hope Benny and even Bobby make some appearances in the new season. This show is my favorite.
B008M721MS|3.0|My rating is only three stars.  I like because I can make call to my family. I dislike because the video Icon does NOT appear any where so I can NOT make video calls.  Thank you.

B0059DQHHI|4.0|Mads Mikkelsen is superb, as always, and is backed up by an excellent cast. The plot kept us interested and curious all the way throughout. The Danish countryside is beautiful and the cinematography did it justice. I highly recommend this film.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun for everybody. I love it and littler ones will to. overall great game and very fun.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Good game but to short. They should have waited till they had more levals to create the game. Overall though good game. If you liked the first one then you should get this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am so happy my cousin showed me this game.  I spend hours every day playing it. I love it.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Love pinterest. Initially the app worked fine. Now, even after reloading several times, it will no longer accept a pin. First my boards would not pull up and the app would shut down. Now the boards pull up but cannot pin anyway
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Recommended by author Catherine McKenzie, Me Before You is an excellent read. I vote it best novel of my summer.
B008KRBTU0|5.0|After having great success with the original Spot It set in my ESL classroom, I purchased a few other versions. They are totally indispensable to my collection of games! Spot It Basic English is really excellent for my beginning students, as they are able to connect simple words with images. This game never fails to engage my students and works wonderfully whether they are a pair or a whole table (up to 6 or so). One of my favorite aspects of these games is that explaining the game takes under 10 seconds and they are ready to play!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Awesome Movie! Would recommend if you like Greek mythology. I always like books that come to life into motion pictures.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|The best film I've seen in blue ray yet. worth re buying. One of the most creative pictures in film making history.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use and love waking up to my own music! I have tried others and never found one so easy to use.  I am glad I found this one.
B00992CF6W|3.0|So it's good but they need to make more updates  so I hope testing soon or making updates. :-) ..
076115728X|4.0|This is a very cool book.  We got it for a 3 year old.  He does like and understand most of the ideas in it - not all yet but he'll figure it out more over time.  It's very imaginative and well done - can be fun for anyone as a unique book to have on the shelf about creativity.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app suits my daily needs for balancing my check book, comparing sales prices, etc.  Very handy!  And free! I highly recommend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed trying to find all the secret compartments and puzzles. Great game! Can't wait for more. If you like to think and reason things out, you'll really like this game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent as a third book in a series.  Would like to see book four in the near future.  Exciting and well written
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was a good film. I did watch it a second time because I wanted to watch it at home as I have a good surround sound system and I wanted to experience the full effect. The first time it was only through the little tv speakers of an old Sharp CRT...not even an HD set!<br /><br />Rich
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The best weather app.  I can't plan my day without it.  The current condition window is especially useful in winter, when it's nice (or not) to know the wind chill temp.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I loved this book because Taubes really breaks down the science behind fat in a way that laymen can understand. I have been carb restricting for 2 1/2 years and re-read this book everytime I need some inspiration again. This time I re-read it because I had we'll intended people convincing me that a low carb diet was unhealthy.<br />I highly highly recommend this book!
B00BU18U82|4.0|My son finds this so much fun, he plays it all the time if it keeps him happy in the car I am happy
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really great game for the value. The graphics are week done and the story line moves along well. There is a guided version with hints and you can also challenge yourself with a harder versions.<br />I've played it twice and again with my niece (11) and she loves it too.
B000002JS6|5.0|I bought this used like new Audio CD, Original recording reissued, Original recording remastered, 1994. I found at the back it says 1980 Leidseplein Presse B.V. But it sounds good very clear recording and all the classic songs are included.
B003DZX3US|5.0|We bought this for our daughter-in-law; she loves the movie.  The delivery time was great and everything was as good as expected when the package arrived.
B00005OAIE|4.0|The first song I knew from this album was &#34;Your body is a wonderland&#34; and i just thought it's a pop song. Then after many years I saw John's live and his guitar performance, that was incredible! So I bought this CD to listen from the start. I like a lot of songs in it. No Such Thing, My Stupid Mouth, Neon, City Love. The favorite one is &#34;City love&#34; very good song melody and solo are all perfect. I recommend this debut from John Mayer.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I would not recommend this game because like most good games it is addictive and in order to get past the challenges you are almost forced to buy extra 'dollars'. To upgrade dinosaurs it costs hundreds of thousands of coins and then you have too wait sometimes days for the dinosaur to 'hatch' or pay 'dollars'. It is very frustrating to spend so much time playing a game and then to almost have to pay for additional 'money'. You are never awarded more than one or two dollars for a any 'completed mission' so you can never build up enough dollars to help you get anywhere!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This is a classic.  Bergman and Bogart in their prime with great supporting actors, Paul Henreid, Claude RainsPeter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet add up to a wonderful cast.  It has a predictable plot there with a few turns that would be surprising to the first time viewer.  I have seen it before at least a half dozen times and it is still very entertaining.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|At first I thought the plot was too similar to the French movie, The Intouchables but it developed and even though the ending was inevitable, I was very sad.  it was a good read, not too demanding but I would recommend it.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|The movie arrived on time and in very good condition. We popped the movie in and watched it and it was in very good condition. Will buy again should the chance arise.
B008M721MS|4.0|This is the greatest app ever invented! I can Skype my mom when I'm with my grandparents or out of town..! But I got stuck with it ,it started one day that it wouldn't let me log in...!
0375842209|5.0|Zusak is a fantastic author who skillfully combines great storytelling with artful prose. The sixth graders in my Literature Circle didn't know the context behind the tale and so didn't &#34;get&#34; it, but if I had an eight grade class full of more advanced readers, this story would be a joy to teach. Compelling read for readers 14 and up!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fun and like real game. Wish it offered more free coins at one time but you get more every 30 minutes or so. I enjoy this game.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The series is great!  I can't wait to watch the next one.  I hope season 3 will be out by the time i finish season 2 this weekend.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I spend a lot of time on YouTube watching the scads of interesting clips and shows since I downloaded this app.  Works good.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|The disks work perfectly and arrived within the projected shipping time frame.  The shows are wonderfully cute and humorous. I highly recommend the entire series.
B007ZYK3CE|5.0|This is about a guy with a bad attitude.  Naturally he has few friends and gets into lots of ugly situations.  Life has dealt him<br />a poor hand, but deep inside he malleable enough to change for the better if given half a chance.  He meets this woman<br />who has real problems of her own.  Can they help each other? Watch to find out.
0345803485|2.0|After hearing all the hype, I figured I ought to be in the know. What I didn't know was the hot, completely irresistible Christian Grey was only 27! HA! And the protag was a 21 year old virgin! The books turned sour for me at that point. I think I read it to about page 150 and haven't picked it up for months. Doubt I will. Sorry. She did a great job marketing it and kudos to her for that. She can sit back and laugh at our reviews!
B002RI9M2U|4.0|I really appreciated this book, and I hope those reading it think of their own actions, or how to treat people in their lives.  Found myself looking ahead to when my kids are going through feelings and experiences like this, and I truly hope they feel they can come to me.<br /><br />Cleverly written, and easily draws the reader in.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I love this album because it deals with many of the aspects of who we are, while still being entertaining. I catch myself being reminded of one of the songs, no matter what kind of mood I am in, since it covers all of them pretty well. Overall, it is a must have.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I love every song on this album. A must have for Pearl Jam fans. Was worth every single last dollar
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I bought this book for some airplane reading. It was great and I couldn't put it down. I finished in two days. If you like twists this book has a crazy ending that I'm hoping isn't quite true. Great read through.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I like how you can evolve your shark to almost no limits there's almost unlimited entertainment and u can dress your shark or modify your gameplay
B006O5XYWG|5.0|good movie, son loved it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am amazed at how fun this game is. My children and I love playing this game. It is a must for all families.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|I downloaded this app because I had some pictures that were too dark.  (Pictures taken with a setting sun)  It did no better than the existing app that came with my phone and some of the same features, like the filter and cropping/rotating..  It does have some cool features like making different types of frames.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Wasn't sure at first but it turned out to be a great movie. It played beautifully on my kindle fire HD.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I like the way this game highlights the numbers on the board so it's easy to spot where they are and also if you already have the number on the line you are looking at or the box and when you've completed the numbers for that game the number turns a different color.  It also has a checker, to verify that the choice you made makes sense logically.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I think this app is awesome because it works better tha. Any of the other photo editing apos that I have used in th d past
B002VPE1WK|4.0|YOU CAN TAKE THIS ALONG ON VACATION AS IT'S LARGE ENOUGHT TO PACK EVERYTHING, EVEN YOUR CLOTHING.  AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|I got the game and it kept freezing and stopping so I deleted it and I bought a different game to play.
B00C3ALLZ8|4.0|This is the first time this insanely surrealistic comedy from the mind of Terry Southern has been released in wide screen.  With a title song by Paul McCartney and early work from John Cleese and Graham Chapman this is definitely a collector's item.  Don't miss Yul Brynner in drag.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I've read the book twice now. I'm sure there will be a third reading. The drive, determination, and prideful spirit that makes America the greatest republic ever is still alive. God Bless the men and women that serve.
B00B1CGDTS|2.0|Usually Olive films releases blu-rays struck from high quality negatives.  This looks like a public domain release of a 16mm print.  I know better quality source material is available because I've seen this film on high def cable looking sharp and with high color purity.
B0074QGGK6|3.0|We might already know or at least intuit this stuff but it reminded me of what's really important and how to make it work.
B004LP3AYI|2.0|I have read all of the original offerings by Terry Goodkind and loved the series so when I went to the kindle version to utilize my new tablet more, I wanted this series. After purchasing Wizards First Rule, I was severely disappointed at the amount of time this title was off the market as well as hundreds of other prospective buyers who made their opinions known through reviews. Now that it's back up and available, it's pathetic to see this title isn't priced to reflect the frustrations of the time waiting for this format by the consumer for at least as long as it was off the market. A strong suggestion would be half off the original price, but hey... who am I but a single person helping to pay your bills by buying your products. I've waited this long, guess i'll wait a bit longer or just blow the dust off my paperback until this gets a proper price point. Think more about the consumer the next time you want my money. The book itself is fantastic, but in this format it's been too long in the fixing. I'll update this review to reflect the actual book quality if there is any move by the seller to make ANY recompense to the consumer besides the dollar or so off that would be better spent somewhere else.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This movie was in excellent condition and is a family favorite.  Deep in its concept and while not for young children, is a study of the human spirit.  Great movie.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Excellent film. Bradley Cooper is phenomenol.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence deserved her Oscar. Great<br /><br />writing. Robert DeNiro shines in a supporting<br /><br />role.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Like most great games, it's really simple in concept.  Most of the puzzles are easy, even at large board sizes.  The addiction comes into play with HINTS.  You never have to use them, but then you don't have to solve every puzzle.  I got used to solving these puzzles quickly, and then got used to using HINTS when I couldn't; in consequence, I SPENT MONEY on this Free game.  Still gave it five stars because four is too stingy.  It really is a great game
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The iPhone 5 and iPad needs a higher amperage to charge quickly.  This high quality car charger works very well to charge the iPhone 5.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|This game has good gameplay but has too many pop ups advertising other games.<br />Q offer should be made to purchase to get rid of ads.  Need Wi-Fi to play.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|What my 7 year old grandson has to say is the following, &#34;I like that you have to think so you know where to shoot.  I also like the character because he is cool the way he can jump on trampolines.  I would recommend this game to boys and girls from 6 years and older.&#34;
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This app worked really well in the beginning but on my third time using it it kept saying it was loading and then kept crashing.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It's a great game u can play with your friends n others online instead of play in against computers.No issues that affect the game.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I liked it a lot but after a few days I got bored of it but it was very good
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love it ! So many shows are so similar, but this really stands out. Great acting and writing. Can't wait to see the next episode.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautiful moving story of Afghan  siblings , split when their father has to make the impossible decision to sell his daughter in order to support the rest of  the poverty stricken family. The story is largely set in war torn Kabul, with Nabi, a loyal servant of a wealthy Afghan business man and his beautiful but desperately unhappy childless wife; Nabi  is also the  uncle of the siblings, who feels life long  guilt over his role in this terrible deed. The  story switches to revealing  the life of Marcos, a Greek plastic surgeon,  who dedicates his life to working with innocent victims of conflict after his own personal tragic experiences,  whilst growing up on the island of Tinos, and who then is instrumental in bringing together the lost siblings.<br /><br />Definitely on a par with ' The Kite Runner' and 'A Thousand  Splendid Suns', perhaps even better! I couldn't put the book down!!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|So great! Love this series! Hope there will be more books. Now I'm feeling like I have to find something as good to read. Might be hard'
B003U69IX6|4.0|This was good light entertainment for a weekend evening.  We're both sci-fi/fantasy fans, so we enjoyed the story.  Good for what it is.
B00821OX98|4.0|the story keeps on making you want to continue watching. There is not too much hype and quite believable, not boring.
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|I like that they are very thick and strong.  Yes, that can be hard to bend.  Exactly!!  My teens have broken every ipod charger by playing battery sucking games plugged in.  Not this one.  We've had these for the prior ipod versions and loved them.  I also like that it is realllllyyy long.  Plug it in under the bed and leave it alone.  it's also good for hotel trips where you never can find a near by plug.<br />I like that it isn't flimsy, it's apple authorized, and that it is long.  It also works.  I will buy another one for the other child.  Wanted to try this one first to be sure it was like my prior one, just lightning connect. Quality product
0307888908|3.0|The book came on time and in new condition.  I bought it for a class.  The content was ok, but not my favorite.
B009G3T01M|5.0|This is so powerful and dear to my heart. Saw them perform on the Ellen show and had to have it.
1609611543|1.0|I ve been gluten free for about a year now and had heard about this book through a blog I follow. The ingredients for the recipes are pricey, and the diet just doesn't seem healthy. Keep looking my friends. This book is not the answer.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game was engaging and brain teasing at times. Overall though it was a lovely game. Just wish there were more levels. Also the final puzzle was lackluster in comparison to the preceding.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|great movie for my 3 year old ,heahas watched many times and still likes it. Plan on adding it to our collection
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Although many have left harsh reviews I thought the books were good and an easy read. I would recommend them but only for adults.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This app was great for about a week but now I have to wait 1 hour to watch a game review 24 min long using the 360p version because the 720p takes about 5times longer!!!!!! This app needs some updates to fix it or they should just put a Adobe flash player app on the kindle fire HD 7in and 8in.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|THIS BOOK IS VERY FUNNY. CRIEG DOES A LOT TO BE HELPFUL AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES HIM FUNNY. LOVE THE. BOOK.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I came to know about this book thanks to Amazon's recommendations, based on books I previously read. The reviews were good and the Kindle price was low, so I thought: what the heck? worst case scenario I wasted a few bucks.<br /><br />There was nothing to prepare me for what laid between the pages.<br />So I'll write this to the whole world to read: This is, hands down, one of the best books I've ever read.<br /><br />First, the language. After agonizing through a best seller book someone begged me to read, written in a dry and boring manner, it was a joy to read REAL literature. Beautiful phrases constructed with love and care. So much so, I'd go back and read some pages or sentences again, just to take it all in and relish the beauty of it. This is first and foremost a literary achievement. I can only applaud (and envy) Mr. Howey's amazing way with words.<br /><br />Second, the story. A brilliant, creative, and original plot, filled with characters that materialize before your mind's eye. People you can feel for, care for, and wonder about even long after you finish reading. This is what makes this book so great. It gets you deep into the story. Reveals some details but isn't predictable. In fact, (almost) every time I thought I figured things out - that I knew what was coming next - the plot took a sharp turn. Lastly, the way it makes you wish you had more hours a day to read, so you can find out what happens next to those people your mind is so invested in. I rarely feel so strongly for fictional characters, and to me it's the one true sign. A sign I've suspended my disbelief and plunged head first into the story.<br /><br />Finally, according to the Q&A at the end of the Kindle version, the author said he reads every review. If this is still the case, I would like to thank you personally. This book was not only enjoyable, it also enriched my life. And it reminded me of the late Carl Sagan's thoughts about the place we call home, that looks like a place blue dotsuspended in space.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Im very eternament and run in the minions is a play ver very good fine bye run make up sing talk
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I've seen this movie as well as the next edition in 3D at a theater. I'm lucky enough to have a 3D set at home to enjoy this movie over and over.  I never tire of the crazy humor.  If you've never seen this movie, but it.  You'll split your sides laughing.  Banana!
B001QB5S3G|5.0|The Mission<br />It was a story we had to see after our grandson traveled with the Jesuits to that site last month on their way to see the pope in rio. Also, we loved the second disc showing how the movie was made. It was most interesting seeing the logistics required and the communication with the indians from another tribe.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It has a nice story line there were about 6 times they cussed and it was shockingly AWESOME!!!  New things kept popping up like<br />SPOILER ALERT!!!<br />Jace and Clary are brother and sister, Valentine is their dad, and Luke is a werewolf!!! Very good. read
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is really awesome!!!!<br />My favorite mode is creative mode because you can build anything<br />So awesome!!! Really worth the 6.bucks
B002N44XSG|5.0|Great book!! Can't wait until House of Hades ( HoH) comes out!!!!!!! =D Half bloods unite!!!!!!!!!!!! Also want to read the son of sobek both two good series Kane Cronicals and Percy Jackson! =D =D
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is challenging, fun, cute, creative and intuitive!  Excellent for developing problem-solving skills!<br /><br />You slide around little blobs of gelatin (looks more like gelatin than pudding) joining them up to make larger blobs, ultimately creating one big monster blob.  I like the game because you can try as many times as you like with no time limit or penalty.  It has good hints to help you get started or get unstuck.
055358894X|5.0|Thank you Mr Lynch - I had read through all of Patrick Rothfuss and Richard K Morgans books and feared I might have run out of great novels... this one delivers on all registers. Captivating prose, great storyline, rich characters, a story that doesn't just hit the tropes but surprises instead. Can't wait to get my hands on the second one... One thing in particular that sets fantasy I love apart are believable characters with motivations that aren't obvious ploys to move the plot forward. The other main ingredient that really makes or breaks a story for me are the settings. Scott Lynch delivers on both counts, and I'll call out the incredible images that his descriptions elicit in particular. I can't decide if I dread someone adapting the series as a movie/television series/video game or yearn for it. The visuals should and would be breathtaking.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I was expecting more if a novel with a main character and having this told from 1 person perspective. If that is what u were expecting HOLD UP BEFORE U BUY. This is more like a random collection of short stories and events. While telling of world war Z ,  by the end of the book u still have things that need explaining......it's a bit unfulfilling. While some of the excerpts make u laugh and others are entertaining. Most just leave u wanting more
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The &#34;Dove Dark Chocolate&#34; of television! It's a smooth, rich, velvety indulgence! Julian Fellowes even makes you sympathize with the &#34;nasty&#34; characters. OK; that part isn't like the chocolate, because there is NOTHING nasty about the chocolate.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Everyone is saying it's a virus but I've had it for around six months and haven't had any problems, my tablet antivirus hasn't given me any alerts.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This program has great character development and an excellent plot evolution. The downside only applies to &#34;occasional&#34; viewers, and that is the fact that the story can be difficult to follow.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great for sharpening your memory while having fun. I have really enjoyed this game because it's different every time.You compete against your own time clock.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The third book in the Crossfire series did not disappoint!  Gideon is not Christian Grey but equally as awesome.  If you liked 50 Shades, you will like this.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|It's both hilarious and also a really good thinking game.  You have to try this game - best one I've played on a mobile device.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I really love playing this. I previously had the game on Facebook and I played it quite a bit, but I like this version better because it lets me play mobile. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Family Farm or FarmVille on Facebook!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is awesome.<br />At first I had some trouble setting it up but it was mostly due to our ****** Verizon router.<br />Once that was out of the way, the setup took only a minute and I was enjoying YouTube videos on my TV and controlling them from my phone.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|With great graphics, spooky sound effects, and mysterious characters, this app is definitely worth a shot! The seek-and-find mini games are challenging, and the game is great to play at night (if you don't get nightmares easily, anyway). I reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a challenging, thrilling game!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Good scifi/action movie but didn't offer a whole lot in character development so this kept it from being a 5 star rating.
1451695195|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book. I was care taker for my dad and my husband prior their deaths.  Many of the things that I read in this book were told to me by my dad and husband.  They both experienced life after death and shared their visions with me.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Interesting twist that I didn't see coming and a unique plot, more special effects would have earned this a five star rating.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have use this PDF reader on both my Kindle fire and Samsung Galaxy tablets and also on my phone. Works great and use it often.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Sometimes tough to follow the character associations between the different time blocks; good character development and believable special effects throughout.
B0007PAMEM|5.0|ALWAY A TINA TURNER FAN AND HAVE BEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME, WILL LIKE THIS COLLECTION, HOWEVER, DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO VIEW IT AS OF YET, BUT I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING OF TINA'S AND DID NOT LIKE IT.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Some entertaining moments, but not something I'd watch twice.  The movie felt like it needed more time for character/plot development.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, however i wish the energy to progress in the game wasn't included. Other than that this game is great for killing an hour or two.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is extremely informative. The author backs up all of his arguments with clear evidence. If you care about your health I'd highly recommend reading this. It could change your life.
B005LAII4E|5.0|The film is fantastic and action pack  from beginning to end.  Everyone in the movie all had a great part even my girl who held it down she was bad ass through the whole movie.  Great action Flick!!!!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love this cd even more after I got it and heard all the songs makes me want to get more of this group. I would recommend it to all my friends  thank you to Mumford and Sons
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|Good show, it'll give you a Joss Whedon fix. Sadly its not Firefly. It's a great concept, I could do with a little less T&A (don't get me wrong, I enjoy the view) and more story.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Really great love story I am going to see the movie now and I cannot wait! Really a page turner
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I like how it gives you a back story to the first movie. I thought James Franco did a great job despite all the critics. This was my favorite movie with Michelle Williams. She was a phenomenal Glinda. I love the colorful scenes. Overall a wonderful addition.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Receivthank youed books in very good condition,. all very well done, no problems, very happy with product and service.<br />thank you
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Thought this was a great movie with great actors. I love the witches and the story of good & bad witches. Great movie!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|If you like sci-fi or fantasy this is a great movie for you. There is a good story, very good action and actors, and great special effects. I hope Disney makes a sequel. I don't understand why this movie didn't do better at the box office. Its fanbase is growing, and there are Facebook pages and a change.org petition trying to get a sequel made.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Another great rendition of the jack and the bean stock movies. They did a great job with graphics! Well worth watching!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This was a non-fiction that reads like a novel, really keeps you turning pages.  Great if one had a parent, relative or someone you knew that flew in a B17, gives a great perspective.  Also and no the least important, this book really helps see into the other side like I have never seen before.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the bomb. I love the different levels and villains. And as always....THE MINIONS!!!!  It's a little challenging but even my 5 year old twin brothers can beat my score. It's so addicting you'll want to play all day.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|The story is wonderful, but the version I received is way out of sync.  I would really like it to be replaced.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This was my favorite book as a kid. I am so happy to have found it for my Kindle. :)
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is one of the best I've ever read. It's suspenseful and makes you want to keep reading. I love it.&lt;3
B009NY43NY|3.0|&#34;It's okay&#34; is misleading.  Not good but not terrible.  Answered the question of who, Eric or Bill, ends up with Sookie.  Ties things up, but ending was just blah!  The whole book was just not that interesting.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have the first two seasons on Netflix and when I saw that Amazon prime had the third season, I couldn't help myself, I had to see it, so I purchased the whole season and honestly, it was worth it! The show is addicting. It has a solid story line that doesn't resemble so much about zombies but rather about the people on earth trying to find sanity in a world fill with zombies. Hence, the title might just be a metaphor to humanity.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best ever but should have more updates<br />we want more say enderman enchanting levels and more like adventure and hard
B007HO392S|3.0|That is all I think of the CD. I didn't think its the best work I have heard from her.
B008EKOIN8|4.0|This will probably inspire me to expand my cooking repertoire a bit. Interesting to read the history of these different ways of cooking, and what has survived in today's culture of manufactured food. Michael can get off into the weeds for a few pages but after a somewhat slow start, it just gets better.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I like the first CD better but this one is growing on me.  Still a good CD to have and enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of comically time-killing fun. My kids love it and so do I...that is when I can get the chance to play. Creative  conclusion to a creative movie. Wonderful app.
B0000549B0|5.0|Director Harry Koster's classic, quirky, movie featuring the wonderful Jimmy Stewart: a man for all seasons - war hero, modest, down-to-earth man who never traded on his fame and achievements.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This is my first time reading a Morgan Rice book. I enjoys the entire book. There were some questions, but that didn't take away from the story.  I'm getting ready to start book #2 as soon as I complete this review.<br /><br />If you're reading this review in regards to  'Is this story worth starting?' The answer is yes<br />It's an exciting ride once you board the ride, you'll quickly want to purchase another ticket for the next train ride.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Doesn't work. No wonder it was free.<br />Picture wouldn't download into the app. Maybe it'll work for you? Gonna delete it.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|This game is fun to play. But unless you buy the full version,it doesn't give you as many choices as you would if you bought it. If you are looking for an app that has a lot of choices for makeup and dresses I would buy the full version. If you just want a couple of choices I would suggest that you just download it for free.
6305897786|4.0|I read the book &#34;The Club Dumas&#34; first and really liked it.  They changed the story line a bit in the movie, but I liked it.  Suspenseful, but not too scary.  It was somehow in the same genre as Psycho.  I would recommend it.  If you are a reader, I would also recommend his other book &#34;The Queen of the South&#34;
B00701L5XS|5.0|I think so!this app was so helpful that I stayed up until 1:00 in the morn tying knots!it is phenomenal.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey! This year is better than ever with a surprising ending. I can hardly wait for Season 4!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book was a really good learning experience for me  it teaches many great things that people can use through out life.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Simply put you are not seeing this movie because it is winning any oscars or such but because it is a solid action movie with some explosions and what not and yeah you need to see a movie like this every so often especially when you are going with your lady friend out to see a movie where the entire time you are yelling in your head &#34;someone give them a gun!&#34;  This movie is a man movie which is simply made up of good guys, bad guys, and guess what?  THEY FIGHT!  Awesome.  I enjoyed it and it took let my mind relax and soak up some action and think nothing of whether he would get back with her and what not.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun. I love this game. I thought that this game would be stupid but I gave it a try and it turned out to be fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing. Wonderfully written. Can't wait to read the rest of the books about this adventure. Two thumbs up for the girl on fire!!
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Love the song, I listen to it almost everyday while I am driving around in my car. Great Great song
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|A nice view into the life on the road with Katy Perry. You'll also see how her relationship with Russell deteriorated.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story although sad had many good philosophical points that are applicable to both eastern and western culture.  although the interweaving of the story was very unique, it sometimes was hard to follow and I had to stay with it for a few paragraphs before the common thread appeared.  In all it made for slow reading and easy to put the book down if something needed to be done around the farm etc.<br />Not nearly as compelling as the author's two previous novels.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I think this is the epitome of \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" movies.  I don't know how I made it all the way through it, but I did.  A few of my friends thought it was great and I am all for giving things their fair shake before I pass final judgment, so I went back to try and watch it again.  Maybe I just didn't get it the first time?  About 20 minutes into it I decided not to put myself through that uncomfortable viewing experience again so I just shut it off.  The main character was so uninteresting and spent much of his time staring at the other cast members occasionally flashing a creepy smile.  It was probably the easiest acting gig Ryan Gosling has ever had.....he didn't have to do any acting at all.<br /><br />I don't get it which is totally fine.  As always YMMV.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I think sharks eat a lot of food when people go swimming in to the oceans where the sharks live at.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|In \\"Choose Yourself\\", James Altucher has some insight and some good points about the nature of our society and economy, none of it original and none of it terribly revolutionary (if you've been paying attention to the technological advancements the world has been undergoing since the invention of the internet).  He makes a few connections that others wouldn't, and makes some convincing arguments based off these connections.  I know that's vague, but I want to keep this review relatively short.<br /><br />Where this book falls flat is the presentation.  You know that thought experiment about an infinite number of monkeys typing for an infinite amount of time eventually reproducing the works of Shakespeare?  Well, this book feels like something that was churned out by one of those monkeys along the way.  The first term that comes to mind when describing it is \\"ADHD.\\"  It jumps from topic to topic, never leading the reader anywhere but back to \\"and then this one time I lost a lot of money, but then I recovered and made a lot of money.\\" The writing lacks any sort of coherence; it's just a bunch of stories from Altucher's life thrown together with maybe a little bit of \\"moral of the story\\" sprinkled on for flavor.<br /><br />One of the things that Altucher talks about (over and over and over and over again) is how in the \\"Choose Yourself\\" era, you don't have to rely on others to choose you in order to do things like publish a book, how technology -- and Jeff Bezos -- have made it possible and easy to completely bypass the traditional publishing system and get your writing to the reader without having to go through any of those pesky gatekeepers like editors.  I agree with him; it's a revolution in publishing that enables a lot more amazing books to be seen by a lot more people.  But it also enables many more subpar works to be seen. With the gatekeepers out of the picture, there's no longer anyone weeding out the bad stuff; no one telling authors like Mr. Altucher \\"I seepromise in what you've written, but it needs a lot of work before being published.\\"<br /><br />I made it through the book, and consider myself better off for it -- I learned some things, some of which Altucher intended and some which he didn't.  But the awful writing and lack of coherence made it much more arduous to read than it should have been, and I fear that in my frustration with the writing I missed out on a lot of what Altucher has to say.  In light of this, I cannot recommend others read \\"Choose Yourself.\\"
B0068RGVMK|5.0|If you like Goth Metal, this is a good one. All the music builds on the title theme. Two more words. OK, three.
B000002IQ9|5.0|This music has been around for a while, the world knows how good it is!!  Only other thing to rate is the shipping -- was delivered quickly and the CD was in perfect condition. Way to go, Amazon !
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I'm stuck on a level.  Don't even know which one because I haven't gone on in a long time.  Wish it had some kind of hint, something to move on.  Really should give it a 2.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I would like it more if it didnt ask me to rate it all the time,  but besides that its a good app
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't put down. Great story. Keeps you on your toes. Highly recommend to anyone of any age. Can't wait for the movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Have always wanted to get a Kindel so I could access this program away from the desktop, so many items to pin.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Wife wanted to watch this.  I stuck around and started to watch this movie and was suprized by all the twist and turns of this drama.  Movie keeps you on edge through the whole movie.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Movie aptly named.  It feels after 15 minutes like it will never end.  If I could rate it -1 I would.  Cruise should be paying you to watch this.
B004U52VPS|2.0|My 6 year old loves Angry Birds and he received this game this past Christmas. He was so excited but when we tried to play the game we found the rules to be tedious and building became mind-numbing. Not to mention he found it hard to knock the pigs down. The idea is great but just not sure about the execution. There are quite a few games my son has that I love to play with him but this isn't one of them. That being said my son decided to just use the game like action figures. He builds what he wants and play acts with the pigs and birds. So he still has fun.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This classic work gets better every time I read it. The fact that it is still relevant centuries after it w written testifies to its greatness.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish I can make a nether portal with flint and steel<br />you need to make a update with the nether portal soon
B00BQ1D7X4|2.0|Let me start off by saying I don't not like this album because Layne isn't on it. He's dead and gone, but not forgotten. I'm not one of those brainless lunitics that hate AIC simply for the fact that they have a new singer. William DuVall is amazing and really brings alot to AIC & having met him I can say the guy is extremely cool, very humble and happy to be in the band. I loved Black Gives Way To Blue and saw it as a rebirth for the band and had all my fingers crossed that they would make another album. I finally heard they were and I was stoked. I didn't expect it to be a copy of BGWTB but a hyrbid of all they're albums. Upon listening to this start to finish, my first thought was disappointment & confusion. Other than the singles \\"Hollow\\" and \\"Stone\\" the only other tracks to really stand out were \\"Scalpel\\" and \\"Voices\\". The album is very bland and the songs bleed into one another and are very forgettable as well as sounding very similar. I'm not too sure what happened here but it really sounds uninspired almost as if Jerry threw around a few riffs and repeated them for the entire CD. Another complaint is the song length. Half of these songs just drag on and on and on at a very boring and unchanging pace, the title track especially could be cut in half. Last is the over-harmonizing of Cantrell & DuVall. Half the time the mix is so bad it's a bad mesh or Cantrell just drowns DuVall out or vice versa. Really sad to find an AIC album that is bad to mediocre at best. I really hope they're next album is more inspired and not a victim of the Loudness War.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I enjoyed it very much If there were men and women like the movie we would not have all the ness in this world like we do. very enjoyable movie 1 and 2
B0026S93C0|4.0|One of the iconic movies from the 80's, brings back memories to the styles and music from that time. Not the best acted movie but enjoyable.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I love that I can download my photos, Music. and etc from any device, anytime anywhere that i have an internet connection.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|This is a story of fantasy and folklore all into one.  It takes the story of shapeshifter's to a whole new level.  The characters are so well defined I felt like they were a part of my life.  I wish that I was a part of the Bridalveil Falls life.  It sounds so awesome the way that Sheryl describes it.  to sum it up...AWESOME BOOK!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so intertaning :'D its my fab game I would never stop playing g this game yahoooooo
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a Great Game!!  I only wish I had more time to sit and enjoy.  To much to get done today. .......... but I will be back.  THANKS
B0036EBANS|1.0|The vinyl I received was scratched! I love this album but I'm disappointed I got a bad product. I don't have the return label so I'm stuck with it.
1452110581|5.0|I purchased it as a gift for the lovely cat lady in my life. It is full of great humor only cat ladies truly understand. Give one to your favorite cat lady!
B004KPX4W2|3.0|Thought it would be fun slow In parts to the point of boring more action and 30 min short it might have been better.
1476734941|3.0|was expecting some more information but the book isn't necessary after hearing him on TV.<br />The book had some studies but could have added more inspiring info like the historical reasons<br />people fast.  I do think it helps rediscover hunger which has been lost since the theory of small constant<br />meals was the thing to do.  Great Idea book needs more substance.
B003L77GG0|3.0|After 10 seasons you are all excited to see Clark finally become Superman, and while the story was fun and the plot built up towards a big final ending, the ending itself was disappointing. It builds up until the last minute, and then the final battle and series end is over in literally minutes it seemed. I felt the creators suddenly realized they were out of time and had to rush everything to complete it within the episode count or something.<br /><br />Either way, I would have picked this up because I had watched the other 9 seasons and I would have felt annoyed until I saw the finale but I'm glad I didn't buy it at it's higher price and waited for the price to drop down (plus I caught it on a sale and only paid $15 for it). It is also a plus that they did a decent enough job filling in plot holes before the finale so there wasn't much left that kept you wondering.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|AWESOME BOOK!<br />Utterly brilliant analysis of Scarface. Wow. This is mind blowing. You have to read this book! I haven't seen the 1983 Al Pacino movie for years but this book has made me want to see it again immediately. Recommended for film lovers and anyone who has ever seen the movie Scarface.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|it didn't block 25% of the adds. already took it off my lap top. I don't recommend if you got to pay for it.
B00004RCO9|1.0|DVD does not play in \\"most US or Canadian DVD players\\". This info was in the small print & now I'm out $7 & thoroughly annoyed. No point in sending it back because I would have to pay for shipping AGAIN. It is a great movie...when it plays!!! Why ship to US or Canada for that matter if its not going to work!! Scam.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I have a history major and am a certified bitchin' movie expert. This movie recieves my highest recommendation for both historical accuracy and absolute bitchenness.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game. I have all temple run games. I think that this is the best. I just love the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is really good  but I think it could possibly give you a bit  more help with the things  they tell you to do. I love the game but I wouldn't recommend this for a young person because  it is a bit hard and they don't explain things properly but than gratifying altogether it is really good and I would  play on this  for hour's
B003TGMFG4|4.0|A good wake up call for all young adults: the true sad story of a young man who died unnecessarily due to many wrong turns. Biggest was inability to communicate with his parents I think. There is much to learn here, if the reader pays attention.
B00992CF6W|3.0|WHY CAN'T U BLOW STUFF UP I MEAN I WOULD ALREADY BE RATING THIS TWO MONTHS AGO I AM SO DISAPOINTED.
1451695195|5.0|It was easy to read and I understood what he was going through and glad to read about it. I read it in one night which I have not done in quite awhile.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This ap is fun, easy and a joy to use. Its easy to make quick adjustments and fixes to your photos. A great ap for a GREAT Price
B003I55BIA|5.0|I love this book! Totally worth reading! I am 14. And it was still great for teens! Love stories are the best!  Ecspically this one.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is really good book. I love it!! It's so good. It's a book I couldn't put down. It's so awesome!
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|This was one of the first items I ordered for my kindle, because let’s face it, it’s epic.<br /><br />I can gush and coo about the story line for ages, but I’ll leave that to people who actually reviewed the movie rather than its adaptation for the kindle like this, so here is my opinion for the adaptation: It was super neat, I love the x-ray feature. I have very little knowledge of actors (celebrities are not so interesting in my opinion, ha) but it really helped when a voice came on and I’d sit there and think “I know that voice! WHY do I know that voice?!” That did save my brain several times, so I’m very happy with it. (:<br /><br />My bummer note to this epic adaptation is that it can get pixilated at times, grainy or whatever. It did make me kind of sad since some of what makes this movie so awesome is that the animation is so well done, but hey, what can you do I guess. It didn’t happen a ton of times, but it did make me twitch a little anyway.
B00BESM14U|3.0|Good movie, but the book is way better. I, personally prefer the books instead of the movies. The movie is good enough for you to get the gist of what the plot/story is about.
0789310627|5.0|We took our four year old son to London, and he loved this book.  Great for teaching him basic info and more on the country.  He loved being able to say that was in the book, etc.
B00B2166BS|3.0|In all, it helps with faster recharge vs the usb plug. Avoids substantial stress on the usb connection since it bypassses usb connection.<br /><br />Cord length should be longer since my established setup is designed for a cord length that needs an extra 12&#34;.<br /><br />Connection is secured by magnet, and this magnet is very low in holding strength (ie, it pops off with minimal movement of nexus). Whether this magnet weakness is inherent in the Pogo connector or is a design flaw in the nexus is not known.
B0000669JL|5.0|I like Bob Marley he' has a good voice and he's a good singer. I like it because is a CD. If it is a cassette I will not enjoy it.<br /><br /> I will recomand it to the people and I will give five stars.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Interesting from start to finish. Gripping story that sucked me in. Great book club selection - leaves lots to talk about.
