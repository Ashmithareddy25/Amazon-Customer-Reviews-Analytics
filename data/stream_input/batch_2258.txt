B008RXYOKY|5.0|this item worked great for my new imac since the new ones dont have a firewire port easy to use and happy
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was entertaining and was not totally predictable. It was well worth the time to read. four more words needed.. lol
B00138KK62|5.0|This is my favorite Alicia Keys cd and I think this is the best one shes ever made. A great classic.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|fun but you have to wait for your freinds to draw back to u. so dont get it if u want to gust draw random pictures.
B004GJVI5C|5.0|This is a great story line that was executed to perfection.  With no CGI this movie is sure to keep you entertained.
B000W93CHC|3.0|While I loved &#34;Pillars...&#34; I got bogged down about half way through this one. There were a few characters that I cared about, but not enough to find out what happened to them. And there were so many ancillary characters, that I became confused and had to go back and figure out who they were (not an easy thing on a Kindle).<br /><br />So I put the book down in favor of a shorter Follett (Triple) and may go back to it when I have lots of uninterrupted time on the beach.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It's nice, though not spectacular. A good little time waster, especially if you're a JP fan. Don't like that you must be connected to the web to save your park progress, though. Not bad.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|so happy to finally own my own DVD.  all i had before was a VHS and could not use it on my player :(  Now I can watch the Thunderbirds & Pink Ladys w/ my grandchildren whenever I wish :)
B004OC07N0|4.0|This book is chock full of good tips and tricks for succeeding as a leader in the workplace.  I recommend it for anyone who is in or looking to move into a leadership position.
B000OJFV4C|2.0|Huge dissapointment - if I was not a history buff I would not have had any idea who was who and what was going on.  I was a fan of Johnathon Rys Myers until now.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a good game.  I also liked atlantis. I am impressed with the graphics and easy game play.  I am interested with anything this company puts out.  Thanks.
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor & Park sets itself apart from they typical young adult read on just about every level: the setting, the main characters, the touching plot. These elements combine to make a read that moves the reader and warms the heart. Whatever expectations I had going into Eleanor & Park were simply blown away, and it will no doubt be on the list of my favorite reads of 2013.<br /><br />Set in the 1980s, Eleanor & Park is the story of two misfit teens in Omaha. Many YA novels purport to be about teenagers who simply do not fit in, and, truly, almost every teen feels that way inside. However, Eleanor, and to a lesser degree Park, really do stand out from the rest of the teens at their high school. Park is Asian, the only Asian kid in school, except for his brother who takes after their white father in appearance. Eleanor, well, she doesn't dress normal or look normal or act normal.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park opens on Eleanor's first day at school, having been away from her family for a year. She gets on the bus that first morning and everyone eyes her thrift store men's clothing over her chubby frame. They immediately recognize her as a target of mockery, dubbing her \\"raghead\\" and \\"Big Red.\\" As she searches for a seat, every available space is suddenly filled with a backpack or saved for someone. Finally, Park, just to make it stop, allows her to sit with him, regretting his kindness even as he does so, fearing that he'll earn the attention of the popular, bullying kids. I love that their first encounter is so awful, and how unflattering Park's first thoughts are. So much of high school is about avoiding embarrassment, and the awkward new girl is just that. This portrayal is so honest.<br /><br />Of course, as time goes by, Eleanor and Park slowly bond, not even speaking at first. He reads comics everyday on the bus, and he begins to notice her reading along. He starts flipping pages more slowly, giving her time to read the whole thing. Then he starts loaning them to her over night. From there, they enter into conversations, whispered quietly on the bus. Their thoughts on the X-Men (feminist or not?), Batman (boring or cool?), the pirate storyline in Watchmen (to be skipped or crucial to the comic?) shift gradually into conversations on music. Park brings new life into Eleanor's drab existence with the best of 1980s pop culture.<br /><br />Eleanor and her four siblings live with her mother and their drunken, abusive step-father, Richie. Her home life has no charms. The kids wear odd clothing grabbed by theit mother with any extra money. They fight over toys, like boxes that fruit come in, because that's the best they ever really hope to get. All five sleep in a single room, often hiding in there from the shouts of Richie. Eleanor, especially, knows how terrible Richie can be, and she never ever feels safe.<br /><br />Park becomes Eleanor's safe haven. Their relationship unfolds slowly, growing at a steady pace into a strong burn. I loved watching them learn to know one another's insecurities, and to accept them. This acceptance doesn't make the insecurities disappear entirely, but it does help. Neither Eleanor nor Park ever felt right in their own skins, and their burgeoning love comes as close to making them feel whole as anything could. I don't usually believe to much in young love, but I really hope these two crazy kids can make it, despite or because of all of the real world difficulties they have to face. Rowell doesn't overly romanticize their relationship, but she also doesn't attempt to diminish their feelings.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is, without a doubt, one of the best books of 2013, though much of it remains. Rowell has written an incredibly moving story about first love, and about the importance of having a support network, even if it's not your family. This book is brilliant, and I will most certainly be reading any more Rowell novels I can get my hands on.er night. From there, they enter into conversations, whispered quietly on the bus.

B009EP3DJM|5.0|I like almost every song on this CD - it totally rocks! Far from being a dumb, Ke$ha writes her own music. There are what sounds like dog barks on track #6 - Wherever You Are, so if you have a dog or dogs you should know that it's not your dog barking.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|She does a very good job of deconstructing a misunderstood concept. I found her insights and explanations spot on! Very well done!
0062238868|5.0|im a huge military buff, and i support the troops, and there is no better way to show that support than to read and understand what our heroes go thru. if u support the troops read this and ur respect and support will grow ten times more.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Whether you have raced or not... Simply amazing insight into our lives !  And having had many Enzos along the way has been most helpful... The car goes where your eyes ( and heart)<br /><br />Thank you Garth... As a racer , and someone who shared much with my pups... Thank you
B0045XICB2|1.0|Boring... Man.. they yap .. yap.. blah blah.. whisper.. whisper.. till the fight.. then end.. of the movie.. I can't believe I wasted 2 hrs for this...
B001G70M6S|5.0|Used this film with my Hasselblad and Polaroid back and my Polaroid land 100.  It is nice.  The 6x6 positive from my hasselblad scanned in well.  It's really fast film.  Fun to use plus you get instant pic and the cost is about the same as it would be to purchase 120 film and have it processed.  The bonus is having a print.  This is a must have if you own a Hasselblad.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|lots of fun. starts out easy and gets tougher as you progress. Have stayed up late many a night to play &quot;one more level&quot;.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Well worth the $2.99! I love this type of game and this is one of the better ones. Good story, graphics and puzzles!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|this was a really good book! i loved the plot line and it was original as well and i thin that is definitley one of the most important things about a book. i definitley recommend this book. it is really worth the money even if it seems expensive.
B005HIREJK|4.0|The watch itself is quite an eye catcher with the black face and yellow accents. It is a simple design but the chronograph gives the impression that it is a high dollar timepiece.<br /><br />The only thing keeping my review from being five stars is that the band looks and feels a bit cheap. The leather is stiff and the fake crocodile texture makes it look a little tacky.<br /><br />Packing from the seller was less than spectacular but it shipped quickly and arrived before I expected.<br /><br />Still, for the price I paid, it was a great purchase.
B005EJNAK4|3.0|It was alright, trailer looked better than it ended up being. Don't plan on seeing it again. All in all ok, but nothing special.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me hooked until the last page.  I loved reading the different points of view, a real \\"he said, she said.\\"  It made me appreciate the author's twisted style, and I can't wait for more.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is sort of our family game and is brought out some weekends and nearly every holiday. It's not incredibly easy but I wouldn't say it's hard either. I learned how to play when I was about 8 and had no problems besides getting down the strategy. If you enjoy games where you interact with other players, can build many different strategies for winning, are able to build your resources up, anything of the sort, you'll want this. Most games last between 30-60 minutes on average, but intense games can go beyond an hour and it still remains fun.<br />If you own previous versions of the game like I do, you will appreciate this new bordered setup. It's much quicker and the board STAYS INTACT (I know! It's great, no mess anymore!).<br />All in all, I would suggest you get it. If you don't like it, there is definitely someone in your family/friend base who will.
0571202284|5.0|It's in pretty good condition, and got here right on time. Very good book for anyone wanting to learn animation
B008WCP2PG|3.0|From the trailers for this movie I expected a high energy romp. Instead I saw a rather dark - if realistic - at the lifestyle of those in the trade. The bodies are hot, but there is more behind the scenes action than stage time. And any movie that can make Matthew McConaughey appear slimy and unappealing loses major points with this viewer.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|I loved the story line and the suspense. Can't wait to read the next book!  Keep them coming.....I can't put it down.
1932907009|5.0|Although it is written for Screenwriters, it is a handy reference for editors on the other end of the filmmaking assembly line.  Editors have to be great storytellers too.
B009CF7GRY|1.0|Shallow characters with dialog that makes George Lucas look like Shakespeare, contrived plotlines, and seizure-inspired dance moves make this film a definite &#34;is it too late to start a new movie&#34; flick.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|my boyfriend had found The Weekend on you tube by chance...we loved the music and the lyrics, and the mood it set, so I ordered them.  Definitely recommend the trilogy if you enjoy the genre of music
B008YRVW0I|1.0|It's so cool I hate it.I played it and then  when I couldn't  I play it anymore.  So now it's my worst favorite game .!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Makes since right?<br /><br />Gm
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Gives an accurate, easily understood battery level so you can keep on playing with no worries. Works well on my kindle fire hd. Would recommend -everyone should have one!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is another great season to a fantastic series.  I have caught myself speaking to my television, rooting for things to happen.  Even though this season takes place in the 1920's there is still relevancy for today.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|too bad it does not run longer and you have to wait a year for the next season. good show
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A relaxing game you just can not put down.  Keep coming back to it every time I turn on my Kindle. All of the Game Circus games fall into this category.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|a little long at times. did not understand why it is called skyfall. sounds like a code word which was said 1 time in the movie but it did not connect to anything.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|If you want to know all about the arm pit of the world, by all means buy this book. If you are looking for a good story, buy something else
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game on the kindle it's not as good as the pc version but its still a great game
B0089LOKHG|2.0|This book started out great, the back and forth between perspectives was great, and the emotion between Lena and Alex was great...until the last two pages. The ending of this book was so rushed and anti climactic. It was such a huge disappointment after spending two years waiting to find out what happens to Lena and Alex. This is the worst ending of any series I have ever read. I am officially removing my Lauren Oliver fan card. Don't purchase this book. Wait till it is free to check out at your local library. It was not worth the wait in any way.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Entertaining, fast-paced and intriguing plot line.  There were times when I could forget that it was not a live-action movie.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game I got as free AOTD and let me just say I was impressed with the it. I think there are way to many match 3 games out there now. So I wasn't expecting much but I found that apart from it just being a 3 gem game it doubles as a puzzle in the sense that you have to unblock and unfreeze some of the gems to complete game. The story is another plus as you progress across the 80 days. Glad I got it as AOTD but I would of gadly paid the $4.99 for it thats how good I found it. KFHD download.
0316017930|5.0|Of all the many books I have read over a lifetime, this is one of the most interesting. It explains why some very talented people succeed while other equally gifted people do not. I can see the reasons for different levels of success even among my own siblings. I HIGHLY recommend this book. I have also read &#34;The Tipping Point&#34; and am now reading &#34;Blink&#34; by this same author.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This maybe long but it was worth. There came some confusion towards the end but it ended like a neat little package of horror a.d suspense.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I can't say I love it, but its somewhat user friendly.  You just have to figure out where everything is.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The Twitter app downloaded fast and installed effortlessly.  Upon opening I entered my password,  and it has functioned ever since.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This is not the app for the kindle fire hd 8.9.  It's actually the 'normal' facebook.  I did find an app that worked better.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Excellent !!!  A great family weekend watching this movie !!! I recommend this movie for a evening in family and friends.
B00AHTYGRW|1.0|i hate getting ripped off.  Bought this to have in my collection, as I like the movie very much.  However the flixster Ultra ZViolet download would not download.  IT is a problem that Flister has been working on for weeks with no resolve.<br />I DO HAVE WHAT WHAT I WANTED A COPY FOR MY IPOD.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Felt most of the book was childish, didn't keep me reading.Think with her talent she could have done better. Only my opinion!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I likened this book a futuristic Charlie and The Chocolate Factory - really clever storyline.<br /><br />It is really for a younger demographic, teens I'd say, but my women's book group enjoyed it overall.  Entertaining.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. Ben Affleck is phenomenal, playing his role low key, but very intense. Of course, Alan Arkin gives and outstanding performance, and John Goodman is a hoot as always. This movie brought back  a lot of memories of the way things were back in the 70's.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is the BEST hungry shark game I have ever played! You have to like this game, and you can really see the 3D!!! I would also highly recommend this game to anyone! I also like the choice of the tilt and touch controls, and that it is free.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|This move, on its own, is quite entertaining.  In regards to the movie resembling the works of E.R. Burroughs, a lot of &#34;Artistic License&#34; went into the movie.  I would suggest seeing the movie before reading the Barsoom stories.
B008OJ28U4|4.0|I must admit I wasn't expecting too much from this release, but Jeff did a great job &#34;reinventing&#34; these songs to fit his own style and sound. And man does he sound good! The production on this release is as good as you'd expect from Lynne and the songs are all well crafted though some songs fit the concept better than others.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I bought this movie for my dad's birthday and  he couldn't even tell if it was new or used copy
B00B2QA646|5.0|I have seen this movie three times already, I love it so much! It is absolutely beautiful with its imagery and I felt so convinced of the romance in it.  This movie is like a play, and is so fantastical in the way it is portrayed.  It is very unique which made me love it even more.  The dance scene is amazing, the dresses are gorgeous, the scenery is beautiful; this is a new favorite movie of mine.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|This was the best deal I have ever gotten on books I have been wanting to read these books for so long but buying the books individually was pretty expensive
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Patti Smith eloquently tells the story of a beautiful love that moved from lover to friend but they were always equal.
B0000C1733|5.0|Besides being one of my favorite bands this album is awesome and plays like new even got it for a good price
B000PMG16U|5.0|the discs work great and are perfect in every way! My father has wanted theses movies for a long time and he is amazing happy that he got them on blueray
B008MEM24S|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles and likes to think. It is great for kids of all ages and easy to learn to play
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I have not been able to open this app.  I have tried everything. help I want to play this.  help
B000000OTU|5.0|This is my favorite aerosmith album so I was happy to get this copy for my dad because it is also one of his favorite albums
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The technical aspects do seem needed but got me a little bored. The overall message was wonderful and as I felt heaven would be in a sense.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Terminator two has always been one of My favorite movies even though I Don't watch it often when I do is great
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Don't ask me to explain it, but this is one of my top five films for stress relief.  It calms me down, in spite of Walter.  There's a lot of F-bombs; my mom would want you to know that before watching.  Love those Coen brothers...and Bob Dylan.
B000003TA4|5.0|CD copy like new sounds great in CD player can't even tell that it was a used copy bought from internet
B005K2XUPK|4.0|First, if you're looking for a case that has a stand or a  band to hold your tiny hand, this is not it. It's a case. But it's a very nice case. The fabric is high quality as is the stitching. It's somewhat padded but I haven't managed to drop it yet, so I can't say how well it protected the device. It has a strong velcro closure and is a snug fit for the Kindle. It's compact and not bulky so it fits in a handbag. The price is right. I'm a happy customer.
B002O3Z50Q|5.0|By far one of the best movies brad Pitt has ever made the quality of this movie is great even the parts when he has no shirt on
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I know this film is Science Fiction but have a powerful message. We must take care of our planet, we must love our mother earth and not destroy her with wars because of greed. That is what we are seeing today on our precious Earth please don't destroy the trees and all green I pray for this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My nephew loves this game so much that he won't even let me use my kindle sometimes and I have to literally take it away from him
0765325950|4.0|I read the book super quickly but I think that is product of the pace of this book. It cover such a epic scope of place and people that it seemed to just fly by to quickly. I believe this just because the number of story lines that had to be tied up or brough to some kind of conclusion. I am not sure that I am satisfied with book for just that reason. Or maybe I am. I know that Sanderson was brought on to write just 3 books to end the series but I think it may have benefited just one more book. With that being said I am going to reread the book.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is my favorite Disney movie of all time so I was glad to find a good copy at such a great price
B004Q3SGNK|5.0|Very well acting nice story!<br />Recommend to all I will see<br />This movie again,hd picture looks very good on my tv
B00027JZ3E|5.0|I was very surprised to find this movie at a good price because of the popularity that followed it. In new condition
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I like the actors and it had some nice moments but it did not wow me.  The best part was probably the father/daughter relationship that developed between Harrison Ford and Rachel McAdams.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|This is movie has had one of the biggest cult followings so to get it at a great price and copy was amazing
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I enjoyed the plot twists and the way the characters developed.  Bad make up job, but overall entertaining.  There were some unanswered plot issues, but the acting made up for it.  Better than I expected.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Me and my dad absolutely love this movie and enjoy the quality of the movie it self. One of the best classic movies to exist
B004XZR63M|4.0|I already read this book many years ago, bought this for my 12 year old son. Great read for explaining the difference between what we've been taught and what we should teach our children about business, income, debt etc... Only wish my dad gave it to me when I was a kid. My son loves it. Not a how to book with useful tips, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I highly recommend it for people of all ages. When you're done with this one, his Cash Flow Quadrant is a must read!
6304779607|5.0|This movie was great for my dad's birthday. He really enjoyed watching it. It was a good copy and price. Great bargain
B003CR9BYE|5.0|This CD is restful, beautiful music...I was already familiar with the Sinatra/Jobim combination. Wonderful collection! I accidentally bought two, but decided to keep both and give one to a friend who is a musician and music lover. She loves it too!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I didn't like Daniel Craig at first as the new James Bond. Not a typical good looking agent 007. I thought Casio Royale was ok and Quantom of Solace was confusing! But Skyfall on the other hand was amazing. And Daniel Craig is starting to grow on me. This movie was great all around; specially the sound score! This movie is definitely worth buying!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I'm a fan of this show but have some diffulty being near a TV set on the evenings that it airs largely due to day-job that usually goes into the night. Trying to follow closely, They're running Season 8; I'm about to start Season 7.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This film was moving on so many levels...and very thought-provoking while being thoroughly entertaining and not maudlin. It made me look at myself and wonder what unspoken, unknown barriers to shared humanity I possess and sub-consciously &#34;act&#34; upon ...whether the person is severely disabled or black or from another culture. Too often we are &#34;politically correct&#34; but not truly socially aware and fully engaged with people who are different from us. It's a treat and a delight to experience.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|very interesting story.  stayed true to book.  liked the storyline and the special effects were great.  worth taking a look at.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I recommend this book to young and old, male and female. Not only does this diary have historical value, but puts you right there with the group hiding for two years.  You clearly experience their challenges and strengths. I kept thinking \\"how would I have handled this\\" as I read about each situation that occurred.  I couldnt put it down. Would never had been interested in reading it, if it were not a selection of my neighborhood book club!
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|They've still got it!  This album is just as great as their previous albums. &#34;Because We Can&#34; sets the tone for the entire album. Can't help but sing and dance right along with them. You won't be disappointed.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a quick read but the emotion packed into this book makes you truly feel like you are \\"participating\\".
B004QPUGRW|5.0|I bought this for a class and it is wonderful. Excellent to use when practicing at home to make sure you are in a pose correctly.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Most incredible production; just like a great book you can't put down!!!  I can't wait for the next season!!!  The cast is awesome and so believable in each of their roles.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I've been using this for about 3 weeks and it works great so far.  It fits perfectly into the phone and the car outlet.  The coiled cord is very convenient and the LED light is not overpowering at night.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|But didn't care for the ending....but would still recommend it for others to watch. He's still a good actor for sure
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I was first drawn to the Beautiful Creatures series when o heard the movie was  based on it. Now I am one goaltenders to read the book prior to seeing the movie. So I dutifully downloaded it to my kindle. After the first book, I was hooked to Lena and Ethan. Their connection and the cast of characters that make up Carlin County's two intertwined worlds is both refreshing and riveting.<br /><br />Beautiful Darkness gives us a deeper glimpse and understanding of the caster world and the order of things. Amma has become my favorite of the supporting characters. This story is on  that makes their connection an  live real. Life an  love doe  not always  end unhappily ever after... sometimes it's complicated.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love all the G5 games they are fun and it always keep me interested.I would recommend this game to my family and friends.Virtual City keeps me wanting more and in a hurry to complete the current goal.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. Plenty to keep you entertained for hours. Unlock New games and the bonus is it's free!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As I was reading the book, I would watch an episode of the show. I always ensured I read before I watched, as that seems to be the best to do. While doing so, I noticed the show started to anger me due to the lack of detail. I know this is expected, but there were points in the book that are key to the whole story.<br /><br />With that being said, George R. R. Martin said it best at the end of this book, if detail is the devil to books, this book has a lot of devils. The amount of detail he goes into is awesome and well thought out. It is a lot, but he states everything for a reason.<br /><br />A GREAT read, and I can't wait to continue the series.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|First, I am not a Facebook fan. I only downloaded this APP to view pictures on my daughter's Facebook. The navigation on this app is horrible. I finally just went to WEB and entered the Facebook address. Much easier. I finally deleted the APP from my Kindle. Don't waste your memory!

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Although the literature is replete with recounts of near death experiences, this specific NDE is unique for 2 reasons : 1st) the subject (and author) is a neurosurgeon with sophisticated medical training ; 2nd) the subject (and author) claims he had “forgotten some key aspects about himself” and that this was beneficial as it allowed him “to go deep into realms beyond the wordly without having to worry about what I was leaving behind”. He says that this allowed him to “travel deeper than almost all NDE subjects before me”.<br /><br />Dr Alexander does not come across as a “soft headed sentimentalist” but rather as someone who is well aware to be gambling his professional reputation by recounting his NDE experience in a time when the view of human consciousness held by most scientists is one that “it is composed of digital information – data, that is, of essentially of the same kind used by computers. … Consciousness is nothing more than a very complex computer program.” Since he has more to lose than to gain by recounting his story, he comes across as sincere when he says that “I see it as my duty – both as a scientist and hence as a seeker of truth, and as a doctor devoted to helping people – to make it known to as many people as I can that what I underwent is true, and real, and of stunning importance. Not just to me to all of us.”
B000FP2Z1C|4.0|You might think as you're buying this album why it is so cheap on vinyl. And that is simple; There are 3 parts to this album in vinyl format:<br />1: The album sleeve,<br />2: The record jacket,<br />3: The record itself.<br />And the record itself is very much like 80's records. Very flimsy, not like the newer 180 grams. But it doesn't sound all too bad. I think though you should get the album on another format first (CD, mp3 download, you get the picture) before getting this on vinyl, so that you already know the songs and how loud they sound and so on and so forth. It does though have an extra song on it, \\"But Tonight We Dance\\", which is only on the vinyl format, so thats pretty cool. In conclusion, it might not be the greatest thing you have ever heard on vinyl, but hey, you're only spending $12.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|As opposed to the reviews in 2012 I believe this application is well worth the money. It is also a life saver. It gives you the ability to create spreadsheets, word documents, and powerpoints. I think that's mainly what most people need. With its recent update it is much, much more user friendly and beautiful to look at. I recommend getting a bluetooth keyboard to maximize its efficiency of use. Using the Kindle Fire's default touch keyboard can be a bother at most times. I am completely satisfied with this purchase and I hope many others will too.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Good sequence to the others.  I felt I needed to see it given the publicity and liking of the preceding versions.  However, there was too much emphasis on special effects and not enough on the story.  Definitely I found this to be of much lesser enjoyment than the previous ones.  Also was disappointed with the demise of M.  Obviously a new sequence in the works.  I hope it is more like the Casino Royale than this recent one.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson writes another great John Corey action story, complete with the wit and humor only he can get away with.  But you get a bonus because Paul Brenner joins John and Kate in this one!
B00BHMF578|5.0|The suspense was riveting even though I knew the outcome.  I felt the fear when the people visited the bazaar.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|These cpu is super fast, the K lets you overclock the chip upwards of 4.5ghz safely with water cooler, HD 4000 built in graphics chip works splendid with my 3 monitor display, I use it mostly for videos and excel so I don't need that demanding of a graphics card. Great buy!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Disney has produced computer-animated movies that haven't been touched by the magnificent folks from Pixar, and have had decent success doing so... Wreck-It Ralph is the pinnacle of their efforts!
0439023513|5.0|My daughter love to read these books.  She has every one of them. She was able to use them for school reading.
030758836X|1.0|Always remember best-selling books often have no literary value.  Writing is horrible, story line is far from intelligent, and story-line takes you nowhere.  Rarely do I force myself to finish a book so poorly written, but did so at the request of a friend in order to evaluate and discuss.  Do not waste your time or money on this book.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks did not let me down. This is a thriller of a book that keeps your guessing until the end. But, the same old Sparks romance shines thru the book.
1938469011|4.0|A bit geeky but since hops are fully 1/4 of the equation of what beer is made of, if you want to understand different beer styles, this book is indispensible to learning what makes beer tick.  Stan has a very conversational style and with a center section which is essentially a dictionary of the many types of hops in use today.  Even if your just a quaffer, this is a good book but if you have beer cicerone aspirations, this book is pretty much required as part of your beer education.
B004GXZ69W|1.0|Poor accuracy resulting excessive tension in my wrist and movements. Hand position not  quite vertical. 3M's vertical mouse is much better than this one. Not recommended.
B00A14SQBU|3.0|It is an ok album. There seems to be songs you cant even understand the words. But other songs are nice.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Totally worth the price! 20 minute workouts and 3 different levels to choose from...I haven't been able to do the workouts daily, but I never feel like I need to do more once I've done the workout. Just remember you need to have some hand weights to do the workouts!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|So original and just fun to watch.  Jane Lynch is amazing in this.  You won't be dissappointed if you rent this.

B008220DGE|4.0|Paul Thomas Anderson is one of those directors that I can't help but respect, even if I don't always respond to his films in the way that I would expect to.  I've seen all of his theatrical offerings and I love the way he pieces his films together.  They are truly `director heavy' films that thrive on his knack for building tension with such visual and visceral flare.  Even when his films don't complete themselves in the way I want them to, Anderson colors so many of his frames with such rich backstory and character development that you can't help but be drawn to the film as a whole.  He's had two masterpieces as far as I'm concerned; `There Will be Blood' and `Boogie Nights', and after that his films run from messy (Punch Drunk Love) to cluttered (Magnolia) to sincere (Hard Eight) and I'd say that `The Master' is certainly sincere, if not a tad messy.  Anderson has so many ideas associated with his films that it takes a really steady hard to reign them all in, and he's managed that before but something about `The Master' feels incomplete, which is sad considering how much brilliance is here.<br /><br />There was a ton of hoopla made over this film before it was even released thanks to the obvious ties to Scientology and the fact that that particular `religion' (if that is what you call it) is all over the media thanks to Tom Cruise, and so there was an almost immediate interest in the film regardless of what camp you are in.  This is where my main issues with the film come in, because I don't feel as though the presence of `The Cause' (the film's version of Scientology) was developed enough.  As far as the character development is concerned, this film is marvelous.  The development of Freddie and Lancaster and even Dodd's wife are all marvelously entangled into the fabric of every frame and for that I was in awe, but `The Cause' itself and the meaning it symbolizes never felt wholly constructed.<br /><br />It felt secondary.<br /><br />The film centers on a relationship that builds between two men who are seemingly very different and yet ultimately very much the same, just at two polar ends of their life journeys.  Freddie Quell is a lost soul, damaged from his time serving in World War II and constantly searching for a place where he feels stable.  Lancaster Dodd has found that place.  Granted, he had to create it himself, but it is a place where he feels important and meaningful and necessary.  As `the master', Dodd heads a movement known as `The Cause' that practices some questionable tactics in the preservation of faith and life and is met with skepticism and downright loathing by some around him.  As his loyal wife notes, he's constantly under attack.  Both of these men are equally lost in their struggles to find worth and yet one of them has self-created a world in which he understands the meaning of life.  Through these men, the desperation to believe in something, anything, which can ground your life, is seen in spades.<br /><br />I chuck a lot of this up to the brilliant dual performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  I don't think either man has ever been better.  These two performances really anchor this film and play such beautiful compliment to one another.  I'm just in awe of what these men were able to achieve.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman reigns in his usual antics to create a more internalized and complex portrait of a man trying desperately to compose himself.  I love how you can see in his more dramatic moments that he truly is the more polished version of Freddie Quell.  He was probably once a powder keg, exploding at the lightest brush with resistance, but over time he has built for himself this façade of a life where he is in control and people need him.  His smile, his versing, his steely determination; all fabrications to allude to a life understood when Dodd is obviously just as lost as all his `sheep'.<br /><br />He truly is making it all up as he goes along.<br /><br />Phoenix is a total revelation as Quell.  I'm completely speechless about this performance and yet I really feel as though I need to muster words to express how magnificent he is here.  I instantly call to mind Heath Ledger's performance in `Brokeback Mountain', and then obviously that very Oscar race.  This isn't to say that the two performances are similar in scope but that they are both complete characters created from the ground up but these actors.  Ledger was uncanny as Ennis, creating this man who was so wounded by a backstory never divulged that `every word was a struggle' and it showed.  Phoenix, like Ledger, colors Quell with so much backstory even if it is never uncovered completely.  Each mannered tick and obvious emotional imbalance is beautifully tuned into the core of this man.  The way he talks, the way he forms his words and fights with his own thoughts is miraculously detailed by Phoenix.  His processing scene alone is one of the most engrossing and wrenching movie moments of this year and any other.<br /><br />It's sad that in both of these cases, they lost the Oscar to mimicry.<br /><br />At the end of the day, `The Master' is a riveting experience.  The performances, the score (which is essential to the tone of the film), the cinematography and beautifully etched physicality of the film are all so powerful to witness.  Sadly, the script seems somewhat devoid of a complete thought.  It builds up to an ending that falls slightly short of revolutionary, which is sad considering that explosively rich ending tagged onto `There Will be Blood'.  That isn't to say that Hoffman's song to Quell isn't stirring (could honestly be Hoffman's best scene) but the fact that `The Cause' took such a backseat to all else in the film made the film's conclusion feel underwhelming.<br /><br />That being said, I'd highly recommend one watch this a few more times (myself included) before passing final judgment.x is a total revelation as Quell.

1609611543|1.0|Author recommends limiting fruit intake. Two strawberries? I laughed. Who eats two strawberries? 14 blueberries? Again, laughed. The info on wheat is interesting and doubtlessly helpful to many folks struggling with various health issues. That's the first part of the book.<br /><br />This is the Atkins diet with a back-to-nature bent. Eat meat, dairy and lots of fat and minimize the carbs. Make sure it's all minimally processed. Cut the grains or minimize them if one can tolerate them (no wheat, of course).<br /><br />My problem with the book is that I eat 70%-80% of daily calories from carbs (mostly fruit) and minimize fat. I also eat very little animal products. According to the author I must be fat and have terrible blood work: high triglycerides, high cholesterol and so on. None of this is true. My blood work is excellent and I have a great BMI. Skinny, not fat. I also take my blood glucose reading regularly and have no issues with blood sugar.<br /><br />A cardiologist recommending that folks eat a lot of meat, cheese and fat?
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was recommended by my friend who loved the 50 Shades series... but, in my opinion, this series is better than 50 Shades BY FAR. Can't wait for the last book!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I do not make many recommendations, but this is the kind of book you never want to end. It grabs your interest from page 1. I will definitely read everything by this author.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|really enjoy the thrill of this drive! always wanted to drive a dune buggy! now I can drive a dune beggy without getting hurt each time I crash!
B001NBEWN6|3.0|This curious story, told in a somewhat disjointed fashion, failed to amuse.  Slogging through some mysterious terrain that could be in the Middle East or South Asia or who knows were, was not an entirely salubrious experience, especially since I found no compelling characters
B009JZTOG8|5.0|What a great twist to the traditional fairytales I grew up with.  Awesome show.  Can't wait for the next episode.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i love this app it gets hard sometimes but it just makes you want to play more i play this alot
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I purchased this gadget for my grandmother, who is 86 and wears hearing aids in both ears. She uses it at home for watch TV and says it helps quite a bit. She has also used it at a live performance, where she liked having the control and privacy of using her own devise. We have yet to try it outdoors, but I think it was a smart purchase so far!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This film is very striking and quality-made as is to be expected from director David Fincher.  The movie is an American adaptation of the novel by Steig Larsson not a remake of the 2009 Swedish film, I clarify, since some refer to the 2009 adaptation as \\"the original\\"; this film is also an original and is a quite superior adaptation of the novel in my opinion (the 2009 version's only superiority being that it is Swedish like the novel). It is definitely better cast than the Swedish version with the actress portraying androgynous, hacker Lisbeth actually believable as a young woman in her early 20's; and the look of the character is more effortless, stylish and realistic, not cartoonish, cliche or forcibly put together like that of the swedish adaptation. The magnificent performances in addition to the superb cinematography, score and editing make a nearly three hour film flow with consistent interest for the viewer who is never bored, lost or disengaged(whether they have read the novel or not).  For those not familiar with the novel or it's content, be prepared, some of the violent sequences are quite graphic, but they are what make the film so effective.  The quality of the blu-ray meets the film's excellence and delivery by amazon and their pre-order discount are always beyond compare. That said, I couldn't help feel utter disappointment when I received the blu-ray combo. I was particularly excited to get a digital copy of the film to add to my iPod, but discovered that UltraViolet digital copies function in a very convoluted manner.  This 'digital copy' is merely license to online streaming and cannot be transferred or downloaded to iTunes, only to devices themselves; therefore this rules out getting use of the numerous gigabytes of an ipod classic or other non-wifi devices.  Now that I am familiar with ultraViolet digital copies I am never purchasing such a combo again, I'd rather download from iTunes than foment the sale of these 'digital copies'. I suggest avoiding them!

B001QFZADA|5.0|I wish he wouldn't  talk so much about his book, in his book, but It sure has everything people seem to be missing in relationships, at all levels.
0425263908|5.0|I devoured this book. I could not get enough of Eva and Gideon. Sylvia Day's writing style is superb.  I felt everything in this book to the max.  My emotions were on overdrive. The relationship and back story to Eva and Gideon empties you and makes your heart feel hollow to filling it up to the brim in the next scene with so much love and butterflies.  I felt like I would burst.  I know this book is compared to Fifty Shades, but it's so much more intense.  It's an emotional roller coaster ride, that is worth all the stomach clenching moments.  I felt like this book had a lot more to offer than just steamy sex scenes.  It had real characters with flaws and problems.  This is the story of two people with broken pasts trying to move on and be together.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Quotable lines fraught with meaning throughout .  Awesome story lines... many of them, and the action, tension, suspense,  yet calm, soothing voices of Pi and Ian create a superb balance.
B00AEFXCLU|4.0|Story stated consistant with the those I have read in Heavy Metal. As far as SCI-FI movies go not a waste of time.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I wouldn't say this is my favorite of the X-men films, maybe because there's no Wolverine, but it certainly is another excellent addition to the series.
0345404475|5.0|Great book! I have read and watched both movie versions and still find this book as riviting as the others. After watching a documetory on the author, I cant wait to read some of the other writing he has published.

B00846WWVM|4.0|1st off - this game was very &#34;well-produced&#34; - I thought the sound, graphics, animations are all very nice and slick.  Gameplay is fairly simple.  I can enjoy the game, but it doesn't addict me (which is actually a positive thing - less time wasted, more of a quick break type of game).
B007L3BMGA|2.0|If you're going into this book with two brain cells to rub together then don't even bother. This is not a thinking person's book, and it knows it too. It isn't trying to wow you with a good story. It doesn't have interesting characters and it doesn't have good writing. It's smut and if you want smut then ... well here you go.

B005LAIHCW|5.0|I collect movies of Jennifer Lawrence and this movie is really good.  Jennifer did a super (excellent) job on that movie and I enjoy it so much.  It is a kinda of Horror movie but very good.  It is about a young girl who was supposed to die after fell off swing and she turned up and killed both parent and parent's son tried to hide her from outside.  You will see the rest.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I know this has gotten mixed reviews, but I found it fascinating and surprisingly comforting.  When I think back on the book, I only remember how peaceful he felt and how loved.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|It is really great 2nd season and I wanted to watch before 3rd season come up so I can remember the shows or I can say, review before 3rd season.  It is so much to say, but you will enjoy it so much.

0062014536|2.0|I put off reading the \\"Delirium\\" series for nearly a year after the first book came out, watching the reviews and finally broke down and read it straight through then RUSHED to get the second book.  Both the first and the second left me with my heart breaking and anxiously awaiting the conclusion.<br /><br />Which fizzled out in disappointment.<br /><br />One reviewer said that the writer has improved since her first book, which may be, but I got the feeling that the passion for the story was gone by the time she got to the end.  From the first chapter, I had to struggle to get involved in these same characters that I so loved and identified with in the first two books.  By the time I got a quarter way through, I just didn't care. I seriously had to force myself to finish it.<br /><br />One of the factors that killed the momentum was the back and forth narration of Hana and Lena.  I would get all caught up in Lena's life then - BAM! turn the page, I'm back in Portland with Hana. A few pages in, I'm seeing life through Hana's eyes then I turn the page and get whiplashed back to the Wilds or whereever Lena is.  The stories would jumble around for a few paragraphs before I could get back into the rhythm of the plot(s).<br /><br />So that in the end, as several people have pointed out, nothing is really resolved in the end, too many open-ended questions.  The last couple of chapters feel like the pilot of a dramatic TV series - you're watching it like it's a movie, but instead of a resolution, you see that the hero/heroine/whomever is just beginning their fight before the old one has completely ended.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'm disappointed with the format, the ending, and generally the overall feel of this book. The rest of the series was smashing, this should have /could have closed the series with much more power.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Amazing season! Not for the faint of heart or squeamish though! This season picks up the events chronicled in Martin's classic Clash of Kings, with brilliant visuals. With a few variants to the original text, the season stays quite true to the original, with amazing pacing and building of tension. Wish I could give it 10 stars! Now, if only Mr. Martin would finish the series....

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|package came on time, all DVD's worked perfectly - LOVING this series!!! Maggie Smith is simply the best, rest of the cast plays their characters wonderfully!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Makes you feel for Pi. I could put it down. Piscine is a great story teller. But i feel that it's a book to be read before seing the movie.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is addicting and competing against my brother makes it even better. I only rate it 4 because the prizes cost so much in comparason to the ammount of coins that can be earned each run
0062075195|5.0|This book is great for my pre-teen! She loves Lauren Conrad! We cannot wait for the next books to come out so we can read the whole series!
B00275EHJQ|5.0|All the Toy Storys are well done.  And the way that each movie relates to a real part of most people's lives makes the movies come alive again and again.  TS3 ended on a positive, yet melancholy note, and made one feel good about all the transitions there are in life.  Excellent film.<br />Now I want to see the 3D version.  Gotta upgrade!
0439023513|1.0|Huge disappointment.  First book, great.  Second book, not great. Third book, waste of resources.  Can't even read past the first few chapters
630587493X|5.0|Okay - after Patch Adams and some other Robin Williams efforts I was &#34;afraid&#34; of this movie.  I didn't see it until 2012.  And I was really surprised.  Embeth Davidtz is a woman I remembered liking so much in Mansfield Park.  In this movie she is quite good.  Robin is also very good.  The story is thoughtful and not sappy.  Okay the ending is good and not a downer so maybe that ruins it for some.  Check it out.  It is based on Isaac Asimov stories.  Nice movie.
0439023491|2.0|My husband loved the first book so I thought I'd be a great wife and get him the next two in the series and he has barely made it through the first few chapters of this book. . ..

B004XZ99LO|5.0|I applaud the performers for their talent and for the countless hours they must practice to be able to perform the masterful way they do.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn manages a thrilling ride that also dives deep into gender roles and our preconceptions about what a 'man' is and what a 'woman' is. However, Flynn's unreliable narrator is no Humbert Humbert and as a result the reader is left feeling slightly manipulated by the end of the thing. Granted, Flynn pulls it off but there was a point where I felt cheaply deceived by the narrator. Still, I'd recommend the book to almost anyone. Great read.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I enjoy action movies  and this movie has that and much more. When this movie was in the theatres I could not leave my seat being afraid I would miss something. When it came out on DVD I just had to get it. I just can't see it to many times. If you like action movies you have to get this movie.
B0007OCG56|5.0|Wonderful journey of intercultural relations.  Because we are different we are not more or less relavant.  A wonderful journey in personal anc cultural growth.<br /><br />I'd seen it years ago and bought it on a thin memory - am I glad I did.  Wonderful story, memorable characters.  A joy to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this app is so realistic. I wish I had a horse. This is why the app is so great
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Not exactly a representative or accurate picture of a stately home community, but compelling drama. Kind of a classy soap opera for those who appreciate fine sets/mis en scene constructed with an exquisite sense of the period and fine attention to detail.
B0015AARJI|1.0|this ended up not working so I returned it- the amount was promptly returned to my credit card for which I am grateful. At least there is good customer service if you are unsastisfied :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read the trilogy, and it was hard to put the book down and do other things.  It is a must read if you like romance/erotica.
B00B23O96A|2.0|I can't say much good about this new EC album. The theme of this new Eric Clapton seems to be 'lets take it nice and easy' and it really shows. Too much mediocre tunes that just don't inspire me at all. The reggae stuff is awful as is the ballads with the smooth vocals. Where is the fire Eric? Where is the innovation Eric? Where is the soul Eric?<br />Very sad to say as a big Clapton fan this CD has no fire or inspiration for me at all. The production is very polished without the great songs.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Wonderfully story, much different from the movie but a great read. I would recommend this book for all ages, would like to read the other books in the series.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I found the flow, content, and emotional connection to be superb. The characters interaction is very believable as being how things actually transpired. The cinematography had me attracted to each scene. Very &#34;feel good&#34; film.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris brings an honesty to the pages, sance Hollywood bravado, that makes you feel the sand under your boots and the true cost of war. For once, a Warrior unafraid to reveal himself without hiding behind a veneer of blustering badass.<br />  To Chris, May your soul Rest in Peace. To Taya, We can never thank you enough for your sacrifices, or console you enough for your loss.
B00846TRHY|4.0|The theme is easy to believe but there is a sense of discontinuity to the order of events and the realness of accomplishment. Hurrah for the good guy!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I have seen random episodes but there is nothing like getting the entire series from the beginning.  It can be funny, creepy, scary and always very entertaining.  It isn't for young viewers due to violence and some language.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Beautiful scenery and believable interactions of characters make this enjoyable. The idea of such an undertaking gives way to the relationship aspects in a very nice flow.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|i only played it once and now it wont let me play anymore .i was soo excited about playin it but now i no that it doesnt work for kindle fire.
B001AG52AG|5.0|Great movie! This is the 3rd time I've watched it and both my wife and myself enjoyed it from start to finish.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Because I love dogs and I have one, someone told me I should read this book because I would really enjoy it. They were right, I loved it.<br /><br />I'm not going to say much about this story.  I will tell you that<br />this story was told by a dog. That's what made this story special. I fell in love with Enzo and I think you will too. He's a wonderful loving dog. He will make you laugh and he will also have you in tears. This book had a great ending to it.<br /><br />Whether you are a dog lover or not I have a feeling you will enjoy reading this book. I truly recommend this book to anyone.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|My wife had been begging me to watch this with her, so I eventually broke down and watched it. I was surprisingly entertained the entire movie.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book is about a dog, raised in the sun kissed protection of his home, until he is suddenly thrown into the cold world of a sled dog. He faces many life-threatening challenges such as bloodthirsty crazed wolves, starvation, and lack of rest. His adventures take him through different masters and  fierce weather, which he must learn to overcome. I would recommend this to ages 13 and up.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|This movie has been one of my all time favorites and I can finally say that my wife and I finally own it and we can watch it whenever we want.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Its a good movie i enjoyed watching it in HD with no skipping and interuptions. Im happy i got a chance to watch this movie.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|Was a decent movie, but I honestly enjoyed the original more. It was entertaining so that's all I can ask for I guess.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think this is a fun game. It does take time to clear away all the stuff on the island and put the habitats where you want them. I do think that the dragons that we are suppose to have for a quest we should be able to buy with our coins.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Kristen Stewart has never been one of my favorite actresses, but Charlize Theron was amazing. It was ok but I wouldn't rent it again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this show is great, keeps u wanting more..lovee it so much!! u never know what to expect, its really awesome!
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|I had intended on seeing this in the theaters, but unfortunately never got around to it. We rented it in HD on amazon prime on our roku and while it was quite long, the scenery and movie was amazing. We loved every minute of it.
1250007305|4.0|I've been really down on fiction lately.  Most SciFi writers I've been reading lately haven't held my interest.  I loved this book.  The characters were believable, the technical parts were real, and the whole storyline was exciting.  I can't wait to read Trojan Horse next.
0062238868|5.0|This was a gift for a friend who was saddened by the death of his hero. Good read. Thank you.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I like Emeli Sande's style and voice reminds me of a young Dolly Parton. Hope she makes it big in America's.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|It was very enjoyable, if you like things slightly off the beaten path.  I happen to love it that way.
0394800192|5.0|And now one of my daughter's too! She absolutely loves it and we read it over and over again. Great fun.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I purchased this book for my nephew and decided to read the first page before wrapping it. I couldn't stop wondering what was next, so I downloaded the book. It had me hooked better then most adult books! ...did I mention I'm 28 lol
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Into the Wild was certainly an eye opener.  It shows the importance of knowing about how brutal nature can be if you don't know what you are getting into.
B00371XIP8|5.0|I loved this one just as much add the first, and that's saying something.Very rarely does a sequel do the first movie justice but they did here.Ask I can honesty say if you haven't seen the first you don't knew what your missing babe!! And they are on Amazon Prime Instant Movies and if any if you movie goers have seem my other reviews ya'll know how awesome I think it is.Just see these movies you won't regret it.
B0012HEB32|3.0|I watched this on the recommendation of a friend and just picked a random episode.  I didn't care for the show but not because it was bad.  It was just a little too dramatic for me.  I like some humor and more action with less drama.  Having said that, it had good acting was an overall good production,  I won't watch anymore; there are so many shows to try out and I don't want to get too far in to a series if it doesn't grab me right away.  Know what I mean?
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I downloaded this book not knowing what to expect. I found myself intrigued in its ideas, terrified by its truthfulness, and amazed by its beautiful depictions. A well written book by all means with an incredibly suspenseful and developed plot. A must read!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|When an abusive relationship turns too dangerous to continue, a young wife makes a run for a new life. In her quest to find security and peace in her new surroundings,she stumbles upon a nice discreet neighbour, and finally someone she hopes to trust. Then she finds herself getting emotionally attached to a young widower and his children.<br />However, her past is not to be taken lightly, and she finds life becomes a game of chase.<br />I would Recommend this book for anyone who enjoys mystery and romance, but caution women who have suffered abuse as this book contains graphic abuse situations. Overall, a very good read with unexpected twists and remarkable writing skills.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|One of the most enjoyable popular music experiences I've had in years!  Just plain fun!  I smiled all the way through.
B004LROUNG|3.0|The book was good but I enjoyed Pelican Brief, A Time to Kill, and others by him that I enjoyed more. Not a bad read but not the best.
0763644765|5.0|Our son loves this book. It's quick, simple and fun. Not saying this will work for everyone, but it did help us get our toddler to the next step with training.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Incredibly addicting bubble scoot game. Got the desktop version off a humble bundle a long while back and really enjoyed that, glad to see the android version was just as responsive and immersive
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Channing Tatum, what more can I say! This was a fun movie not only is Channing Tatum great in this but I llove Matthew McConaughey!
B004UJTG6Q|2.0|I hated this book and request that you don`t read this book either. I think there was to much weird language in this novel.
B00866JL96|5.0|This is a very good movie! I would recommend it to everyone! Zac Efron has really grown into an excellent actor!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was disappointed when I realized the kindle didnt have a calculator on it until i fund this free app for the calculator. The buttons are huge and easy to use
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's a really good story! I love it! I can't wait to read the second book! It should be as  interesting!
B000VHVGM8|5.0|Kevin Klein is stellar in this flick. Love the cast as a whole. If you love Fierce Creatures, then obviously you have seen AFCW! If not, what are you waiting for?!
B00BBQXQFI|3.0|Looked a little &#34;old school&#34; cartoonish. A little scary for smaller kids, I would recommend 5-6 and older. I would watch it again with my kids.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|I got this game looking for something different. My kids loved legos when they were small so at the least I thought it would be cute. I'm pleased to say its fun and cute:). Think I'll keep it:)
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I thought this movie captured the true feelings of the the times. It was heart rendering for me to watch. Mr. Schindler 's actions moved me to tears. What a brave lovely people the Jews were here and are today.
B000FA675C|5.0|Thanks so much, i have bought and read this book already when it first came out in paperback but will now reread on my kindle since you were kind enough to offer it free.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Loved the series b sad to c it ended, it seemed to be as accurate as possible while still entertaining
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I am a 35 year old mother of 3 kids...I don't read these kinds of books, but I can only say God must have led me to this one.  I read this book in one day, and couldn't stop thinking about it last night.  This book has made me a better wife, mother, nurse, woman, and daughter of the King.  I am changed by Adam's and his family's example of selflessness, Godliness, bravery, and love.  May Adam's legacy never die, and may his children be blessed in his memory.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I am collecting these at the moment, not even opened it yet.  But I am sure it will play just fine as the rest of them have.  Great service !!!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I would recommend this for adults and children. Touching story with depth to it. Shed a few tears with this movie.
0345803485|5.0|of course i had to get this product because everyone was raving about it. it was a great read and i cant wait for the movie
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addictive. I like it so much because it has the same idea every time. But its not always the same route.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|I love period, historical novels but this one was just too darned sad for me.  Nothing good ever happened to anyone in the story.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|Although it is a sweet little story and I enjoyed it is a book for preteens and young teens. Halfway through the second book and its getting a bit boring.
1400052181|5.0|The reason you will find 42 1 star reviews is because this book makes white racist uncomfortable. Not only does it expose how black people were treated in this country it destroys the myths of white supremacy . White social scientist taught the African was inferior in every way and here you have a black woman's SUPERIOR DNA body  contributing so much to science. They cannot deny  the facts so they talk of liberal agenda, Oprah, Then most of these right wing so called capitalists want to be critical of her family wanting to be compensated. How dare they? I guess they feel capitalism is great only when poor black folks can be exploited. You are disgusting devils.Basically they want knowledge hidden . They 42 1 star reviews are of the same mindset that attempted to make sure black were denied education . Get this book for your children and teach them about black doctors from Ancient Kemet .
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|I was unable to put the book down when I started reading it.  It is an unbelievable story about what men will do to obtain  their freedom from oppression and wrong.  I find it very difficult to comprehend how men can treat other human beings if such horrible ways.  It was a joy to see how others  were so willing to give of their possession to help others in need. I think God was watching over these men as the made their was over 4,000 miles to India, especially having gone through the Gobi Desert.  This book is a must read.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Do not play this game unless you are ready to be addicted to it.  Simple gameplay, but so much fun.
B000IKM8UM|5.0|Movie is still amazing over 20 years later, I remember watching this film around 7 years old and seeing it at 28 again was even better! And Denzel was a Hunnie and so were his lips lol
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Challenging and entertaining, this game never gets old! Learn the laws of physics through experience as you expel pieces of your orb to propel yourself and fight gravity by gaining enough velocity to keep yourself in orbit. Absorb the smaller orbs or be absorbed yourself by the bigger spheres.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|AWESOME. Buy it. NOW! I would recommend this to the whole world. Catchy tunes, messages about current topics and some fine lyrics to get you moving. This is totally not the genre of music I gravitate too but I love this album. LOVE IT.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Informative, easy to use. Like the 10 day forecast, great for travel purposes. Have found it to be reliable and accurate.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I'm only about 33% through this eBook now, but I am impressed with the depth and quality of the discussion content as well as the experience and expertise of the author.  His work in this field has won a Nobel prize, but he writes in a fluid and clear style.  The book is about our two systems of (what I'll call here) &#34;thinking&#34;.  One is our automatic or intuitive system for forming impressions and assigning causes that is built into (what I'll describe as) the code that runs in our brains (and maybe brains of other animals above some point on the evoluntionary scale).  Think &#34;Blink&#34; or fast thought.  The other is the rational and reasoning part of our thought process that comes into play when prodded into action, often reluctantly it seems.  Think &#34;I think therefore I am&#34;.  The book is full of surprises and interesting info and I find it stimulating and insightful.  I think other readers will too.  Read the abstracts on Amazon and see if you find it interesting
B008BM0IUG|5.0|This book contains lots of information on all if the particles we are affected by everyday. Although it doesn't contain information on the recent discovery of the higgs on March 13 2013 it still gives a thrill on every paragraph. I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in science.
B008M721MS|4.0|This is a great way to visit from afar! I get to see my family more often, especially in these trying times.
0470901071|4.0|Good content, well organised and easy to read. Comes with a CD with materials too. Only thing is not hard cover.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I've only heard positive things about Argo and was not disappointed - very good movie.<br />great acting, and the actors and actresses chosen were an almost perfect resemblance
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I assume you will be reading this message saying &#34;pffft, whatever&#34;, but keep in mind that no one will be mocking or blaspheming God in the day of judgment. (Matt 12:36) I feel every christian should also consider what they consider to be &#34;good&#34;. You wouldn't think it would be unusual for a jew to dislike the name of Hitler, would you? Likewise I also dislike anything that degrades the name of my God. (Exod 20:7) That should be an embarrassment for someone who carries the name of CHRISTopher, he shouldn't even allow that on the script. But God is not willing that any perish but that all come to repentance. (2 Pet 3:9) Turn to Jesus before it's too late whoever is reading this, God is a merciful God that wants to forgive your sins and bring you to heaven. &#34;For whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#34; (Romans 10:13) Eternity is a day that never ends. You don't want to go to the wrong place.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|Most of the action movies I see use acting stars in the lead who aren't capable of performing believably in the hand to hand combat scenes, so they edit the action sequences into teeny tiny micro scene bits in order to hide the inadequacies.  I understand the need to do this but I find this annoying and I feel cheated.  Boy, was this movie a breath of fresh air!  Miss Carano is amazing in the action scenes.  I noticed that even though she was often doing these scenes with acting stars, that they were tasked with making the scenes as believable and entertaining as possible.  The tone and flow of the movie is very good and even the vehicle chase in the woods was well done.  She is so beautiful, that in my opinion she is second to none in the eye candy department, and has an appealing natural acting style.  It would be disappointing if she isn't the next Hollywood action star.  Highly recommended!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Loved it! Denzel once again proved he is a man of many faces.This was a stellar performance gain for him.
B007XHWROK|4.0|Good CD.  It is a good listen for a variety of ages.  All the way from a small child to an adult.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I could listen to this soundtrack endlessly! In fact, I've listened to it every day since I received it. It is beautiful!
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|There are a few good songs.  Not his best album but still it is a very good album.  Still a good choice
B003WKOTXE|4.0|There is not dialogue.  I enjoyed it but not for everyone. Interesting to watch how children have so little seem more content that those who have a lot.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Love Amazon! I am a huge amazon shopper, if I can get it here I do.<br /><br />The App is great. I have the Android verison and the Ipad Version. both work really well.<br /><br />The only negitive I have is the ipad version provides the results from a search on the side of the screen with the first result showing in the large area. It makes it a little hard to view due to it bein so small.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this cute game. Caring for the dragons is simple. This game is so so fun. You get to pick your own name for your habitat. You get to grow dragons! The best part is... it's free! You should totally get it!
B006MGDVIY|4.0|Senna was one the most electrifying drivers F1 has ever known. The film does a good job capturing the highlights of his brilliant but brief career, but I think that they have unfortunately left many aspects of his life unexplored. Emotion is generated in the film by exposition and others talking about how Senna felt instead of growing naturally from footage and construction.<br /><br />That said, Senna is among the best F1 films available, and it's subject a compelling figure.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I've really enjoyed this product. I've never heard of them until I watched the movie &#34;Warm Bodies&#34; and loved the song they played in a specific scene. Some of their other music isn't half bad. The delivery was received in an appropriate time and everything looked great. Shipping information didn't update often, which would be nice. Otherwise everything else went great! I would recommend this.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Had you reading to the end. Had to read till I got it done all  on e sitting. great book
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo is what every movie should be - entertaining.  I've heard comments made on TV about how this movie was historically inaccurate and how it was the Canadians who did 90% of the work of getting the hostages back from Iran.  While this may be true, I say to those people - WHO CARES?  This movie is fast-paced, exciting, funny, and riveting.<br /><br />Ben Affleck does a great job of acting in and directing the movie, and the plot is great.  I just loved the performances by John Goodman and Alan Arkin, and wished they had larger parts.  The scenes in Iran were striking and kept you on the edge of your seat.  How could anyone argue that the final portion of the movie, as the hostages were leaving Iran, wasn't utterly engrossing?  I guess you knew in the end what was going to happen, but it was a great ride getting there.<br /><br />In the age of historically-based films, and especially those that rely on recent events (Zero Dark Thirty is another one that fits this bill), it is really nice to go to theater, watch a movie, and get genuine, unadulterated entertainment.  And that's what Argo gives you.  If I had been an Academy Award voter, this one would have gotten my vote - hands down.<br /><br />If you are a person who revels in the details of a movie, and enjoys picking apart the plot, don't see this one.  But if you are just out for fun and entertainment, make Argo the top of your list.
B005VPRG10|5.0|The box was in perfect condition and delivered on time. Lego is always fun and for those who follow Star Wars this set is a \\"must have\\".
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Nice story. Nice cinematography. But nothing special to give 4 stars.<br />In the journey some mystical things happen. Viewers are left to wonder are they real.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|If you want to do better at what you are doing, stop what you are reading now, and read this book.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I have always loved writing so one day when i get the time and focus I am going to right a book about the many adventures I have been on or some other crap I think may be helpful to people. lol great way to get started and give you a outline on what you need to do ahead of time.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is a cult classic: if you aren't sure about the movies by now, you never will. So I'll talk about the quality of the Blu-ray edition compared to DVD.<br /><br />First of all, these are the full extended editions, at least the first two. I don't care much for the second two so I haven't watched them yet. Might not ever.<br /><br />Anyway, the first two look and sound really good. They don't look as good as new releases on Blu-ray of course, but they did more than just go back to the original (which even back then the film quality was better than DVD). They obviously cleaned it up a bit and did some processing on it to make the movies look even more sharp and detailed. Some scenes are better than others. For example, the dropship scene in Aliens is a little bit better. But the entry into the aliens' nest was breathtaking.<br /><br />For suspense/action movies, these are still difficult to beat and have stood the test of time. Between the near-perfect pacing, creepy sound track, effective use of light and dark, etc. these are cinematic masterpieces. I watch them on a regular basis, maybe every 2-3 months. I never grow tired of it even after all these years, and I am very grateful to have them on Blu-ray so I can experience the movie on my big screen almost as if I were in the theater many years ago.<br /><br />P.S. No matter how many times I watch Aliens, I always have to swear at Spunkmeyer for leaving the dropship and wandering around on an alien-infested planet. He ruined everything!
B00454U1NS|5.0|What a variety of music on this CD.  Some songs I had never heard before, and quickly becoming favorites.  A must have for Pink fans!!
B003YHSE7W|4.0|As usual with superhero movies, this one looks and sounds great. As usual with sequels, the story falls a little flat compared to the original. Given how cheap Blu-rays are on Amazon, it's probably worth buying though.<br /><br />I don't watch movies like this expecting an award-winning performance or story. I don't expect it, and am not let down. What I am let down by is the one-dimensional villain (Ivan) who barely talks or even twitches a facial muscle the entire movie. The other bad guy, Hammer, is just plain old annoying. There are too many forced subplots as well such as the SHIELD guys showing up, the &#34;new element&#34; part, etc. I understand they need to tie the Avengers together, but for how much the writers get paid, they could have come up with an idea that both integrates better with the rest of the movie while being more entertaining.<br /><br />Also, LtCol Rhodes is a different actor. He tries hard but doesn't have the demeanor of the first actor. Oh well, doesn't make a big difference but it is noticeable.<br /><br />I have watched this twice now. The first time I hated it, then my children wanted to see it so I watched it again. The second time it grew on me a little and I don't hate it anymore, but it's still not as good as the first one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is a good game anybody who likes building and controlling  will like this game. Check it out yall this game is awesome.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I watched this movie in the theater. While it has its plot holes and is not what many people expected from a prequel, I think it is a good movie.<br /><br />The story is a bit flimsy, but I'm not sure there is a way to set up the phenomenal movies of Alien and Aliens that wouldn't be flimsy. It is almost one of those back stories that is better off not filled in. Regardless, I knew going into it that an Alien prequel would be some tall shoes to fill. Besides, it is an action/suspense movie, I wasn't expecting an award winning screenplay.<br /><br />Visually, the movie is very good. Many special effects were filmed the old fashioned way with puppets, wires, etc. and edited only slightly. This adds a nice touch compared to some movies where entire sequences are either blue screened or just pure CGI. The visual effects honestly reminded me of Terminator 2, the first A movie to have a lot of computer effects. Both movies used CGI sparingly and to great effect.<br /><br />Despite some of the shortcomings of the movie, I like it and bought this at full price when it became available. There are only two real gripes I have about the movie.<br /><br />The movie has an R rating due to a single scene near the end. If they were not going to edit or omit that scene to reduce the rating, why couldn't they make other scenes more gory and worthy of an R rating? It wouldn't have hurt.<br /><br />Second, it takes suspension of disbelief to accept interstellar travel and other sci-fi elements in this movie. I am okay with that. I'll take quite a bit of sci-fi in a movie and be okay with it. Even a machine that can perform automated surgery... in the future! In space! Fine. But if a machine can perform surgery, why not go all the way and give it a laser that can cauterize and seal flesh instead of using staples I can buy at the store? For a real humorous take on this, youtube the honest trailer for this movie. See what a person can do after having surgery. Walking hurts: but running and rappelling is okay?<br /><br />Anyway, I like the movie but can't give it five stars. It was good, but not on par with the original Alien and Aliens.
1451648537|3.0|This book tells you WHAT Jobs did: He launched Apple, launched the MacIntosh, launched the iPod, iPhone, iPad, etc.  You probably already knew that.<br /><br />It doesn't tell you HOW: I read this 600 pager FAST because I kept thinking that the next chapter would tell me HOW he did it.  Some secret.  Some insight.  To no avail.  No real details other than someone commenting on his \\"reality distortion field\\" and then on how important it was to him to integrate the software and the hardware to do it right.  And how mean and critical he was to the ideas of others.  Over and over and over again.<br /><br />It does, unfortunately, tell you WHY: In the first chapter we learn that he was adopted and we are told, via interviews, that the \\"abandonment issue\\" was a driving force.  I find it hard to believe that the motivations of any person, much less one like Steve Jobs, can be entirely explained away with Psych 101.<br /><br />Jobs was painted as a paper thin character throughout this entire biography.  At one point, after Jobs is ousted from Apple, the author mentions how Jobs would learn his lessons at NeXT and Pixar that would allow him to later transform Apple.  But, we never learn what those lessons are, other than that he was mean, critical, had a reality distortion field and thought it was important to integrate software and hardware.<br /><br />When Jobs is diagnosed with cancer he says it's because of the stress during his time as CEO of both Pixar and Apple.  But those two short chapters don't convey any of that stress.  Instead, they talk about the great movies and shorts released by Pixar during that time, giving credit to John Lasseter.  Why?<br /><br />Amazingly, Bill Gates kept showing up as an interesting and complex character providing unexpected insight, opposition and even friendship throughout the book.<br /><br />Why, in a book about Steve Jobs was Bill Gates the most interesting and complex character?<br /><br />And what of Woznaik?  Jobs dumps him early on and then, as an aside \\"brings him back on stage\\" at a later event but we never learn what his true relationship with Woznaik has become over this time.  What became of Steve and Steve?<br /><br />Steve Jobs may very well have been a monumental jerk.  Even so, the author missed every opportunity to at least provide the MOTIVATION for him being a jerk.  Such as, I don't know, how much of his fortune did he stand to lose if Pixar and Apple had failed?  We don't know.  How much pressure was on him?  To succeed?  From either of his boards?  From his family?  From himself?  How much of his identity was at stake?  We never delve into these issues.<br /><br />Instead the author chooses to paint a story of a bunch of decent human beings, mostly engineers, stuck in a room with Steve Jobs, repeatedly subjected to his tyranny.<br /><br />Steve Jobs.  Who was he?  You won't find out from reading this book.<br /><br />I find this story hard to believe.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Not much to say here: by now you should know the movie. This is a masterpiece of drama and action, with a dark twist. It probes the depths of the human psyche, and does so in a very entertaining way. The visual and audio quality of the Blu-ray transfer is very good: of course, this movie is not so old that the transfer would be in doubt.<br /><br />If you like this movie, buy the Blu-ray. The quality is amazing and it is worth every cent.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Hard to believe that this was not picked up for publication.  Very readable. I will look for more books from this author.
0375851569|5.0|Like any other classic stories, it is not worth reviewing this product on the basis of the story itself. We all know Dr. Seuss and kids love his stories.<br /><br />The books are well constructed and the binding is firm. My children are old enough not to abuse books but these should stand up to some roughness. The cardboard container they come in is a little flimsy, but the books themselves are sturdy.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00AEFY552|3.0|This is the classic movie you know and love with all the hacking and slashing that one can desire; however, I have recently purchased this movie for around $10.00 and discovered that there is a &#34;Sapphire Series&#34; combo pack on blu-ray that contains this movie with 2 others running for about $25.00!<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-Collection-Braveheart-Gladiator-Private/dp/B008F2823C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1363623086&sr=8-1&keywords=sapphire+series
0307887448|5.0|This story starts with a simple premise---a \\"virtual reality\\" video game contest (in the future, 2044) where the winner wins a lot of money.  Eventually, though, it becomes a contest for control of the culture of this future society.  Most of the story takes place in this \\"virtual reality\\" computer game.  The characters are unique and interesting.  They don't meet in the real world until nearly the end and yet relationships develop and even love happens.<br /><br />The clues to solving the riddles and winning the contest all have references to the \\"pop\\" culture of the 1980's:  Video games, TV shows, Movies, \\"Rock\\" music, etc.  I was never part of the 80's \\"pop\\" culture scene;  I didn't play video games, I didn't watch that much TV or go to movies or listen to \\"rock\\" but I was able to follow the story.<br />I was intrigued and hooked and found myself drawn into this \\"virtual reality\\" world.<br /><br />It was an enjoyable read...I didn't want it to end.  5 stars.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I'm a huge Rocky fan growing up, I have always used these movies as great sources of motivation; although some may find the story a bit repetitive.<br /><br />I hate reading stories that just re-describe the movie, so I'll just say this.<br />Rocky 1-5 are perfect movies with lovable characters and villains, The final movie Rocky Balboa was just a perfect ending to the series by establishing Rocky's dominance.<br /><br />On Blu-Ray all these films look amazing, unlike most old movies Rocky used authentic sets so, everything looks real still despite the crazy definition boost!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|As a writer I pay attention to not only titles and writers but script too. Very well done I will watch this one over and over.

B00AJLHUAS|4.0|Ferry's compositions played by a traditional jazz band (and, apparently, &#34;traditional&#34; recording equipment) have echoes of traditional jazz, but with key changes that are more modern and an emphasis on minor chords. On the whole, it is most pleasant listening.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|Enjoyed this book alot. Some of the Harry Bosch series books for whatever reason are 5 stars and have you gripped, i'd give this a 4 star, well worth a read.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|While I really like playing on this app, I am unable to get any gifts from friends.  Not sure what the problem is, since all my freinds say that they are getting my gifts.  Guess it is better to give than to receive?!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey has a great script, casting, acting and cinematograpy. The growth of the characters with each episode is delightful and intriguing.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game is challenging but easy.I could play it all day if I could. I will never stop playing. Sooner or later I'm going to delete all of my other games but only leave this one,that's how awesome it is.
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|This is a great novel and it describes the two main characters very well. This novel is about two friends that were working hard to achieve their dream but faced some difficulties which caused the death of one of them. The ending was surprising but I guess back during this time in history, it was okay for people to decide someone's punishment without the law. Overall, it is an interesting novel and I would recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is amazing!!!!!!! I dont recomend this book for kids under 5th grade. I think that everyone who enjoys adventure with a little bit of romance should have this book, or at least read it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The book was good however after the first book it kind of took me longer to read book two and three it really became a little boring
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read! I hate the ending though. A total cliffhanger! This is the third book in the hero's of Olympus .The Greek and Roman demigods collide, and that causes lots of problems. A great read.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great read.  I really recommend - great story and multiple twists.  Not scary - more creepy.  Gillian Flynn is an amazing author.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun and addicting puzzles, easy to play. Will probably end up buying the extra packs. You should try this game!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Just now finished, great story, a must read. Loved the humor if the main character, had me giggling at 5am.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never thought I would be so sucked into a zombie show. It's less about the zombies and more about survival during an apocalypse. Awesome twists, stunningly realistic.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|At the beginning I didn't think I was going to care for this book, but Tony surprise the more I read the more I wanted to read! Excellent book, I will definitely read more of her books!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Very addictive, if not often frustrating. You will spend a lot of time with this one. The difficulty ramp is steady although somewhat broken at times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game isn't hard at all. Also it was  very interesting and you can get<br />A lot of things if you try this game is so cool because it's very easy .
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is fun to play and doesn't require special knowledge.  Card faces need to be larger for us old floks.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|I would be willing to bet this will be the best movie I see all year! I had to have the soundtrack and, of course, it sounds amazing. Tarantino left all the pops from the vinyl albums in too. CLassic!
B00B22IJXK|5.0|This game inspires my creative juices.  I think it's fun choosing my special photo closeups and making them, creating a special design surrounding them and sending the finished product to &#34;whomever&#34;.  My friends and relatives appreciate it.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I have used this for about 4 weeks now and am yet to perfect the standing process.  it keeps falling down all the time so I just lean it unto a book when I need to use the Kindle.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a great deal of fun.  I like to draw and this is a super good game for that.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|I don't know how they made something so good even better but there they go doing it again. I gave this CD set 5 stars because I can not find a single thing wrong with it! The additon of Silver Springs to the origianl disc just proves what a mistake it was being left out in the first place. It's a perfect ending to a perfect beginning to Fleetwood Mac Rumors. Disc 2  of their live World Tour is just so good and the sound quality is awesome.<br />I absolutely love Disc 3. The studio recordings, the demos, the outakes... the instrumentals...so good. To hear their voices so raw like that, I just loved it all. Stevie's voice on The Chain, Planets of The Universe, Silver Springs and Gold Dust Women...sounds just incredible. Christine's voice is so pristine and beautiful. I just loved the rawness of their voices. The previously unreleased recordings that they shared with us are a real treat for the die hard Fleetwood Mac fans and to hear Lindsey's, Stevie's and Christine's voices so up front like that is like entering a new world with them.<br />I don't know how they do it but I hope they keep doing it for many more years to come because there really is no one else out there like Fleetwood Mac!<br />Whichever way you choose to buy this 35th Anniversary Deluxe Edition....you can't possible go wrong....it's all just so good.<br />Thank you Mick And John! The Mac is back! Can't wait to see you in concert!!

B007L3BMGA|4.0|When i started this book i wondered what all the fuss was about and what everyone was talking about but as i got into it i couldnt put it down and very soon bought the second book
B00001QEBQ|3.0|Love the movie but was disappointed that I ordered and paid the higher price for the Gold Collection but got the widely available anywhere video instead.  The seller said that was the code she was given to enter and that she was sorry and offered to return but I kept it.  I told her to let amazon know to change it for other buyers because it clearly shows the gold collection is worth more.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I've followed Mumford & Sons for a while now and to see them at the Grammys was a sweet delight.  Babel is one of my favorite albums by them.  Lover's Eyes is one of my faves and of course, I Will Wait.  Incredible band!
0385349947|1.0|Most women get their education at modest universities, paid for by student loans. Sandberg got her education at Harvard because family wealth and connections with high society meant she was born with a Harvard pedigree.<br /><br />Most women also get their jobs by sending resumes to employers. Sandberg got her jobs, first at Google and then Facebook, by jet-setting around the world and mingling with the super rich. That is how she met Zuckerberg.<br /><br />Sandberg, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, has wealth that totally shields her from stress that ordinary women face. Sandberg and her book, therefore, provide advice relevant to super-rich women, like herself, that is impractical to woman of ordinary means whom Sandberg portends is her intended readership.<br /><br />For example, Sandberg encourages women to assert themselves and take risks, as if to imply that is how Sandberg herself got ahead.  Not so.  Sandberg didn't work for anything or earn anything.  She was instead born into affluence, wherein her Harvard pedigree and social contacts and lucrative career were handed to her.<br /><br />That means, for example, if Sandberg errs in judgment, she will never risk losing her job, her home, or her wealth.  But women to whom Sandberg is preaching will lose it all, if they follow Sandberg's advice.  That is because unlike Sandberg, they don't have millions of dollars in assets as a safety net.<br /><br />Neither is the theme of Sandberg's book anything new, as she represents.  In fact, bestseller books (and hit songs) about women's rights have been published at least since the 1960s.<br /><br />And how is it that Sandberg manages to find time to write a book that has nothing to do with her job at Facebook?  Hint:  She has a staff of minders who tend to all her parental and domestic chores at home.  That is yet another advantage that Sandberg leverages that women who read her book for advice do not have.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Love their music.  It's different from the popular music.  Their voices are incredible!  I don't get tired of listening to their music over and over again!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a wonderful piece of historical fiction that will be a classic for this generation and those to come.
B001BIMYXQ|4.0|This band really had a unique setup...with the great voice and incredible musical arrangement.  Along with the famed , Sweet Dream, most everything on this collection is superb.  Kinda wish they continue to make music together.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|A real contribution to the genre. Smart, complex, entertaining, unpredictable. The story that is told is highly entertaining and the story yet to come is set with great anticipation.
B00377Z0Y4|5.0|This is an amazing album.  I had forgotten just how good a band Jethro Tull is.  There is not a bad song on the disc.
1892005034|5.0|Extremely helpful. Helps you get to the roots of your relationship issues plus shows how to express those in a way that eliminates blame.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I don't typically listen to pop music but this band released a really good album.  The music and lyrics are better than most pop music I've heard in the past 40 years.
0670026638|5.0|This was a wonderful book. It was multilayered, moving back and forth between the experience of a young girl in Japan and a woman living in Canada.  The story explored themes of Zen Buddhism, quantum physics, animal spirits and totems, the effects of the tsunami in Japan, bullying, mental illness and suicide, and moral choices during wartime.  All of these weighty themes are combined in a very enjoyable, seamless way.  I couldn't put the book down.  It has an uplifting, hopeful ending.  It is whimsical, graceful and smart. The author has given a wonderful gift to the world. Thank you! This is the first review I have ever written for Amazon, and the reason is that I enjoyed the book so much. I would highly recommend this novel!
B00006IX0R|5.0|The CD arrived almost immediately after the purchase was made.  The product arrived in excellent condition as if it was newly purchased.  There is absolutely nothing negative that can be said about the service or product.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Not as good as Dark Places which I think is her best book, even better than Gone Girl.  This story seemed to contrived and and hard for me to believe.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I would give it 15 stars if I could. It is so entertaining and the shows seem like they only last 10 minutes!
0345525558|4.0|The story moved along at a good pace and the characters were interesting although some could have been better developed.  The introduction of flowers and what flowers can bring to our lives was a pleasant addition to the story.  At times the reading was distracting  as the auther dangled a vague mystery or two.  The main character was self destructive and although the author tried to explain her reasons for this behaviour, parts of the story did not hold up.  Still I enjoyed the book .
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Another excellent game from Play Rix. Similar to Atlantis, it gets progressively harder as you proceed around the world. Faithful to. Jules Vern.  Thanks for a great faotd.
1451675046|1.0|To start off, the bulk of the science in this book is what is commonly found in High School books, not much new. (I must readily say, the high school books do a better job of instructing too, having authors 'geared' for instruction. Dawkins (as in his other books) tends to ramble on.) To be fair, the science in this book is mostly agreeable even to Christians. (It seems Dawkins doesn't realize virtually all Christians accept that variety 'evolves' within the species.) Dawkins uses this book as an opportunity to inject his anti-religion, militant atheist zealotry. Not to fear, nothing in this book (or any science book) negates God. Dawkins closes his mind to God thus no one else dare conclude God is real. He totally ignores the fact that there are so many other scientists that truly believe in God, creation, miracles and the Bible. This book does serve as an excellent \\"revelation\\" on how more and more 'professionals' and 'intellectuals' are becoming \\"mad scientists.\\"<br /><br />Back to the book; Dawkins says, \\"To say that something happened supernaturally is not just to say 'We don't understand it' but to say 'We will never understand it, so don't even try.'\\" (For some reason he repeats all of this twice in his 'miracles' chapter.) Hhmm, I have spoken to so many people and never heard such lame talk or 'reasoning.' Dawkins (most typically) offers absolutely no references for these quotes (indicating this may be nothing more than mere personal opinion). Many of the wondrous scientific accomplishments Dawkins sites in his book, are by scientists that believed in God and/or miracles or the supernatural. They made progress while believing such things. I (and many others too) conclude along these lines; Knowing God did it moves us on, realizing there is rationale involved, and thus we can anticipate learning something sound and arranged with purpose. Thus MORE INCENTIVE, knowing there is something we can learn. MORE INCENTIVE as opposed to Dawkins' \\"don't even try.\\" Even Isaac Newton saw God as motivating, more incentive. This is the opposite of Dawkins' thinking that religion hampers scientific advancement and education.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Dawkins touches on something I was already aware of for well over 50 years now. He writes a rather complementary thought; \\"The Jewish creation myth (not that I would reasonably call it 'myth' ...but for now...) comes closer to doing justice to diversity..\\" Though Dawkins has a way of presenting Biblical accounts more derogatorily (and certainly, much more incorrectly and distorted) than many rational people do, he most fortunately tells of the much more absurd non-biblical myths such as the sun hatching from an egg, a porcupine that bit off its thumb thus made winters last four months, eating pomegranate seed that cause famine, a spider weaving animals from its web, 52 tears of blood that floods the world, and so on. I trust you get the picture. These myths, quite inadvertently, contrasts extreme absurdities with the closer to realistic and more straight forward accounts recorded in the Bible. In other words, there's a more basic God 'did' 'said' or 'created' without all of the craziness and hoopla that is contained in the more far-fetched ancient myths Dawkins presents. Dawkins is even speechless as far as having no mythical complaints on the Biblical creation's 'days' 'nights' and seasons as well as nothing Biblically mythical in his 'how did everything begin' chapter. Likewise on earthquakes, Dawkins notes quite a few ancient myths of animals and other absurdities causing earthquakes, while writing of nothing fanciful of this sort from the Bible. Honest thinking people must see this is a plus in favor for the Bible. Thank you Mr. Dawkins for highlighting this!<br /><br />Dawkins is confused with the sun in the Genesis account. It was created (bara) \\"in the beginning\\" and \\"made\\" (asah) to shine onto the earth's dark surface on day 4. This is the much-abused format of atheists; First misinterpret the Bible, then say it's faulty based off of those wrong conclusions. Incidentally, throughout his book there's not even a hint that the Bible could be understood or interpreted any differently from Dawkins' understanding of it. Are Dawkins clearly biased explanations the only options?<br /><br />Oddly, Dawkins says the Bible doesn't \\"tell us\\" about things like \\"the internal combustion engine\\" or \\"nuclear fusion\\" thus the Bible can't be \\"given to us by an all-knowing god.\\" What?.. Dawkins continues that there are no mentioning of bacteria and germs, though these are debatable. Not that it would matter anyhow. Dawkins discusses water cycles but doesn't mention the Bible does too. He writes of the universe having a beginning but doesn't mention the Bible does too. He tells us about the lack of myths about the universe since they didn't know \\"the very idea of there being a universe vastly bigger than our own world\\" but the Bible knows and clearly mentions this as well. Or consider, of all of its Egyptian history, the Bible never mentions pyramids, is this any grounds for invalidation? Dawkins has no clue what the purpose of the Bible is (besides it's big enough already). The Bible's focus is, for one, on people's relationship (or lack of) with God for starters. But it's certainly not written to be an encyclopedia on matters of personal or scientific curiosities.<br /><br />Dawkins does humbly acknowledge he has limits; #1 Physics, \\"There are scientists who understand at least something of this wonderland of the very small, but I am not one of them.\\" #2 \\"I'm a biological scientist who doesn't understand quantum theory.\\" #3 \\"not being a cosmologist, I don't understand it [how/if time had a beginning] myself.\\" and more. Now if Dawkins would only \\"humbly acknowledge\\" his 'weakest' weakness; Theology!<br /><br />As a scientists, Dawkins aught to be most educated and learned of historic primitive and older times. Throughout the book, Dawkins labels the Bible and it's people as history, primitive, ancient, etc. Ironically, he is thoroughly inept at understanding or explaining such early and simpler writings! Is he really so incompetent or is he willfully choosing to be misleading? Even the internet is full of Biblical explanations from a Christian POV. There is no evidence throughout this book that Dawkins has even bothered to research any of these free options or better yet, Biblical Scholars. (Actually, Dawkins book contains absolutely no references or footnotes at all!) This includes no research on his grand error of the Gilgamesh flood predating the Biblical flood (a topic he manages to squeeze in because of his chapter on the science of rainbows). It appears he can't distinguish (A) when something was written (B) from when writings were compiled or (C) at what point the account was to have taken place.<br /><br />Dawkins (rightfully) explains away \\"luck\\" as nothing in this book. But in his \\"Blind Watchmaker\\" he certainly indicates otherwise that he believes in it, expects and relies on it! \\"We are allowed to postulate a certain ration of luck.\\" \\"If we use up almost all our ration of luck in our theory of how life gets started on a planet in the first place, then we are allowed to postulate very little more luck in subsequent parts of our theory.\\" \\"If we don't use up all our ration of luck in our theory of the origin of life we have some left over to spend on our theories of subsequent evolution.\\" This is only a small sample of Dawkins `portioning luck' that the BW delves into quite lengthly.<br /><br />Dawkins does propose many very plausible reasons to explain many apparent miracles, but offering such a list of possibilities doesn't come close to ruling out further options. Dawkins insists miracles are \\"a 'transgression' (or breaking) of a law of nature.\\" He endorses David Hume's thinking (though even Hume doesn't say miracles can't happen) that, in essence; If believing it's a lie is less miraculous than the miracle itself, then believe it's a lie. Fine and dandy. What if \\"miracles\\" are in actuality following 'laws of nature' not yet understood? Dawkins seems to think God can't/doesn't intervene using natural scientific laws (not violating them) to cause miracles (or for creation, for that matter). Is Dawkins really informed of ALL there is to know about science?<br /><br />Dawkins is also guilty of offering \\"multiple choice\\" questions without the \\"4; None of the above\\" option so often used in propagandizing. On Jesus turning water into wine, Dawkins proposes three options:<br />1. It really did happen. Water really did turn into wine.<br />2. It was a clever conjuring trick.<br />3. Nothing of the kind really happened at all. It is just a story, a piece of fiction, that somebody made up. Or there was a misunderstanding of something far less remarkable which really did happen.<br />4. None of the Above. Clarke's Third Law yet to come. (No Dawkins didn't put #4 there, I just did!)<br /><br />Notice how the third option (the one Dawkins hopes to steer you into believing) is not a brief short statement glossed over quickly, as the preceding are, but, instead, quite a lengthly one composed of an explanation and arguments meant, all the while, to be `convincing.' He continues this approach throughout the whole discussion of this miracle.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Dawkins writes in a few places that there are those that can and do distinguish the Bible from fairy tales, myths and legends. Virtually all of the Christians I know can. I have absolutely no conflicting problems with science and God. I experience evidence for both in my everyday life. I see uncountable people that properly apply the Bible (and sadly, improperly as well, if Dawkins was only conscious of such differentiation). When followed correctly, there is undeniable evidence of a most wise and understanding Biblical Author. There is no rationale in concluding that so many ancient writings are myths therefore they all must be. The same with religion, most are wrong therefore they all have to be wrong? Not so.<br /><br />I could go on and on like this about Dawkins' \\"Magic\\" book but this should give a general idea of its format. It's painfully obvious Dawkins has an emotionally obsessive ax to grind. The science in Dawkins' book is fine but there are plenty of other informative books (even for younger ones) that aren't tainted with Dawkins inept religious understanding or his passionate irrationality against God. If you wish to discover how lame and foolish even reputed `intellectuals' can be, then here's a curious read. There is nothing at all faith shaking here, just more preaching to the choir. Otherwise try even a high-school science book.people as history, primitive, ancient, etc. Ironically, he is thoroughly inept at understanding or explaining such early and simpler writings! Is he really so incompetent or is he willfully choosing to be misleading? Even the internet is full of Biblical explanations from a Christian POV. There is no evidence throughout this book that Dawkins has even bothered to research any of these free options or better yet, Biblical Scholars. (Actually, Dawkins book contains absolutely no references or footnotes at all!) This includes no research on his grand error of the Gilgamesh flood predating the Biblical flood (a topic he manages to squeeze in because of his chapter on the science of rainbows). It appears he can't distinguish (A) when something was written (B) from when writings were compiled or (C) at what point the account was to have taken place.<br /><br />Dawkins (rightfully) explains away \\"luck\\" as nothing in this book. But in his \\"Blind Watchmaker\\" he certainly indicates otherwise that he believes in it, expects and relies on it! \\"We are allowed to postulate a certain ration of luck.\\" \\"If we use up almost all our ration of luck in our theory of how life gets started on a planet in the first place, then we are allowed to postulate very little more luck in subsequent parts of our theory.\\" \\"If we don't use up all our ration of luck in our theory of the origin of life we have some left over to spend on our theories of subsequent evolution.\\" This is only a small sample of Dawkins `portioning luck' that the BW delves into quite lengthly.<br /><br />Dawkins does propose many very plausible reasons to explain many apparent miracles, but offering such a list of possibilities doesn't come close to ruling out further options. Dawkins insists miracles are \\"a 'transgression' (or breaking) of a law of nature.\\" He endorses David Hume's thinking (though even Hume doesn't say miracles can't happen) that, in essence; If believing it's a lie is less miraculous than the miracle itself, then believe it's a lie. Fine and dandy. What if \\"miracles\\" are in actuality following 'laws of nature' not yet understood? Dawkins seems to think God can't/doesn't intervene using natural scientific laws (not violating them) to cause miracles (or for creation, for that matter). Is Dawkins really informed of ALL there is to know about science?<br /><br />Dawkins is also guilty of offering \\"multiple choice\\" questions without the \\"4; None of the above\\" option so often used in propagandizing. On Jesus turning water into wine, Dawkins proposes three options:<br />1. It really did happen. Water really did turn into wine.<br />2. It was a clever conjuring trick.<br />3. Nothing of the kind really happened at all. It is just a story, a piece of fiction, that somebody made up. Or there was a misunderstanding of something far less remarkable which really did happen.<br />4. None of the Above. Clarke's Third Law yet to come. (No Dawkins didn't put #4 there, I just did!)<br /><br />Notice how the third option (the one Dawkins hopes to steer you into believing) is not a brief short statement glossed over quickly, as the preceding are, but, instead, quite a lengthly one composed of an explanation and arguments meant, all the while, to be `convincing.' He continues this approach throughout the whole discussion of this miracle.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Dawkins writes in a few places that there are those that can and do distinguish the Bible from fairy tales, myths and legends. Virtually all of the Christians I know can. I have absolutely no conflicting problems with science and God. I experience evidence for both in my everyday life. I see uncountable people that properly apply the Bible (and sadly, improperly as well, if Dawkins was only conscious of such differentiation). When followed correctly, there is undeniable evidence of a most wise and understanding Biblical Author. There is no rationale in concluding that so many ancient writings are myths therefore they all must be.The same with religion, most are wrong therefore they all have to be wrong? Not so.<br /><br />I could go on and on like this about Dawkins' \\"Magic\\" book but this should give a general idea of its format. It's painfully obvious Dawkins has an emotionally obsessive ax to grind. The science in Dawkins' book is fine but there are plenty of other informative books (even for younger ones) that aren't tainted with Dawkins inept religious understanding or his passionate irrationality against God. If you wish to discover how lame and foolish even reputed `intellectuals' can be, then here's a curious read. There is nothing at all faith shaking here, just more preaching to the choir. Otherwise try even a high-school science book.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|Without the stunning visual images in the \\"adrift at sea\\" section of the movie, the viewer might despair of Pi's fate. Yet this movie is really about his journey in spirit. After having to leave India with his family, the boy becomes the lone human survivor after the cargo ship they were taking passage to North America is scuttled in a typhoon off the Philippines. In India they had been the operators of a small zoo. Some of their animals made the trip and 3 in particular survived the initial shipwreck. Some of the spiritual dynamics introduced including Krishna are brought out as Pi learns to deal with his ferocious companion, a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker and as the days lengthen to months at sea with little hope of survival we see how he envisions the world of the sea in fantastic luminous images. He first lands on a strange island which is hospitable by day and hostile by night by virtue of pure waters turning acidic by night. Later he washes up in Mexico where his longtime companion tiger just calmly walks into the forest without a look back. This upsets him and then a strange twist occurs when he is asked by Japanese authorities to account for his being the only survivor of the wrecking of their cargo ship. His story is too fantastic for them so he tells them another one which is more sinister yet more plausible. The allegory is caught by his listener as he retells the story many years later. The spiritual lesson is what do you wish to believe, the boy floating across the Pacific with a tiger or a boy who escaped evil doers.

B005ERYEGU|5.0|this book provides the best description of my work I've ever seen, and provides solid information on improving prospecting.  I've tried the cold calling 2.0 prospect and early results are very favorable, far better than previous efforts at email marketing.

B007EECSFA|3.0|A really good read but not quite great!  I would have liked a little more detail, what happened to characters.
1476712042|5.0|I am in love with this book - absolutely LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT! Jamie McGuire has quickly become one of my favorite authors after reading this book.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster has everything I want in a book; great plot, great pace, great chemistry, great characters, great love story and great sex! This book had me hooked from the first page and I couldn't put it down, I read this book in a day! The chemistry between Abby and Travis was an instant sizzle, from the moment they made eye contact, and the plot behind Abby's past was surprising but very creative.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is about a girl, Abby Abertnathy, who started her freshman year with her best friend America at Eastern University. Abby is running away from her life back home desperate to start a new life, one that lets her blend in and not be a stand out but that was impossible the moment she caught the eye of Eastern university's bad boy Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox at a fighting ring. When Abby loses a bet to Travis and has to stay at his apartment for a month, not only do they become best friends but they also fall in love. Abby constantly fears that Travis is too close to what she was trying to leave behind, and this tension creates a dynamic rollercoaster relationship of constantly bringing out the best and worst in each other.<br /><br />A significant reason that this book is so fantastic is Jamie McGuire's ability to create characters you fall in love with. For me it's, TRAVIS MADDOX, who makes this book - this guy is smart, sexy, hot, funny, thoughtful, tattooed bad boy that screams sex with a heart, just saying his name brings me to my knees for this guy is every girls collage dream! Then there is America the \\"best\\" best friend any girl could want or need, who stands by her best friend no matter what and understands Abby so well that she sometimes knows Abby better than she knows herself. The sympathetic character Shepley, who I constantly feel sorry for, is \\"Mr nice guy\\", the guywho always gets stuck in the middle of his girlfriend America and his cousin Travis's relationship with Abby.<br /><br />This book is a must read! I guarantee that you will love this book and fall in love with these characters as much as I have. It's a book that you can read over and over again and never get enough - it's that addictive!<br /><br />I am so excited I can't wait to read Walking Disaster, a retelling of the story from Travis's point of view- I already have my book pre-ordered!<br /><br />Ladies get your copy now!!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved hunger games, catching fire, and mockingjay they were absolutely amazing. It was filled with a lot of violence, romance, suspense and it was very enjoyable. I recommend this book to anyone who likes these kinds of books and new technologies. I loved the hunger games series.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|great game, nice graphics.  If you love dinosaurs you will love this.  The only bad thing is you have to wait for a long time to get anything new.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app works nicely on the Kindle but also can sync it with my home computer and my Iphone too.  This way I have my plans and my bookmarked verses available anywhere I am at.  I love this app.  Makes it very easy to keep up on my reading.

0553382179|5.0|Love this book - it has a great way to tackle a messy house/room with small steps so you don't get overwhelmed.  The book does have religious tones to it, but I didn't really mind.  Great online community, too.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved the characters and the author's sense of humor.  Also enjoyed the ending which was different then what was predicted.

B000E1NWJQ|5.0|I have owned these recordings of the Respighi since they first came out in the 1959. They have always been my favourite performances however many I have since bought. More recently I have acquired the Debussy as a fill-up. This too is fine and a more than generous extra item, but it will always be the Respighi that attracts the collectors.<br /><br />There have been several reincarnations of these very famous recordings and I have resisted this latest one on the basis that enough is enough. However, having sampled a few of the others in this SACD series and been very impressed I have finally weakened and invested once more in this latest appearance.<br /><br />Well, it is an absolutely phenomenal improvement with extra body, definition, presence and sense of sheer reality. The Debussy is better too!<br /><br />Once more this Respighi/Reiner combination heads my list of preferred recordings, not just as a performance but also as sound. Considering its age, that is an almost unbelievable statement.<br /><br />In summary therefore, I would suggest that whatever other recordings collectors have or newcomers are considering, this SACD version by Reiner deserves the most serious consideration as a future purchase.also add to this. When you in particular review a particular CD, I pay pretty close attention. I would say the characteristics of your reviews I value the most are the detail and general sense of balance and fairness that comes across. That's a great help. Thanks for taking the time on your reviews.  (US review)<br /><br />............................................
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Movie entertained the family.  This was a nice video, but would not consider buying DVD also would not watch this movie again.  We are glad we waited to rent this Movie.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel as always has a stellar performance of an alcoholic in denial. Performances all around were great especially John Goodman as his dealer/friend.
B009OCR1X4|4.0|I have worn out the CD...that should say something.  beautiful score of music and makes me recall the movie every time.  As I read the book I heard the music playing in the background!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Interesting story line, especilly if you like psychology and/or know anyone who suffers from panic attacks or post-trauma stress symptoms.Characters seem real, except for the  villain, who becomes so evil at the drop of a hat.

B009AMAGQM|1.0|This movie is a hodgepodge of supernatural thriller clich&eacute;s aimlessly thrown together. While I have enjoyed many supernatural thrillers and therefore understand that you need to be willing to use your imagination, the plot of this movie was craftfully pulled in an unintelligible knot after half an hour. Had I not been in a movie theatre with my family but in front of the TV, I would have turned this off halfway through. To not being able to finish a movie, by definition in my rating system, renders it a one star movie. After reading some other reviews here, I realize that maybe you need to have read the book to be able to make some sense out of this. However, this should not be necessary, or at least potential viewers should be warned upfront.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|This book depressed me in the beginning until the &#34;plot&#34; became evident then it became unbelievable. I had a difficult time accepting the fact that the main character could accomplish all that he did accomplish by convincing whole villages to assist him. You should read this book knowing that you will be required to suspend reality as the main character marches towards successfully accomplishing his mission.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I much preferred the book to the TV series, and I am looking forward to reading the next book.  Highly recommended to everyone.
B0050IY61G|4.0|But there are some repetitions.<br />A very good and easy to understand covering of the subject nevertheless.<br />Anyone interested in the subject should read this!
B00499QUK2|4.0|Well acted by Freeman and Cumberbatch.  Stories are engaging and exciting.  The show was able to modernize Sherlock Holmes while maintaining the core of the characters story.
B004LK5CEE|5.0|I bought this Bootleg Cut of Almost Famous because I absolutely love this movie. This version offers almost 20 minutes worth of extra scenes added into the movie that makes the viewer feel more connected and understanding of the characters. The artwork on the cover is fantastic and the price on Amazon is unbeatable. If you love Almost Famous, you will love it even more with this extended version
1416550550|5.0|THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK. The story begins with a frail, ethereal child reaching the shores of Autrailia. The child came over in a Ship and recalls fragments of her travels, but not why, or for sure IF, she came with a Governess, or her Father, or even, just exactly WHY she is here. She adapts and learns of the history and different, possibly strange, ways of the Aussies. She is, after all, a Brit. As the child learns of travel and her new homeland, we learn about these with her, but we are given insight into the workings of her soul...who she comes to live with and why. And WHY she ends up back in England.<br />Who does she live with here? Whom are her companions? Why does she react differently here than in Australia? What is special about the house she has come to live in: Who are the people here? Why do they treat her differently. What parts of her memory, or memories of others, must snap together for this new world to make sense?<br />Will she be a Brit or an Aussie, or a combination?<br />I found that I did a lot of learning while reading this book. The ways of various cultures, their inward and outward mores were searched. The book had a complex knot of story lines that kept me attuned at all times. There was adventure, loss, love lost, love regained, and all that went on between the landing in Australia and the awakening in Britian.<br />I would recommend this primarily to females who like Romantic Histories with many a plot twist. The book kept me glued in my chair and turning pages well past midnight, 2 AM, and into the dawning.Expect to be entertained, fooled, and made to love. It is a sweeping work and I loved it!
B00AHXIC50|4.0|A party record. Loved it. Bruno Mars' career has legs and we'll be watching him for a long time to come.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have been waiting for weeks for my Huluplus to update with Season Three and was tired of getting spoiler alerts from others, so I bought the instant online version and found it extremely easy to use. I loved being able to watch it on my laptop seconds after purchase. No streaming problems - very smooth (and cheap!) experience.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|What's not to like about Walking Dead? Just one thing: The only reason this doesn't get a 5 is because there is no closed-caption. It's surprising how many of the actors/actresses mumble on this show.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Well worth the price! Best case ever! I've dropped my phone several times and not a single crack!  I haven't tested in water, just not willing to risk my luck!

1423140591|3.0|This is a good read. I became a fan with the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. I love Rick Riordan's writing style, but I don't think it matchs the more in depth plots and character developments of this series, The Heroes of Olympus. This book is bigger than any in the original series but the light hearted banter and zanyness is best reserved for shorter works in my opinion. It gets lost in these more detailed and the more in depth writing style of the Heroes of Olympus books. It feels like Rick Riordan is in a gangly teenager phase of writing, it's not cute and simple anymore and it's not rich and developed yet. With all this you'd think I would be not recommending this book, but it is worth a read, its just not as good as his original series was. It's also somewhat confusing trying to blend together the similar but different Greek and Roman dieties.
0671646788|5.0|You can only rise as high as you can dream. If you can't dream it, you can't have it. Great book on expanding the size of one's dreams and possibilities. Just how big can you think?
0553381407|5.0|Unfortuneately most of us have at least one toxic parent.  This book could be standard reading for everyone. It shows the different types of toxic parents and counters their toxicity with the truth. You don't have to live your life striving for their approval. Toxic parent relationships are not healthy and should not be treated the same as healthy parent-child relationships. This book is very informative and very practical.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|Interesting information about the hidden abilities that just might be occurring around us but is hidden from society in general. Could it really be true?
B0064MT1QW|4.0|I've always seen bits and pieces of this movie on tv over the years.  I saw it on Amazon, and thought that I'd finally bite the bullet and buy it so that I can see the whole movie.<br />I'm really glad that I made that choice.  The English Patient is perhaps the epic film of the early 90's.  A love story, mixed with a tale of jealousy, mixed with a hint of espionage, all being told by an injured soldier that being looked after by a lonely nurse.<br />While I really did enjoy this movie, I did not think that it packed quite the punch that I was expecting; a definite case of hype overshadowing the actual film.<br />All in all though, a good entertaining movie!
B004L03B3S|5.0|Interesting issue portrayed leaving one wondering about the reality of the issue in the world today. What would it really be like?
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I hadn't read this book since I was probably forced to when I was a kid, but after reading &#34;The Road&#34; by the same author, I decided to give this one a shot.  What I found was a true masterpiece of American literature.  The story follows the life of a dog as it progresses from a comfortable life in civilization through the rigors of self-discovery through great trials of body and spirit.  Read this if you too are in need of that same sense of self examination. I loved this book and will likely read it time and time again.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Fantasy or reality? This film touches on what really happens today and makes one question what we think is happening and what is really happening in the governance of our world.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This was a great series and was sad that it ended. The quality of the Blu-ray was very good and arrived very quick and in perfect condition

0062014536|5.0|Unlike the first 2 books, Delirium and Pandemonium, Requiem is told from a dual personality from two different characters, Lena and Hana. As I have mentioned before, I love when stories are told from different point-of-views. However, at first, I was a bit disappointed that Hana was chosen. It didn't take long to realize that having Hana's side of the story and what was going on in her world was imperative and just as intriguing and intense as Lena's world.<br /><br />There isn't much that I can tell you about the actual plot without any spoilers. But I am going to do my best in telling you why I think that this is one of the best endings I have ever read...<br /><br />In book one, we saw Lena on the inside being kept safe from the disease. She was doing what she had to do to just get to her surgery date so she wouldn't have to worry about what happened to her mother happening to her too. That is, until she met Alex. And learned that there is another way to live, as long as you have something worth fighting for. In book two, we watched Lena survive, learn and grow out in the wilds. She creates a new life, new friends become her family. And she meets Julian, who is sweet, safe and exactly what Lena needs at this moment in her life. She makes new discoveries about people she cares deeply about and we watch her reactions and the consequences to that.<br />Now, Lena has come to the ultimate battle. Where does her alliance stand? With whom? What does she want out of her life - to make a stand and live with new consequences? Even death? Or will she try to take the easy way out, travel far, away from all the fighting and hide for as long as she can?<br />And, what most of us have been waiting for... who will Lena choose?<br /><br />But there is so much more to just Lena's story. And Lauren Oliver makes it loud and clear, no matter what life brings, you always have a choice. Don't hide from anything, no matter how scary it may be, or how hard, you have the right to do what you believe in. Follow your heart. Yes, at times you may choose wrong, you may fall down many, many times. But in the end, what truly counts, is that you are honest with yourself, with others. And don't let anyone ever stop you from doing what you want to do.<br /><br />The last page of Requiem, page 391, will forever stay with me. I've told many people already - I want to get another copy of this book so I can tear the last page out and frame it. It's something that I want to remind myself of. It's something that I want my kids to know...<br />\\"Tear down the walls.\\"<br />Don't build barricades around yourself, or you'll always live in fear.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to everyone. Love is not a disease. Fear is.you believe in. Follow your heart. Yes, at times you may choose wrong, you may fall down many, many times.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|kudos to Mr. Brooks on writing a book that is as intense as Stephen King`s Misery. An innovative way to describe the start of the infection, thru the build up of the great panic, the start of the war, to wrapping it up with most of the beginning characters. I never thought a zombie story would keep me riveted as this one did.  5 stars!
B0063M22QO|4.0|A great app for developing concentration skills.  Being an educator, I tend to gravitate towards those apps which are not only entertaining, but enhance thinking skills.  This game has been around for ages and has withstood the test of time so to speak.  I enjoy it myself.

B005LRWRZ8|3.0|My Original Review<br /><br />I cant believe I am actually liking a Megadeth album again.<br />I only like two of Their Albums - RIP and CTE. Before RIP the production on all of their albums was lousy and Dave had and still has the worst voice in any Genre of Music - its terrible, laughable, A joke, annoying, idiotic and these are the good things I can say about his mumbling. I'm not against Non-Singers - I love GoatWhore, Motorohead, Behemeoth (Now there is an Fn Metal Band) and I like real singers like Bruce Dickinson and Rob Halford. But Dave's voice just sucks, its annoying. Anyway - see my review of Risk.<br />Getting back to review of 13-<br />Starting with Youthanasia - Megedeth just Suck - just terrible, terrible garbage he has been releasing since then. The First Step Back was UA - but after repeated Listens it became Mediocre and I felt the same with Endgame. Both UA and Endgame Start off real Strong and than just become Mediocre. But I never give up on a band - I'm a Metal Fan, so I get around to eventually listening to Everything. So Onto 13:<br />Why Do I think this is so good: The Number One Thing is that on this Album Dave, or the Producer, has found a way to mask all the horrible attributes of Daves Vokills. This is the only Megadeth album, and that includes RIP and CTE, in which I am not put off by his Vokills. Not only that - the album gets very atmospheric and better as it goes on. It Kicks off with three solid Hard Rockin Numbers and as it goes on it never dips into mediocrity like all their albums since Youth. Towards the end of the album things get real atmospheric, dark and just great with songs like Black Swan (I believe it and a couple of other tracks are remakes) and the ending number, 13, is just really cool. All in all - this is not to be compared to other Megadeth Albums - it is not a RIP, nor is it bad like most of their other albums - its an album that stands on its own - Its a very good Album and will go right next to RIP and CTE, without sounding like them, in my collection. Im very happy about this as the all the other Deth albums are in the Junk Pile and I am running out of room in that pile. Megadeth have Finally Made a Good Album Again - Go get it<br /><br />Ive Since Changed my Mind about 13 - Its not as good as I thought - below is My Corrections<br /><br />I said My Favorite Deth Cds were RIP and CTE - I like the earlier ones but the Production was pretty Crappy compared to the above two. I dont Like anything starting with Youthanasia utill UA. UA and Endgame were the return of Megedeth being good again - though I felt after the first few tracks of both records - things really dragged. With 13 - Its pretty much the same. I do not like Dave Mustaines Voice - he has always sounded crappy and live he has always been completely terrible. On the three albums I really like by Deth, including RIP, CTE and 13 - for whatever reason - his vocals dont bother that much. I have been playing in bands for a long time - believe me - I know a bad singer when I hear one and I would not have a singer, (actually he is not a singer he is a vocalist) in my band - He sucks. If he wants to play guitar in my band thats a different story but he is not getting near the mic - I dont care how famous he is. Now if Rob Halford or Bruce Dickinson want to sing in my band, they are more than welcome<br /><br />briandillon<br />March 19th 2013<br /><br />Album Rating: 3<br /><br />Yeah - Ive been listening to 13 some more and its not as good as I thought. Its in the Same League as UA and Endgame. So These Three Albums UA, Endgame and 13 are better than what Deth has Been releasing since Youthanasia but no where as good as Classic Megedeth - (Peace Sells Through CTE) - If I could re-rate it Id Give it a 3. Again - its OK but nothing amazing like RIP - I was wrong in my initial thought of 13 - I thought it was much better<br /><br />Killing 3,  Peace Sells - 4.5,  So Far - So Good 4,  RIP 5,  CTE 4.5,  Youtanasia - 2.5,  CW- 2<br />RISK - 1, WNAH - 2, TSHF - 2, UA - 3, Endgame 3.5, 13 - 3<br />Daves Vokills - 1<br />Daves Mental State - 0<br />Guitaring, Drums, Bass - 5

0452289963|5.0|This book is especially good for people who are down on their luck or just not feeling the joy of living. It needs to be read and understood by a lot of people.

1400082773|2.0|I have heard and researched too many facts about this author that I do not agree with in his representation of what happened in the story because  he presents it as factual. It is also a little boring and mundane for me.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Great book concerning NDE's. Hearing from a brain surgeon himself with all the medical education and knowledge allowed this book to be unique by combining faith and the experience process of consciousness to that of scientific facts which most NDE's lack. Ultimately Alexander's message of the Divine being a force of love surrounding all beings at all times is a powerful lens of how to better enrich your earthly life.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app. Wish they would do something to earn more gems; swap for coins; or have option to use both for purchases.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I can't rate the DVD yet, but I can rate the movie. \\"Jack Reacher\\" reminds me of a movie made before the bitter fruit of computer graphics came along. Back when story, well composed scenes and good acting were paramount.  Now I'm sure computers were used in the making of this movie, but they aren't the star, as is the case in so many of today's thrillers.  It's not a visual spectacle, or an action-packed thrill-ride.... It's better!  This movie had some thought put into it.  Its got re-watchability.  It has a story that engages the mind without being taxing on the brain.  The acting is good, with crisp dialogue and has some good old-fashioned tough-guy lines from the title character.  If I had to make this movie using ingredients from other sources, I'd say there's a good helping of \\"Bullitt\\" with a hint of \\"Person of Interest\\" and a little of \\"Dirty Harry\\" even.  The cinematography is clean, clear, and colorful, with good, steady fight scenes that you can actually tell what's going on.  None of it is predictable and it's all classy.  Good pace, sweet cars, pretty girls, great character.  I left the theatre feeling good, walking a little taller and already certain I'd buy the DVD.  Can't wait.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Really good - guess that is why it won several awards. I had no idea any of that had happened.

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Magn&iacute;fica tercera temporada de una de las series con mejor producci&oacute;n e interpretaci&oacute;n de las que se puede ver hoy d&iacute;a en televisi&oacute;n. Despu&eacute;s de una segunda temporada con ciertos huecos e hilos argumental es un tanto fuera de control, la serie ha vuelto a sus ra&iacute;ces de centrarse en los personajes y en la importancia de la herencia y el legado de la familia.<br />La calidad de cada episodio no tiene nada que envidiar a muchas de las producciones de Hollywood de hoy en d&iacute;a.<br />Si eres un amante de Downton Abbey, no saldr&aacute;s decepcionado, al igual que s&iacute; lo eres de los programas que tratan la diferencia de clases en la Inglaterra de entre guerras.<br />Totalmente recomendable para todos aquellos que aman la televisi&oacute;n de calidad.

B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|I am familiar with the show's appearance on DVD, and I find that on Amazon Live the picture is about 50 per cent darker.  Darker parts of the picture are just black.  Buy the DVDs if you like, but don't bother with Amazon's stream unless you want to try to re-adjust your TV picture every time you view this.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I dont see horses very often, but when i play this game its almost educational for me. it shows you the food the horses need and the grooming horses need. its also fun. you train your horse, jump over hurdles and dogde cones. this game is fun as well as educational.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|Let's Go. (It's French.) I love this sonic screwdriver. I have some 3D Glasses and I enjoy acting like I am David Tennant. The product is extremely durable and the only thing that I could recommend worrying about would be that the NIBS are likely to fall off. However, if you super glue one of them to the bottom, The screwdriver is the best.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|This book took a lot of research by the author.  It had to have been quite an undertaking but the results give us, the readers, an accurate account of the wives of Henry the VIII,  his offspring and his court.  The book is very detailed and it is backed by all the research the author did.  Certainly one of the best accounts I have read on this historical and interesting time of British royalty. Very well written. I enjoyed reading this book and appreciate the immense amount of work done by the author.

B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I watched each of The Lord movies in the theatre and bought the extended versions on DVD. I loved them all, only having the most minor gripes about pacing and some uneven quality In the effects.<br />When I heard they were doing the Hobbit in 3-film fashion i wasn't skeptical like many claim to have been - I was excited! Having recently enjoyed a few 'game of thrones' marathons, I really think that a longer format experience only benefits good source material.<br />You couldn't ask for better material than The Hobbit and the first film does not disappoint for surpassing the high bar Peter Jackson and his crew set with the lotr trilogy. The New Zealand middle-earth cinematography is fine as ever and the digital magic is close to seamless now, such as technology have evolved.<br />I think that after the 3 parts of the hobbit have been released it ill be considered the best-ever such adaptation and we'll all wish they'd spent so much time on each of the other books- such as GoT and its ten hours per book ratio

B00B99KJR0|5.0|Better than Call of Atlantis, which was one of my all time favorite games. I like match-3, and these games that add a story or innovative game play are great. Heroes of Kalevala is also very good, but I think I might like 80 Days even better! The challenge is to find combos of more than just 3 matches to unlock better and better tools, helping you complete the level faster and get the coveted 3 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a fun game with horses.  You groom the horse you can buy different types of horses.  It is just an awesome game.  (By the way you can also have friends. You could be my friend).<br />Fun fun fun<br />:-);-)
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Thanks to Amazon free app of they day, I gave this game a try.  It has been a lot of fun to play.  It is hard to master, so it will be a while before I've worked my way through the levels.  I was looking for a game that interactive and challenging.  It is also beautiful game to look at and the background music is very enjoyable.<br />Give it a try, I don't think it will disappoint you.
0312641893|5.0|Great book.  You can read a review on Christian manfesto by Michelle Black that will give you a real insight into this book that is soon to be a classic.
0316056898|5.0|This is a fun read.  Part memoir, part just funny ranting, part \\"dishing some common sense - It's a quick read, but very enjoyable.<br /><br />Tina Fey is smarter and more down to earth than many of the other popular memoir-writing funny women.  She is also very likable - at least in this book.  I would have been annoyed if she came across as full of herself - but she doesn't.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Loved this movie. They did great job recreating this. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a different take on the original.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was a selection for my book club.  Enjoyed every minute of reading it.  An excellent ladies book club selection.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I began reading this book with an open mind, knowing very little about it except what I've heard about it in the media. Now that I've read it, I can not understand what all the fuss about. The writing has been done very poorly (will someone please give E L James a thesaurus?), the whole story is lacking creativity (if you've read Twilight, you've read this book, minus the sex), and the main character is far too childish and a bit ridiculous for a 21 year old graduating college. Overall, I'd say it was a giant waste of time reading this book.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love all of the jewel-type games &amp; especially ones that have puzzle pieces as part of the game.  This jewel game is similar to the atlantis game.  Not overly difficult but you can challenge yourself for improved .  star- ratings.  I &quot;bought&quot; this game as a free app of the day.  No glitches on the kindle fire hd.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian has a way with suspense, plot twists and sharpwitted humor. I thought I had the mystery figured out 3 times-but was further suprised by the end!!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I really loved this book I don't even know how to explain why. I felt like I knew Emily and that I could share in Chris's grief. I really wish that the truth about her being molested would have came out though. Truly amazing.
B005XN3150|5.0|I love being able to digitally stream my movies now. Since I started doing this, I found it's an affordable option for my entertainment. This particular series is highly addicting and very entertaining. It's a cross between a fairy tale world and reality. It's kind of crazy and amazing how talented the world's intertwine.<br /><br />I found this series to be highly entertaining and enjoyable to watch without too many adult things that keep my kids from being able to watch as well.<br /><br />It's not as predictable as it would appear. These aren't the fairy tales you grew up on as a child. They're all altered slightly and unexpectedly.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an awesome series!!!!!! If you love Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell, you will love this!!  The Crawley's are so enthralling!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is really fun and so far I've run into no problems. It's a little like temple run with more obstacles and there are missions you can do. I like how right now it's doing a world tour so you go to a new city every once in a while. 5 thumbs up!! :P

B006TF6WAM|5.0|Really enjoying this story which is cleverly constructed with the darkest side kept hidden until near the end.  Can thoroughly recommend it as it certainly makes one think of one's own life and how one's omissions should be rectified before it's too late. The characters are most convincing and everyone of them could be a person one has met.  It is suited best for people in the over 60 age group but can be enjoyed by younger people too
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I enjoyed this one more than the first book. However, ideas are rushed and the climax is wasted on a few short pages. Characters are flat, I want to feel like they are my friends. I want to be like, &#34;where did I do that?&#34; Oh ya! It was that book I read, right now I feel like I'm rushing to get it over.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I really love this series of movies. I am always drawn to romances and find myself looking forward to the next movie to see how their story turns out. I enjoyed it!

B00BVYR0IO|5.0|keeps you on the edge of u'r seat. A MUST WATCH FOR WALKEING DEAD FANS! :) I LOVED IT WILL WATCH AGAIN
B00947N6D8|5.0|Russian, sword-wielding Santa, Australian outback Easter Bunny, a very powerful sandman and a tooth-fairy hummingbird? This movie does not hold back when it comes to being unique and original. Create a portal by wishing into a magic ball -toss- and then fly through your creation. Take a ride on Santa's insane sleigh.<br /><br />But watch out because the Boogie Man, Pitch Black, is tired of being a figment of people's imagination.<br /><br />In his quest to be acknowledged, the Boogie man has found a way to harness and manipulate nightmares. His plan is to rule the world and then (must watch movie) yada yada yada its all good and there is a new guardian to thank.<br /><br />With a new twist on old characters, this has something in it for older and younger folk.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|Mostly true anyways!  I loved it!  My husband thought it was alittle exaggerated but it was all ness assay to make a memorable story from it.  Great gift idea for your climbing and hiking pals.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Wow,that is a wonderful story with a wonderful ending.  I loved the story line and the characters reactions and actions to everything that happened.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Have always been fascinated by period stories, and this one is awesome! Finished watching seasons 1 and 2 back to back, can't wait for Season 3 to be available on Prime Instant Videos.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This is one of those &#34;sleeper movies&#34; that is absolutely fantastic and didn't get the credit that it deserved!  It is a classic, right up there with Raiders of the Lost Ark, Sherlock Holmes, Ironman, Avengers, etc.  Very clean, entertaining, and an overall great movie!  My husband and I have watched it multiple times and it never gets old!
0385363133|4.0|Nothing extraordinary but a nice read.<br />It's like a movie. If you don't expect much of it, it will still surprise you, and you will forget about some minor issues in the book (or the &#34;all too perfect&#34; situations and feelings inside).<br />Once you decide to let them pass, the book is indeed a good read and enjoyable, which I don't regret, especially if you want to share it with your partner.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This is everything I expect from a documentary and more;<br />an in depth look at a life perusing quality and craftsmanship,<br />with a singular focus on perfecting ones craft.<br /><br />Both uplifting to see,<br />and depressing to realize we may never be this good at anything.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book...<br />I have fallen deep in love with Ana and Christian both. In my taste, \\"Bared to you\\" is written so much better..yet I can't seem to put this book filled with such beautiful people down. Part of me wishes Stephanie Meyer wrote these book as well.<br /> I would still give this book an \\"-A\\"  .

B007FEFLTO|3.0|Had to have the follow-up, but is the sequel ever as good as the initial introduction to a series (rarely).  Characters are good, but their emotions/actions are just too predictable this time around.  I love Follett's novels, and I'm glad I made this purchase...just didn't feel the connection to the characters I felt in Fall of Giants.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good movie but not sure about best picture?  I thought it was a good portrayal of a true story.  watch it and enjoy
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Right...where do I start? If you've already read the first two books in this horrendous trilogy, then no doubt you will want to know what happens to Ana and Christian in this (thankfully) final instalment. Well the big news(!) is that they get married and then proceed to refer to each other as Mr and Mrs Grey. Why? Have they forgotten their Christian names?<br /><br />The writing is as bad as ever and the absence of a half-intelligent editor is once more strongly felt. I have never read such boring and repetitive crap in my whole life! If I see once more that someone `bit their lip,' or, worse still, `rolled their eyes,' I will scream out loud.<br /><br />While the sex scenes are without a doubt horny, I find myself constantly distracted by the lack of good English. To say that Ana's dialogues are simplistic and child-like is actually giving her too much credit, so why on earth would she use the word `avuncular'? She wouldn't even know what it means. I have seen seven year old kids describe things better than EL James manages to.<br /><br />And by the end of this journey into BDSM, I cannot help but feel that the true BDSM community would be absolutely horrified at this kind of portrayal of what they find to be a turn on. These books do nothing for that community whatsoever, as they make people think that BDSM is completely about being in an abusive relationship, which it so IS NOT!<br /><br />So do yourself a favor; if you like a good sexy read, do not expect it from this or any of EL James boring, repetitive, banal pieces of rubbish.<br /><br />Now if you are looking for an author that can write a good story then check out The House of Pleasure by Penny Saunders. The book is the first in a trilogy which tells a completely different, but just as horny, kind of story. But the biggest difference is that this author can actually write. Her narrative is strong and believable, as are her characters. The sexual content is enough to be titillating, without being over thetop. In other words, it turned me on, rather than `Shades' which most definitely turned me off.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BUCBVZ0 The House Of Pleasure (The House Of Pleasure Series Book 1)]]
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It really keeps you on your toes. Its like a good horror movie, mixed with a good mystery. One of the best apps I've played on a while.
0765325950|4.0|...and it's done. The first serious major fantasy series I ever picked up, back in probably 1998 or so, comes to a close. (I'm discounting The Lord of the Rings as not being quite a series. And I can't remember when I first picked up any of the Drizzt Do'Urden books, whether it was before or after the Wheel of Time, but in any case I think those books aren't quite so hefty as these.)<br /><br />I'm one of those fans who spent hundreds of hours reading the books, theorizing about them, discussing them online (in the long-ago book forums on the Wheel of Time computer game website, mostly a ghost town now -- yes, I remember what the Land of Doubles is :-) ), attending book signings for them, and even going to the Provo midnight release party for this one. Really, to me, this is much more than just a fantasy book, even the final book of a series. It's the end of an era, of waiting years between books waiting for the next to come out, wondering what would happen next. I never would have guessed how far the ripples would extend from borrowing The Eye of the World from a friend who happened to be reading it.<br /><br />Does the book deliver, as the final Wheel of Time book? (There's going to be an encyclopedia, but almost certainly never anything beyond that. Jordan left the barest of notes for potential \\"outrigger\\" novels, and he was ardently opposed to \\"sharecropping\\" his world, as he's said George Lucas has done with Star Wars. So it goes.) Yes. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the Wheel of Time, but this is an ending, and a satisfying one. It's even more impressive given that Jordan wasn't even the one to end it, as he sadly passed away from a rare blood cancer awhile ago and had to prepare all his notes for a successor -- not even one he had a hand in choosing -- to take up the challenge. We as fans demanded an awful lot of this concluding book, and Sanderson delivered.<br /><br />Given the personal significance of the Wheel of Time to me, I would be more than justified, I think, in assigning it a five without further thought. I may have spent a few hundred dollars on Wheel of Time books (and ebooks) over the years, but I've gotten far, far more entertainment and joy out of them than that. At the same time, I think there are certain aspects of this book with which I take issue, or over which I have inchoate concern.<br /><br />First, this book covered the Last Battle. Throughout the entire series the Last Battle has been portrayed as monumental and epic in every sense of the word (not just the overused Internet sense of it). And indeed it is that, in this book. The longest chapter of the book, titled -- well, I'll let you make the obvious guess -- is 190 pages. And there's plenty more battle beyond that. This might have been necessary, to appropriately fit the immenseness we'd all imbued the Last Battle with. But at the same time, it is looooooooong. It is excellent throughout, but even excellent battle scenes can't go as long, and sprawl as much as they did in this book, without going a bit too long. I have no idea how fewer or shorter battles could have conveyed the sense of scale and import of it all. But I do wish somewhat that it had been done. Also, totally contradictorily (I told you this was inchoate!), I kind of expected that there would be more fronts to the battle than there were, and that it would occur in many more places. The addition of large numbers of channelers to the Shadow's side explains why there weren't more, perhaps -- what Light-side channelers could have mopped up on their own became often overwhelming when Dreadlords entered the stage. But I expected far more widespread mayhem, perhaps far-flung guerrilla warfare, for the forces of darkness to have delighted in.<br /><br />Second, the Black Tower. The gradual unfolding of much of that plot thread, and the interactions among particular characters in it, is delightful. (Especially with Pevara and Androl's relationship hearkening back to the Aes Sedai united as one in the Age of Legends.) Yet I was somewhat underwhelmed with the actual mechanics of the Dark here. (Admittedly the Dark aren't always the smartest or most well-coordinated villains around, but still.) It took them that long to accelerate their efforts? (And, really, previous books had made me think those efforts had progressed far further, and more successfully, than apparently they had.) And the denouement of that thread was really that sudden? I don't think those scenes did quite justice to the words of Elaida's prior Foretelling. (Unless that referred to other future events -- I think some of the prophecies did, but not this one -- but in this case it seems incredibly poor if that was the case.)<br /><br />Third, Demandred. A competent Forsaken, finally! And yet. I wasn't surprised to see him appear, and from where he did. But I think we needed more than process of elimination to explain how he got to where he did. And we needed more back story to his dealings of the past couple years, to explain how he did it. (This may be a topic for the encyclopedia, but that tantalization should have been salved somewhat before. This issue goes all the way back, and I don't think Sanderson can truly be blamed for it.) And, returning to competency, slightly: Demandred was waaaaay too vocally angry. Sure, he had a chip on his shoulder the size of Hoth, but he was also really the only Forsaken that consistently got things done. And you're telling me he couldn't control his ego enough to not sound pompous? Seriously, he started to remind me a little of his parody in ISAM's classic Wheel of Time parody summaries. Not to mention, the supposed best general of the Shadow never seriously thought that Rand might be, um, some other, more strategic place, maybe? Like, um, maybe Shayol Ghul? C'mon Demandred, this is clownshoes.<br /><br />Fourth, Slayer. The eventual way everything went down there was satisfying. But I feel like I never really understood the why of Slayer, his motivations, the history behind him, and so on. Probably that'll be cleared up in the encyclopedia. But I'd have liked a little bit more on him before now. (This is another complaint that isn't really at Sanderson's feet -- I feel like he may possibly have made extra effort to address these concerns. Really they should have been elaborated more in previous books -- perhaps the ones Sanderson did, so maybe I'm okay with shifting a little of the blame to him. :-) )<br /><br />And there's probably more I could say here, both to praise and to complain, if I spent the time to think about it. But I'm already at ~1400 words, and I really should be moving on to other things now. :-) So I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />All these complaints notwithstanding (and I feel like there are enough I really do have to drop it to a four, even if I loved it like a five), this was awesome. Highly anticipated, thoroughly enjoyable, a satisfying conclusion: Sanderson done good. (Although, reading an epilogue I knew to be almost 100% Jordan, I found myself missing all the more his words for the conclusion to the series. Sanderson doesn't have the same lyrical approach that Jordan does. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and probably particularly wasn't for many of the battle scenes of these last three books. But in the quieter interludes and pauses, I sorely missed the real thing.) And much thanks to Team Jordan for picking him, and bringing Sanderson and his books to my attention. The only real regret I have is that this is an ending to fifteen years of my life, and to much of the endless theorizing, discussion, and anticipation. We all wanted this to happen. But it is a bittersweet ending nonetheless.s Sedai united as one in the Age of Legends.) Yet I was somewhat underwhelmed with the actual mechanics of the Dark here.

B000W746GK|5.0|Have watched it many times. Love the spectacle.<br />Watchable even on my portable dvd player while on the go any where
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have always used Artic Silver thermal paste. It is tons better than the manufacturers thermal paste. I kid you not when you apply this stuff, your cpu, gfx and such will actually run cooler. I am not talking a whole lot, but it does run a few degrees cooler. Its realitively cheap and lasts a long time.
B008Y1YK0I|4.0|The restored version is a pleasure to watch: colors are gorgeous and the music is even more beautiful. There is one problem. The dialogue was restored at one decibel level and the orchestral soundtrack at another decibel level so I had to keep adjusting the volume throughout the movie. In order to hear the dialogue the volume had to be turned way up, but then the music was deafening.
B00AKKS278|5.0|I love the Miracle Morning program. I started 3 weeks ago and i feel amazing. I knew already that I should meditate, say affirmations, etc but I was not doing it consistently. Hal has provided an easy system to follow to insure I get these  in everyday. I love the program so much that I started a support group of 10 women who are following it and we talk every Sun to hold ourselves accountable. I feel so inspired that I know something really great is about to happen to me as I'm  now so much more  focused on my goals.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Sure we've read about what life was like back then and all the events that took place, but these episodes do a great job of detailing what life was like through so many eyes and from all different classes, and the storyline is what makes it so interesting. I couldn't wait to watch season 3, so I ended up buying it, but now I'm dying to find out what happens in season 4!
B002RKRTGO|5.0|Eh? Mysterious monster? Large dogs? Can there be things that even science can't explain? How will Sherlock Holmes figure this mystery out? Read to find out.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Really get a sense of the character as conceived by Doyle. Love Martin Freeman as Watson! Highly recommend this series.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|So many movies and media is made in contribution of Arthur Conan Doyle's very believable character Sherlock Holmes, yet none of those can compare to Doyle's original work. If you've watched those you should give this series a good read.
B005544V6A|5.0|After finally giving the show a chance midway through its second season, I got hooked so badly that I actually paid to watch all the episodes I missed in one marathon viewing. Love it when things get &#34;lippy.&#34;
B0063M22QO|5.0|Down loaded this app. Play it all this all the time on Pogo . Com. Nice to be able  to play it on my  kindle  fire.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I had actually not seen the first season because I figured it was going to be just another law firm formula series. LA Law, Ally McBeal ... whatever. But I watched one episode about halfway through the second season and got hooked. Love Harvey and Donna, love Mike and Harvey, love Rachel and Mike, and cringe in anticipation for any scene with Louis.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Fantastic documentary for music lovers and even those who are not passionate about music. It will pull you in for the entire hour and a half. Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good documentary.
B00A6RVRXG|1.0|Did not care for the music at all - lifeless.  I confused them with Yo la Bamba.. My mistake and I gave the CD away.
0451239377|3.0|The book I got was in good shape but a really old copy.  I probably would have opted for a newer version.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Good old fashioned movie plot with alot of bitchiness thrown in for good measure. Love the fashions of the day and all the fight scenes (would not have been stand-in doubles) - how did they not hurt themselves?.  Just would have loved to have seen the husband at the end with a good lip-locking kiss to seal the deal.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Play all the t ime<br />God h Bjorn. Cc g ghost vBulletin the b a I an on go to
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I've been using the free version of this for years and been very happy with it. I decided to buy it as a \\"thank you\\" to the developer.<br /><br />I can set up several alarms, and only pick the ones I need. Tonight, for example, I'm setting four.....
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed the 3 books...get all 3.  I am more of a James Patterson reader but found this a nice change of pace
1446303314|5.0|I love Finnanger's style.  I have most of her books and plan to sew the dolls as soon as possible..
B004J4WLPU|4.0|It's not often a book has me guessing as to the who the villain is but this story kept me guessing until the very end.  Easy to read and a real page turner I enjoyed it greatly.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|It's not the best of the series but if you love this world and the characters then just shut up and enjoy this book.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Gameplay is fantastic. With three levels of control: water flow, nozzle height and nozzle pitch, the problem solving potential is vast. The characters are worthy of your sympathy, and the music is groovy.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|This was my first exposure to her.  This cd most certainly didn't disappoint!  I put it in while working.  I hated it that it ended, so I simply put it on loop so it would play continually.  Her unique voice is truly pleasing.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is a great movie, the audio & video were excellent, no problems streaming. Downloading was immediate with no problems.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is bitter sweet! I read each book from start to finish and enjoyed every minute of it!!!! Sad that it's over, I need something else to read that's equally as good- I hope there`s a 4th book!
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I recently saw the movie and was deciding which sound track to purchase.  I am loving this one and the wonderful music.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Some aspects hard to believe.  I'm sorry that I can't specify them now--it's been a long time since I read it.  My wife really liked it.<br />Now I remember what was unbelievable.  The author purports to remember minute details of his life at age 15 when he is writing at age 50, like how an article of clothing smelled as part of a long narrative about each main event.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|Everyone could watch this.  Great script, actors and very action packed.  Would buy again if necessary.  Rest in Peace Whitney Houston!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|EXCELLENT game!  I am a chess novice and I am using this to help me learn how to play.  Levels of difficulty can be set.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|the night i ordered this season i stayed up into the long hours of the night viewing as many episoides before giving out to sleep a very easy convienent way to get your flix addictions
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Kept me wanting more and more from the very beginning. Definitely ready to start the next in the series. Can not wait!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|app freezes alot,  wont refresh,  I have to refresh manually to make sure im on live.  Too time consuming.  Sucks.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|Interesting format and wonderful characters with serious war time experiences revealed as the story unfolds. This book also makes you want to visit Guernsey.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I'm kind of biased here. Huge fan of Peter Jackson. Enjoyed Tintin as a child. So I had big expectations and they were met. Glad I finally saw this.
0525478817|5.0|This book broke my heart. I stayed up late to finish it because I just had to know what happened. The teenagers in this book have been through SO much and the sense of humor they continue to hang on to is amazing. Even knowing what kind of destiny awaits them. I wasn't a huge fan of the novel within a novel aspect. I never usually like that, but it didnt take anything away from this beautiful story. Im pretty sure this was my first John Green book. It wont be my last.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I love this movie, it's perfect, it was a gift but we watched the movie together, and it's amazing, I'd definitely buy another movie from amazon!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie is hilariously funny! LOVE the Thunder song! Hilarious! A couple parts are a little raunchy but if you can tolerate that type of stuff in a movie it's all good. Part with Same Jones as Flash Gordon was pretty funny too!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I am just amazed that the people who made Angry Birds made this dog.  It's just non-sensical.  Hard to figure out.  and it's just plain boring.<br /><br />I've noticed that their products are getting a little worse as time goes on.  This is a good indicator of that.  It needs to go back and have someone just start over again.
B009GESJH2|5.0|This guy has grown up over the years, I like how his music has progressed from rap to mainstream rock!!
B00371QQ0M|5.0|And now in the best quality we've been able to see since it was in theaters in the 1980s!<br /><br />This is one of the last sci-fi movies to go through the trouble of producing elaborate scale models and highly detailed sets.  The designers on this film had a free hand to make it a visually memorable film.<br /><br />YES.  A good deal of the story was re-written to make the film move along better.  If you are looking for a faithful re-production of the book, this isn't it.  However, Frank Herbert was still alive when it was made, and he was aware of, and approved the changes made to help bring his story to life in film.<br /><br />There was a 4 and a half hour rough cut made of this film that I would love to see.  Even though it would have been incomplete and unpolished.  The love story with Chani was glossed over to move things along.  For example.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I got this by mistake.  I don't really understand it and haven't tried it.  I'll have to study it a bit more.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Just good, solid, rock n roll for a world that has fallen into synth pop hip hop hell.  Tighter than Reality, more personal than Heathen, this is Bowie doing what he has been doing since Hours: breathing life into a dying genre.  Bowie rocks like a man half his age, but with the maturity and swagger of someone who does it like he invented it.  And reinvented it.  Ten years is too long between Bowie albums, but in this case, the wait was worth it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Takes some studying to get it right.  For some time I was stuck on level 3, then I got the hang of it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and it was amazing!! It was one of the best books I have ever read
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Have not tried some of the higher levels which I will do eventually.  Would be a great game for young ones.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't keep going like the original game on the computer. I don't like having to keep restarting when I finished the whole game.
B002RKRV4Y|5.0|I was told about this story by a friend and I found it for free-it was a win-win situation. I would recommend it for anyone who likes to read.
B00BGD07KS|4.0|Solid song, decent ballad worthy of Mimi's talent.  Probably won't be her next number one, but a nice appetizer for the lambs waiting for the album later this spring.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|I thought that Mark Wahlberg did a pretty good job of playing Bob Lee Swagger.  The Stephen Hunter sniper books featuring Bob Lee Swagger are very good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best app ever you can do tons of stuff and the new update gives It clouds instead of fog TOTALLY ASOME :-D
B00BHMF578|5.0|I recommend this movie to the older generation because it stimulates your memory of this historic event and will remind you of somethings you don't remember or didn't even know was going on. The characters were well played and the direction keep it intense. One to watch more than once.
B004UID2LC|4.0|it has a lot of adds but I still really like it it comes out really clear but the one thing that I don't like is it keeps saying I cant go on it or something
B002N5N5R0|5.0|Amazing story and the characters are outstanding. If you start this you won't want to stop watching it. Can't wait for next episodes to start.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|The terminator series is a collector's item.  This movie plus the rest should be added to your &#34;SF&#34; collection. Where down right coming close to making it fiction.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|Can't believe this small town motorcycle club can get in so much trouble. Makes me want to go buy a scooter.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I like action, intrigue and good looking people.  It's the non fiction world of espionage and sub plots.  Daniel Craig is one of the best James Bond I have seen in a long time.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This is a book about a male MarySue who gets everything he wants. It is poorly thought out and poorly written.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|It's a crazy world out there. And the supposed event happened sometime ago in our political world. Just look how<br />things have changed in our current climate of time.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Well-conceived story line for this murder mystery.  Matthew McC plays the part of a lawyer who is likeable and disgusting at the same time.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|would be better if there was actually more to do, ky kids love it but they get bored rather quickly
B005COO1X6|3.0|I have read all of Stephen Kings stories and this is a bit disappointing. The story starts out well and has a good hook in the middle but ends quite abruptly with an ending that seems as though King got tired of writing and just ended to be done with it&#62;
B00005MP58|4.0|I would recommend this movie, great cast, good movie, Colin Firth is great as usual, I have watched the last 3 remakes of this Jane Austin classic, this is just as good.
B002PAQETY|4.0|I ordered this cd because the band being Welsh caught my attention. The music is good, however I personally like Kelly Jones and his solo album better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great. Show. I am absolutely hooked on it. There is so much I have learned about how those English homes are maintained. Cannot wait for next season!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fell in love with this show from the first episode of Season 1. I've been hooked ever since. It reminds me of a very dramatic Anne of Green Gables meets the Titanic. If you love history, love stories, and the early 1900's era, you will love Downton Abbey.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It works pretty good It gets really annoying though if you have 10+ News feeds though it can get really.Irritating because it shows some on the old one mixed in with the newer ones
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Great movie for family with older teenage kids, not appropriate for younger children. Love the story line and the actors.
B0009P66TK|5.0|Excellent!.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Lots of twists and turns in this season, and I will admit I cried in some episodes! I loved it!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|i love his game but soon after getting it it started returning to the home screen every time i tried to open it. tried re downloading but it still happens.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't usually like soap-opera type shows, but I love period drama movies so I tried this one. It's lovely. You get really invested in the characters. I love some, and truly hate others!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Osmos is fun, beautiful, and has a great soundtrack. The controls are easy to learn (it's hard to imagine how they could be any simpler) and the game runs smooth as butter. My only gripe is that it gets really hard in the later levels. That does not detract from the game overall, though.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|IMO, this is a great game. A lot of fun, addiction, a good storyline, and, best of all, zombies! Swords, arrows, zombies, oh my!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Story moved well, I could follow the story line from past to future, etc. I did find all the characters a bit confusing to track, but can't wait to read more of Harry Bosch
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Great book about an extraordinary American. Chris is truly legendary and knowing the rest of this story makes you sad for Taya and his children who sacrificed so much.
B00742GBDM|4.0|I liked this story... been meaning to read the book for years and still hadn't.  Saw this on Prime and loved every moment.  The acting was stellar!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the progressive challenge of this game. i only wish that you could skip levels you are unable to complete, and come back to it at a later time without having to exit and reenter the game. It was a great game for the price!
B008I3RARW|2.0|Does not run off line on my android<br />Does not run off line on my android<br />Does not run off line on my android
B009A87ZKG|5.0|George C. Scott is Patton!  I do remember the controversy this movie made at the time but what a role!  Outstanding!
B008CRC506|5.0|This is the best show on TV in a long time. If you like Broadway Musicals this is the show to watch.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|If you enjoy futuristic flicks, these are the greatest!  Hope they come out with another series.  The way it ended, they could!
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|Absolutely fabulous set of songs-- so excited to have new material!!  I must say I am a die-hard and truly appreciate that Bowie is not for everyone, certainly not for those who enjoy superficial noise as music.  This work is no different.  Be prepared to really listen.  It may take you a few listens to \\"meet\\" the songs, but well worth the effort. High energy, high mystic, deep thoughts and comments on our world.  You'll hear echos of previous songs from throughout Bowie's career... Space Oddity, Sweet Thing, Supermen, others-- quite clever and classy.  I'm eagerly awaiting live appearances and the opportunity to see David and the gang on the road again!  Simply Brilliant!!!!!!!!
B0014BQQYS|5.0|This is a classic!  Even though they're the bad guys, you're hoping they win.  If you like Paul Newman and Robert Redford, you'll love Butch and the Kid!
B005VPRETE|5.0|My daughter hasn't stopped playing with her LEGO Friends sets since Christmas! She has just started making her own creations using the different parts from all the sets. They all work well together. Love these LEGO sets!
B00683JK9K|5.0|This app is very soothing.  I really like the way the pieces are laid on the right side of the picture.  You also have a lot of control on how the puzzles are played.  You can change if the pieces rotate or not, how many pieces there are in the puzzle.  I wish it had more scenes available.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|When I started this book, it was slow...so slow that I almost put it down and moved on to something else.  I'm glad I didn't. The pace slowly began to pick up, but even faster was the rate that I felt myself drawn into the web that was woven by the author.  I came to the conclusion half way through the book that I empathized with the main character,  wondered how this stuff could possibly happen to a young boy of 15, and that what was really happening here was a cultural-anthropological statement on the state of social irresponsibility in North America.  Fascinating!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The play is near the top of my list of favorites, if not at the top, and this movie has totally done it justice. Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and Russell Crowe were all incredible. And Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were perfect choices for the Thenardier's. The fact that the songs were sung live makes this now the new bar for future musical films. The whole movie is a masterpiece, with sets, designs, choreography, costumes and the cast and crew. I cannot recommend this movie more! Even if you don't care for musicals, this is one you should really see! It truly is just superb!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is a very entertaining and fun time killer.once you play its very hard to sop gaming a very cool and real thing to do
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Sarah Jessica Parker and her friends are truly city girls. The DVD shows all the problems that can occur with 3 single girls living in the city.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Have always enjoyed Ian Rankin's Rebus series and was glad to see him back in action if only as a civillian.  The interface with other detectives and the &#34;bad&#34; guys is always fun to read.  A great read by my standards
B007REV4T8|5.0|Upon viewing this movie, I feel that it is one of the best movies that Daniel Craig has ever made and hopefully he will continue to make more like this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|omg this game is so awsesome its so fun I love horeses so this the perfect game for me its an wonderful game
B0062HS03O|5.0|One of the best singers of this year. She is truly one of the wonders of the singing world. I truly enjoy listening to her.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Super cute! If you are an old school video gamer or just a parent of young kids. Some of the language is a little coarse for the soft ears but the film is fantastic!
B00003CXRM|5.0|George Clooney and his counterparts in this movie are the greatest. As compared  to The Odyssey, this movie is truly one of the greatest ever made.
B00846WWVM|3.0|I love the story line and how the water does stuff to different objects but to change the aim of the cannon is extremely difficult to do quickly. Needs to have a dial in the corner or something that you can do at the same time you are moving it up or down. And why does the circle to aim the cannon disappear? Love this genre of gaming (puzzles, obstacle courses, etc.) but lousy controls.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Her voice is the voice of an angel. I could sit and listen her to from day to day and enjoy it more and more each time that I listen to her.
B00A6TYCNQ|2.0|yea this game is pretty good. nice graphics nice storyline ect. But regally gameloft? 6.99 for the game and EVEN MORE MONEY TO MAKE IT TROUGH? WE ARE NOT MADE OF MONEY GAMELOFT QUIT YOUR MONEYSAPPING ASSES OUTTA HERE
B0098VXE50|5.0|Snow White and the Huntman is truly one of the best movies of the year. Ive watched it several times and just seems to get better and better.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|The GUI on this isn't the best, but it is pretty straightforward nonetheless. The only thing I would like to see added to this app is a way to do a one-touch download of all books purchased. I scanned through and ordered about 50 books from my computer, thinking they would automatically get sent to my tablet, but they didn't. The covers do, but then you hav eto go through one by one to download the books themselves. I'd rate 5 stars if not for this.
B001E75QH0|5.0|Indiana Jones is truly one great adventurous hero in some great stories. He is one in a milion. Ive enjoyed watching these videos over and over.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I liked the way the author developed the character's in a new and different way.
B000002LND|5.0|The songs on this CD was truly inspirational. I could sit and listen to her songs all day and truly enjoy the moment that she is singing them.
B008YCMM2A|5.0|Loved this period in Miles' (and everyone involved's) career. Scorching performances. A great recording from beginning to end, and highly recommended.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|After watching the first show on TV, I became hooked on the Glee Shows. They have great entertainment value plus the music is fantastic to listen to.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was apprehensive about purchasing the series, but I'm glad I did. Hunger Games was important in setting the stage for the series, but Catching Fire was excellent, and what I feel to be the strongest book of the trio. Definitely worth the time and money. Highly reccomend!
B008EQIEWS|5.0|A great DVD to go along with the Clash of the Titans movie. Sam Worthington is one of the greatest actors of our times.
0385738765|4.0|Great book, again couldnt put it down. However, I liked the first one better(theyare alwasy better) but i cant wait to read the next one to find out how it plays out.
B000083E79|5.0|Cher has the voice of an angel when she sings. I truly enjoy listening to her high tones and words of her songs.
0385737955|5.0|My boyfriend was reading this in this classroom and so i picked it up to help. I loved it couldnt put it down and so much better than the second book, although i couldnt put it down eaitehr cant wait to finish the series.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|What I truly liked most about this movie was the background scenery and the actors--they were some of the best backgrounds and the actors were truly great.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I enjoyed it very much.  I had read &#34;Pillars&#34; a couple of years ago and just never got around to reading &#34;WWE&#34;.  It was fast moving and as usual for Follett, the characters were engaging and memorable.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I generally like this app, but have a real frustration problem when I am in Facebook chat with someone.  After I type each entry, it immediately pops back up to really old messages and I have to constantly scroll down.  Someone needs to fix this or I'll find another way to get on Facebook!
1878424319|5.0|Once i read this book. Love has changed for me. Life has changed for me. I give and help even more. I can express my true feelings and mean it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is fun to play and always easy concept for th younger and older to understand.  It's a true classic
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|This album is crap. It is way too soft to be considered Rock. The only 2 tracks that are actually good are the radio hits. Track 1 and 3. The rest of the songs suck. I would not recommend buying this album to anyone unless you don't care about wasting your hard earned money. I would only recommend buying track 1 and 3 for iTunes. I was definitely disappointed. I hope their next album is better than this one. I am giving this album 2 stars only because they had 2 good songs.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really really liked the first one but the second one I loved because the story got more intense and it wasn't just about the sexual exploits.  Now its turning into a really good story, a cross between a romance novel and a mystery thriller in my opinion.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|I enjoyed it and my six year old also enjoys it and is able to play it without much trouble.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Don't be discouraged when reading this book as the 2nd book in the trilogy is much much better. But you must read this one to get to the 2nd one and for the 2nd one to make sense.  You will not be disappointed once you get to the 2nd one.  It is a real page turner with a lot more story and background info on Mr Grey.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have had fun playing this game. This seems like a was getting chased by random people! You should get this game.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like having this on my kindle fire hd tablet so I have something to occupy my mind on the go.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is a great movie with a message.  It is so funny kept me  laughing all through the movie but kind a sad at the end.  Great acting by Ruth Gordon,  I loved the movie.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is so addictive!! The free version does have lots of pop-up ads, but some of them are actually good ads that I am interested in, so they don't bother me, especially because I'm used to it.  Tons of levels and I like the different birds and their little sounds...LOL! It cracks me up.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved the movie. The scenery was beautiful. The story was very interesting and really kept my attention. I want to watch it again.
B00003CXRM|5.0|My husband and I love this movie and could watch it over and over.  The transaction was fast and easy and I would highly recommend to my friends.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is a nice book although it gets a little repetitive on the descriptions of the erotic encounters... almost the same format troughout the book, anyhow it is a very nice book.
B005LAII94|3.0|SAVAGES was an okay surprise. How close to the truth this is I don't know. The two Californian dudes growing the best quality grass seem like real surfer dudes from the beaches of California. One of the dudes has come back from the war in Afhganistan and the other is a trained botanist. The soldier dude is the enforcer, where the other takes care of buisness. Both dudes share the same woman and when the Mexican drug cartels move in to take over their business the girl is kidnapped and the two are forced to work for the Cartel<br /><br />The best performances come out of Benicio Del Toro and John Travolta. Both actors light up the movie once they're on screen. Oliver Stone stages a brilliant action set-piece 65 minutes into the movie. The movie is extremely violent and one has to see the extended cut. How truthful the ending is I don't know? Still any movie from Oliver Stone is an event for me. Can't wait to see what he does next.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|As a 50 year fan I feel that this is the best since the  Pet Sounds album of the nineteen sixties!
B0062P3392|2.0|The true elements to this story have been exaggerated to the movie star personality and the type of films JASON STATHAM makes. It's a formula that seems familiar in most Statham action movies. Even though I thought this film could have been better as for a Statham film it's one of his better films alongside THE MECHANIC. The premise to this film is intriging and had my interest to a certain degree. The shoot-outs, car chases and hand-to-hand combat have an air of authenticity. It's a well shot movie. The only problem is it has some smelly acting in the supporting roles. The one bad performance was the Sheik's son who delivers an amateur performance and can't hold his own alongside DeNero and Clive Owen. It's worth a look as the this type of spy/mercenary genre is a favourite. As for me DeNero was showcased better in John Frankenheimer's RONIN, are good companion piece to THE KILLER ELITE.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|It was a good read and very enlightening with regards to the real action going on in Iraq.  I had put off reading it, but felt that it was appropriate in light of Chris Kyle's recent death.  I am glad I did, real american hero.  The story shows a human side to him that in spite of his human shortcomings, he was there for his buddies.  The line &#34;Runaway&#34; was a hoot.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|From a filmmaking POV ZERO DARK THIRTY and THE HURT LOCKER are crafted by a genuine filmmaker who brings a documentary type narrative to a highly controversial film that is ZDT. The film starts off with a highly disturbing interogation/torture scene that goes on for a lenghty time in finding crucial intell to the whereabouts of highly placed terrorists. One might say after 9/11 America's moral compass had become warped when it came to finding leads in the whereabouts of terrorists and potential terrorists. As for me I've always believed torture had been sanctioned throughout American history in the fight during the Cold War and Vietnam to the present day. The USA might say it doesn't sanction torture but any self-respecting and educated person can see through such lies.<br /><br />Getting back to ZDT the film has an absolute air of authenticity in the manner that the film is put together;through it's realistic cinematography and the fact-like manner that the script is written.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain is the child of post-9/11 and it has become her sole obsession in finding Bin Laden. Her performance is the heart and soul of the film and the perfect actress for audiences to relate with and go on this disturbing journey of suicide bombers, IED bombers and fanatic terrorists who would not stop at nothing to see the deaths of Americans and innocent civilians.<br /><br />As for conspiracy theorists one might say why Bin Laden did not have underground tunnels to make a quick getaway? Since no one has seen his body or any photo's for that matter ( photo's in todays digital age can be easily manipulated and have little credibility)sceptics would say it was a propaganda ploy for the USA and West to move onto other parts of the world and give people their catharsis in the death of Bin Laden.<br /><br />As for the film ZDT from a filmmaking aspect should have won best picture then ARGO. ARGO is a feel good movie and sat well with the Academy. ZDT and THE HURT LOCKER at this point are some of the best films dealing with terrorism alongside Steven Spielbergs MUNICH and the '60's film THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS. How truthful ZDT is I don't know. A lot of questions have been left unanswered since the Bush family had been involved in buisness dealings with the Bin Laden family. Only time will tell and maybe 20 years from now when sensitivity has died down to a certain extent we might get a film similar to Oliver Stones JFK.
B003G4W49C|5.0|How did I miss this book?  I had not heard of it until I saw something online regarding the movie.  While it is a pretty simple read, it does address a lot of deep topics such as children growing up to fast, society forcing adulthood on them, all the way to genocide,
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Although this book is not in itself that exciting or great as the previous 3, it sets up the next book in the series very well.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I got this for my wife's birthday and she really looks forward to watching this. The show is highly rated and should be great to watch. It arrived right on time.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|I purchased The Hobbit from Amazon instant video and 27 minutes in got an error message and could not get it to stream further.<br /><br />After some time on with a support tech, turns out this is a known issue. And, yet, they let me buy it.<br /><br />Don't buy this movie. Wait for the DVD. Streaming is broken for this one.
B007SN2FCS|3.0|I ordered this book to replace the Goodnight Moon board book that my twins pulled apart.  I wasn't sure if this was going to be an abbreviated version or not but I ordered it anyway.  Turns out, it is an abbreviated version.  Rather than return it, I leave it out for the babies to manhandle and bought a replacement board book to read at bedtime.<br />The cloth book itself is fine.  It's colorful and seems durable.  It's just not the same as the board book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is like granny run.....just so much harder...I get frustrated cause I keep killing my little man...teeheehee, but I did make it past the first level, well at least it said I did anyway.....great game!!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Castle is really just a lot of fun.  I can't stand most shows like this, just too repetitive, and every single one of them (ncis - law and order) is so close in both form and content if you've seen one then you've seen em all.  Castle manages to break out of that mold with a VERY strong cast - i can't stress how strong - and great writing.<br /><br />Give it a shot. If you don't fall in love with Beckett and Castle with the first few episodes you aren't human.

B008B3H4VQ|4.0|I think this album is pretty good by Linkin Park.  It provides a decent mix of their old and new styles.
B00979CS50|4.0|Im a big fan of Neil & Crazy Horse,and although this is a good body of music, its not 5 star.Its good ole boy rock n roll and way better than most of the music that is released today.You wont be disappointed....support your favorite artists.
B00871C09S|5.0|James Stewart and Grace Kelley are awesome in this movie. This movie was remade by Christopher Reeve and Daryll Hannah not too many years ago. Both movies are wonderful but I do prefer the one with James Stewart.
B005F9CPG8|3.0|Do we really need another greatest hits package by the Beatles?Save your money on this one and spend the extra to get the Red & Blue regular or remastered Beatles greatest hit sets.OR go out and purchase all their original studio recordings.You wont be disappointed....support your favorite artists.

B0025KVLVA|5.0|Start with their studio cds and then move onto the past masters volume 1&2.Both belong in your Beatles collection, but I believe the Past Masters vol.2 is better than 1,as it is more like a greastest hits package of singles and B-sides....support your favorite artists.

1469273756|5.0|This was a refreshing return to feel of the Jack Ryan series. After &#34;Teeth of the Tiger&#34; and &#34;Against All Enemies&#34; depressed me as a devotee of this universe, this, and &#34;Locked On&#34; have restored my faith in this evolution of the series. Mark Greaney is a far better ghost writer for the Ryan-verse than Peter Telep.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Cranford is one of the most beautiful and well made british dramas out there. It is funny as well as serious. My mother and two teenage siblings just ADORE it!
0316212261|5.0|I am an avid reader of Jim Butcher's Dresden Files, and Gail Carriger's writing fit me like a comfortable armchair. I was leary, based on the cover, that it might be more my wife's type of period supernatural romance, but fortunately my mother taught me the old cliche of not judging a book that way.<br />This series is so much more than that. The main character is immediately the reader's companion and guide through the tale. Definitely a can't-put-it-down read.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Beautiful. Magical. Stunning. Romantic. Imagitive. Creative. Musical. Wonderful. Heartfelt. Historic. Dramatic. Inspiring. Peaceful.<br />I LOVED IT, LOVE IT and WILL ALWAYS LOVE IT
0375842209|5.0|Zusak has accomplished a masterful handling in beautiful prose of a difficult subject. This book belongs among the classics of literature.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is an awesome show! It can be scary, funny, and emotional all in one episode. It is never predictable and it keeps you wanting more! Love it!  5 stars for sure!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I watched the last three episodes on Amazon Prime last night, and love the arc of the series. I recognize the updates of some of the original stories,  and I very much like the scruffy Holmes, the wounded Dr. Watson, and the cops, especially Aidan Quinn. I like the idea that even a brilliant mind can become addicted from self-medication, and that despite his many quirks, even the genius Holmes must deal with the realities of life. I also like that he is not celibate, as many of the other portrayals are, that he does not consider sex to be a distraction or reduction mental energy.  This Holmes is much less the gentleman, and his open appraisals are very effective in making people uncomfortable.<br /><br />OKAY, so I never met a Holmes I did not like, and I have read most of the original stories, and seen most the older movies with Basil Rathbone and others, and the new steampunk movies and the BBC versions. . I liked this enough that I paid to watch it. It was a good deal. Get it now.
0425263916|5.0|After reading \\"Bared to You\\" I immediatley had to download \\"Reflected in You\\" which I read in two days! This series makes you yearn for more. It has an awesome story line and hot and steamy love scenes. It made me feel each emotion right along with Eva while reading. It was very easy to become absorbed into their lives. I cannot wait until \\"Entwined In You\\" comes out!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this show!! Irt great and I love Joan & Sherlock wotking together.Must see TV for the new season.
B000001ELL|5.0|2010 was the year that I was buying a lot of USED Kiss albums on CD. I did buy the record orig. in the mid summer of 1979 & I was quite happy w/ this purchase. Here is my review now:<br /><br />1. I Was Made For Loving You...I really enjoyed this song when it was on the Top 40 & it reached #11 in June of '79. The music on this song was so unlike Kiss, as compared to their EARLIER releases. This song was & still is, DISCO w/ a hell of a danceable beat. I always loved this song & the EXTENDED DISCO version is EXCELLENT & it is 7 min. & 35 seconds.<br /><br />2. 2,000 Man...was written by Mick Jagger & Keith Richards in the late 60s. As I was reading some of the reviews on the Amazon pages, I had discovered that other people rate \\"2,000 Man\\" as the very BEST on this album. In my honest opinion, I don't hate this song, but it's my LEAST favorite song incl. here. I do prefer Kiss' version over the original  Rolling Stones version. I do like the music & the beat to this song, but the lyrics are rather stupid w/ NOT  much imagination, sometimes. The only lyric that do like is \\"Don't you know...I'm a 2,000 Man\\".<br /><br />3. Sure Know Something...was a minor hit for Kiss. This song has a SLOWER disco beat.  I like this song quite well.<br /><br />4. Dirty Livin'...I like the beat & words to this song.<br /><br />5. Charisma...is sung by Gene Simmons. Again this reminds me, a little bit, of a Disco song. I love the words & the music, along w/ it's catchy beat. I could picture how this song could mix well w/ \\"20th Century Foxes\\" from the 1980 movie \\"Foxes\\" & it was performed by Angel.  Actually, \\"20th Century Foxes\\" was ALSO from the 1980 \\"Live Without a Net\\" by Angel. Back to \\"Charisma\\" it is really a dynamite song.<br /><br />6. Magic Touch...is my 2nd TOP favorite song on this album. The music & esp. the words are touching & actually tender, in it's meaning. I love this song VERY MUCH. I also feel that this song pays ONE HELL of a GREAT compliment to a wife, lover, girlfriend or etc. THIS song is QUITE unforgettable just like the rest of the \\"Dynasty\\" album is.<br /><br />7. Hard Times...I like this song & it's meaning quite well.<br /><br />8. X-Ray Eyes...another Gene Simmons song, which I think is real good. I like it a lot.<br /><br />9. Save Your Love...this song is pretty good, too.<br /><br />I love this album even if it was quite a bit different. Kiss was keeping up w/ the latest music trends...in this case, some Disco.  This album is always recommended.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|This was very good!!! I loved every minute of it. I highly recomend it!!!! It was just like a dream!!!
067144901X|5.0|My daughter loves this and of course, we have memorized it at this point.  Sometimes it's the only way to get her to eat is if we recite books like this one to her.  She loves it - definitly in her top 5 (she's 11 months).  I also teach toddlers and my classes all love this book, year after year.  We usually wear out a few copies per school year.
B009ZM76J2|5.0|thought provoking ---- wasnt sure about the girls' biological father --what was that story of the intermarriage that was going on ----between the natives and the whites.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Its been 10 or so years since I last watch Daria on television.......and I can honestly say that watching this show again was like getting in touch with an old friend.  I would recommend this DVD series to anyone who likes to laugh.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a stradegy but it gets really addictive and it is like you  never want to stop playing it!!!!!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|This game starts out great then glitches and will only let you get close to the end and I had to start over more than toe times! What a wast of time and money. $6.99 until after you buy it then it's &cent;.99 or free . Amazon really knows how to screw you out of your money. Like most app games I've bought  I'm out money !
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I am a lover of history...ALL history...it's only thru history that we get a true picture of who we are and where we came from.
0345803485|2.0|Well. I have just finished the 50 shades of grey trilogy, and i have to say, absolute disappointment.  i expected the books to be kinky,rude yes, but written well and an entertaining read. Im no prude but the entire story is beyond a joke and the writing is god awful. I do understand this book is sort of fantasy, just a story yes but has the author,a middle aged woman writing this....has she actually researched the sex lives of 20 something women? At the first sex scene i found myself laughing out loud..and it didn't stop until i was about halfway through the second book,where i was so bored of reading the continuous repetitive sex scenes, actually started skipping them to find some kind of a story.All they seem to do in this book is have sex,it gets boring. The way its worded is just a joke. 'cupped my sex' for some reason the (Constant) use of this word irritated the hell out of me, who the hell calls a woman's privates 'her sex'. just stupid. I could not get my head around the character 'Ana', again she just irritated me throughout.She comes across as needy,desperate and pathetic,totally abandoning everything else for one man,who,quite frankly,comes across as a petulant spoilt brat. I call that some kind of domestic abuse?! Never have i read about,heard in conversation,or come across in any magazines etc all the 'oh my's , the begging 'Christian please's and pathetic grovelling she uses in EVERY sex scene. This is basically twilight,only there's explicit sex  this time. Christian Grey is Edward, Anastasia is Bella and Jose is Jacob,the friend on the side. No woman orgasms  at the drop of a hat,or rather a drop of a name said out loud. I spent good money on these books expecting an entertaining,slightly rude read instead i was bombarded with crap writing,over the top sex scenes,a wet flannel of a story and left feeling the need to write a ranty review. by all means read out of curiosity as i did, but my advice would be to save your money and buy a nice twilight dvd instead.d instead.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game kept my attention and was enjoyable !!!<br />Nice graphics and puzzles that were challenging but not frustrating.<br />Worth the purchase.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I really did.  It had everything a movie needs.  A beginning, middle and end with all sorts of storylines, special effects, interesting characters, seriousness, humor, fighting, action and a little romance mixed in.  It was well put together and kept my attention throughout the entire movie.  I liked it a lot.  I wish there were more movies like this.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Came as described.<br />Plays beautifully.<br />The movie itself is one of my favorites. It's gorgeous both in imagery and in storytelling. Dark and gruesome, yes, but also fantastical and breathtaking.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Saw her in concert. She made this album come to life! Awesome artist with a great future! A must have!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Came as described. Plays perfectly.<br />The film itself is visually stunning as well as very emotional. The heartbreaking clash between the deceit and brokenness with innocence and wonder is surely one you'll feel in the gut. It's an important message going out to those who don't identify with the young man's pain. Everyone must see.
B005938CS0|3.0|Been listening to Maiden since I was 8 years old...now am 36.  Had to replace a scratched up CD with one of them new fangled download things for my ipod.  Yeah, I'm old but this record came out before I was even born.  Great songs, not so great recording quality.  You can't appreciate Maiden without taking a listen to their first album.  Paul Dianno is a better vocalist than what you hear on this recording.  His voice live was great!  This is where today's METAL began.
B00015BIOQ|4.0|Been looking for &#34;No Sanctuary Here&#34; since hearing it as a hi-end demo.  Could never find the track at high resolution.  Found the CD used, and think it was worth the price.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book is wonderful. This book shows emotions of horses. It causes people to think in the animal's perspective. Michael Morpurgo has shown a great example of hardships on horses, and how horses can be determined to find a loved one that they once left behind.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|KEPT MY INTERST THROUGHOUT, WAS SURPRISED AS THE STORY PROGRESSED.  MANY TWISTS AND TURNS TO KEEP THE READER WONDERING.  DID HE, DIDN'T HE?
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I haven't decided yet if I like this as much as &quot;Hunt for Kavala&quot; (another awesome match 3 game). I'm not a big fan of this game's board pieces, as they seem somewhat low tech, but the actual gameplay and premise are super creative. (Where do these guys come up with this stuff?) Way to go, Playrix!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|My teen recently got into the Halo games.  He wanted this movie for Xmas.  He was not disappointed, he enjoyed it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wish that I would have read this sooner. Coming off age story that most anyone can relate to. Easy to read, but requires thought.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Great movie! If you like music you will love it! Watched it with my wife and kid Sunday night. Rent it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book!!! It addresses his intimacy issues in a way that people are able to understand and relate too. Not as much smut as the first or third book also!!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|This was another of the series that fell into a good movie group and I liked it so much.I now have the complete group.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So much better than the first. I absolutely could not put it down!compared to 50 shades, this series is much better because it's way more realistic.
0061992860|4.0|I didn't watch this movie, but my wife watched it ans was really interested in it and she liked the fact that they give quite a bit of information about how to survive.
B0047E6LW6|4.0|Great album and they are even better live. Their stage persona, vocals and music are excellent! Well worth buying this album
B00006JDVV|5.0|I saw part of this movie when I was channel surfing and ended up watching the last 15 min;s of it and then I bought it and thought that it was great.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|My grandson says that he likes game a lot but not his favorite.<br />I guess only his favorite gets a rating of 5.
B00139W3NE|5.0|This was a great movie, and it took my attention right away and kepped it all thru the movie. To get the Idea's going and makes you think if something like this could be true,
034580404X|5.0|I have read this trilogy before, and knew I would want to read them again.  So after having purchased several sets as gifts, this one was for me!  I have already finished the first book again, they are so well written & engrossing if somewhat unbelievable, but isn't that the whole idea of books...to take us away from the evryday sameness?
B00555X8OA|5.0|Purchased book for a philosophy class and the book was exactly what i needed for the class. the only thing that would have helped is reference to the actual pages in the book.
1608862801|4.0|The comics reprinted in this trade paperback are great and will be enjoyed by people of all ages. Some fans will be disappointed to find that the back-up stories are not reprinted in this edition, but their their exclusion makes the story arc more accessible to casual readers. This is a pretty good trade paperback overall, but I'd personally recommend the \\"Mathematical Edition\\" to more hardcore fans of the series.<br /><br />Adventure Time Vol. 1 collects the first four issues of the series and includes a cover gallery.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Great album by them as always!! I have been a fan for a long time and wouldnt expect anything less!!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This was exactly what I ordered and it was on time, I will be buying from these people again. I will recommend this place to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just started, but it is fun so far.<br /><br />very nice for a free app since it isn't covered in ads like so many other apps.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it kept her very busy she was very excited about it she is only 8 years old and got top score Yahoo.
B00000K3G8|5.0|In my haste to purchase wit one click, I failed to read that the item was missing the back cover. Definitely my fault, and a good learning experience. Otherwise, it is in fantastic condition.
B00170I7GG|4.0|This video could not be seen on my computer because of some technicality about registration of my PC.  I am very disappointed in Amazon.<br />Mary Lee McCown
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This is a great movie period, would recommend kicking back w/popcorn & taking the time to watch it. 5 stars
B00B99KJR0|3.0|The graphics and sound are nice but somehow this game seems to fall a bit flat on the fun and engaging level!  It`s not bad, but it`s nothing to write home about either!  Get it while it is free, otherwise there are more engaging options out there!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's a fun game. Rovio updates it from time to time. This is a very popular app as you can see. Basically you take birds and fling them at green pigs. But it is a good time killer. I also recommend Angry Birds Seasons, Angry Birds Space, Angry Birds Rio, Angry Bride Star Wars and finally Bad Piggies. Hope this helps!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|We live with nature in great respect. This movie reflected well what it tried to portray in struggle with ferocious tiger.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Even though I like this app I still think it needs some tweaking. Mojang is a good company to make apps. But I miss my Xbox version.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I have read all five of the books in the Song of Ice and Fire series, and I have now seen both of the first two seasons of this TV series.  I suppose I could complain, like so many of the book readers, that too many details have been altered to one degree or another or omitted entirely - why, for instance, did they cut Meera and Jojen Reed from the story?  Or what happened to Stannis Baratheon's wife (homely, humourless, introduced him to the religion of the fire god) and daughter (afflicted with greyscale, best and only friend is the foole they brought from across the Narrow Sea to entertain the court at Dragonstone)?  Why does Robb Stark go after an entirely different girl than the one in the books (and who doesn't actually appear until the third book, A Storm of Swords)?  And the scene with Joffrey having the two whores beat each other savagely - is this necessary, especially if we already understood the character to be cruel and capricious, like his mother and &#34;uncle&#34;?<br /><br />But what would be the point?  We all know that our favourite books, when made into movies or TV series, will be altered, sometimes for the better (Shawshank Redemption, where the story was made more concise, and Fight Club, where it was given more linear continuity, are two examples that spring to my mind) but usually for the perceived worse.  Grouse though we may, this is what happens.  I think we can learn to appreciate a well-done story, regardless of the changes.<br /><br />And this one is pretty good, despite the changes I mentioned above.  The writers have still stuck mostly by the original story, easing back on the sometimes burdensome details George R.R. Martin included in the books.  The casting is impeccable - Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, for one, is absolutely perfect; Natalie Dormer plays Margaery Tyrell somewhat sexier than I'd pictured her in the books, but that makes her more appealing; Lena Headey really shines as Cersei Lannister - and the choice of shooting locations absolutely amazing.  Northern Ireland, of course, has been the stand-in for the North of Westeros; Iceland for the far North, beyond the Wall and to the Fist of the First Men; Dubrovnik, Croatia, has provided both King's Landing and some of the interior scenery of Qarth, with Morocco providing the deserts outside.  The story, of course, continues to be gripping, which makes me wonder how they're going to straighten up the narrative once they get to the fourth (A Feast for Crows) and fifth (A Dance With Dragons) books, where the continuity is stopped for a bit; half of ADWD takes place along AFFC's timeline (read Martin's notes in both books), so it's going to need to be tightened up considerably.  But I'm particularly looking forward to the third season, since the body count really soars in the third book and some drastic changes take place.  Onward!ing locations absolutely amazing.

B00BBW16HW|5.0|Not only did this movie make me laugh out loud--loudly--but I actually woke up the next day and watched it again. What a refreshing movie about friendship and the power of the human experience. Loved it.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|So far my daughter has watched this movie at least 5 times.  She has read all the books which make the movie even better because she already knew all the characters.  She loves it, so I am happy!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great place to store anything,  the photo capture feature is really handy.  I like having the ability to capture on multiple devices.
B005LAZIRY|4.0|Yeah, it's not the Opeth you wanted.  But it's the Opeth Mikael wanted!  Deal.  It's a prog-rock album, not a metal album.  Deal.  This is the direction Mikael wanted to go in.  Deal.  He's mature enough to (a) not stay a teenager forever; and (b) have the balls to do his own thing.  Deal.  I saw this band live in Bangalore:  it's not a solo effort.<br /><br />Anyone ever listen to the Led Zeppelin debut and then \\"In Through the Out Door\\" back-to-back?  Yeah, that's it...bands evolve...if you don't enjoy the evolution, no trouble, drop off the wagon, but at least appreciate that Mikael's making the music HE wants to make...which is what artists do.  He's not concerned with spoon-feeding you a repeat adolescent fantasy.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|From all the Oscar talk, I was expecting something more. It was good, but not excellent. Guess I'll watch the movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book!! Could not put it down!! As soon as I finished it the first time I immediately read it again.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|relaxing and challenging.  great graphics.  good story line.  one of the best match 3 games i have played in a long time.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I found this story to be rather humorous. A good lazy day read.  It is a bit predictable, but still a good, relaxing read.
B001FB55LC|5.0|This is movie was great buy:) I absolutely love the movie and have watched it like 4 time since I got it:)
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I wouldnt want a pilot who is drinking on the job. Pilot who a true alcoholic and is stubborn but wants the public to trust him that he will get better, enough!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Some parts of the book are drawn out and was repeated.  Will try his other new book.  Read some of his older ones.
B00B7FXZQS|2.0|The homes in these P.A. movies seem to be the same lay out, with 2 floors. Why not a 1-story home or apartment in a poor area.<br />Always in a nice suburban area. I guess the entity or ghost prefers middle-class lifestyle.<br />This family is going to take neigbor's kid in for days and not have met the family across the street. This would have been kidnapping or an Amber alert right away. Give me a break!!!!
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Both books worth reading but 100 Year Old Man would not be enjoyed by everyone. Having said that, it got a grwat response in our Book Club.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Could of been better, like other gangster movies. I wanted to see more suprises and realistic outlaws, and more fighting.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|SO excited that I got this as the FAOTD! Have had it in my &quot;saved&quot; list forever...waiting for enough funds to buy it guilt-free...then I get it for free! So if u get it today, great! If not tho, don't wait, as this deal may not ever come along again &amp; it's well worth $5! GREAT GAME HOURS OF FUN!!!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|As soon as I watched the first episode - I was hooked. (so was my husband) Now, we are almost caught up, and are trying to avoid spoilers, which is not that easy, as it seems a lot of people are watching it.
B001QJUX24|5.0|I heard on NPR that Spielberg called this &#34;the greatest film of all time&#34;. Not sure if it is the greatest, but it's pretty dang great. I watched it with my 10 year old son and two exchange students from Germany and Thailand. It's a Western but it strangely appeals to all ages because it has a lot of great dialogue, great action, very colorful characters throughout, and some very hard-hitting but well done themes (racism, dark violence). Great movie. Will watch again soon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|horse virtual pet game.  it has some delay that slows the game down at times but fun is to play.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was really surprised by this book. It is taught, fast paced and keeps the reader on their toes for the whole scary ride. No one is what you expect, no event is what it seems and Gillian is deft at pacing and bringing her book to a concise, chilling end.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I was a Dr. Who fan back in the 70's. My young nieces and their dad are always talking about Dr. Who. I couldn't imagine they were airing re-runs. I enjoyed viewing season 1 of this newer version and I'm looking forward to catching some of the other seasons as well.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|This series is a winner.  It is worth seeing more than once -- may be an annual or biennial occurrence in my house.
B009K45Y62|4.0|Maybe kind a small but very cool and limited ;)<br />and also nice Combo CD , i realy like it
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|I loved the music on the show, but this is very poorly mixed. Also, Fade Into You was not able to be downloaded as advertised.
B001RIY49C|5.0|Just awsome ! u got red lighting eyes when u push the button , the voice kind a disturbing i think u can find a way to turn of the sound .Anyway 5 stars
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|This is a cartoon about an old comic book called, The Dark Knight Returns that came out in the 80's. Frank Millar wrote and drew this comic book. The cartoon art is based on his drawings so you get a feel of the comic book by watching this movie. I loved it. Most Batman cartoons are pretty good. The only problem is the voice. They have Peter Weller doing the voice of Batman. His voice is ok.
B007OLYPW2|2.0|I just could not get into this book no matter how I tried.  A third into it, I was still struggling to &#34;get&#34; where the author was going with the story, and had trouble finding any relevance in the characters.  Perhaps too abstract for me (I like mostly lively historical novels, but was trying to break out of my mold), it may be intriquing to those with the patience to see through its pedantic writing style.  Good luck!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is just like temple run 1 and 2 it is the best game I hope you like it
B0035JRVBO|5.0|After many frustrating attempts to &#34;stream&#34; movies from the net, from not being able to find the movie I wanted to not being able to make the process work, I discovered that Amazon will rent movies for immediate watching.  This classic (Forrest Gump) was available, was very reasonable in cost and I was able to watch it immediately -- with no problems whatsoever!  This will be my &#34;go to &#34; place for movies from now on!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The first 30 minutes are amazing.<br />I like the rest of the movie but sometimes it felt too slow.<br />Overall a very good movie.<br />Denzel rocks!
B004WGIXX4|4.0|i would watch it again, awsome movie and would tell other people to watch no strings attached.  they would be happy with it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read about book in NYT, downloaded free book one, was hooked and bought Omnibus. Fascinating premise and socio/psychological page turner. Will definitely read more Howey.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was quick read---The twists and turns in this novel certainly kept me reading to see how it would end!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|my kids picked this game up right away.  the only thing I would change is the ability to race in a grid style.
B00594XOZU|5.0|First off, the 4 star rating is a LIE!!!!! Get it now!!! It's AWESOME!  It's great for talking to friends. I have bothered text +  and KIK. They both have upsides and downsides.<br />  KIK upsides-<br />1- Shows when texts are sending, delivered, and read<br />2- Good to communicate with friends.<br />  KIK downsides-<br />1- Can only text people with the app.<br />Text + upsides-<br />1- Can text people with app AND regular cellphones.<br />  Text + downsides-<br />1- to many ads<br />2- takes time to get texts.<br /><br />Based on that GET BOTH!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Got this for my kid.  It took him several days to put together and he loved every minute.  The detail is amazing.
0670024813|5.0|Jared Diamond has written books and has had one documentary based on his book Guns, Germs, and Steel.  In this book he illustrates what differences other cultures have for the activities such as child rearing, children's toys, and diet and their effects on the world around them and themselves.  Jared Diamond has a knack for getting a sense of culture into another so that it is understandable and revealing.  There are these little &#34;light bulb&#34; moments that occur that might have been unnoticed because one culture seems them every day but they differ in perception in accordance to their effect, such as carrying a child in a back sling rather than pushing it in a baby carriage.  Very intriguing and enlightening book which we would all do well to read.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The beginning of all the books, all 3 will be required,. for a tale of adventure and excitement, but won't end in a final conclusion<br />in the 3rd volume of the adventures.
1616550414|5.0|If you love Legend of Zelda this IS a must have. It is absolutely stunning and great to look at
080701429X|5.0|This is an inspiring and beautiful book, that must be read, re-read, and then passed on to loved ones and friends.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I did not know that this type of app was available still have a lot of learning to consume on apps but this one is awesome not only do I have a flashlight but I can have different colors too on my phone screen.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The Pro version is better than the complimentary one. Calibrating the battery certainly extends the life of the battery as well as offering correct summaries of the lasting power as it is used in different ways from sitting in standby to watching movies.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a challenging, great to pass time with when there is nothing else to do if you do not get bored.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham spins another fine web, this one mostly outside the courtroom and a bit different than many of his past but the same intensity and he has not last that talent for pulling the reader in.  Fast, fun read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get it if you have any money can't get moDs<br />Adding skins and chatting get get it it is Great
B007REV4YI|5.0|I use to watch Bond movies all the time when I was younger, but they started to lose interest for me around the first Piece Bronson one.  Daniel Craig really is more of the action man that I want to see.  I beautifully shot film.  I highly recommend.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I haven't yet watched this on Blu-Ray as I received it only today.  However, I've watched it on DVD and TV and love, love, love the show.<br /><br />Now being in a blended family, I'm hoping the rest of the family will enjoy the ship and crew as much as I had.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Great movie first of all. I love Johnny Depp. Product was exactly how described and in great condition. Cover was perfect and disc played great
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A marvelous insight into the minds of actual combatants of the air war over Europe. The reunion of the two pilots is one of the most poignant stories I have ever read.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|At first this item appeared pretty sturdy despite its cheap design. I knew that since I bought it for a cheap price the structure was also going to be cheap. I didn't expect it to break so easily when inserting my iPhone though. I would have given it at least four stars if it did not break after a few use.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|For being such an old film the really went above and beyond with the cinematic effects and the twist at the end was really good. 👍👍
0738212415|5.0|I have no drawing experience or talent.  This book is so much fun and right from the beginning you see results, I am only on Chapter 3 but already see an improvement in what I thought I could draw.  I would recommend this book to anyone that<br />has never picked up a pencil to draw, you will love this book.  I am 68 years old and if I can do it, anyone can.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Plot twists and resolutions are missing what makes the book world so entertaining and suspenseful. A great story line that was not used at its full potential...
B000YHE4AG|5.0|My kids and I traveled over Christmas, they watch Elf twice during our flights.  They love to watch this silly show yearly at Christmas.
0060007737|5.0|This is the one book to buy if you're going to buy a book on branding. Not only does he provide suggestions for how to go about branding, but he also gives many great examples of how branding has been effective for well-known companies. I've loaned this book to many friends and they all have found it to be as helpful as I did.
B009ZQGNPQ|2.0|This review is about the series itself.  Downton Abbey is a wonderful show that has developed some fantastic characters both honorable and admirable and also evil and conniving.  I've largely enjoyed the show  to this point, with a few exceptions.  Every now and then the writers will take a character and cause him or her to do something that is completely outside the scope and nature of that character.  This is where the show loses me.  If you establish, for example, that a man is honorable and will go down in flames before he will ever say a bad word about anyone else, then you can't have him blackmailing people in later episodes.  It just doesn't work.<br /><br />Season three started off okay, but ended terribly.  Toward the end of the story, the writers began to alter the characters taking some amazing ones and regressing them and taking one evil one and trying to suddenly make him into an honorable fellow and a hero.  It's not believable.  I'm not saying people can't change, but there needs to be a reasonable impetus or a change of philosophy before that change takes place.<br /><br />I love the setting.  I have come to love and admire some of the characters of this show.  But I quit.  The writers have killed it for me.  Watch season three at your own risk.  If you're anything like me, it will disappoint.
B002O3Z50Q|5.0|it was very well done A retell of the war between GREECE and TROY it started because of two reckless and responible young fools.Paris youngerson of the king of troy,and Helen wife of the king of sparta.And with knowing it they gave her hushand brother the reason to have troy under his thumb just like greece or see the city burn.As we all know what happens.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Love d the first look ring forward to more like this. Grandma think s it is a very good game for all ages
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Very solid and unexpensive, bought it for a small HTPC and does a great job, play some medium games (with another video card), movies, etc.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was OK i couldn't just search one words thooo kind of sucked hoped for more words to that would have helped its like made for little kids didn't have half the words i was looking for
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great for the price you pay.Don't be afraid because it says it allows in app purchases, you can get along just fine without it.
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|I do not yet have this video. I am waiting for this to arrive and after I watch it I am sure I would give it a good review.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|This movie was awesome. As soon as i watching it it was just like watching a 70's kung fu flick. I loved it!!!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Great action movie. Best Bond movie yet. I have seen all of the Bond movies and enjoyed this one the most.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This story stays with you long after you are done reading it. It eloquently describes the horrors of war and the resilience of the human spirit. A must read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book, I cant wait to read the next one. This book was amazing I felt as if I was in the hunger games myself
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|this game is fun and very addicting. requires thought and strategy for every level. glad I got it for free but worth a few bucks.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I was sceptical at first but I'm glad I tried it! It's so fun!!! Try it out, you would t regret it!
B001I45UFC|5.0|Very enjoyable read. Makes me want to watch the video again. Can't wait to read the next book in the series
B00425S1H8|5.0|There's not much more kudos to add to this perfectly functional product.  I'm completely happy with the operation and ease of installation under 64-bit Windows 7.  I had an earlier USB to Serial adapter, in theory using the Prolific PL2303 chipset, but no drivers would work under Windows 7.  It was refreshing to have this adapter work simply and easily, using both the shipped (older) Prolific drivers and the latest/greatest drivers on the Prolific website.<br /><br />If you need a DB9 serial port on your serial port-less PC, there's no question that this adapter will fit the bill.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I love the BBC Planet Earth series, but the image on this BD doesn't feel like full HD -I mean when you get closer to TV it looks like the resolution has been increased digitally. I have a BBC Life series and the quality on the Life series I can assure is much better than the PE series! Maybe there are different versions of PE with different qualities?!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best books I've ever read. It is a must read for anyone in search of the meaning of life or their Personal Legend. There are so many quotable passages that bring meaning to life and can be mantras for anyone who is lost or trying to find their path. This book is one of those that can be read time and time again and bring new meaning and significance with it. I'd recommend this book to everyone!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|There is not much to comment on the movie itself but the cut and image quality are exceptional. It comes with a small history book that does not fit inside the plastic or the paper cover which is the only down-side.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I checked this movie out from the local public library and enjoyed it so much, I ended up watching it over and over again. It is not the best movie ever, but it does what it sets out to do and is to entertain.  I love the camaraderie between characters, especially between Stallone and Statham, and Randy Couture and Terry Crews, and Dolf Lundgren. I liked it so much I was inspired to purchase a copy of the first movie, [[ASIN:B004AQR24W The Expendables]] and while I didn't think it was as good as the second one, it was ok as well. Just a little to dark to see at times, and if you are vision impaired you need light, glad that number two was light enough to see for both day and night scenes.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|they only give you like 10 min. to play then ask you to buy it. screw them. this game sucks. don't get this it just takes up space
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Nice mix of technical jargon and low brow humor.  The pacing is great, I enjoyed this and will look for future works from this author.  For .99 cents you really get a lot of value as it's fairly well written!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Easy to read, easy to use and full of options. This one is a must-have! I use it more and more.
0765325950|5.0|If you are a fan, then this isn't optional.  It successfully ties off every string that we've been left hanging on to for the past 20+ years.  Robert Jordan would be proud of how this was completed, and it was touching to read the parts that were verified to be from his pen before he passed away.<br /><br />It's as exciting and hopeful as it is heartbreaking.  A truly worthy ending to an epic tale!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|the game is out standing it's so adidtive when you bread dragons you never know what you will get and it also helps- how you have a basic economy
B00BD47WGM|4.0|I loved this book as a child. Re-reading it as an adult, though, it is so very different than what I remembered. It is heavy-handed and quite moralistic, which was the style at the time. It jars me now as an adult, but I suppose I didn't recognize it as a child.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Data very good, speed of loading very good. Refusal to go to landscape mode when my fire hd is turned on its side very bad.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It is very difficult to get people to play with on this particular game.  I do wish more people played...
0762445262|5.0|This is a really cool item for a bat fan or batman collector. This bat signal actually works and it moves up and down. Really awesome and it looks great on the shelf next to smaller scale batman figures.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Worst game ever there is a time limit and its a copy of minecraft whenever I try to place a block it ends up breaking the block under it worst game ive ever played!!!!
1446303314|5.0|Iloved this book, instructions very easy, and that is what I look for in any book.<br />Loved it, Loved it.
0812550706|1.0|The product is what was described... It arrived in good condition and good timing.<br />The printing is just too small for me to read. We also &#34;had&#34; to order it to push our purchase total to get free shipping. ...<br />I wish I did not have to order this book but it is in great condition and we will be happy to donate to our School library!
B00846F1YW|5.0|This was a free download for me and I love the game! Would have bought it, but super glad, that it was free.
B00138GZAC|5.0|I have always loved Sade!  I enjoy this music almost daily on my MP3 at work, drowns out the other unimportant noise.....
1400097029|5.0|John Banville's evocative latest novel tells the story of a man who returns to the scene of a dramatic summer from his childhood while coping with the death of his wife. The narrator moves back and forth across time and space to weave together two very different times of his life, each of which casts light and shadow on the other. As usual, writing so beautiful it is more like poetry than prose. Highly recommended, though not a cheerful read.
B0018QXL1K|3.0|It is only 2 songs on this album.  I should have brought the singles of those only, next time I will listen closer.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An inside look at a Navy Seal's life and experiences. The sacrifices they make are worth more than words could explain.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am very pleased with the Amazon streaming of Downton Abbey.  I actually had quite the experience trying to get season 3 and it was so pain free with Amazon!  Great Job and Wonderful Series!!!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|A terrible end to a series with promise. It is too unemotional, and very confusing. Half the time Katniss, who tells the story, does not even understand what is going on. I would definitely not recommend.<br />Even after the second book, I only continued reading to see what became of the love triangle. The author did not go into detail with it at all, so it wasn't worth reading for that either. Just read the first and stop there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My little 4 year old brother loves this game. We even play together. It's the best game ever. And it's not inappropriate.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app has come in handy so many times! Can't do math in my head ;( I love the large keys. So easy to use!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love jigsaw puzzles.  These are fun puzzles to do, I just wish they had more of a variety of pictures.  I like pictures landscape, with castles or mountains.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|I could play this CD over and over again.....great band!  Not one song I don't like. They have so much talent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really enjoy Minecraft. I have the x-box, the pc, and the app versions. They are all amazing, but the app is a little pricey. I eventually got the PE version after a random discount and I really enjoyed it. I have played it a lot, it has crashed once but very few apps don't crash after using them for a while. The graphics are really good, and you can use the controls really well, but sometimes they might fell a bit awkward. Again the price in my opinion is a little high, but you may see it differently. So go and buy the app because it is truly a great game, and is being updated constantly. Again this is just my opinion. I don't want to discourage others from buying it, its just the price is a little high.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I recomending this's  video ............................comedy, drama,,,,,,, animals i loveeeeeeeeeee wuaooooo what escene.<br />I will watch in 3D now,......... I repeat no problem
B00632HWOG|4.0|I have yahoo for many years and enjoy the way it is laid out. It is easy to use. Love the logo.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great, witty read with nostalgia woven throughout. If your 8-year-old nerd self could have written a book this is it.<br />If there is but one flaw it is Cline's writing is so good it is hard to step away, few breaks in the action. Excellent read.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Couldn't wait to receive pre-order purchase.  Believe me, it was worth the wait. I will enjoy for many, many years tp come.  Fifty yrs to get it all right.
B009738XXM|1.0|She should stick to music instead of bashing the Boy Scouts.  The Boy Scouts are more American than her beloved pop culture.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I have all of the Criminal Minds Seasons and they are very good. Will buy future ones as well ' Thank You
B004HB1D2W|5.0|It was so much better than expected! I am so glad I bought it. Very in depth and dark, exactly my style.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Shares video to my wdtv and my samsung with no problems.  Plays youtube videos and downloads with no skipping. Would recommend this to any friends interested.
B008OOYALE|3.0|To expensive and takes to long.  Trying to breed the special dragons only creates tons of the same ones but if you don't have the gold to buy it you have to keep trying.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I Watched The Hunger Games And Was Pleasantly Surprised With The Concept Of This Movie. Great Acting And Plot. Excellent.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|It was on my to watch list for quite some time and finally got to see it. it was very strange, but very funny.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|One Of The Best Movies I Have Ever Seen. Just When All Is Lost, The Glory Of God Steps In.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Good action and dialog, but the plot and backstory behind the main enemy didn't make much sense.  I was confused as to why this guy was going out of his way to do all of this meticulous stuff just to kill one person.  He could have done it a lot easier....
B008M721MS|5.0|I Like Skype Cause It Is The Most Famous Way To Interact With People I Know On The Internet. Excellent.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Love the backstory for Bond & Moneypenny!!!!! A whole lot better than Quantum of Solace!!!!  I must for the true Bond fan!!!!
B0031KE9C6|4.0|I enjoyed the pilot and probably watch more episodes.  Nice, clean mystery and especially if you have younger people in your home.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Great show, loved watching at home in my own time and catching up on the show.  It was pretty reasonable too.
B004WR125O|4.0|Easy way to stream Pandora through the Onkyo receiver.  I would recommend to anyone that enjoys streaming musice.  Works as advertised.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome but sometimes I have to force close it.  Overall it is awesome.  the blocky paridise! COOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLNESSSSSSS is it
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The cable that came with my Kindle Fire cracked which caused my Kindle to not charge properly.  Amazon enabled me to replace the cable with no charge.  Thanks Amazon.
B000T46O52|5.0|This movie showed the emotion of the descrimination issue without causing the viewer disgust. It gave AIDS a face and showed that compassion is not a wasted experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If u love horses this is the game for u.. you learn a lot when it comes to this game and to be able to feed and do rodeos is even better got to love it
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Others have complained about the visual quality of these DVDs, but we think they are fine, and the price is unbeatable.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I'm as big a fan of Jimi as I've ever met, and it didn't blow me away the first time I listened to it in my car.  The first tracks that stood out to me were Earth Blues, Izabella (I thought the most polished) and Villanova Junction Blues.  Okay, I'm at work now, and I'm wearing headphones, and now I love this CD, since I'm not too focused on it, and not judging it. The songs have a very loose feel to them. It makes me want to go home and put on the CD and try to jam with him.  Some of the songs have a feeling of long jam tracks, with Jimi filling in with his amazing rhythm and soloing ability. It's interesting how some of these songs clearly were ideas which evolved into other songs.
B00BF2UKDE|4.0|A solid Bad Seeds album, with moody feel, carrying with it some of th erecent Grinderman persuasion. Don't be fooled by the single they released, the entire album is great!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I really enjoy this show. Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are really good together. You might think it is a watered down American version of Sherlock, but you'd be wrong. They are really pretty different, and both do what they do really well. Elementary has the advantage of making more than three every two years.
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|There's always a risk with the long awaited return, but its so good, easy to understand why it debuted so highly on the charts. Each song visits another era of the Bowie past, very introspective and nostalgic
B000002J03|5.0|Very good CD.  I had this on vinyl.  I wanted something to listen to in my truck.  What can I say about Led Zeppelin.  They are the greatest.
B008CIUS72|1.0|Will not work on my kindle fire..keeps telling me I have to sync with a web address on my pc..still does not work
0802473156|5.0|My wife and I heard about  book from the author on The Oprah show and was interested in learning for ourselves if this could really help married couples better understand how to love each other.  I purchased the book  and after my wife and I read it we have a better understanding of each others love languages.  The book was eye opening and life changing. A must read for couples.  I purchased additional copies after reading and mail to my two daughters and close friends and ask them to spread the word.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Will not work on my kindle fire..keeps telling me I have to sync with a web address on my pc..still does not work...I just want to be able to watch tv programs on my kindle
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Saw previews and felt this was a must see movie.  Was not disappointed at all.  My wife and I were on the edge of our seats throughtout the entire movie and there was never a dull moment.  definitely a must see.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Not sure why, but this app would not work on my Kindle Fire Gen 1. Didn't find any particular help either.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I read this book in one day because I couldn't put it down! This book was very fast paced from the start so it was easy to get into. They meet and practically start falling in love the first day, but the down side to that is that it seemed like their love was immature and unrealistic. In a way it was somewhat fitting because they are so young but if felt like they didn't really have a strong base other their first date. What made it so interesting was that they were immediately pulled apart buy their situation and they still had to interact knowing they wanted more.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have AVG Free and Pro installed on my phones, PCs, and laptops. However, many of the features on the Kindle Fire do not work. I still rate this as the best on the market. I never have any issues with the app. Never had an intrusion of any kind while running AVG.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a fun little game to play! Came in handy during boring waits at airports and while on vacation. VERY addictive!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Wanted a printer app for my Kindle, and this one didn't work for me. I have uninstalled it and have yet to find one that works.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|I was all excited to see this movie, after seeing the opening credits the sound was so bad, we were unable to watch the movie.  There is definitely something wrong with the video stream from Amazon on this video.  I hope Amazon gives a credit back.  As a user of Amazon Instant video, I have never had this issue before, and after giving up on the Life of Pi, we did watch another movie that night successfully.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|This may be a good app if you have a HP ePrinter. I didn't realize that an ePrinter was a specific line of printers. I was hoping that it would work with any printer on the wireless network. Even though the app recognized my HP 2600n Color Laser, it would not print. I tried for days to find a way into HP help to get answers, but ....
B002ZG976U|5.0|At first I was worried and I thought it was the DVD but turns out it was the player. DVD was fine no scratches, it was shipped promptly. Love how cheesy this movie is.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game.the best game on here is the one where u got to go from on side to another.that's is the bbbbeeeesssstttt game on there!!!!!I wish I was the game because I would be there everyday that's why I want to be the game.This game also has bonus points for everything wow I love this game very much.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|With so many reality tv shows on these days, it's good to watch a good story develop and stay true to the book it's based on.
B0015DROBO|5.0|You are completely drawn in by the quirkiness of the lead character.  You see why she is like she is.  You cannot see her in any other light.  Anyone who like a novel idea of a novel will like this and the other two books in the set.  I wish there were more.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book.  It was a quick read because I just had to know what was going to happen next.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book sets up the story for the third book while fleshing out the story from the first book.  I liked everything about the book except the place names.  Too bad I am not from there or they would all make sense to me.  The stories do not suffer from my ignorance of other countries.  People who like to see a project to the end would love this second book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book so much.  The characters were so well written, you just felt a part of it and a connection with them all.  I read the last couple of pages a few times just because I loved it and how it ended.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I think I did read everything he wrote.  The stories are intriguing, interesting and unexpected.  Except for the place names the tale could have taken place in any country.  People who like mysteries would like this book.  Also, people who can tolerate violence in aid of furthering the story will find this book satisfying.
0061900656|5.0|This is a nice little book to prepare a boy for the family addition.  I don't know if he fully understands as he thinks Mommy is having a monkey, but we will keep reading it.  Great little book.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid, shared it for the first time with our kids. It was a big hit!
0696204800|5.0|I have already made some of the blocks in this book.  For me it is the best book I have purchased in a long time.
B000002ADT|5.0|many consider this album his best.  i can see why. i love miles davis and love this album.  bought this CD version for the car- arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
B003M8NG94|5.0|It's a hands down that it just isn't worth the small savings purchasing a standard DVD when a Bluray version of any given movie exists! So do yourself a favor and don't get the DVD first. And, if you have an old VHS movie you like, then you’ll LOVE the Bluray version of it if it has been digitally transferred to an upgraded Bluray.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love this app and it's so much easier to navigate in the tablet version! Would highly recommend downloading this if you're a fan of tweeting!

B00101ZOTA|5.0|One of my good friends, after discovering I was a Spacey fan, insisted that I would love this movie. They were right. As per usual, Kevin's brilliant.<br /><br />I really don't know what else I could say about this movie past I can't believe that I didn't see it sooner. Masterful. Attention getting. Awesome.

B00B99KJR0|4.0|It's a Match 3 game, which usually means it's just as good as any other Match 3 game. But this one has a little something that makes it more entertaining. The graphics are crisp &amp; the game play is smooth, not all glitchy. The storyline makes for some fun motivation. I don't know exactly why it's more fun than any other Match 3 game, it doesn't have any extra special features. I guess it's just that  it's a straight forward Match 3 with smooth gameplay &amp; fun characters. I recommend it to anyone who likes Match 3 games. I got it as the Free App Of The Day, but knowing how good it is, I'd pay as much as $3.99 for it, and I'm on the lower end of the income range. lol

1885167776|5.0|I have read my share of business and success books over the years... The One Thing takes all concepts and ideas and gives you a few simple (not easy) ideas to get you on task and focused. I am a big fan of Gary and Jay and their book The Millionaire Real Estate Agent gave me the fundamental models to be successful in real estate (I can say it changed my business life). The One Thing gives me the tools and concepts to be much more focused and efficient in what I do, not just in business but in life in general. The book is very well researched and not based on theory, they give some surprising facts that show many of our beliefs about focus and willpower are dead wrong. I have 20 copies on order and plan to give it away to everyone I know that wants to achieve a higher level.
1426308469|5.0|Like all well-done educational products, this book helps young kids have fun with education, so that they learn to enjoy learning.  This book has great artist depictions of dinosaurs in their habitats and presents a lot of high-level information captured in relevant snippets that are informative to early readers.  This book's great blend of pictures, icons, and text makes it appealing to readers and pre-readers, alike.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|We see the madness in Norman Bates' eyes, the fear on Marion Crane's face. The looming house next to the Bates Motel is even more frightening. The stuffed birds and old pictures in Marion's room are a more threatening presence. The face of Norman's mother is even more scary. These are the basic elements of the film.<br />If I could have changed something in the film I would have deleted the DA's clinical explanation of what happened betweeen Norman and his mother. We could have figured that out for ourselves.
B003X271YU|4.0|My Book club read this and we all loved it we all gave it a 4 would recommend it highly
B007N5YJWK|2.0|The 39 Steps are just baby steps. Hitch took 24 more years to make North By Northwest. Don't kid yourself. The chemistry between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint was amazing.<br />Donat and Carroll barely talk to each other. And the chase across the Scottish Moors isn't even close to being shot at by a crop duster or climbing Mount Rushmore.<br />In his early work Hitchcock is learning how to make interesting films, but let's not pretend that The 39 Steps is a masterpiece. The great films come later, much later.
B007VGXS8M|3.0|The problem is I downloaded it for  child. It should have been age rated. The graphics were too small and I think it should fit on the screen of my kindle fire instead of having to scroll around all the time. Also, I wanted to look for Waldo, not items. Technically speaking, I have had no problems.
B00000IQCA|5.0|Usually the large ensemble casts make bad movies.  This one is great.  We watch it several times a year, when the moment strikes us.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is about as close to call of Atlantis as it can get. It doesn't have outrages permissions and the game is really fun. This game can keep anyone that likes games like Call of Atlantis or Bejeweled. So if you like those type of games give this one a try I think you'll like it. The file is pretty big for this style of game but it has so many levels that you can't really complain. Hope this helps you guys decide if you want to get this game. Thanks for reading [..] Thanks!
B006LSZECO|3.0|A thriller most of the time. Sometimes hard to believe.  Sometimes boring.  Written well with many good details.  I don't know anyone like this
B0097PW7H8|5.0|This app lets you know if you are charging your battery the correct way. By doing so it allows you to keep your battery in check so you can have the longest battery life possible. For those of you always having problems with your Kindles this could be the solution for you.
1593272774|4.0|This book is good for providing examples and ideas of how to build with technic pieces.  Unfortunately, it does not include practical applications of the simple machines.
1933784032|5.0|i bought this book as a reference source for my star wars modeling,i wasnt dissapointed for the most part.large,weighty tome,good pictures,im not having a problem with the binding like others seem to have,but its only a couple months old. they could have printed a LOT of the thumbnails they show at the end pages,but,for a fan of the films,it would be a good gift.
B005S9ELVC|4.0|I am surprised that apparently no one has noticed how this \\"new\\" gangster film is so influenced by some 1940's serials, particularly the great William Witney serial classic \\"G-Men vs Black dragon\\". In many scenes, you find blatant modernisations of some of the most memorable twists and turns from the serial. Josh Brolin has even the look and the hair style of Rod Cameron who starred in \\"G-Men\\". When you understand that filiation, Gangster squad is a very enjoyable film on his own, of course very different from the contemporary gangster films. The only drawback is Sean Penn's grotesque mimicks.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like it for the mindless fun. Some strategy involved but not much. For a free game it's worth it. I come Bach to it a few times a day to use my regenerated coins.
B000FC12Z0|4.0|I really liked this murder mystery.  There was a crime within a crime that I never would have figured out.  There were many characters so sometimes  it was not easy to keep up with who was whom. I read at night and I often went to bed quite early to see what happened next .
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book was sooooooooooooo awesome. Can't wait for number five. Super amazing, action filled story! Percy Jackson is looking for the labyrinth in this amazing adventure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun once you start playing it you are addicted haha well I love this game and I recommend it to everyone!!!
B000002GYR|5.0|This is some of Tom's original works, before his voice became so rough and growl-ley. I love the current voice, but it was refreshing to hear when Tom could actually sing and carry a good tune --
B0086HGW42|5.0|Great album, Ed really has talent and there's a little bit of diversity in these songs, which is great because no one wants to listen to the same song essentially for an entire album.
B004RKXNDU|3.0|I slogged through this book.  I stuck with it but often just could not proceed.  The jargon takes some time.<br />Actually, it was not until I watched the Alec Guinness films, that I understood enough to go back and finish the book.<br />I have not read another George Smiley Novel.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love this game and have enjoyed many hours playing. I would highly reccomend this application to players of majong.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|A classic for any Sci-Fi Collection and the Blue Ray quality surely adds to this Classic and loaded with Extra features,well worth it and the price was very reasonable.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|For anyone that cares about being a great programmer. This is a fantastic book with a lot of great insight into the world of professional programming.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Throughout the entire book I couldn't stop gasping from every turn and twist.<br />Cannot wait to read the final installment in this triology!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love it, lots of fun. I love games that stimulate my brain and cause me to think fast and visually
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I use this with a SDHC memory card to provide readyboost for performance increase of a windows laptop computer. Ordered a separate adapter to allow use in a 54mm slot. The product is a great value and helps to boost system performance.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great bible resource, use it often, Love that you can use various versions, highlight, various things you can do. Make a great study bible.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Good game fun and challenging.  Like the graphics and controls.  The price was right, could probably charge more.  Hidden objects are my favorite type of games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game to have, gets my mind thinking, An old game but still popular among many I'm sure. Good brain game!
1616550414|5.0|I recommend this product to all Zelda fans around the world, it's nostalgic to old fans and bring the new ones to this magical franchise, with a lot of content and a beautiful case!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm hooked! Love all the great ideas and things I see on pinterest. Love that I can make my own boards of favorites.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Gets my mind working, great game. Makes me think. Not always as simple as you would think, but great to get my brain going.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very interesting, good novel.  Well written, unexpected turns.  Enjoyed it thoroughly! I look forward to reading more books by her.
B006OITIQE|5.0|This album continues the pop sound that One Direction has ridden up the charts with.  Great music all around.<br />You'll want to buy this album!
B000W93CHC|5.0|I enjoyed the book and highly recommend it.  It was an enjoyable and fun read although it did ten to get a bit drawn out at times.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really have enjoyed this series. Always a turn coming. Can't wait to find out what's gonna happen next. I've even gotten my husband into the series. =)
B004GGM444|5.0|My nine year old grandson put me on to Skrillex, and I must say, I really enjoy their work.  The tunes have nice change-ups, interesting textures and surprise twists.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|The story just wasn't very compelling and I couldn't care less about the characters.  Don't bother with this movie, it is not worth the time.
B003K07DUC|3.0|If you are a fan of Matt Damon this is a good movie to puchase.  If this was some no-name actor then nobody would watch.  A decent story.  Good acting.  Plenty of action.  Damon has done work far better than this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Like an evening soap opera but great characters and I really like the time period.<br />Who knew how servants were treated back then.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|A real page turner, outcome in doubt until the last page. Typical Rebus, he's out for justice and the system goes in circles.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|My step daughter loves this and watches it over and over again. I would recommend it for any teenage girl
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I previously had played Call of Atlantis from the same developer all the way through, not expecting that it would hook me enough to actually entice me to complete the game.  Match 3 games usually don't engage me for long.  The story and beautiful art in these games, along with the innovations in the puzzles themselves, have made it worth playing through.  These particular games are so enjoyable that I'd have to highly recommend this one as well as Call of Atlantis.  Having completed the other, it was a pleasure to find that this one is now available and so far every bit as enjoyable, engaging, and well written as the other.  The story is well done.<br /><br />I won't bother summarizing the gameplay or the synopsis of the story -- the current top reviewer has done a marvelous job of that.  Please go read that reviewer's outstanding review and upvote them for that.  My task is simply to express how delightful the game is and how much value it is to the buyer.  You won't be disappointed.
B008JFUNAU|5.0|\\"Oz: The Great And Powerful\\" is great! This is how the story goes: When Oscar Diggs, a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz, he thinks he's hit the jackpot - fame and fortune are his for the taking - that is until he meets three witches, Theodora, Evanora and Glinda, who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone's been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity - and even a bit of wizardry - Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well.<br /><br />The cast by James Franco (as Oscar Diggs), Mila Kunis (as Theodora), Rachel Weisz (as Evanora) & Michelle Williams (as Glinda / Annie) is great. The directing by Sam Raimi is great. The screenplay (based on the novel \\"The Wonderful World Of Oz\\" by L. Frank Baum) by Mitchell Kapner & David Lindsay-Abaire is great.<br /><br />The music by Danny Elfman is great. The cinematography by Peter Deming is great. The film editing by Bob Murawski is great. The casting by John Papsidera is great. The production design by Robert Stromberg is great. The art direction by John Lord Booth III, Todd Cherniawsky, Stefan Dechant, Andrew L. Jones, Iain McFadyen & Meghan C. Rogers is great. The set decoration by Nancy Haigh, set dressings by Christopher Casey, Kemper Harris, Anthony Klaiman, Keith Allan Miller, Jon Nicholson, Nikki Sass, Scott Schutzki & Kevan Weber is great. The costume design by Gary Jones is great. The make-up effects by KNB EFX Group (Howard Berger, Robert Kurtzman), Richard Alonzo, Ozzy Alvarez, Lee Grimes, James Lacey, Jonah Levy, Bart Mixon, Joe Podnar & Don Rutherford, special make-up effects by Nick Marra is great. The special effects supervised by John Frazier & coordinated by Robert Tyrell is great. The visual effects supervised by Vincent Cirelli, Bill Kent, Matt McDonald, Pavan Kumar Potluri, Daniel P. Rosen & Scott Stokdyk, coordinated by Jennifer Avery, Danielle Bemis, Christopher Blasko, Shu Fujita, Ryan Gaul, Lauren Guerard, Dianne Hardy, Kerry Joseph, Veronica Kablan, Daniel Kepler, Robert McGlinchey, Sharina Radia, Jeff Reeves, Joseph Shahood, Andrew Turner, Derek Weil & Eric Withee is great. The stunts coordinated by Scott Rogers & Randy Beckman is great.<br /><br />This is a great family adventure film that is entertaining and well-made, visually. It is also well-done and well-crafted, as well. This is an interesting prequel to \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\". Sam Raimi has made an interesting movie, also an interesting choice of film outside the original Spider-Man & Evil Dead franchises. James Franco gives an interesting performance as Oscar Diggs, the man who would eventually become the Wizard of Oz, also leads an interesting cast of actors, who are themselves, interesting choices for the roles that they were cast for, just like Franco is or was.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Simply an awesome movie.  Ben Affleck excelled here, as did all of his fellow actors who worked on this film.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My old kindle cable was quite literally falling apart, and so when I called Amazon they very graciously gave me a credit to buy this new replacement one. It's nice and long, works like you'd want it, and most importantly isn't falling apart!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I did have some trouble with the HD loading.  First time that has happened.  Inspite of that,  I did really enjoy the movie,
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Levels are really easy, but are very entertaining. My 4yr old loves it. No pigs. Cool effect freeing caged birds
140131046X|5.0|Just finished reading \\"Have A Little Faith - A True Story\\". WOW! Another tool in my toolbox :) I have a new appreciation of people in general as well as different faiths. An awesome book I recommend to EVERYONE.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|All the necessary info, but iPad version is laid out much nicer. On iPad the 10-day is graphical, easy to see info quickly
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|really really fun game awesome that they made a good hand held jurrasic park game like this for mobile phones/tablets
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE THE IDEA OF BLOCK'S AND THE GAME IS GREAT I  DON'T REALY PLAY ANY OTHER GAME AND THANKS FOR. READING THIS GOOD DYE
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It is completely different than your typical princess movie.<br />Its entertaining for boys, girls and adults.<br />Recommended for 4yr olds+
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Player looks good, however I'm just used to the one that comes with my phone.<br />Downloader is pretty standard. last word
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I have lost many an hour to this game.  So far the games on my phone have only been a way to kill time while I wait for something else, this is the first android game that has drawn me to play it for the sake of playing it.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|This was exactly what I was looking for after being scammed with bootleg copies from China that I ordered a few months back.  Awesome collection and awesome service.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|Graphics were kinda crummy, game play is confusing and clunky.  Do items picked up wind up in an inventory somewhere?  Is there an inventory?  What am I trying to do here?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game looks mild and not hard.  It is fun, addictive and harder with every level. I highly recommend it to young and old.  Have fun.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The movie hype is what made me read this book.  It was just okay.  For the first time, maybe the movie is better than the book?
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Very surprising to learn  about about this roman philosopher / poet who talked about basic ideas behind modern science in the 1st century BC.<br />How this ideas almost disappeared and then rediscovered and start to influence many thinkers is an amazing story beautifully told
B004LE7PCM|5.0|Good old fashioned how to solve the bleeding obvious corny but good not all but some of the stories but  enjoyable
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|I stumbled across this game recently and am glad I did. There are many options to improve your toon or the vehicle. I have only played a few times but love it. My kid drives better than me. The graphics r pretty crisp n clear too.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|Lana Del Rey's provocative songwriting would be enough to make her a compelling prospect. Add her sultry and versatile voice and really imaginative composition and arrangement, and you get something truly extraordinary. In Lana Del Rey we have a siren for a post-feminist age.
B0086HGW42|4.0|I listened to this album a few times on Spotify after Sheeran kept appearing on my last.fm recommendations.  I think what makes him so listenable is he does flip between melodic folk tunes and almost rapping over a melody.  Think Remedy-era Jason Mraz but with a British accent that doesn't go away when he sings.  The recordings have an intimate feel of just him and his guitar.<br /><br />If you're a fan of singer-songwriters who play acoustic guitar and clearly have talent to spare, this is worth adding to the rotation.
1936608618|5.0|I bought is first from iTunes, to read on my iPad, liked it so much that I bought a hard copy for me and my wife, and two additional copies; one for my CrossFitting daughter and one for an employee who's really working hard to get back in shape. (She's lost almost 80 pounds so far.)<br /><br />The illustrations are excellent and there's not much that's not covered..
B007712XAU|5.0|I've heard everyone talking about this series.  Everyone has loved it.  Now I know why!  This has been awesome to own.  I will watch it over and over!
B006Q1SQCQ|4.0|I read this book thirty five years ago.  The techniques have been useful over the years.  I wanted to read the book again to see what I had forgotten.  The book seemed overly wordy to me this time.  The techniques could be summarized in a pamphlet.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This was one of my best buys. Our whole family enjoys this movie. It is family friendly and keeps you interested, and smiling.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|My grandchildren love this movie, a wonderful classic for all ages. A must for family film library for generations to come.
B000GB775E|5.0|This was a special gift for my daughter. She enjoys to laugh and was able to enjoy this movie very much.
B008NF45S2|5.0|Does what it says it will do. Connects to wifi printer easy and also recognizes my laserjet that is connected to my desktop. I use it primarily to print agendas from my calendar. I rarely purchase apps. This one is a good one.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|For one thing, I have always loved Barbra Streisand, but this particular movie has something else going for it - an intriging story line.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes musicals.
0393338827|5.0|Excellent Product- Fast Shipment.  A+++++++++<br /><br />Great value.<br /><br />Excellent Product- Fast Shipment.  A+++++++++<br /><br />Excellent Product- Fast Shipment.  A+++++++++<br /><br />Excellent Product- Fast Shipment.  A+++++++++
0805092447|5.0|My son kept talking about this brown bear book in school, and he would repeat a lot of the passages. Finally he brought it home from the school library. That night instead of me reading him a bedtime story, he read the entire story to me. Many of the words coincide with his sight words at school, so he could easily recognize most of them. He was so excited and proud that he could read an entire book to me. The next day he surprised his mother by reading it to her too. I have never seen him so excited about a book or reading. I had to order the three book set for him for his birthday. I highly recommend this for any parent wanting their little one to learn to read. My son has a slight learning disability, and I think it's encouraging and wonderful that he has found a love of reading with this book.<br /><br />On a side note, he happened to walk in the room and saw me typing this review. When he saw the book cover he started quoting passages from the book. If that is not a great endorsement, I don't know what is.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great value getting bluray dvd and digital copy. i payed double for season 1 and it only had the bluray copy. Cool extra features!
1907590331|4.0|This is a great book about what happened during the Great Depression. The author uses vivid and gritty words to describe the life at that time. It shows the life at that time to you like a mirror. If you want to learn the ordinary people's life in the Great Depression, you definitely will learn something. It is not so appropriate for children though because there are inappropriate words for children, but it is definitely a classic for adults.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I loved the book as it delved into their past and decribed each persons feelings. Since doing a family tree I love to look at old pics and find things out from old letters etc. So this story really got me in. I love the twists and turns in the story and that it was very well written.
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|My Grandson just loves this story, I enjoy watching it regularly with him. Fasinating animation. Takes scary out of bees!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading several heavy novels and biographies, I was looking for a light read to cleanse the pallet. \\"Hopeless\\" was in my recommendations by Amazon, so I downloaded it thinking it would be a typical romance story. Not so! This was one of the most surprising novels I've come across in a long time. I just could not stop reading. When life required me to put it down, I kept thinking about the characters as if I knew them personally. A definite addition to the list of books I'd highly recommend.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a very good book and recommend it. I can't put the book down, the greats part is on my kindle it allows to highlight and take notes.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|When it said it was three and half hours I expected it to be the full version of the HOBBIT and not half the version after just over two hours.  I guess it was their gimmick to get people to purchase the first installment.  I really did not like the characters because they all looked so fake with their makeup hanging out.  I will not purchase the sequel.  I have the animated version and it is really good compared to this version.  You would think after having done the Lord of the Rings trilogy Hollywood would get the HOBBIT right: they failed miserably.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is so amazing it is just like taking care of a real horse and i think that is important because  it is resopnsiblity
B008D28HYS|5.0|Very addictive -loved the original paper versions,these are just as much fun. Would highly recommend to anyone who loves puzzles.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a story of my generation.  I remember the &#34;Code of Battle&#34;, one that applies to this very day, but sadly rarely adhered to, one that requires we look deeply into our souls and make a &#34;higher call&#34;.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Pretty much couldn't put it down. Read it all in less than 24 hours.  Excellent storyline, character development and flow. Enjoyed it from cover to cover!
B00A85EMVK|3.0|I love Top Gun and thought the 3D version would be great, but the picture quality is not that good. With Blu-Ray you get a more crisp picture, but this seemed to be the old picture with just the 3D effects.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|This album rock. Love the songs. The music! Would highly recommend buying!Love it! Love the words in the songs lots of meaning.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|The picture quality is great with all the colors!  This is such a cute movie and a great family movie.  The colors and the 3D effects are great!
1579128955|1.0|the back and front coers came unglued after 3 days, very disappointed in book. gave it as a gift, have a sad kid.
B006H5120E|5.0|Strongly recommend this movie if you have a 3D TV and blu-ray player.  The graphics and the picture of this movie make it worth the price.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Wasted 2.5 hours watching the most boring 007 ever! No plot development, no twists... Just boring all around. Lots of pointless car chaises
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is such a great movie in 3D.  The colors and graphics are outstanding!  Great family movie, if you have not seen it before recommend you purchase this movie!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game! My fiance got me hooked just from watching her play. Now I'm trying to catch her and pass her score!
B005LAIHCM|1.0|This movie has a formula that grows more common each year. All male characters are shown in the worst ways. No good males in the movie.  Jennifer Lawrence and Elisabeth Shue star as mother and daughter - Elissa Cassidy and Sarah Cassidy. Sarah is newly divorced. Elissa's dad isn't even shown.  At the beginning Elissa and Sarah moved into a new house alone. Sarah started a new school, and met new kids.  The other girls were shown as silly and uninteresting, the audience was meant to only care about Sarah and Elissa.  The main male characters are Ryan Jacobson, Officer Bill Weaver, and Tyler Reynolds.  Tyler was shown as both a drug user and a stupid pig. Ryan was the villain of the movie.  Officer Bill Weaver was shown as corrupt and incompetent, also he had been covering for Ryan.  Ryan was at first shown as a quiet and withdrawn boy. Elissa was drawn to Ryan quickly. They made a cute pair. Sarah told her that she can't changed him. Sarah's marriage had failed, and she believed her daughter could do no better.  The possibilities were strong at that point. This could have ended with romance and love. That didn't happen.  Later it was revealed he had a girl named Carrie-Anne trapped in his basement. That had been the name of his sister, and this girl seemed disturbed and violent. Ryan appeared to be caring for his disturbed Sister.  Elissa eventually learned how damaged and dangerous Ryan was, the girl wasn't really Carrie-Anne, he just believed she was. He'd abducted her to replace his dead his sister.  After Elissa learned Ryan was insane she ended up kidnapped herself.  Eventually Sarah shows up, and they save each other. At the end Sarah and Elissa were leaving. The movie's ending is also far to common - Women and Girls alone, no Men and no Boys.   Sadly many people think that's a happy ending,
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story is an absolute rollercoaster of emotions, but I loved the way it ended. I highly recommend this book!
B00B0NDF26|4.0|I was shocked to hear Tegan and Sara turn the corner and go mainstream.  The crazy thing is that it works.  The music is more accessible but it still has that Tegan and Sara sound.  So far these girls can do no wrong.
034580404X|5.0|Who wouldn't be happy with this!  Best way to buy the complete story.  Brand new and much cheaper than buying them individually.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|It's great that a band that has been around as long as they have, can keep their music updated yet stay to their roots and known styles.  I have loved Bon Jovi since I was a little girl and heard Runaway playing on MTV.  Back when MTV was cool to watch.  Love you Bon Jovi!
0553593714|5.0|I don't need to finish this book to give it a rave review. I started out with the tv show and got into it, but needed more depth. Can't stop reading this. I'll be blazing through the rest of the series, that's for sure, and then I'll have an empty hole in my heart much like the hole left by the end of Harry Potter. Also- I never really liked fantasy or adventure too much. I couldn't get into LotR, but this did it for me. So, even fantasy skeptics should give it a shot just because of the character relationships. The adult themes also raise it up a notch for me, reminding me that I'm not reading a children's storybook about princesses and wizards.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Such a wonderful classic, loved reading it again as many summers past I sat in the swing and read the afternoon away! Truly a classic to be enjoyed for many generations!
1481130331|5.0|I received this book from a friend upon recommandation and I have to admit that I was reluctant to read it at first. I love historical romance but pure historical fiction is not the same thing. I read it non the less and am glad I did. The layers of prejudice in the book ever spiraling outwards and back in had me gripped and made me think. A five star read for any reader of this genre.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|My favorite series so far. Can't watch it on HBO, so I have to wait till its on sale. Third season can't come out soon enough.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is by far the best replacement keyboard I have tried so far. I liked swype but this is better. Word predictions are very good.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Amazing!! I couldn't it down. Thrilling to the end! Can't wait for of the movies to be out in theaters.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It's not enough to say that this book is what it is--that I am naive or pompous to expect graceful or intelligent prose from some pop culture titillation. That the manuscript was not even read through once by an attentive critical eye testifies to the publisher's cynicism, not carelessness. Somehow about 30 pages in, Washington State University at Vancouver magically is transported to Portland, Oregon, where it stays for a while, and then seems to move back to Vancouver. A young woman graduating from an American university in 2008 does not own a computer nor really know how to use one. Americans say *backpack*, not *rucksack*. Americans do not say *cross* for irritated or angry. There is no single detail in the book to suggest the British author has any knowledge of the Pacific Northwest beyond names of cities and roads. I know the book originated as on-line amateurism, but if publishers wish to maintain any credibility, they must hold to a higher standard of correctness--they must show they are reviewing and editing the product they're selling. All the childishness of the characters, dialogue, narrative is indeed what it is, and the book can lead to interesting discussions about why S&M can look like a peculiar antidote to the solitary, automatic, safe and still poisoning world of internet porn--but can't intelligent women come up with a better zillion-copy trend than this to confront what porn is doing to human sex in 2013? Can't we really do better and want better than this?
B001NR8F2O|4.0|I really enjoy Kiss!! However if any one member screws up songs or has horrible Vocals Live it's Paul Stanley. Gene Simmons is like a timeless performer and incredibly consistent on bass and Vocals. Paul Stanley is now a Parody of himself and live delivers his vocals like a young male going through puberty. I give this a high rating because it is a significant product but I recommend a bootleg DVD/CD of the show if you can get ahold of one.  I hope when they replace the next Member it's the Stanley character.  I think KISS can continue on forever without any original members if they wish to as the experience of seeing Kiss has always been more important than any of the albums released from studio recordings after the first ALIVE album. The Original were important albums. The new Line-up is BETTER than all line-ups with the possible exception of the VINNIE VINCENT/ERIC CARR Version in Make-up which was the rockingest version with most tunes rocked up and even speeded up creating great excitement live. It will be interesting to see where they go.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Recommended by my husband. Good choice.<br />Suspense, mystery, and some romance...well really some light sexual tension tossed in. The main character is a female homicide detective. She's tough, with a barely visible soft side and a realistic character.  Overall good murder mystery. DB
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This book explains a simple way to lose weight that should be easy for most people. Fasting only two days a week seems doable, especially when nothing is forbidden the other five days. The recipes and meal plans look very good and, hopefully, satisfying. I think this might be our new way of living.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|What a fresh breath of air this book has been. Gary Chapman has done a superb job of describing and defining our most precious possession, love. He gave my wife and I, proof the frustration we've experienced has been out of love for each other and our family. Thank you Dr. Chapman, profoundly.
0670451495|5.0|This book was a favorite growing up and I recently found a copy at an antique store. I needed to buy a book for a baby shower and was excited to find it was still available to purchase.  I will be ordering a copy for my grandchildren also.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This app really has given me a finer edge.I've not had the opportunity with auto spell,which just stops way short of entering the proper intelligent solution. Hey this is way Better than yelling out loud, especially if their feed up with me!
B007RFJ4QM|5.0|Good movie. I love anything with a Wahlberg in it. Was a movie worth  watching. Have shared it with other it was so good.

B001R1SUY4|5.0|The boys love this. They could watch Turtles 24 7. It is a easy way to keep them happy in the car on a long ride.
030758836X|5.0|Strap in, put your head back, relax and admire the climb up to the initial view of the honey soaked lives of newly married New York City it girl and hunky mid-western boy.  But get ready, hold onto your stomach and brace yourself for a dizzying crazy plunge down with Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl.<br /><br />First you cheer for wife Amy, \\"fat with love\\" for her new husband, removed from her job, her brownstone in the city, her childhood inheritance and relocated to a small Missouri town.  Then loopback, rooting for Scotch soaked Nick, cheating husband, worn down from Amy's insatiable need for worship and admiration.<br /><br />Accelerating through the turns of a marriage spiraling out of control; deception, scorn, adultery, resentment, cunning revenge, and eventually murder.  Ending after the final tunnel, ruined careers, scattered bodies, and an unexpected pregnancy. The mystery stops, eerily returning the readers and Amy and Nick to a similar spot from which the ride began.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great stories. It was a easy read. I could not put down once I started. Will look for other stories by E.L James

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Straight forward and up to point. Will help any novice in publishing. Great book for starters and self publishers. Go for it!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|A true story, a true love story, and beautifully done. Enchanting AND historical.  Goes to prove it isn't required to make up an action packed line in order to produce something compelling.
0446582778|5.0|Great read. Was kept in suspense until the very end. Anxious for another book to read about Harry Bosch's adventures.
