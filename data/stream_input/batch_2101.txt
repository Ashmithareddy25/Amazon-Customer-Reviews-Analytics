B006ZCWTXS|5.0|This CD is well worth all the praise of five stars, no need to skip ANY songs.  I, my daughter, and my husband enjoy this entire CD.  It's a feel good, soulful, and relaxing R&B mix.  Rebecca respresents true talent that you look for in a vocal artist.  I could only wish the industry would give more recognition to artist like this versus those mediocre pop sensations.  Down with the popular, up with the talented!
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|This was a total waste of time and money.  If you love Matthew McConaughey, don't watch this one.  Left me wondering why he would want to do this film.  Thought it couldn't get any worse until I made the mistake of watching &#34;The Paper Boy&#34;.
B005T0M0HW|5.0|We bought this for our kids, age 2.5 and 6.5, for Christmas. The dishes are pretty small compared to another set they received, but they love them. They are a great size for them and work well with the wood kitchen we also bought from the same company. My daughter especially loves the salt and pepper shakers, which have little rattles in them so they are fun to shake. They love collecting all sorts of things in the pots too! A great, well-made product.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I had high expectations for this book based on the hype for the movie.  The story was good but not great.  I had a hard time connecting with most of the characters.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The book kept you guessing for a while which was good.  Gillian did a nice job of developing her characters.  You did feel like you got to know them well and I reacted to her descriptions as if I knew them.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|My interest was caught right away and it kept going due to pretty tight writing and rather fast pace. I completely enjoyed this book!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Good writing.  Really made you want to hike the trail all the way.  Wish I had read it when I was younger and my body was in the condition it could do this hike.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my grandson, he watches this movie over and over, takes his tractors and tips them over like when Mater and Lightening McQueen make them do in the movie, so that will show you how much kids like this movie.  It's a Classic movie and a great one for kids.  Was a great price also, as it's mostly only found on blue-ray that's way to expensive.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Quick read, but while I was reading the book I kept wondering if I was having some of the same symtoms.  Got uncomfortable at times and definitly sad.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|The vision of Dr Suess and all these great stars and then the creativity of the people who made the movie- these three things alone are enough to make this a great movie. When you add the importance, relevance, and truthfulness of the subject matter- it becomes truly a movie everyone should see. The only reason for any negativity about it would be a persons own guilty conscience.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Fun book to read for the most part.  Good character development.  The story a bit hard to believe for the centurian, but mostly a good read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Simple game for passing some time. Good for young preteens too. Sometimes annoying to have to have gems to get certain things. I just dont use them.
1439181780|4.0|This book is an easy read.  I guess I could have finished this book in one sitting, but I don't have time like that.  This book draws on common sense.  Laws of attraction.  You receive back what you put out into the world.  If you put negativity out that is what you will receive.  Also if you have think it, believe it then you recieve it.  I like the book and it's a good book to continually reference while you continue your life's journey.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it!<br /><br />Every last word purely genius. I haven't read a book in some time and this book was  purely psychologically mind screwing.
0321885112|5.0|I am not an artist, but I am a visual thinker. I heard Mike Rohde on a podcast and was immediately intrigued by this concept.  The book goes through the specifics in very short order with a variety of examples from other \\"sketchnoters\\" from around the world. Just following along the examples and sketching alongside will get you up to speed. Again, I am not an artist but was able to produce legible and articulate sketchnotes after a few sessions.<br /><br />Sketchnoting can be used for many other applications besides the conference lecture examples that the book contains.  I use it for conference calls and business process descriptions as well.

B004DMIIOG|3.0|I was expecting nonstop action, explosions, flashes of color and all that fun stuff. But it's actually more of a slow movie, so I was a little disappointed. It was also very similar to Digimon: The Movie, in that people go into the Internet and fight a bad guy.<br /><br />I'd recommend watching it, but I wouldn't really recommend buying it.

0765325950|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out.  Bought my first WoT book in the late 90's and have been hooked ever since.  I liked them so much that I introduced them to my mother and best friend( both avid readers).  Just sad that they both passed before Mr. Jordan and never got to read the final books of the series on this side of the veil.  Mr. Jordan and Mr. Sanderson my hat is off to both of you.  Mr. Sanderson, the family of Mr. Jordan couldn't have chosen a better writer to complete this series if you two had been related.  The last three books of the series were a bit darker than the rest, but it was all worth it to have such a beautiful ending.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|Let me first say that this is a visually stunning movie, now let me follow up by saying that it's rather confusing. No spoilers but you'll be left scratching your head wondering why the crew makes some of the decisions they make and there are plot holes the size of a Buick. Worth a watch if you're into creepy/horror sci-fi but not a buy IMO.

B0054R6BFM|3.0|In Jay Asher's debut novel Thirteen Reasons Why, Clay Jenkins receives a box of cassette tapes. The tapes are from Hannah Baker, a classmate who committed suicide just weeks earlier. The story follows Clay as he listens and spends the day with a map travelling around town to locations related to the thirteen events that brought Hannah to suicide. Hannah's tapes are a litany of accusation and blame against classmates, involving sexism, revenge,  underage drinking, rape, and survivor's guilt. Clay has his world turned upside down as he listens to the most intimate thoughts of a girl he had a crush on, but never got a real chance to get close to. Hannah's experiences and thoughts are projected onto Clay's understanding of his school, friends, and community. He is left with a changed world view, warning him of the consequences of inaction and the importance of responsibility and caring. Hanna's tapes portray an adolescent girl coping with a rapidly changing social dynamic, fraught with dangers and pain she has not faced before.<br />Thirteen Reasons Why walks a line between being a heavy-handed story of hopelessness and adolescent lack of perspective, and a moving story about the dark underside of high school, sexuality, and the onset of adult relationships and social responsibility. The novel is a compelling read, if for nothing else, because it deals with the culturally taboo and often undiscussed issue of suicide. Jay Asher does a good job of creating a sequence of events that shine a light on the intricate and unexpected consequences one's actions can have on others. This lesson, to think before you act, is one that readers of all ages are fit to be reminded of, and could be especially important to young readers coping with the book's adolescent setting. If there is a defect in Jay's writing it's that Hannah's story is mostly one of injustice and injury to her by others and it lacks in the kind of self-loathing and self-imposed unimportance that one might expect. She spends the entirety of her stories explaining in a precise and analytical way, the hurt others have caused her, but little time emoting to the reader the unbearable weight of her own pain, her guilt, and her need to kill herself to stop it. It is not inauthentic, but her character could be seen as one finding revenge and romance in her suicide, rather than one aiming to end her pain and pass on the lessons to her classmates, just as the book intends to illuminate the reader. The tale is also significantly lacking in adult characters and parental context, which causes a flatness that adds a deliberate and forced quality to her self-absorbed story.<br />Teen readers may find familiarity in the character's difficulties during high school and parents might get insight into how disparate their perspective can be from their children's. The author manages to keep the reader attentive and the plot moving with the unusual dual dialog that flips back and forth between Clay's thoughts and Hannah's tapes, making it a steady read. This book is a reminder that there is a another world inside each person's mind and it can turn desperate and alone without support and understanding in times in which we are often too self-consumed to pay enough attention to those around us.  As Hannah says, &#34;I wanted them to know me. Not the stuff they thought they know about me. No, the real me.&#34;

B002ZG99N6|5.0|This movie was shipped out in great timing and was in great shape. Looked new and well worth the money spent
0307352153|2.0|Well, I really wanted to like this book. I enjoy the topic of personality types and particularly when it comes to introversion, as I am an introvert. Perhaps my expectations of what the book was about were not in line. But I found that I just couldn't get into the book at this time. The writing was fine but it wasn't drawing me in. Maybe too many anecdotes. Perhaps I may pick it up at another time and be able to enjoy it, but for now I am setting this down as a \\"did-not-finish\\" or DNF.

B0028DRGDQ|1.0|I bought this DVD due to all the praise the movie had received.<br /><br />My conclusion: Pretty much everything about this movie is either extremely annoying or just plain old:<br /><br />- Shaky Blair-Witch-esque amateur camera gimmick:<br />Apart from the fact that this is 100% unoriginal, it is just insanely annoying. The camera guy is supposed to be a professional, yet he manages to make even the easiest shots super-shaky while constantly zooming in and out. WHY??? I guess to make the lame story appear more dynamic?<br /><br />- The female reporter protagonist:<br />She is CONSTANTLY screaming and panicking. Half way into the movie I was just hoping for her to die but she didn't and her hysterical screaming has pretty much ruined the movie for me.<br /><br />- The story:<br />There's really not much to say about the story, except it's a zombie movie within a locked environment. Not a bad idea at all and a zombie movie doesn't at all need a highly complex story to be good.<br />The problem is, it's all been done before and there is nothing shocking, captivating surprising about REC.<br />If you like the shaky camera gimmick and constantly screaming women, you might like it.<br /><br />Personally, it bored and annoyed me. 1 Star.

I've actually gotten compliments on my hair since I've been treating it differently. I'm glad I got this book.

0765325950|5.0|This has been my favourite series since I read the first book. I've read this series more times than some people have read books. In total I've spent maybe 2 solid months just reading these books, and I'm a fast reader. I didn't want the series to end, but I loved reading this book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Im not usually a high school, young adult reader but because it was on the top 25 I gave it a try. Im glad I did. It was a great story. My mouth dropped open at times, I cried, I laughed. This book stayed with me long after I finished. Rarely does that happen.

B005UBNKWO|5.0|Being a huge fan of intel processors in the past, I was very hesitant to try an AMD, but luckily I was on a tight budget when I bought this. It might not be as fast as Intel on calculations like video encoding, but this thing definitely beats intel when it comes to gaming. I am able to achieve 65-70 fps with all my original graphics and parts (other than a motherboard and I7) while playing most games where my previous I7 only got 50-55 fps. This thing also has a huge overclocking overhead while staying cool(4.3ghz).<br /><br />So what's in the box?<br />-The processor duh<br />-heatsink with paste and a fan attached to the heatsink (Not the best cooling when overclocking so I upgraded)<br />-AMD sticker<br /><br />Edit: If you have the extra money, I would suggest the FX-6300. Much better performance over the FX-6100.

0525478817|3.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />This was a remarkable reading experience for many reasons and the book deserves its accolades for the power of its characterizations, but as a Young Adult Teen fiction author myself, I feel compelled to offer a few words of criticism.<br /><br />Green's award winning book is about two young teens dying of cancer and yes, as the awards attest, he does manage to avoid most of the cliches and sentimentalities of such works, while creating two of the most original teen voices in contemporary fiction. Yet not entirely. The love story is indeed profoundly moving and the unflinching honesty, even cynicism, with which these young teens face death is truly inspiring in part. Unfortunately, however, religion or spirituality of any kind is relentlessly ridiculed in the novel, and one gets the sense that the author thinks it is 'uber' cool to be so starkly atheistic and despairing, when in fact such a stance is already a bit old fashioned. Nearly every adult in the novel is portrayed as foolish and befuddled by life and of very little help to the young lovers themselves, and that is certainly a standard cliche of young adult fiction. Every representative of a belief in the afterlife is depicted as a self serving delusional fool. Only the teens are clever enough to see through the the ruses and hypocrisies  of adult believers and to face head on the brutal fact that this earth is only a doomed and dying rock spinning around a dying star, and we ourselves are mere molecules doomed for extinction.<br /><br />This rather traditional teen atheism reminded me of a passage from Graham Greene's The Power and the Glory[[ASIN:114217686X The Power and the Glory]], which was itself published in 1940, at a time when such sentiments were indeed fashionable:<br /><br />In reference to the Mexican lieutenant, who is doggedly tracking the 'Whiskey Priest' with an eye to arresting him (at a time when being Catholic was a crime punished by death in Mexico), Greene puts these sentiments into the man's mind:<br /><br />\\"It infuriated him to think that there were still people in the state who believed in a loving and merciful God. There are mystics who are said to have experienced God directly. He was a mystic, too, and what he had experienced was vacancy- a complete certainty in the existence of a dying, cooling world, of human beings who had evolved from animals for no purpose at all. He knew. \\"<br /><br />The possibility of a spiritual dimension to the human person, a dimension that might be 'eternal' and might transcend the physical limitations of the body, this possibility is not even hinted at within John Green's novel, which I consider quite irresponsible for an author of young adult teen fiction.<br /><br /> Yes, it is refreshing and iconoclastic in a healthy sort of way, to reject all false comforts and escapist dreams, and instead to face heroically the stark truths of human mortality. Yet when dealing with young teens, there should at least be the hint of an alternative viewpoint and the possibility of an argument for a more spiritual vision, even if as an author one does not want to endorse that viewpoint oneself. Fair enough.  But there isn't such an alternative viewpoint in John Green's novel, which makes the hype surrounding this work all the more disturbing. Yes, the love story is very moving, so much so that I mourned for days after the 'death' of one of the principal characters), and mourned more deeply than I can remember ever mourning for a fictional character. It is the great achievement of the book, that the young couple come so alive that one grieves for their passing and feels their terrible loss. But stacking the deck against a spiritual viewpoint mars the book considerably, and in my opinion, places it firmly in the realm of old fashioned, outdated cliche, all comments to the contrary notwithstanding. Teens deserve better than this.<br /><br />By a synchronistic coincidence, simultaneously with The Fault in Our Stars, I was also reading the remarkable 'near death' memoir by neurosurgeon, Dr. Eben Alexander, [[ASIN:1451695195 Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife]].<br /><br />Dr. Alexander, a brilliant neuro-scientist who  shared the convictions and scientific view of the vast majority of doctors and scientists - that near death experiences, while certainly real enough subjectively for those who passed through them, were also simply nothing more than the final chemical discharges of the brain. It was a prejudice he was to see shattered by his own seven day near death experience.<br /><br />This book is being lauded as 'the longest near death experience' ever recorded (seven days in a coma), and it is an astonishing, inspiring story, not least for the fact that Dr. Alexander is precisely the sort of scientist who would have endorsed Greene's sentiments above. He had no religious convictions at all prior to his experience and remained convinced - ala the prevailing scientific world view - that when the brain dies, consciousness dies with it. \\" Human beings ... had evolved from animals for no purpose at all.\\"<br /><br />From Amazon.com's blurb:<br /><br />\\"One morning in 2008 he fell into a coma after suffering a rare form of bacterial meningitis. Scans of his brain revealed massive damage. Death was deemed the most likely outcome. As his family prepared themselves for the worst, something miraculous happened. Dr Alexander's brain went from near total inactivity to awakening. He made a full recovery but he was never the same. He woke certain of the infinite reach of the soul, he was certain of a life beyond death.<br /><br />In this astonishing book, Dr Alexander shares his experience, pieced together from the notes he made as soon as he was able to write again. Unlike other accounts of near-death experiences, he is able to explain in depth why his brain was incapable of fabricating the journey he experienced. His story is one of profound beauty and inspiration.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Alexander should not have recovered at all from his coma, let alone a full recovery with all of his mental faculties restored. Medically speaking, his recovery is nothing short of 'miraculous', and he now firmly believes it was for a reason. He feels he has been  called, because of his medical and scientific background and former convictions, to witness to the nature of the Afterlife, a 'reality' which so many of his scientific colleagues firmly refuse to accept.<br /><br />His account of his spiritual journey into the world of the Spirit beyond death is the most profoundly moving rendition of a NDE I have ever read, and it needs to be read to be experienced, so there is little point in my attempting to summarize it. I cannot recommend the book too highly.<br /><br />However, two things struck me with particular force about the book. The first is his sensitive account of the thoughts and sentiments expressed by his concerned family members and friends who gathered around his bedside during his coma and who attempted to comfort one another. Alexander gathered these comments together after his recovery and they give a picture of a remarkable community of loving friends struggling through a terribly painful and distressing experience, one which challenges their own faith and convictions. The  comforting, spiritual remarks they make to one another (not always with complete conviction, more out of desperation and hope) are precisely the kinds of comments that John Green ridicules with such sarcasm in The Fault In Our Stars, and reading these accounts simultaneously with Green's novel revealed to me in stark clarity how shallow and contrived Green's writing is in this regard, despite his justly lauded success in characterization. Dr. Alexander's loving community of family and friends seems so psychologically healthy and well balanced and gives one a sense that they reflect the best of human nature during the most trying of times.<br /><br />Thesecond thing that struck me about the book is that during Dr. Alexander's seven day journey into the afterlife he meets a sister whom he never knew he had (since he was adopted at an early age), but whose existence he discovered when he inquired of his natural birth parents after his full recovery. But...and this is my point, nowhere during his seven day sojourn does he encounter Jesus or any representative member of the Christian faith, despite having attended Episcopal services with his family. He states that the Episcopal Church and its services never resonated within his being, since he did not consider himself a 'man of faith,' and attended more out of familiar bonding. After he returned from his NDE, however, he found he could experience a connection with the same loving Divine Presence of his NDW within the hallowed walls of the Episcopal Church- but still without any explicitly Christian content. He had become a believer in the Divine and the Afterlife, but not in strictly Christian terms. Instead, he saw the Divine expressed in a myriad of forms and traditions throughout human history, and that viewpoint is refreshingly contemporary.<br /><br />I would certainly highly recommend The Fault in Our Stars to young teen readers, but I would encourage them to also read in conjunction Dr. Eben Alexander's remarkable memoir, because the two books complement one another, and the latter provides balance and perspective missing from the first.nspiration.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Alexander should not have recovered at all from his coma, let alone a full recovery with all of his mental faculties restored. Medically speaking, his recovery is nothing short of 'miraculous', and he now firmly believes it was for a reason. He feels he has been  called, because of his medical and scientific background and former convictions, to witness to the nature of the Afterlife, a 'reality' which so many of his scientific colleagues firmly refuse to accept.<br /><br />His account of his spiritual journey into the world of the Spirit beyond death is the most profoundly moving rendition of a NDE I have ever read, and it needs to be read to be experienced, so there is little point in my attempting to summarize it.

B005GIS1SY|5.0|It was a great movie started off pretty nice funny through out the whole movie and you get in touch with the characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Get this game while it's free, it is really addicting and doesn't slow down your kindle at all. If your a fan of temple man get this game I highly recommend it!!!!!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The series itself can get a little show at times. But Season 3 proves once again why The Walking Dead is arguably the bes show on TV....maybe even ever???
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Games move fast and the general format is simple yet addictive. Only downside is that you can't skip puzzles in a group so it's possible to get stuck.
B00005ATZT|5.0|I bought 4 VHS tapes of this movie when it came out, I gave a copy to each of my children and one for  myself. And then I realized VHS tapes were becoming extinct so I bought this DVD from Amazon. It arrived on time, in excellent condition and it was very inexpensive. But best of all, I appear in this movie. I was one of the extras. I was hired to play the Secretary to one of the FBI agents at their headquarters in Chicago as the agents searched for Kimball. I got to work with Tommy Lee Jones for 4 days and I told my fellow workers he would win an Oscar, and he did!!! Thanks to Amazon, my small role in a movie will keep me fresh for my grandchildren to see!
0765365278|2.0|While I'm not one to shy away from long passages on a character's inner workings, I'm also not a fan of multiple long passages with nothing new to add to the character's development! Nevertheless, I slogged through the book because I was mildly interested in the characters and the world created, and I love Sanderson's other books. Unfortunately, The Way of Kings did not leave me wanting more and I'll probably skip the next 9 \\"Archives\\".

0984380213|5.0|I'm a constant reader of business books and most make me think of some new ideas, but most of the ideas don't end up being implemented.  This book was valuable because it provided a clear action plan. The authors described the big-picture reason why you'd want to break up different sales roles among different people and then provided concrete steps to do just that.  There was no \\"fluff\\".  The book was relatively short compared to most books of it's type - it didn't waste any words and provided lots of useful, valuable content.  I've been implementing the ideas from this book at my company and it's very quickly provided positive results.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is an absolutely terrific book that concisely lends incredible insight to the impact and sheer power that habits exercise over our lives. The anecdotes are masterfully delivered and skillfully but succinctly reinforce the points that Duhigg makes throughout each chapter. What really pulls you in is the subtle familiarity with the conditions of the \\"characters\\" in this book, the sense of being able to relate in some way. This is a guidebook for changing your life, and for understanding on a fundamental basis why people behave the way they do.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the other two books in the series much better.  But, this was OK.  I guess books can't always end the way we would like.

B005NPCUC8|2.0|In the original album, the songs flow seamlessly into each other. In this version you can actually hear when one track ends,a silent gap,then the next song begins. Very disappointed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i play this to pass the time, they want me to write 13 more words before they let me post this reveiw
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|This film was truly amazing !  And the fact that it was real makes it even more so.  If you ever need to provide justification of the importance of wild life conservation, *please* just show this film !<br /> One caveat, however, it *may* not be appropriate for small children.<br />Did you know that chimps hunt in packs & eat monkies?  I didn't.  And I bet a lot of parents in the audience there with their kids didn't either : \<br />Depending on your child's maturity, I would say for about 11 or 12 years old & up.

B003O86FMW|5.0|loved this series of the hunger games, read all three way before the first movie, looking forward to seeing Catching fire
B005LAIHR2|4.0|You go to watch a movie like \\"Rock of Ages\\" for the music, not for the story.  Those who have knocked the film for a shady story aren't entirely wrong, but I will contend that the story, while not being the strength of the film, does enough to make the film work.<br /><br />You can't help but see that all of the performers from Tom Cruise to Paul Giamatti to Catherine Zeta-Jones to Alec Baldwin, had a blast making this film.  And why not?  They got to bring back the nostalgic time period, that many feel, was the last great decade of music.  The movie not only restores a number a quality 80s hits, but they do so in a way where the songs coincide with the story or moments in the story.<br /><br />You can't make a movie about 80s music without understanding and capturing the 80s music culture.  I remember going to school during that time period and seeing kids with long hair, black rock band t-shirts, and looking like the rockers that they all obviously idolized.  Our parents thought they were crazy.  It's ironic how with each generation of music, the previous generation doesn't tend to care for it.  My parents hated the music of my time just as their parents hated the music of their time.  And, I have to honestly say, I can't stand most of the music today.  Go figure.<br /><br />The story takes place on the Sunset Strip, a place on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood that was considered by the music world to be the mecca of rock music.  If you were anyone, you got your start here.  Bands from \\"Def Leppard\\" to \\"Journey\\" all fondly remember the days of sinking their teeth into the music scene by performing gigs at places like \\"Whisky a Go-Go,\\" \\"Roxy,\\" \\"Pandora's Box,\\" and the \\"London Fog.\\"  Here \\"Rock of Ages\\" centers around \\"The Bourbon\\" (fictionalized locale used in place of \\"Whisky a Go-Go\\").<br /><br />Enter Sherrie Christian (yeah, if you can't make any connections with THAT name, then you don't know hit 80s songs!), played by Julianne Hough.  She's a girl from Oklahoma who has a dream of being a rock singer.  She meets Drew played by singer Diego Boneta who also has aspirations of being a singer.  He works at \\"The Bourbon\\" and when unfortunate events quickly strike Sherrie, Drew helps her to land a waitressing job at the club she has dreamed of since she was little.<br /><br />The Bourbon is in dire financial straits and club owner Dennis Dupree (wonderfully played by Alec Baldwin) is counting on legendary rock star, Stacee Jaxx's (Tom Cruise in yet another signature-defining role that will blow you away!) one-night-only performance to pull him out.  Of course, we have the underhanded agent, Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti) who has other ideas.<br />On the other side of the rock music fence you have Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the wife of the new Los Angeles mayor whose sole mission is to end rock music for good in Los Angeles.  People, not familiar with characters like this, have complained about the lack of authenticity of Whitmore, but  I remember people preaching against rock music, making claims that rock groups were Satanic and evil.<br /><br />The performances in this film are all top-notch.  The standout is easily Tom Cruise's Stacee Jaxx who easily models the typical rocker of that era.  He dresses and acts the part perfectly.  Band members of Journey and Poison have said, \\"that's how we were!  We had drugs, sex, and alcohol.  We were kings of the Sunset Strip!\\"  Everyone in the film does their own singing, and Cruise was no exception.  He practiced for 5 hours a day for 5 months, and even when band members of Def Leppard were brought on set to watch him, they were astounded at his music ability.  Cruise reportedly has a four-octave range, and while he obviously isn't Def Leppard, his rendition of \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" is pretty darn good!  One of the producers overheard a Def Leppard member say, \\"Christ, he's better than we were!\\"  Not true, of course (which even the producer stated), but getting that type of feedback from members of one of the most popular bands of the 80s is high praise!<br /><br />There are over 20 memorable hit songs scattered throughout the film.  I'll wager that nearly everyone knows them all.  Back to the 80s culture on-screen brings back the crazy hair-styles and outfits that were so popular and common back in the day...the tight spandex pants, the guys when looked at from behind, you thought were girls, and so forth.  In the extra features, many of the artists laugh at how they looked back then, but then, that was the culture.<br /><br />The song and dance numbers are all fun, and I still remember some people in the theater audience clapping and singing right along.  It helps, of course, to have one of the world's best dancers in Julianne Hough who really did a job with her dance numbers.  Watch the extended version, as most of her dance numbers were edited out for the theatrical version.<br /><br />Is the story somewhat cheesy and predictable?  Yes, but so what?  The point is that the story is fun, and it keeps and plays in time with the songs.  \\"Rock of Ages\\" is just a ton of fun and a good time.  I've even had people who weren't around, or were too young, to appreciate the music of that era say things like, \\"why don't they do music like that anymore?\\"  \\"Rock of Ages\\" even goes so far as to poke fun at the next generation \\"boy bands\\" that basically replaced the power ballads and music of the 80s' bands.<br /><br />So if you want nothing but a good time?  \\"Rock of Ages\\" is it!edback from members of one of the most popular bands of the 80s is high praise!<br /><br />There are over 20 memorable hit songs scattered throughout the film.

B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is one of the great Playrix games.  My wife and I own them all for the Apple products and we are getting them on the Kindle Fire so we and our grandson can play the games there.  The challenge is to race around the world in 80 days.  You are racing against the clock and if you do well you get between 1 to 3 stars and the game keeps track of your time.  It is a match three game with puzzle pieces that you are trying to move down the board and off of the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />As you progress the levels get harder.  Each country has multiple levels like England and when you complete a country you go to another country.  You can see the map of the world in a globe form and see the countries on your journey.  There are seven levels in England and 3 stars per level so the best possible score is 21 stars for completing England.  On each level you complete a puzzle piece like Mr. Fogg's journal, or his money purse is freed.  Getting four or more matches helps you to charge the hammer which allows you to break out a tile at the bottom of the board.  Once the hammer is charged it is best to use it quickly so you can recharge it again.<br /><br />You can also free other tools that can help you clear the board faster but to earn them you have to move them to the bottom of the board and free them like you do the puzzle pieces.  You will need them so don't use them unless you really have to use them to beat the clock.<br /><br />The game is colorful, fun and challenging.  We enjoy it and it can provide hours of fun.  The timer on the RH side of the screen shows you the remaining time and at which points you will lose a star for taking too long.  The tiles can be locked or frozen and many other challenges and you have to use your speed, ingenuity and tools to quickly finish the level.  When you complete a country you will be asked to solve a small puzzle like to create the stamp for that country to prove that you were there, finished the country and moved on in your journey.<br /><br />We enjoy the Playrix game and if you like their games like Call of Atlantis then you will like this one also. We recommend it to you as a fun game.<br /><br />The game is large at 78.12 MB but that is because of the many levels and good graphics.  There are also a few permissions like:<br />* Storage - modify/delete storage contents<br />* Network communication - full internet access<br />* System tools - prevent Kindle from sleeping<br /><br />It will ask you to rate the game after several levels but you can select Don't Ask Me Again as a response.<br /><br />I rate this as a five star game and a lot of fun to play.r journey.<br /><br />We enjoy the Playrix game and if you like their games like Call of Atlantis then you will like this one also.

0060555661|3.0|I've not fully completed reading the book yet, but from what I've read so far this is my comment. I may change my mind when I've finished the book. The assessments written after each chapter and added after the original release of the book brings a whole new dimention to Benjamin's consept and brings the book into todays world. The examples of past happenings that are used are also so explicit and quite remarkable, and are good examples for life lessons not just investing ones. I'am not a finance person in fact finance bores me to tears, but I have to do for my SMSF or get ripped off!!!. I am in fact an Engineer but I am finding the book very interesting and am continuing to read it, although being a self proclaimed extremely technical person, my progress is slow, but very very compreshensive. Thanks for opportunity to comment.<br />Regards Chris Burcher.
0028643151|3.0|This is a quickly produced  book that is an easy read on a plane.  It will  not give you any  kind of depth on any of the issues and there are no refs to  enable  you to check anything. He covers asteroids, WMD's, greenhouse effect,  ice  ages, volcanos, plagues, insects, bioengineering, cyberterror  and, presciently,  tsunamis.  He does not mention overpopulation(which will bring civilization crashing down over the next 150 years without any doubt at all),  supernovas or the Doomsday  Hypothesis(the seemingly absurd but  quite serious idea that on general gounds  alone it is likely we  have lived half our total span as a species).  His chapter  on  volcanos does not mention that Yellowstone Park in the USA is the  worlds  biggest caldera.  To his credit he does take the greenhouse  effect seriously and  he was writing about 13 years ago. If only the  average citizen and  the government had the same good sense. But of course the problem is that monkeys, like all organisms, have only one motivation--replicating their genes and accumulating resources therefor, and with few exceptions those who produce the most children don't read books and even if they do it will not divert them from their monomania. With 11 billion and no food it will be anarchy and universal misery and there is no credible alternative.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Character development lacking. Too many things just happened without any explanation of the how and why.<br />Book felt like it was written in a rush without much thought or research leading to better depth to plot and the characters within each subplot. Ending left you thinking, &#34;That's it?&#34;

0547848412|5.0|Life of Pi Review<br /> Initially Yann Martel's Life of Pi starts off exploring the main character, Pi's life that is highly devoted religion. Pi's life is not just devoted to one or two religions, but is devoted to several of them. Originally it is unclear to the reader why so much time is devoted to Pi's life of religion since the main plot is Pi surviving at sea, but this later sets the stage for large amounts of conflict once the main design of the story ensues. The main plot of the story entails Pi being stranded in the middle of the ocean in nothing more than a life boat and the boats survival kit.<br />  Pi is not alone though; Pi must survive with numerous animals, including a tiger. As if surviving at sea wasn't hard enough, Pi is forced to survive with the remaining superior animal, which of course is the tiger. In order to survive this ordeal Pi is forced to do whatever it takes to remain alive. Previously living a life heavily devoted to religion and restraint this forces Pi to put aside his beliefs and do what is needed to adapt for survival. This leads to many conflicts that Pi must struggle to overcome if he is to survive.<br />  Ultimately when Pi survives the ordeal several questions regarding the boy's tribulation are brought to light which puts a completely different spin on what may or may not have happened while Pi was out to sea. Martel does a brilliant job of posing thought provoking questions within his own literary work that brings the novel to a deeper place at the tail end of the story. This causes the reader to reflect on what may or may not have happened within the story and replay what has happened up to this point.<br />  Not only has Martel created an intense tail of heroism and survival, he does so in a way that is sophisticated and highly researched. Every facet within the story that may seem insignificant is brought up again later during the closure of the story to provide evidence of the validity of Pi's survival. When authoritiestry to discredit Pi and his claims of survival they are quickly met with evidence to prove otherwise. This paints a well-crafted novel that not only takes the reader on an enthralling ride but also leaves the reader thinking and second-guessing what may have actually occurred while stranded at sea.<br />  While the story starts off slow enough, the beginning is important since it sets up the major conflicts within the story. With so much inner conflict the story is more than just a harrowing tale of a teenage boy lost at sea with a tiger. The major theme of the novel involves a highly religious teenage boy who must not only cope with surviving out to sea with a tiger, but he also has to put aside his morals in order to do what is needed to be done to survive.
B005PK553C|5.0|I'm enjoying the series thus far.  Very unique and interesting concept, curious as to where it will lead.  Good performances.  I gave it five stars because I more than like it, however, it is not at the level of Breaking Bad.  Excited to finish this season and check out the second.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I prefer smaller and flatter mouses, I find it hard to hit the left side front button unless I have a full grip on the mouse with my hand completely covering the mouse.  That's not how I prefer to hold a mouse, much more comfortable holding with fingers.  Even with all the weights in the mouse I find it still too light for my taste.  Coming from a wireless mouse with two AA's in it, this is lights and I often over move it.<br /><br />Other annoyances:  The material is slick, much more so than my last logitech making it a little too slippery.  There is no tilt wheel for fast spinning.  On a positive note the software is very good and it does feel quality.  The blue lights cannot be turned off and I really wish they could.<br /><br />What is with every single gadget feeling the need to have a blue light?<br /><br />Initial review, will update if things change.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|I would have liked to view less violence in the film. Scariest Joker I've seen !<br />Worth watching but not a family movie
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|This was the best DVD set ever for Monster High fans. Both movies were well written, and had great interesting storylines and beautiful animation. I am an adult fan, however my 9 year old god daughter is also into Monster High. These movies are clean and appropriate for young children of any age, but at the same time have enough jokes and things that will go over kid's heads to keep the adults interested.<br /><br />While \\"Why Do Ghouls Fall In Love\\" is a romance, it is clean enough for the children, yet having your heart broken is a storyline all the adults watching can relate to.<br /><br />Friday Night Frights does have a few scenes where Clawd is somewhat possessive of Draculaura and telling her what to do. It is a good opportunity to open up a dialogue with older children about healthy relationships. At the end he comes around, so younger children probably do not need this kind of talk and will just see it as a kid's movie as it is meant to be.<br /><br />Highly recommended! These are two movies that Monster High fans will want to watch over and over again!
B006JD48NM|4.0|An engaging, gripping and ultimately moving film that happens to be about racing. I'm a gearhead, so no shock that I loved it, but even my wife (who couldn't care less about Formula One, motorsports politics or anything in between) got really wrapped up in it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show deserves all the accolades it has received and then some....brilliant ending...can't wait for season 4!!! Hope it won't be long
B00006ADGP|1.0|Because this was a remarkable and sensitive film, I purchased the DVD as soon as I saw it on Amazon. Big mistake!<br />This is an inferior product that almost destroys this beautiful film!  I feel ripped off.  Now I see that there are many reviews here that warned the buyer to beware, but I didn't think to read them because I knew and loved the film and didn't stop to think that the DVD itself might be a poor product.  I've learned my lesson.  I started to show the DVD to my students and was horrified at what had been done to the film. Not only is the quality of the image unacceptable, but the amateurish dubbing destroys the performances of the wonderful actors. Terrible, and a great disservice to a beautiful work.

044042335X|3.0|Reacher, an ex-army guy with no ties to society, no job, no money, no permanent home, learns that one of his army buddies has been killed. He brings his old team together to get to the bottom of this killing (which turns out to be plural.) At times a bit over the top with gratuitous violence and hard-ass behavior but, all in all, a fun escape read.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story. Better than the movie (which is usually the case) I read all three books in the series in four days. Two days later started over again! Can't believe this is a kids book. Loved getting to know the characters and I love that they are all a bit flawed.

B000FC2KL0|3.0|I love Anthony Kedis....but his writing style was very remedial.  I was hoping for more psychological insight from him. This came highly recommended by a friend who is a recovering addict. I'm not...maybe that's why I didn't get as much out of it.

B0055SJVPW|2.0|I watched this movie thinking it would be a funny romantic comedy, but it's not really like that.  There are some funny parts, but not too many.  The movie gets really boring and drawn out toooo much!  I wouldn't recommend this movie unless it's the only thing that's on.  If you want a good funny romantic comedy I highly recommend these.  [[ASIN:B003B3V0UM When in Rome [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B002P413IW The Ugly Truth [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B009EU6F1U Hit & Run]], [[ASIN:B00005AVS8 That Thing You Do!]], [[ASIN:B001OD4S50 Role Models (Unrated)]], [[ASIN:B004IY1AW6 How Do You Know [Blu-ray]]], and [[ASIN:B000CQM4Y2 Just Like Heaven (Widescreen Edition)]].  That's all I can think of off the top of my head right now.  I hope my review(s) are helpful to everybody reading them.
1577311523|4.0|I 1st became aware of the book when I heard it was one of Madonna's fav books. I've bought this book many times over and gave it as a gift to my closest friends. Specially my mother. Amazing book and philosophy to know. However, this book is not easy to read, unlike some review I first read before I ever read this book. The way is written is not in simple terms or flow. I've learned that some people do not get it and loose interest. Use of &#34;big&#34; words and deep messages may appear out of order and loose you forcing you to re-read one paragraph. This book must be read with an open mind and slow, very slow; studied & even then, you will still go back to it and read certain sections. The message it's amazing and explained thoroughly. Some may be able to fly through this book and digest it well, while others may just not be interested or understand it's content.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Liked the story, no twist or turn. Books are so much better to read then watching the movies. Worth Reading.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|This series was bought as a Christmas gift for a grandchild. Everything we read about it was that it was a good story and a safe buy for a young lady.  History and family and caring.... good combinations.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|A Christmas gift that I got for my Grandson, since he and I had seen the movie together,  He really liked having his own copy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it is cool because you get to build anything you want! and its great for a game with friends!

B008CPZNL6|4.0|Just what I need with my coffee in the morning.  Like the format - reminds me of the days when I read an actual paper and flipped the pages.
B002KREVCO|1.0|We bought this for a chirstmas present and 1 of the CDs is broken and wont play.  I have tried different machines, and none will read it.  I returned it and we had it reshipped.  Same issue.
B0079R8KXG|3.0|I must not have read the description as carefully as I thought. Being able to stand the Kindle horizontal is fine but I was expecting to be able to stand it vertical - in a reading position. Minor thing but still bugs me.<br />Everyone was right about the smell of the thing!<br />It did snap right on my Kindle Fire and is a perfect fit.
B002VQ7PVS|3.0|If you doln't like books that keep going back and forth from the present to the past, this is not for you. But it is an interesting look at what went on during World War II that most people were not familiar with. If you enjoy that kind of history, y ou will enjoy this.
0525478817|5.0|I wanted a book that I would get attached to as soon as I picked it up. I think this is a wonderful book and I've recommended it to all my friends. This book is still great even if you're not an active reader.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game&#65281; never found a better one before. you have to run all the time but i run to a stumble or fall so easily that i want to have more life in these characters.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|Over half way through, the episode paused and the loading icon rolled continuously.  Then I was given a message to come back later which I did twice (the next day).  I watched a few more minutes until the scenario repeated.  I went to pbs.org to complete my viewing and will go there to watch future episodes.  I contacted customer service and none of their suggestions made any difference.  This is the only time I have had a problem with amazon viewing.  I'm a loyal amazon customer, but this was a disappointment.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|A good movie covering relationships and baseball.  Hi Tech versus experience of an old BB scout.  Well done, actors  and acting.<br />Slow moving at times.  However a very enjoyable evening at the movies.
1426308469|4.0|Our four year old is fascinated with dinosaurs. This book was a great addition to his collection of dinosaur books. He is especially interested in knowing what the various dinos ate. This topic is covered in the fact section about every dinosaur presented in the book.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This old classic was done very well. Acting was exceptional.  Scenery depicting the times could have been better.  It followed the book except for a few parts.  I would recommend the movie to everyone except the young.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series so much I couldn't wait and had to see Season 3 early! -Can't wait for season 4!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nice show of a psychotic mind. Well written by sparks as usual. Go read it if you like his other books
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so glad that I purchased this season. I enjoyed it so much I purchased Season 2 and 3! Good storylines, amazing acting and the fashion is incredible.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Bought this because of all the good reviews and am happy to say it was pretty good. Some parts were predictable to me non the less I liked it.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I enjoyed the character and plot set up. Didn't see this one getting so dark. Such an exciting first kiss and first date...the kind of feelings that make you envious and leave you yearning for your soul mate...however, the rest of their relationship was completely undesirable. At some point I didn't really want another love scene...things got awkward when the characters forced bad sex on each other. Could have told the same story without draining the characters of all sex appeal and chemistry.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I always saw my husband play it and thought it was stupid but when I start playing it myself it's actually fun
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was the best price out there.  It is about 7.99 pre movie.  Which is the price to buy just one movie
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Love my kindle nice to listen to the read to me  while I walk.<br />Defending Jacob the ending will blow you away!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is REALLY fun.I recomend this game boy everyone.it's a bit simple at times ,and other times it's a little tricky,but I still recomend it.
B000V6MSN0|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, one of the best Motion Picture soundtracks over the last 25 years. Never get tired of it.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|Another great Lee Child book.  They just keep getting better.  The Jack Reacher series is just the best.  It's hard to put the book down.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|recieved on time and in good shape. i have not had time to view the entire season. what i have seen so far i like. this is in some respects like the x-file and millinnum. i enjoyed both of these shows
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|To be outside, to hold it in, to not quite fit, to find a place...<br />the tenuous reality of being a kid unto himself, not into a clique is a fascinating journey.<br />In a more harrowing, haunted way than even John Hughes' &#34;Breakfast Club,&#34;<br />&#34;Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34; tenderly exhumes the pain and causes of several tragically talented young people.<br />Privileged, but without the nihilism of &#34;Less Than Zero,&#34; extreme but without the stock scenarios of &#34;St Elmos Fire,&#34; this is a coming of age tale that pulls the rug out from under you only to stand you back up firmly on your own two legs and invest you in the clarity of what can be.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is awesome yaaaårrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrthis game has lots of things like jumping trains and even collect the coins
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This app along with CrossMe color are the two best apps that I have for my android.  I wish there were updates more often.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Just too much to accept<br />There were good story lines and there were the unbelievable. Unfortunately the unbelievable wins. Thus three stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Both Temple Run and Temple Run 2 are great tablet games.  Great graphics and exciting concept.  This game holds my interest.
0062127241|4.0|\\"Don't worry, smile and dance<br />You just can't work life out<br />Don't let them moods entrance you<br />Take the wine and shout.\\"<br /><br />If you're here, then you know.  This memoir is just as candid and confessional as Townshend's music has been through the years.  Not a rock history--if that's what you want The Who's story has been told in more reportorial detail elsewhere--but an autobiography, intensely, almost fearlessly personal.  There's not a lot of musical exposition here--a small surprise, given how he even wrote the Rolling Stone review for Meaty Beaty Big and bouncy.  Rather, it's a record of his anxieties, drunks, periods of thoughtlessness, failures of family life, etc.  Perhaps he has read George Orwell's quote, that \\"An autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful. A man who gives a good account of himself is probably lying, since any life when viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats.\\"  Pete is certainly unsparing in his recounting of his own failings, which makes the reader appreciate his enormous accomplishments all the more.  Young readers, having come up in the post-rock era, might not quite grasp what all the fuss is about.  They really had to be there, but this marvelous memoir is almost as good.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series, we brought it to Mexico with us since we don't have regular tv here.  We look forward to watching an episode every evening, the acting and story line are great.  Wish we had more seasons to watch!
1455502758|3.0|\\"There's one thing that keeps surprising you about stormy old friends after they die--their silence.\\"<br />-- Ben Hecht, Letters From Bohemia, 1964<br /><br />\\"When I mount the scaffold at last these will be my farewell words to the sheriff:  Say what you will against me when I am gone, but don't forget to add, in common justice, that I was never converted to anything.\\"<br />-- H. L. Mencken, Baltimore _Evening Sun_, June 12, 1922<br /><br />As someone said at the time of Hitchens' passing, a world without Hitch is going to be able to get away with fractionally more dishonesty than previously.  The loss to British and American punditry is severe.  Yet trust Hitchens to have something provocative to say about even this tragedy.  These passages are adapted from, or first appeared in, various magazine articles.  Collected here in book form, suffused with his unmistakable lack of sentimentality or self-pity, they have that much more impact.  The effect is rather like an atheistic reverse-image of C. S. Lewis' A Grief Observed.<br /><br />Of course he wasn't present to round the book off properly.  There's no doubt that if it were possibly to expire and then come back and describe it, Hitchens would be the man for it.  The books ends with scraps, jottings that either served as starting points for longer thoughts, or would have.<br /><br />The introduction is gracious and admiring, by someone I was not familiar with.  The afterword is by Hitchens' wife, Carol Blue, and it is heartbreaking. (Interestingly, she quotes him asking for Mencken and Chesterton books, whom he has previously derided in print.) The publisher is Twelve, which also published his massive 2011 collection of essays, Arguably.  In all, a sad but fitting postscript to a remarkable journalistic career, and life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I haven't read a book (trilogy) this great in....never! Love love love this. I had to practically force myself to go to bed and get some sleep. The last trilogy that I &#34;read&#34; , which has been popular, I thought was a joke, and was flipping thru the pages trying to find something worth reading....NOT THIS TRILOGY.......I read every single word and was in it....sometimes speaking out loud....&#34; wow...your kidding... Oh no, not again....&#34;<br />Yes I have already recommended this trilogy to my friends, and even to a few strangers talking in a line somewhere
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have to fight my  3 year old son for a turn. He is better at it than I am anyway.  The whole family loves it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Zoomed thru this book. All else took back seat in my life til I read this trilogy.... Want more of these
B0081SPK0I|4.0|This game is neat. It is a great oldschool arcade style racing game. It reminds me of a game i used to play on N64. It is fun and a great time killer.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I couldn't put down this trilogy. I gave mocking jay 4 stars only because I felt that this book didn't flow as easy as the first 2 books did. I felt a couple times that I missed something or didn't really know who a character was. Maybe I just need to re read it again. Great ending. I have already recommend this book to my friends. Can't wait to see the movies now.
B009FXIICK|4.0|I got this when it was the amazon app of the day. Its a neat game but not my favorite. Its very fast paced for a quick game to play.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Very interesting and well written. I particularly enjoyed the case studies and historical information.  I never knew habit was quite so powerful.
B008NABUU8|3.0|I love bridge building games but this was very difficult to play. The UI is hard to handle, but with improvements it will be a good game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed very much. Couldn't put the book down  ready to start next book to see how it ends.  Do not like to do reviews.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a class act program.  It has beautiful sets and costumes.  I like following the family throughout the years.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|The book was good and definitely for 13+ though. If you want to read this book know that it has a lot of romance
0765325950|5.0|I have been reading this series since the mid 90's and I was worried it wouldn't end right.  Sanderson did a great job of wrapping up the series in a very satisfactory way.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|Wonderfully recorded!  Often the music is transcendent...  just fantastic.<br /><br />My only wish would be the ability to get a SACD version of it for even better quality.<br /><br />Shorter is in top form.<br /><br />A must buy.
B005OP7162|5.0|This has to be one of THE best shows on TV. ALways keeps you guessing or wonderfing what will happen next! Great writing and acting!
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|Explains the basics well and then, the more advanced stuff is easy to understand.<br />Books from &#34;The Missing Manual&#34; consistently worth the money and time.
B009WHD3OW|4.0|The movie was all great action, however there was far too much cussing and swearing that served to diminish the actors acting ability to pull off the character they portrayed from their own talents.
B0099Y2YL6|3.0|Unlike previous season's discs, the UK edition of Downton Abbey 3 is different than that which PBS is broadcasting. Having previously watched the UK version (while overseas) and currently watching the US as broadcast by PBS I can say that the UK edition is MISSING a few short but quite good sequences.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why this is but must say that it is unfortunate as some of these sequences add better continuity to the story.<br /><br />If you can wait for the US version, I would recommend that you wait for that version to become available.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever and I highly suggest it so I think you should seriously buy it.<br />If you do buy it you will enjoy it very much indeed. Thank you.
1427210241|5.0|I've been listening to this series on audiobook sinse 2000 and finnishing this was like saying goodbye to old friends. The plot was spot on and I couldn't wait for the next chapter.....chapter after chapter. If you've not read the rest of the series it doesn't cover backstory very much.....assumes you're allready a fan...new readers should go back to Eye of the World and start from scratch(and I recomend it).  the story is the most epic of all the books in the series. Non-stop action from about halfway through to the end. And the end itself.....I sort of stopped for a minute to reflect on the fact that this huge story was over. There will be no more of Rand, Matt , and Perrin's adventures.
B003VSVWA0|4.0|He is absolutely amazing.  My words are not important, just listen to him -  an amazing experience. Also, check out his LIve In London album.  Superb!
B000URWYTS|5.0|The book was totally engaging, even with its absurd ending.  I had no previous knowledge of Frank Lloyd Wright's personal life and found this tale intriguing.  It is a real page-turner.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|HIs songs are poetry set to music. The group is so tight.  His musicians are a joy to hear and his three singers just wonderful talents.  They blend so beautifully.  One must really sit back and ' take in' this music.  There are no disappontments, here.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have used calculators in business and have always enjoyed the convenience and speed they provide. Calculator plus provides a basic calculator that is easy to use. It is perfect for everyday usage and a pleasure to have on my Kindle. If your searching for a basic calculator, your search is over.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless kept you guessing till the end.  I truly enjoyed this book.  It's a great read.  Colleen Hoover did a great job.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|We love this movie. We can watch it during the holidays when we have time! It's become a holiday tradition at our house.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|My kids and i are enjoying this game a lot. It is very detailed and still easy for them to follow
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I am soooo glad to have this on my Kindle. My grandchildren LOVE it. Keeps them entertained for hours. My 2year old grandson says &#34;PaPa&#34; &#34;PaPa&#34;. and we know this is the one he wants to play with. His PaPa is in the construction business and every machine is his PaPa's.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|There are already nearly 1,500 reviews for this book, but I'll post mine as well because I found this book to be many things, both good and not so good. In the first place, the premise is truly shocking and fascinating. A 14-year-old is accused of murder in the same jurisdiction as his district attorney father. Okay, let the fireworks fly! And they do. In no time, the father is put on leave and he promptly begins to defend his son at all cost, from hiring a great defense attorney to tracking down a suspect on his own. In the mean time, the boy's mother is more suspicious. More fireworks, this time the family drama kind as mother and father battle over what to believe vis a vis their son. Is he a good kid who makes some bad choices? Or, is he a bad kid who inherited a ruptured set of DNA from the father's family that is peppered with murderers? Enter cops, a psychiatrist, and even the grandfather still in prison for murder. These elements the author weaves together quite well as we venture down the path witnessing good and evil through the eyes of a man who proves to be an unreliable narrator. In fact, the book is told in the first person with plenty of courtroom transcripts. Because the reader is forced to bounce back and forth in the timeline without specific knowledge of when some testimony is given in different venues, the shocking ending is cleverly revealed. The trouble is, the reader spends a little too much time with the narrator, getting repetitive, dragging through a courtroom with retelling of various well-known parts of the story. The book could easily be 50 pages shorter without losing any impact. Still, I stuck with it with some satisfaction. In particular, the questions asked are the kind that don't always have answers. And if there are answers they are not the ones we like to face. There is good and evil in this world, and some of it may (or may not) be in the family.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I sent this item to a relative on vacation in Hawaii and she loved it. The case sealed her phone completely and no water damage from swimming in the ocean. The pictures and videos were clear and audio was clear.
1616550414|5.0|This book far exceeded my expectations of it and is filled with every sort of insight and artwork you could ever want on each of the entries in the Legend of Zelda series. The book looks and feels great and goes perfect on my bookshelf.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|When I downloaded this apps it was for my little sister to play, but now I find myself playing these mini games in my spare time. This game gives you goals to complete and the games are both addicting and fun to play. If you ever needed something for you or your kids to just sit down and play to keep you busy, this is the apps for you.
B007EC27QM|1.0|I was checking some equations, and the math on this does not take precedence into account.<br /><br />2+4*6  will calculate as (2+4)*6
B00ANW33CM|1.0|This doesn't feel like Mahjong at all. Having the constantly rotate the view is the most annoying part.  I can't get past it to play.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This unit works good for my IPOD. I use it to send to my BOSE bluetooth speakers when out by the pool and to my wireless headphones when at the gym. It does drain the battery faster and may only get half the time I normally get on playtime but that is to be expected.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|the game is really fun if you know what you are doing but if you are playing forthright first time it is kinds boring.it has plenty of options to do with your horse and other people's. horses too.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|For a free app it is great. You can set it up to tell you when the battery is at designated percentages, verbally. This is a great app. Highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I know I'm not allowed but I'm under 13 and I thought this app was so much fun, I played for an hour once and it never gets old.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Katniss everdeen is still someone to be inspired by. Nothing seems to be too tough for her to overcome even tho there are plenty of times she wanted to give up she always made it through. Loved all the books can't wait for the next two movies
B00APJLX8E|4.0|Fun, fresh and funny. New twist of old tale. Well done and clever. Good for children of all years even the old folks.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|Really good movie according to my grandson. I did not see it myself, but all his friends raved about it. Good choice.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|Awesome movie! I just watched it and can say this is one of the best fantasy movies I have seen.
B00005NWYU|5.0|Very nice family show. We all loved it. (big and small.  Good job Jim Carey.  Another good choice from Amazon.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love, love, love this app!!!! I can play for hours and I'm constantly downloading new puzzles. Overall this is a great application
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a series that I will miss once its gone. It's frustrating at times because of the antagonist but otherwise, I love that there isn't a lot of sex, nudity & violence.
B00AOMR2S2|2.0|The songs are not as exciting as they are while watching the movie. It left me wanting something more, just buy the individual songs you like.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|My husband and I love this CD. It was an excellent value and in no problems at all with the order.  It is one of our favorite CDs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Way too addictive but lots of fun. Great graphics. Good for passing time anywhere and very easy to learn and play
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Bought this for my son. Really enjoys almost every dat he is bust playint the dvd or cd should have bought them sooner
B00021HBGS|5.0|These are a lot of fun to play with.  They adhere so well to the tub surfaces, and there are so many different pieces to play with.  I love watching my toddler put the roadway together and then name the various cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, etc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game.  The graphics are very good and the game does not get boring quickly like some games do.  The only downfall for me is that getting extra gems is hard... And the options for \\"free gems\\" seem a little skeevy.  Other than that, though, I really enjoy this game.
0525478817|3.0|I felt terrible after doing so... While I don't want to shelter my children, it wasn't a good choice for an 8th grade book report. He kept referring to it as his &#34;everybody's dying&#34; book. Additionally there is an &#34;implied&#34; sex scene. I read it along with him and told my husband, &#34;So the depressing book I bought him also has a sex scene in it.&#34; Oops.<br /><br />There is some beautiful (though contrived in passages) parts of this book - the references to Shakespeare and the idea that a person with an illness can be a &#34;grenade&#34; in a family struck me as very insightful.<br /><br />I didn't find myself drawn to any one character (except perhaps a secondary one - Issac) and it felt very much like this author was writing this book for the sheer purpose of making the reader cry (I didn't).
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this game is AWESOME..... i have always loved hello kitty and this game is fun, easy and addictive. it reminds me of diner dash
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was the only thing I have been interested in a dictionary. I completely loved the book. I wish there was another book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the best yet. It's almost like three dimensional. It's more complex than the original temple run. It has a gold mine and zip lines. It's pretty awesome.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This was a Christmas gift, and it arrived promptly.  The person receiving this item loves all the Twilight Saga.  Thanks!
B00498YZH8|5.0|Performances by Lawrence and Hawkes are impeccable. It's clear why Lawrence was nominated for best actress that year. Not sure if Hawkes got nominated for an award or not, but he deserved to be. His performance was so convincing, I found it hard to believe that he was an actor and not a real backwoodsman.The story of an elder sibling, still a child herself and deserted by her father, struggling to care for younger siblings as well as her mentally ill mother is gripping and heart-wrenching.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I gave this to my daughter for a Christmas gift.  She absolutely loves it and watches it over and over.
B0096PYUE2|2.0|I still can't play my online games, nor watch movies. I am being asked to upgrade flash player. So it doesn't work for me.
0375826742|5.0|This is only the second book on the 5 that are the Inheritance cycle and the whole work is amazing, just a must read for any one who enjoys fantasy stories
B008HT4FUW|5.0|One of the best shows on tv. It gives a look at what it was like at the turn of the last century. Old fashioned views of a simpler world.
B003AWRMCE|4.0|Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and Richard Harris.<br /><br />The story is good, the scenes are well acted and it feels like you are back in a changing Western town where there are a lot of morally ambiguous people.  This is not a feel good movie, but a movie about harsh judgements and harsh consequences.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A great quick read, with enough spice to make it interesting. Does make you want to read it more than once!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A show about people who live a different way from now. I wouldn't mind living either upstairs or downstairs, in service or being served, if it meant living with these fine people.
0545265355|5.0|Great book that is entertaining and leaves you wondering what will happen next.<br /><br />Although, the overall concept is pretty disturbing (kids killing kids) but I think its pretty well known the overall plot of the story so I doubt anyone will be surprised.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|this is really good.  But start slow, don;t do as many per each exercise as she does at first!  Recommended!
034580404X|5.0|As most people know, this series is pretty graphic, but the overall storyline is great.  I'm a pretty conservative/modest  'good' girl so some of the scenes were extremely disturbing, but even if you skim over those parts the book is awesome.<br /><br />It has a mix of romance, mystery, action/trhiller.  It is definitely a page turner.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great graphics, very entertaining, but you must have patience.  I wish I could save up to where I left off instead of having to go back from the beginning each time I fail a maneuver.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Plenty of action, heartbreak, and cheers, all with a super original backdrop. I'm gonna go insane waiting for the next book, it couldn't come soon enough
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good for the brain, too.  Try matching tiles faster and faster.  This is addictive!  I highly recommend this for all ages.  I am 75 and it keeps me hopping!
B007N0AEWY|4.0|Had to buy this after hearing &#34;Is That Clear.&#34;  None of the cuts are quite as good as that one, but they're all pretty good.  Makes you wanna DANCE!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Im a big fan of rock history flicks. this one takes the cake.  Dave never stops and digs into the real heart of rock and roll.
B0097NGUJG|4.0|I listened to the sampling of tunes on Amazon and found the voice and instrumentation intriguing.  The price was such that I couldn't pass it up.  So far, after several listens, I'm not sorry.  There are a few songs that are rewarding to listen to by themselves, but I find that listening to the entire album as a single listening experience (or concert) is the best way to enjoy it (as I'm sure the musicians intended).  &#34;Unique&#34; as a descriptive term in describing a new band or musical release is very much overused, but I believe it is truly apt in this case, and in a very positive way!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game has great graphics, fun characters, enjoyable challenges and all in all its a fun game. My only criteria would be that it is VERY similar to temple run.
1577314808|5.0|I can not recommend this book enough.  I have read it over and over again and now I have it on audio to listen to it.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|You have to have a taste for it...or have been one of those High School outsiders to really get this story line.  I love the looks Pedro gives when he realizes he is winning the class president election and at his victory party.  Priceless.  And of course the Dance sequence to Canned Heat, worth the price of admission.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Forbidding.  Enjoy your stay in the world to the most popular has been in commonwith and it is a bedroom
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is a pretty fun game.  Probably the best I have played on my fire hd.  Graphics are very good and it doesnt take long to get the hang of flying and landing.
B007712XAU|5.0|I wanted to catch up.  I had heard so much about the show and I thoroughly enjoy Dame Maggie Smith, that I purchased this collection.  It was worth it.  The characters and story lines are great.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|No way to turn it off other than turning off media volume on the phone.  Background graphics are annoying as well.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod takes me back to my teens.  Listening to him sing some of my favorite Christmas songs is just great!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|it's good, I'm tired,  does this qualify as irony yet? if not, do I need to come up with a new joke? it told me to rate it
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love the game, and I'm a boy. I can't believe that it's free.  There is something that you could fix, you shouldn't have to have internet. Other than that it's a great game.
B00005NTNU|4.0|Liked the movies. Arrived in a timely manner. Price was pretty good. Condition was new. Was a gift, so did not know about the workings, but did not hear otherwise.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Adam's the type of author who's scene descriptions and characters already have you seeing what they see and feeling what they feel. Then for Orphan Master, Adam made the trip to North Korea to make sure his scenes and character also accurate enough to help you live in the rarely visited NK. I enjoyed the book from start to finish and can't wait to try more books by Adam Johnson. Maybe I'll try to take a class with him at Stanford!<br /><br />Edit: 4/15/13<br /><br />Congratulations on winning the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction!
B00A0A59IS|5.0|My Daughter loves this album and listens to it all the time.  I love the extras and she can't wait for the next album.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is of the hook! I love this app because you get to take care of your own horse.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was just amazing! I had so much fun reading it and just did not want to finish! I ended up finishing it in one week, surprising myself because I normally don't read that fast. I really liked this book and although I was confused at some parts, it all came together as he explained farther. I recommend to high schoolers or soon to be freshman, so they can experience the difference between what Charlie experiences and their own experience.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Lots of excitement and intrigue in this story.  I'm looking forward to seeing the movie.  Sparks is a great writer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love your game so so so so so so so so so much! Wish I could play it 24-7!I want more give me more!!!:)
0307744434|5.0|I'm not going to say anything because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. But, this is an amazing book!!! Love it!! Love it!! Love it!!!!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Great service and fast and will buy more Lego products. Can not wait for next years fantastic new item. Best Service!
0618154043|4.0|Christopher Tolkien undertook an immense task when he decided to turn his father's decades of work into publishable, cohesive literature. This book is extensive in detail, with a myriad of names and places to try and remember and make sense of, and at the same time apply it to several time lines and plots one should already know from the Lord of the Rings series.  This is indeed heavy reading and text-book like at times and really should only be undertook by someone who is already familiar with Middle Earth.<br /><br />This book is also rewarding. Many answers are solved and some mysteries revealed. I particularly enjoyed learning about the kingdom of Numenor and the origins of the five wizards, and Gandalf's endeavors in the decades leading up to the war of the ring. There is also captivating new characters and stories from the first two ages that you will enjoy. There is a lot to absorb in this book, but it's well worth it in my opinion.
0547884591|5.0|This is a good companion to Ferriss's last book &#34;The 4-hour Body.&#34; In addition to reading it, you can use it as an exercise weight. It is quite substantial.<br /><br />In all seriousness, this is a book that was put together will a great deal of care. Not only is it well written, the subjects covered are wide ranging and the photographs are outstanding.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|In last one week I searched so many bags but this bag is the best. All other bags don't come even near to its quality and style.....Online you can get this bag for less price. Stores in NY are charging 110, 85, 80 etc..
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed this game. The graphics were good and one could follow the story line. I will be checking out the other apps for sure!
B004ZY0VHY|2.0|We need to talk about Lionel Shriver's thesaurus. As another reviewer noted, this book reads like someone who writes with one window open on Microsoft Word and the other on Thesaurus.com. Phrases like \\"immediate rapacities\\" and \\"superficial peripatetics\\" and \\"lambent joy\\" seemed more designed to impress than to communicate.  The fact that this epistolary-novel is supposed to come from one estranged spouse to the other seems wholly unimaginable.  Is this how a bohemian character who writes budget-friendly travel guides for starving students would communicate with her husband?  I doubt it.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the book was over-written.  (Example:  Every day we spent apart, I would conjure that wide warm chest of yours, its pectoral hillocks firm and mounded from your daily 100 pushups, the clavicle valley into which I could nestle the crown of my head on those glorious mornings that I did not have to catch a plane.)<br /><br />I also got bored with the newspaper-like summaries of every school shooting ever.  I want insight into this family, not a superficial recounting of the same widely-known facts of every other school shooting.<br /><br />Obviously, this was not my favorite book.  I can see how it would prompt discussion and but absent a group debate, this book made up entirely of unlikeable characters is both tiresome and grim.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|seemingly effortless writing, well drawn characters and the strength love brings to life made this book a joy to read.  Well done.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I must say this game is so realistic and fun, i find it very addicting to play. Some things I wish they would change, is to make it easier to earn gems, they are expensive to buy and it takes too many to feed your horse and to buy things, I also wish they let you keep all the horses that you purchase in the same field together.<br />overall, this has to be my favorite app so far, it is perfect for any hose lover!
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game!but does not have bukets or flint and steel. worth the money!!!no joke. must have app for all minecraft lovers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun it is amazing i love it lol love it was awsome now they've gave me a free gift.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is omg appofmylife.com. It is very addicting. If you like temple run and temple run 2 you will love subway surfers. Excited for the sequel
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very interesting and fun it's almost as if your doing it you're self all though it takes a lot<br />of extreme concentration.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|this game was fun until it deleted all my progress. that wouldnt be too bad, but since they give limited time characters and stuff, i couldnt have them even tho i had gotten them when they were available. Very dissapionting. kindle fire
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this games is super fun I play it so much I rate it all 5 stars it makes a fun game when u all alone
B00881VLCE|5.0|These are fun puzzles and easy to navigate.  They work great on my Kindle fire.  Graphics are very nice and vivid.<br />Bob
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surfers cause you get to compete with girlfriend and I just find it completely different and free
B009I2UH2W|4.0|Its a great product I would've given it 5 stars except for the bright white light on it when charging. Its very bright and it never shuts off even when fully charged. Otherwise Its great cause I use it allot when Im at work in my work truck
B006LSZECO|2.0|While the novel certainly has merit as a cleverly woven story and depicts wicked and complex characters we love to hate... I couldn't wait to be done with it. The war was just too brutal to enjoy.
0307592731|4.0|Wild is the recounting of the author's summer long hike of the pacific coast trail (PCT). Cheryl Strayed, (Strayed is a chosen last name after her divorce), after the swift demise of her mother, goes into a tailspin of grief. She cheats on her husband, quits school, and even occaisionally does heroin. She quite spontaneously decides to hike the PCT to get her life back on track (so to speak!) The book alternates between her hike experiences, and the story of her life before and after her mother's death. I found Strayed, in my opinion, to be a bit of a drama queen and a knucklehead at times, (hence the Oprah connection!). That being said, however, Wild is a good compelling read.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Sweet story that can be read in a day or two. Very creative concept that makes you question our use of time and how it was intended for life.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great read. Reminds you of the ups and downs of life and the strength we must find to protect the ones we love. And to truly give your whole heart to the ones we love.
0763619612|5.0|If you want to inspire someone to be an artist... this is the book<br />If you want to inspire someone to believe in himself/herself, this is the book!<br />Cute, short, simple and sweet illustration. Just perfect!
B003QP4NPE|5.0|Few people have come up with such ingenious ideas about how to take  over the world. I am proud to say that Daniel Suarez has trumped them all.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I thought this book was just for teens or young 20's.  As I read on, I realized it is much more than that.  I found the characters and plot very entertaining.  Liked the format as well.  Highly recommend this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really love all the additions to Temple. I'm going to be even more addicted to this game then before!

B00B2V66VS|2.0|I DL'd this on Feb. 3rd on my Kindle Fire....played it for a day or two LOVED IT --- but now it crashes and won't even play anymore.  I was liking this game a lot but now I can't even get it to open. When I try -- it just goes back the home page and won't even open anymore!!  I have reported this to amazon because now I am getting all these error pop ups and they said they have passed this on to the developers.  No word yet and I would love to give this 5 stars but I can't right now...they need to see it is having issues.  once it's fixed I'll come back and make a better review.  =)
B000NTPDSW|5.0|You have a best picture oscar winner, best picture oscar nominee and a third much weaker (running out of ideas) movie.  Great cast with oscar winners and nominees.  Anyone who likes REALISTIC gangster movies would like these.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Gave this as a gift and it was thoroughly enjoyed!<br />This is a great trilogy... each segment just gets better and better!
0525457585|5.0|A very enjoyable read.  If your a reader and liked the movie, you owe it to yourself to read this.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Groban's voice is maturing and expanding in tone, range and technique; and his songs are also getting more diverse in style, ranging from a Celtic ballad, to full throated baritenor Italian songs, samba Spanish rhythms, a gorgeous duet with Laura Pausini, and a little bit of folk/country beat thrown in! Thoroughly enjoyable from 1st to last song.<br /><br />(If you spend a couple more $$ at Walmart or Target, there are 4 bonus songs that are spectacular, the best 2 are Grazie and the Dave Matthews Band cover of Satellite which is soooo good, it almost beats Dave's version).  All in all, something for everyone's wishist.  Orchestrally, and arrangement-wise it is also top of the line with all the best musicians on board.  It's a keeper, no lie. Can't lose with this one. Rob Cavallo and Josh are a musical collaboration made in heaven.<br /><br />As you can tell, I highly recommend it.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|I thought the acting by Denzel Washington and John Goodman was great, as usual, and Don Cheadle was AWESOME, as usual, but the movies message was mixed and unclear to me.  I found myself wondering exactly what it was they were trying to say.  The movie was, I thought, in itself almost a contradiction?
B00APJLFEG|4.0|The voice talents alone are worth watching/listening to. Adam Sandler fans, you will enjoy.  It's simply a fun, lighthearted take on the father-daughter relationship. It just so happens that the father and daughter are vampires and their &#34;family&#34; are monsters.  They're all adorable, regardless.  Over all, this film is one of the most charming I've watched in a long time.  Absolutely worth the time.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|I don't remember how long this movie was... And I hate regretting things - but I sure wish I could get the time back I wasted watching this one.  I love charlize Theron but this movie sucks big time
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It's fun and was free on Amazon. I like the the original version. Simple and not too complex. Easy to get into.
B0028KF4M4|3.0|I love sitting around and watching tv seasons.  I loved season 1 and 2 of this show.... But this season had me bored and didn't even finish it :(  opinions are opinions - but if you get bored easily I suggest you buy this episode by episode because you might not wanna watch them all....
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I got it after a friend recomemded it but it has been only 2 days and now it will not open
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Amazing!  Love this show.  I purchased the SD and have it streaming on my tv.  Great quality with the SD - save money and do SD unless you have money to burn
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was very disappointed and bored with the last book. I think it wasn't written as well as the first two books.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Great show and great follow up from season 1.  I got the SD and looks great when I stream it on my tv- looks hd to me....
B009FZFONO|5.0|Forget the zombies (of course the is impossible) and you have dynamic group relations with great characters!  I've learned to love this show!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|good game but a little easy. I would probably buy the sequel. hope it comes out soon. nice job g5
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My husband and I have been watching Materpiece Theater<br />since we were first married in the 70's.  We have enjoyed<br />Poldark, Duchess of Duke Street, I Claudius, The Irish R.M.,<br /> and more recently Sherlocke.  Downton Abbey tops all of<br />the fantastic British imports we have enjoyed so much over<br />the years, thanks to PBS.We are looking forward to a long<br /> series of Downton.  Every aspect of the show is so well done.<br /> Thank you, PBS for bringing these British made dramas to<br />us colonialists.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book. Couldn't put the book down. I loved every bit of it. I can't wait for the next book in the series. Now I can watch the movie!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|&#34;Unstoppable&#34; is what I am about watching (and having) this movie. Set it to come on satellite every showing available, now that I have it, can &#34;stop&#34; - always see something different (that I missed or misenterpreted in other viewings). Love the movie, and the Amazon sellers fast, efficient service
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Good acting, reasonable scenes and an easy to follow script.  It's worth a watch if you have the time...not great, but good.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read..could not put it down till the last page was turned...looking forward  to the next crossfire novel to be released.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Simple, pure, with passion and creativity. You can tell they are having fun.Makes me want to clap my hands and stomp my feet, and sometimes I do!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book gives in great detail how hard war and the effects of war has on all envoled. This is a gerat read just like the world without end and Pillars of the Earth.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|I like this game, but I find it sometimes to see both tiles that I need to match. Overall, a pretty good game.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great Writer I read a lot of his books started with Eye of the Neddle<br />covers a lot of great topics in all of his books.<br />My father was in world war 2 & what little he would talk about it, he always talked about how bad the Germans & Brits had it. He stayed in after the war because he could speak German. Also we are German & American Indian. The 2 books are very good!!!!!!!!
B00005QDW1|5.0|Arrived early and in great condition. Great music at a great price. What more could anyone want? Would recommend to all No Doubt fans.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I needed a second charger to use at work, this being part of it.  I had bought one when I originally got my Kindle Fire HD, but I thought it may be beneficial if I had a second one to use at work, just in case the electricity at home were to be cut-off for some reason.  So far, I haven't had to use it.  Hoping it will continue to be that way.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|I saw the Beach Boys 50th reunion concert at the Hollywood Bowl, and they played about 50 songs.  It was terrific.<br />This DVD captures the highlights but only contains about half of their performance.  What it does show is excellent,<br />but I would have preferred to pay more and get the whole event.
0765325950|5.0|Ok, something result still amissing....but it is still a worth conclusion ! and after 12 years....it was really wonderful to know the ending!
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|It's very addicting! Graphics are great, story is great! My concern is it seems a bit difficult. You need to get enough stars for upgrades to get farther in the game and it takes a lot of stars to upgrade. So you either play a LOT or you buy them from the developer. Which is overly common nowadays anyway. Still fun.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I, like other reviewers, have small ears.  Traditional ear buds with adjustable pads always hurt my ears.  These headphones are perfect.  They stay in place while exercising.  They are comfortable and the sound quality is very good.  You won't be disappointed.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|This great classic just keeps getting better every year.  I love the songs and the antics and the children.<br /><br />Download was smooth and playback high quality.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|I love it<br />It is Amazing<br />Best for my nexus 4 bumper and i received about 3 days very very fast<br /><br />Thanks alot :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was not happy with the second book but the third book was great.  I am now waiting for the second movie to come out!!!!
159514188X|4.0|It was a pretty good book, not typical.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to teens and young adults.
159514188X|5.0|Unique premise,interesting lead characters and everything just combines that even with the foregone conclusion of the ending,you will cry(or at least be teary eyed) once you arrive there. Highest recommendation for students,teachers and parents.
B008XBASVY|3.0|it was hard not to imagine chris colfer as the protagonist in this book albeit chris colfer the author intended it to not be him. its an interesting depiction of what high school is like but nothing much is going on. its cleverly written but ive always been into huge plots and winding storylines so this book its just ok for me. just a personal preference.
B008XOXGCO|3.0|Only standout songs are Good Ol' Days and Broken Arrow. If you're already a fan,you'll dig this disc. Otherwise,it won't change your mind.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every bit as exciting as seasons 1-2 with unexpected turns. Can't wait for second half of season to finally air. :)
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Excellent movie, excellent DVD set-up and I highly recommend it.  It has regular DVD and Blu-ray DVD making it multiple purpose.

B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is true to form.  Twists, turns and excitement.  A page turner, you can't put it down.  I highly recommend it
B002OEBMN4|5.0|This CD is awesome from start to finish. No filler songs. If you like Slayer then you MUST have this one.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Without exception, all Americans should read this book to understand what these warriors go through to become the elite of the elite.  Personally, I am very proud of them and their willingness to serve and sacrifice for our country.  It never fails to amaze me that there are men who put their lives on the line with every mission.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|He loves it said it works great!  He uses it with his XBOX and TV and I think his computer too.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A great read and rather unique in regards to how the plot developes with many twists and turns.  It is not one of his best works but it is well worth your time to read.
B006LSZECO|1.0|i only finished this story because i had spent good money on it .  the story was long tedious and at times quite boring  throughout the whole laborious read my only thought was .... who was the bigger jerk .. the husband or the wife .  big waste of money.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|our daughter recommended this game to us.  i love it but.....i tried to purchase new cards for !9.99, they never got credited to my game.  also, at times you play cards, and the numbers never start scrolling across, so you have to get out of the game and you automatically forfeit your cards.  also, sometimes it will GUARANTEE you a new square piece if you purchase it for so many cards, so i tried that, gave up my cards and NEVER got the square that was &#34;guranteed&#34;.  but other than these glitches, it<br />is a very fun game and very addictive.  i love that you can play the slots now and then.  sure hope they can get the running right.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|These are original equipment eartip replacements. Three of the same size unlike the three size sample you get with the headset. Once you know your size you can order three of the same size.<br /><br />Satisfied with this product.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love period shows, so this is perfect. Streaming quality is good, I don't have any problems watching it online.

Kathryn did an amazing job, i watched her & Twitch on SYTYCD, it was great seeing them in a Step Up movie! Can't wait to see what's in store for a Step Up 5???? ..........
B006BAEQB2|4.0|As always, Philippa Gregory delivers an excellent view into the past with strong characters and great references to actual history.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughters for Christmas because I had an old, old copy that my own children viewed when they were young and the girls viewed it my house and wanted a copy to take home to their house.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The dvd arrived in great time and was a big hit with my son as it was a gift to him

0938045768|5.0|I've weight trained most of my adult life and my body has paid a price. I needed a new training program that would be easier on my aging body. Convict conditioning have me all I needed. I thought I was pretty strong, after working trough the book, I realized I wasn't. It is a great book for anyone looking to increase strength. Buy it!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This is a great movie I loved the performances, and the script, I've watched it over 5 times already  :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't play minecraft 24/7 and was skeptical of this game at first but minecraft pocket edition is so worth it once you get a few minutes into it the controls are easier that they look the gameplay is just as fun
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this app makes it so much easy and fast to browse my facebook, got it on my kindle and my phone, I just love it!!
B000VYX8PE|3.0|It was a good book and really had a lot of suspense but the ending was disappointing and lacked the emotion the rest of the book had
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love temple run 1, and really thought i would love the second, but there have been too many upgrades, I get dizzy playing the game. It kind of tilts on its own and thats what makes me dizzy, its still fun to play.  I do recommend this game to any one who likes the game.  If you don't get dizzy easy.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Lovely documentary of a true artist. Big thanks to the film makers and the seekers who finally tracked down Rodriguez. Bravo to the South Africans who knew a good thing when they heard it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game its well worth the money,this game is great you should get it. the updates are amazing. the newest armor updates are awesome. cant wait for the next one, I wonder what it will be, maybe red stone will be in the game or even cakes .the sugar is useless in the game now.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Great free app and way to get WORLD news versus strictly the American viewpoint.  And I don't even have to search for it on TV!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this is a very cool game. I love adventure games with a story line.  I got lost in this game for a while. it was a cool way to pass time.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have always had adobe reader on all my computers--I depend on its compatability and ease of use for many different files that I download.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thus game is awesome ....<br /><br />..<br />I love the excitement!!...the will to not die is Cray Cray . It's even better then temple run and angry Fran run....you'll have the best time playing!!!
B008RTE08E|5.0|The hype (most of it) that has surrounded this movie basically said: \\"It's a silly nonsense movie, not worth your time, etc.\\" Well, the silliness and the nonsense are precisely the point. There is a \\"Zeitgeist\\" here from 1967 which is kinda \\"the hippie vs. the Straight World\\" or \\"Authority vs. Fantasy/Dreams\\"...or you may have your own description. If you followed the Beatles \\"down the rabbit hole\\"/as they evolved so-to-speak you'll know what I mean.  For me, since I've gotten it, it is one of my most watched DVDs. For exactly the reason that it IS more a \\"vibe\\" than about anything \\"concrete\\". And yes, the sound and picture are restored beautifully...the commentary by Paul and Ringo is cool and so are the extras. And finally, not to be too philosophical about it (but I will anyway!), the modern world could use the fun fantasy and non-violent silliness that MMT provides.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This place is awesome but I have an idea make a country background I would rally love that so much. I meant really
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Ever since I was little I could not fall asleep unless there was noise.First I tried keeping the Tv on but that soon got annoying and the flashing light only kept me awake longer.After that I tried the radio but I always got up to change the station after ten minutes!And just when I was about to give up and swear to never sleep again I found this.It gave me the noise I needed and still calmed me.And better yet it had a built in sleep timer so I can set it to an hour after I fall asleep for invade I wake up and I won't be freaked out by the silence.ii really loved this app.I only wish that it had a few more sounds that were more simple and quiet.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I bought this mouse to replace my old microsoft mouse, which was simple, although it was wireless. When i got the mouse and started gaming on it, i was very impressed with the customization, precision, and sensitivity. It works pretty much anywhere from a blanket to a mousepad. It did take me some time to get used to the wire, and at first i was annoyed at how bulky and tangly it was, but now i realize it's not such a big deal. Once problem that is significant to most gamers is that the mouse is very light. It does come with weights, but even after inserting them into their places on the bottom of the mouse, it is still very light. But despite those two problems, I would recommend this mouse to anyone who games or edits sound or video.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just started playing this game but it seems pretty entertaining so far.  There are quite a few different things to do.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This time wasting app is an enjoyable pastime when you have nothing else to do. It will challenge your creativity by coming up with various ways to accomplish the goals. The thing that struck as soon as I started the app, was the catchy theme song. Try it, you'll like it.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my 14 year old niece and she loves it.  She is constantly watching the DVD and cannot get enough of it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it as a GTD system, for taking book notes and everything else. Great searching, tags and support of different documents images and all possible mobile devices.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best TV series I have watched.  I caught up on Season 1 & 2 on Amazon Video on Demand.  Now I'm watching Season 3.  Can't wait for Season 4.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Very exciting and fun to watch.  Lots of plot twists and turns.  Good character development.  I am enjoying the series.
0738711500|4.0|I have only just begun to work through the &#34;training&#34; that this product promises and so far it is interesting (I still don't know if I believe these things work) -- and found the following out:<br /><br />First -- beautiful artwork on the cards and each card is unique -- they are so attractive that I wonder where the originals are and if they might be up for sale as each one is simply beautiful but they have no appearant association with standard cards (no hearts, clubs, spades or diamonds). It is worth getting this deck of cards for this reason alone especially for the price.<br /><br />Next, you need to buy a few things to go with these cards based on the opening chapter that talks about how to  care and empower your cards -- aparently you need some kind of &#34;natural fiber&#34; cloth large enough to wrap the cards in and another cloth to serve as a layout cover as well as a piece of quartz crystal to aid in empowering the deck -- I am letting you know this so that you can make such purchases at the time of buying this training set.<br /><br />The only reason for giving this less than five stars is the lack of advice to aquire the additional items or the lack of encluding those items since they are ongoing &#34;requirements&#34; with the cards. You all have a good day now.
B000002GJH|4.0|Having already listened to \\"Hunger Strike\\" and \\"Say Hello to Heaven\\" many times on the radio, I went into Temple of the Dog thinking that the whole album would have the same alternative flavor. Instead, I discovered that this is something that would fit right in with either the blues or soul sections at the record store. The songs are all dirge-paced and manage to be both mournful and celebratory at the same time, which is appropriate given that the album is a tribute to the much too short life of Mother Love Bone's Adam Wood. If you have ever wondered why Chris Cornell is always on lists of the best male rock vocalists, this album is all the explanation you need. It is the best demonstration of his talent I have ever heard. The standout track is the 11-minute opus \\"Reach Down,\\" which is full of the kind of improvisation that is bound to appeal to the progressive rock fan like myself. Overall, this is a very good album, but not a great one: most of the songs are solid, but none left that much of a lasting impression. Still, I highly recommend this album to anyone who is nostalgic for when grunge was on top.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the most compelling series I have watched in a longtime.  I loved it.  Unfortunatelly I am now caught up and will have to wait for weekly installments.
B00009AOBI|4.0|It's a movie, just like the one I saw on tv.  What else can I say about a dvd to fill this minimum wording needed?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the Hunger Games and could not put it down.  I will read the  next two books. Captured my imagination.
1842171593|5.0|I recommend this product to anyone who is interested in a more scholarly treatise on the weapons of Rome from the Republic to the Empire. A little heavy going for history generalists but excellent.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|I have to admit something, I love case studies. When a software development book starts throwing out \\"examples\\" of the methodologies being discussed, I tend to get interested in the story. I start paying closer attention. If they're well-written, I get very interested. Generally, I find myself wanting more. Naturally, I don't get this - the book is a dry technical reference on software development practices and not a novel. The fiction interspersed within is meant to keep you interested.<br /><br />The Phoenix Project takes this idea to the somewhat strange conclusion. Instead of being an exploration of IT topics with fiction within it, this is a piece of fiction that is an exploration of IT topics. A particular IT topic, in this case - lean development and DevOps. For those not in the know - lean software development is an evolution of agile software development that attempts to take lessons learned from the factory line (especially Toyota and just-in-time management) and apply them to IT and development. Its been around a whilso; I recall attending a session at a conference about it at least five or seven years ago. DevOps is a much more recent concept that, I think, emphasizes a focus on all pieces of an application - not just the code, but its exeuting environment, its network, its process for being changed. Its a really new concept, and one st ill being explored (note that \\"The Visible Ops Handbook\\" is not actually a book, at this point).<br /><br />The book follows the \\"adventures\\" of Bill, a newly promoted head of IT for an ailing automotive parts/retail corporation. The company's IT department has a history of failing to meeting obligations and having a revolving door management. This is particularly problematic given that it is also responsible for delivering \\"Project Phoenix\\", a massive undertaking to revolutionize the company. It is not going well, and it is made clear to Bill that delivering Phoenix is vital to the future of his career. Bill himself seems like a nice guy, and is definitely the \\"reluctant hero\\" of this tale; he had no particular interest in advancing in his career and had to be cajoled by the CEO of the company.<br /><br />He quickly regrets this - the IT organization is an underfunded disaster, with failing infrastructure, absolutely no process or change management, and a single employee (Brent) who knows everything about everything. Bill's first day is spent running into a crisis involving the company's payroll, caused by the company's over-zealous head of IT security and leaving the company unable to print paychecks. It does not get better; Phoenix is quickly and clearly failing to meet a deadline pushed by a politicing SVP, whom has the power to push the CEO to demand its release on the unreasonable schedule of one week. No one working in the IT field will be surprised when this deadline proves a disaster, though in this case one of rather excessive scope. I will say at this point that it is clear the authors have been in one or more combinations of these disasters before - they write them vividly enough that I think anyone who has worked for a large IT organization will find themselves sympathizing with their plight and remembering past IT disasters of their own.<br /><br />Bill is mentored in his \\"quest\\" by Erik. A quirky potential board member with a history in the technology industry. Erik completely serves as the sagely master in this novel. Most of his lessons take place at a local factory, where he illustrates his points about the four kinds of work and how to deal with constraints and how to move work through the system. His quirky personality works extremely well - picturing him as the Yoda of the novel wouldn't be entirely far off.<br /><br />The book winds down to its conclusion through very interesting portrayals of corporate betrayals, triumphs, and even a character whom entirely changes their conception of their job and life. The end is, inevitably, triumphant - this probably wouldn't be an effective illustration of the principles the author wants to get across otherwise.<br /><br />As a piece of fiction, I'm a fan of this novel. It manages to make a dramatic, interesting story about a bunch of employees in a corporation learning about a new IT methodology. It, mostly, avoids stereotypes - the characters are well-defined and have actual motivations. Even the aforementioned Brent is presented reasonably, as a helpful person who has simply been around forever. He's a problem, but more in the way his job has developed than any particular maliciousness. The weakest characters here are probably John, the head of IT security, and Sarah, the villain of the piece. I get the impression that the authors have no particular respect for the way IT security runs at most orgs, and Sarah is mostly here to be a pushy, political executive. It works, for the story, mostly because the actual villain is the IT process - Sarah is simply there show the failings and stomp on them until they break. The other flaw is that the characters, especially Erik, are prone to exposition - this is probably unavoidable given the goals of the novel.<br /><br />In terms of this book's value as a work illustrating a new IT process, this is more mixed. They definitely explain all the points; I can't say I don't have an understanding of the four kinds of work at this point. The problem is that the book has limited value as the kind of reference guide that would be needed to put these thoughts into actual practice. This is one of the few novels I've ever read that could strongly benefit from an index. It could also strongly benefit from a companion volume that goes through all this in the more traditional manner. I suspect the \\"IT Ops Handbook\\" was meant to be that, but its impossible to say since that book does not yet exist.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book. Its both a good read with an interesting, if unusual, story to tell, and certainly capable of getting one to think about the right ways to approach IT management.
1451638450|5.0|My friends and I have been waiting for this story for over a decade, a story of Ivan. Bujold once again delivered a high quality story with all the frenetic energy and plot twists one expects in a Vorkosigan story. Highly recommended for a fun read.
B0095XPZBC|4.0|Originally airing from 1988 to 1989, the second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation was beset by challenges. A writer's strike crippled Hollywood between seasons and the show was almost cancelled as a result. The producers were able to get around the problem by re-tasking scripts from the aborted Star Trek: Phase II TV show from the 1970s, reducing the season order by four episodes and - in a fit of true desperation - dropping a clip show (the terrifyingly awful Shades of Grey, widely-acknowledged as the worst episode of the entire franchise) into the mix. They scraped through to produce a season that is a notable improvement over the first year, and definitely better than it has any right to be given the situation it was produced under.<br /><br />As with the first season, things get off to a bumpy start but improve later on. Fortunately, they improve a lot faster. The first two episodes, The Child (Troi gets pregnant with a rapidly-evolving alien thingamajig) and Where Silence Has Lease (the Enterprise gets stuck in a void in space where an alien superintelligence messes around with them just because that's how it rolls), are pretty bad but there is a quantum leap in improvement when Elementary, Dear Data comes on. Excellent performances and a strong script alleviate the somewhat ropey rules the show is establishing regarding the holodeck. Weaker episodes continue to roll in - The Outrageous Okona (slightly tepid conman comes on board), The Dauphin (Wesley Crusher romance episode...NO!), The Royale (crew encounter weird hotel IN SPACE) and Up the Long Ladder (outrageous Irish stereotyping) should all be burned - but there's also a better sense of the characters getting their own voices and characterisation becoming more consistent.<br /><br />More to the point, the season gives us a larger number of very good episodes compared to the first. A Matter of Honour is terrific fun, establishing Riker as the first officer of a Kling Bird of Prey during an officer exchange programme. Jonathan Frakes - whose acting powers have now been radically enhanced by The Beard - steps up his game a lot. Contagion is a very dumb episode about computer viruses, but as an action romp it's very entertaining (similar to The Arsenal of Freedom in Season 1, but better). Peak Performance from later in the season is in a similar vein. Time Squared is a creepy episode about time loops and features some disturbing ideas and a doom-laden atmosphere, though some questionable writing for Picard prevents it from fulfilling its full promise. The Emissary is an important episode for Worf and the progression of his character arc and is very solid.<br /><br />More impressively, this season gives us the first two hands-down, no-questions, absolute 'classic' episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. First up is The Measure of a Man, written by Melinda Snodgrass (best-known as the co-editor of the Wild Cards superhero books series). The episode is an examination of whether Data is a sentient being or not, and features some terrific acting from Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Jonathan Frakes. It's a morality play, the sort of thing that Trek can make tedious if it mishandles it, but here the team do an exemplary job of exploring the issues and turning them into a riveting hour of television (and it is an hour, as the Blu-Ray set features the hitherto-unseen 60-minute cut of the episode before it was trimmed down to the normal 44 minutes).<br /><br />Even more impressive is Q Who? This episode is notable for introducing the Borg, but it's also a masterclass in pacing, music (the score is incredibly ominous), exposition without getting leaden (the hints to the past antagonism between Guinan and Q are played just right), tension, action and a genuinely surprising ending: arguably the only time on ST:TNG that the crew 'lose' the struggle of the episode and only barely survive. It's also the one and only time that Q is effectively used as a dramatically intensecharacter. His other appearances either misfire or are played for comedy. Here we see John De Lancie at his absolute best, particularly in the scene where he pitifully tells Picard what is happening is no illusion after eighteen Enterprise crewmembers are killed by the Borg. The climactic scene where Picard begs Q to save them before they are all slaughtered is handled pitch-perfectly by Patrick Stewart (who was genuinely troubled by the episode's message that the Enterprise crew can't win all the time) as well.<br /><br />Whilst Season 2 will never be remembered as the best season of the show, it does feature two of its finest hours and a whole host of other, very solid episodes. The cast turn in excellent performances, particularly Diana Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski in her own season on the show (replacing Gates McFadden as Dr. Crusher, who was sacked for criticising the show's sexist scripts in the first season; internal and fan pressure resulted in her reinstatement for Season 3). It's a shame we didn't get to see Pulaski again, as the evolution of her character arc and the development of her relationships with Worf and Data were very well-handled over the course of the season.<br /><br />As with the first season, the restoration job has done a pretty good job. However, a different team was used for the second season and there is the sense that a few corners were cut. The redone effects aren't quite as well-handled as in the first season (particularly noticeable in Q Who?, though the original version of the episode had a few iffy effects issues as well, so perhaps it was unsalvageable) and the new team have only cleaned up the planets that the Enterprise orbits, rather than replacing them with fully-convincing 3D spheres. Whilst the improvements are still light-years beyond what people might be expecting, they're not quite as jaw-dropping as the job that was done on Season 1. This is made up for a bit by the other extras, which are impressive. The highlight is a lengthy roundtable discussion between the entire cast about the show and what it meant for their careers and legacies, although the ongoing 'history of the series' documentary is also excellent. The original DVD extras are also included, though again only in standard definition.<br /><br />The second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (****) sees the show improving by leaps and bounds over the weaker first year. It is available now on Blu-Ray in the UK and USA. The third season - often regarded as the show's finest season - will be released in April.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I did a lot of research and decided to try this as it seemed a great buy for the price. I coupled it with a Corsair Hydro H100 liquid (no maintenance) cooler. I have it overclocked to 4.6/5.2GHz and never have an issue. I use AIDA64 to monitor component temps and haven't seen my CPU temp (overall or individual core) go over 70C. I have stress tested using multiple threaded archiving and various games, pegging the CPU at 100% for 30 minutes or more steady at 5.2GHz Boost. I can't get the temp over about 65C.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|The reason I give it 4 stars is there is no way to aim smoothly like the original ps3 controller. It is definitely comfortable but I play black ops 2 mostly on ps3 so I'm just glad I only spent 35 bucks for this controller! Don't buy if you plan on using it for fast paced fps online! I hardly ever do reviews but need to let people know about this problem
B000OLTBL4|5.0|Great movie for family night.  Someone had told me about the book.  This movie is so good I'm wondering why they have not made more as there are more then just the one book?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting I look toward to every bee coarse and I love spending the coins on upgrades
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show is a hit in our house!! Everyone gathers around the tv to watch it and then we make fun of my little bro for being a chemist!!!
1451695195|5.0|Since retirement I have begun exploring NDE & spirituality. This is a compelling story that intellectually is convincing to me that there is a world beyond death. The author is quite a wordsmith. The story of his journey just flows gracefully & smoothly. I would certainly recommend it to those of a skeptical nature or scientific frame of mind/thinking.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great and im starting to love the whole world tour thing...i am actually starting to become addicted
B008ASGP3U|5.0|This is the latest Inspector Rebus novel. Ian Rankin continues to produce the most entertaining police procedural about Scotland. You'll find an interesting aspect when the words of a song are misheard by Rebus which explains the books title.Rebus is again confronting his nemesis Cafferty along with other miscreants.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|During installation this software wants full and complete access to your device. Why should a game need to know your contacts, your phone status and similar information?  It smells like malware - accessing your personal information  and demanding total control of your connectivity without user control over your phone then what else can it be?  Is it going to be sitting in the background consuming my data and text messaging units?  Cute game, but at what price?
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just one word to describe it: GREAT. I spend at least one hour a day getting useful household info, beauty tips, fashion styles and a lot more.
B007SGM084|5.0|Christian and Ana's discoveries are many.  Defiitely mature content. Hopefully there will be more in this series ... what about Taylor and Gail?
B004EBZX6W|4.0|App works fine.  Found all my neighborhood wifis but Wifi Connecter (the way they spell it)  would not work. After 5 downloads it still failed to install on my Kindle Fire.
B000QCQ8Y4|2.0|I have so many friends who LOVE the Reacher novels by Lee Child that I finally got one. Oy. I read to within the last 100 pages and just gave up! First of all, Reacher sounds like he smells!!!! Yuck. The writing was WAY too detailed and too much description. Too implausible. Reacher walks down Sunset Blvd in LA and sees his friend in Denny's? REALLY? Has Child ever actually BEEN to L.A.? Give me a break. There was a lot of poor grammar and someone needs to find out more about guns. My first and last Reacher novel.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I didn't want to spend the time skimming through the discs to make sure they all worked so I returned it (saw a lot of negative customer reviews)
B0049VZ222|1.0|This series didn't grab me. The main character is dim witted and frustrating to watch! I love the &#34;idea&#34; of the show, but it wasn't what I was hoping for.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I love Ellen and reading her book just makes me laugh more than I could think a book possible! it is definitely worth the buy, this book I'd an excellent read.
0545265355|5.0|My daughter won't stop reading these! She has read the set three times through and just keeps rereading them. She's coming up with ideas of other books the author should right based on the storyline of the first three. Definitely keepers in our library!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I have only seen the pilot but loved it! I have adored Kevin Bacon since footloose and this kind of show is my thing! If you like clever,creepy,suspense you'll love this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|the acting as well as the writing is superb.<br />IT is almost addictive.  Each episode makes you curious about the next one
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Teenagers are buying this trash, and it's nothing but sexual rubbish.<br />If we allow our kids to read this we are as sick as the author and the publisher.<br />God help the next generation.
0446580848|5.0|This book was a Christmas gift for my son. He enjoyed reading the book. The book arrived on time and was packaged well.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|It met all of my expectations! This is a very attractive case and the feel of it is nice as well.
141659521X|5.0|I purchased this book for my son for Christmas. I understand it was a good read. The book came well packaged.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I heard about this show on a podcast I enjoy.  Gave it a try.  You have to give it the through the 2nd episode.  That's l it took for me.  What a great story.  A little upset on how the 3rd season ended, but I think that is the sign of a great show.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Love J.J. Abrams and this show. Season 1 got me hooked so hard until season 4, which IMO was a big disappointment. Up until then it's a wild ride with lots of unpredictable happenings and unforgettable main characters. Had to try out LOST after watching this show, which (needless to say) has been another whirlwind of an adventure.<br /><br />For anyone who loves a good semi-realistic sci-fi thriller, this show is for you!
B009GEDP26|5.0|Castle is a nice way to relax in the evening.  The show is somewhat formulaic, but has some nice acting and some good scripts.  Has good character development and a good supporting group of actors.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is excellent! It is extremely inspirational and is a great book for anyone who has any doubts about heaven to read.  I really loved it.
0979019710|5.0|I am a new Miracle Morning-er and can't believe how amazing it is! I have not been this happy in years. And as many have already said, I didn't even realize how \\"just okay\\" my life was up until I saw how much better it could be!<br />I found two awesome accountability partners through the Miracle Morning Facebook page, and intend to start a group of Miracle Morning people through meetup.com to get like-minded people in my community together to support each other and LOVE LIFE!<br />The Miracle Morning has made me actually listen to clichés such as \\"life is too short for that\\" or \\"the only time we have is now\\".  THEY ARE SO TRUE :D I highly, highly - *reaches up on tiptoes* - highly recommend this book.<br />Cheers!!!<br />Taylor
B00004XQ83|5.0|Great CD, good price, shipped quickly. Wonderful CD with lovely selection of songs which a lot of us grew up with in the South, and find it refreshing to find them collected in this CD..........I may just listen to it again now.....Thanks!
B009AMANBA|3.0|I expected to see his life story not an analysis of slavery as the entire focus of the film > Hal Holbrook's Lincoln was a more thoroughly presented character which had more time with true archaic language from the time period. Watch the last episode of Holbrooks Lincoln in which he truly captured the Lincoln of the final days in demeanor and \\"look.\\" Lewis' Lincoln looked too young. If you want to see a truly great performance watch the episode \\"Crossing Fox River\\" between Holbrook and Beulah Bondi. Very powerful. Very emotional. Spielberg should've bypassed the assassination portions for a part two > too rushed with little or no detail about the assas. events, death of Booth and trial. Don't watch \\"The Conspirators.\\" It's terrible and it treats the prosecutors of Surratt as \\"rushing to judgment jerks\\" (liberal philosophy interjected).  She was involved in Lincolns death there was no doubt...the book is accurate, the Redford film is manure. One reviewer stated the simplicity of not seeing the assasination was commendable > Holbrooks Lincoln captured that beautifully with no assasination or aftermath seen on film.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Captivating and holds your attention. Can't put it down. Very good book. Must read. Great series. On to the next one.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Love this album. Hard to pick just one favorite. &#60;3  &#60;3  &#60;3  &#60;3  &#60;3  &#60;3  &#60;3  &#60;3  &#60;3  &#60;3  &#60;3
B004LROUNG|2.0|I've read Grisham's Client and Firm and enjoyed them. Was expecting something similar and was disappointed. The plot doesn't move until 65% of the book is through
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|Has England ever produced a greater rock guitarist than Richard Thompson? I reckon nobody from these shores has ever matched the lyrical beauty, ebb and flow that Thompson extracts from the electric guitar. Even as a teenager Thompson was already in the premier league  [google \\"Bouton Rouge sessions Reno Nevada\\" and move up to 7'00\\" to watch an incredible clip - or check out his phrasing on 'Who Knows Where The Time Goes' or the solo on 'Autopsy' from 'Unhalfbricking'].<br /><br />So I still can't help but see RT as a guitarist first/foremost and a songwriter second - although that probably does him an injustice now, nearly 45 years on from 'Unhalfbricking'. This CD is a real return to form (I didn't much care for 'Dream Attic') and some of these songs are up there with the very best he has written - the picks being 'Stuck On The Treadmill', 'My Enemy', 'Straight And Narrow' and 'The Snow Goose'. There are only two or three slightly weaker tracks (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) but of course there's still some great guitar licks and passages in addition to superb backing throughout from the A-list session musicians Thompson assembled to record with him in Nashville.<br /><br />Thanks Richard for restoring my flagging belief in new British music following (in my opinion) an all-time-low year of dross releases in 2012. This is a highly accomplished release that grows on me more with each listen. Warmly recommended.ecommended.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I really wasn't a big Katy Perry fan, the age gap probably had something to do with it, but I do have a couple of her songs on my iPod. I'll be honest, I just couldn't find anything else I wanted to watch so I streamed this movie, which is way more like a documentary than a movie, and was amazingly surprised at how much I enjoyed watching it. It's not often we get such an insiders look into the lives of celebrities, but you sure do in this. I have to admit that it was absolutely heart breaking to watch her marriage crumble, and her crumble with it. She is brave, the way she handled that, going on to do her show in the midst of a personal crisis. I have a lot of respect for her, way more than before, and I highly recommend this movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a very pleasant departure from \\"James Bond\\".  LIFE IS REALLY A JOURNEY.  I have a stepson who most like has mild schizophrenia, environmentally and drug induced.  Living with and coping with mental illness is a challenge not only for the \\"diseased\\" but also those around them.  this is a good read, worth the time.  I don't know how it could be transformed into film but if anyone can Deniro and Cooper are up to the task.
B005Q1W10A|2.0|The whole picture doesn't appear on the tv screen.  The subtitles are only partly visible, part on one side of the screen and part on the other side.  The container of the DVD's arrived broken altho the discs weren't damaged.
B007WFTFG6|3.0|The app didn't keep my children's attention very well or very long. There are a lot of choices for scenes to color but its very blah.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book to see what all the hype was about and I still don't get it.  I thought it was a poorly written piece of garbage. The story was horrible and I found it very degrading toward women. If you just want to read it for the sec scenes there is lots of that,  but no substance.
B009O07NMA|5.0|In my opinion...every song on this record is a hit. I think it may be the favorite album Ive purchased in a long time. I hope these guys stick around as a group and continue to make music for Country radio for a long time. Way to go guys! Congratulations on a fantastic album!!!!!!!
B007EC27QM|5.0|LOVE THIS!! MAKES COUNTING MONEY INTO SECTIONS EASY AND IF YOU NEED TO SEE WHAT ONES YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE YOU JUST TAP THE BOTTOM OF THE BLUE SCREEN AND IT SHOWS YOUR HISTORY.
1616550414|5.0|There are no words to describe this book that do it justice. Beautiful concept art, tons of information you wouldn't know from just the games, and even a bonus Prequel comic to Skyward Sword; The book truly has it all. The illustrations are in beautiful high color quality, the book is a nice, sturdy, hard cover with a gorgeous embossed design on the cover, and the amount of information packed in it is great. I highly recommend it.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|I am a huge fan of Andrea Bocelli and this CD is in line with the greatness of all his other work. It is absolutely wonderful.
1439153663|3.0|I bought this book for our book club. It is a great story, but very hard to read,<br />the events described in this book will bring tears to even the most hard<br />hearted reader.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|Some of the songs I was familiar with and were favorites, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the entire album. There is a great variety of music and most of the songs really can get you going in the morning. Would be great for workouts too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a really fun game. The graphics are good. It does not crash. It is  like temple run in the sense that you are running from a villain.
B000BKJ78K|5.0|This was a gift for a Star Wars fan.He was waiting, waiting for it to come out for all the extras included in the set.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very small number showing percentage of charge on bottom status line.  Accurate to ones digit, agrees with Galaxy Note 10.1 charged number, but on screen all the time.<br />Very nice addition.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|A sad sudden ending to an excellent series, one of my favorites. (Spoiler alert!) Hard to watch some main characters die off but I guess Fillion just did it out of frustration at the time so they couldn't continue it if they wanted.
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|Little boring just watching one person doing the exercise. No warm up or cool down exercises. Doesn't give much time between exercises, for &#34;set up&#34;, unless you pause it (which you have to do quickly). You do feel like you exercised when you are done, though.
0374533571|5.0|I went out on a whim when I purchased this book last night at Barnes and Noble (I had a 20% off coupon so I figured, why not put it to good use?) but it turned into me reading this book in one sitting. Plain and simple: it is amazing. I sympathized with Pat and connected on a level that made me feel as though I wasn't a reader, but was actually experiencing everything Pat endured (and even did the Eagles chant though I am far from a fan). Quick did a remarkable job with the characters in this novel as each and every person made a difference to the story's protagonist. The last chapter in the story struck me in particular as the perfect ending to Pat's twisted life. I definitely recommend this book to anyone going through a tough time in their lives or even anyone who just wishes for a captivating read.
1592402038|4.0|I really needed a punctuation review for some creative writing I was doing in my grad program. This worked out perfectly for what I needed. It was sharp, funny, easy to read and easy to digest. I highly recommend this book<br />As it was highly recommended to me as well.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|the cost is 5.99 once you get as far as you can for free. i did pay because i was enjoying it. once i payed the money it only took my 10 more minutes to get to end of it. i feel that is too short of a game. it was fun. just really not worth it. i guess it be mre worth it for 2.99
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show just draws you from the very beginning. I love that Amazon has it. I don't have cable but I can buy the episode for $1.99 the day after it airs which is wonderful. I can't wait to see how they end season 3 and I can't wait for season 4
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|It has been a while since I saw a great movie... thank you Moneyball for resetting that counter!!! Highly recommend this to anyone whether you appreciate the sport of baseball or not.
B0057O6IDW|4.0|This movie is nowhere near the masterpiece of Zombie 2 and City of the Living Dead but still has some ghastly Fulci gore scenes which is pretty much the only reason i bought this one. The BR transfer looks good.
B009AMALGM|4.0|Haven't watched it yet, but I'm sure it will be as good as the previous ones.  Look forward to watching it soon!!
B001LMT50W|5.0|You can't go wrong with Coldplay. This album's great. Glad I got this version instead of the regular Viva La Vida version. The extra songs complement the rest of the album really well. Love it.
B0090SI42Y|3.0|\\"We had decided to leave this place, but it turns out that the universe had other plans.\\" When a legend of a golden treasure is heard of a group of various warriors come to a village. When an evil faction looks to take control it is up to the local blacksmith (RZA) and a rogue British soldier (Crowe) to stop them and protect the village. I have to admit that I am not a huge fan of movies like this. I have never really been into martial arts type movies although I have seen some really good ones. That said, while not being all that amazing of a movie itself this one was super entertaining and had some interesting fight sequences that I really enjoyed. The movie is way over the top and unbelievable, but it fit in this movie. If you are looking for an Oscar worthy type martial arts movie then I recommend 13 Assassins or War Of Arrows. This movie is really just visually fun and the fighting is entertaining, which is good sometimes. I liked it more then I expected. Overall, better then anticipated, martial arts fans may really like this. I say B.
B008PWN0I4|5.0|This product is excellent. It met all my expectations and has certainly lived up to the quality that I was looking for.
B00A2H9LK6|3.0|\\"Everyone has a different nightmare in Silent Hill, I am theirs.\\" Heather Mason (Clemens) has been plagued by nightmares ever since she was little. Her and her father (Bean) constantly are on the move trying to find a way to help her. One day when Heather is at school her father is taken and the only thing left are the words Silent Hill. Heather must now venture into her nightmare in order to get him out. It might just be that I'm older but movies like this don't tend to scare me at all. When the goal is to just out gore the previous scene it really has an impact on the movie. I knew going in that this wasn't gonna be an amazing movie anyway and the actual story wasn't really that bad but when mixed with the armless zombie things and gallons of blood it really is more of a distraction then anything. Again though it may be because I'm too old. Younger fans of this stuff may enjoy it, I did not. Overall, OK story line but tried to be Saw. I give it a C+.
B000025GZC|1.0|They claimed that it was the 1993 version of the album but it was not. It very clearly stated on the back that it was the 1997 version. This is important because the 1993 version had a superior mastering job, one that had a much better dynamic range than the 1997 version while being equivalent in all other areas.<br /><br />Do not trust their product descriptions! They will fraudulently claim it is a rarer product than it actually is and thus charge more for it. They should be banned from the Amazon Marketplace for this abhorrent behavior.<br /><br />I have attempted to return the product and am still trying to sort everything out.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This headset was a gift to my grandson for a good report card.  they have brought him hours of gaming pleasure.  This set makes you feel like you are in the room with your opponent, the clarity and comfort are not matched by any other set
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Best description of NDEs that I have ever read. His experience is like none other and stands alone for the incredible images of his NDE. Entire story and the ramifications of his insight are life changing. Don't miss this one.Thank you Dr Alexander for sharing.
1604680547|5.0|I am very well pleased with this book. It has the variety I wanted & easy to understand. Wish I had bought it sooner.
B009AMALLM|2.0|I really like the PA Trilogy, especially 1 and 3.<br />This one...not so much.<br />It provided zero substance to the ongoing story and it wasn't even scary.<br />At some parts, I was hoping that someone would get killed in the movie.<br /><br />Another very distracting thing was the teenagers.<br />It may be just me getting old but the teens cursed waaaay to much, to the point that it was a distraction in the movie.<br /><br />By now we know the formula, night falls, scary low frequency sound, and then a boom (sometimes followed by a s scream).<br /><br />If I were you, I would stop with 3....I wish I did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so perfect after all it's the only thing that I can do it for a while now I'm playing with it

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am addicted to this game it gives you an adrinlin rush and its easy to play but it's a step up from temple run if you want something harder!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 7 year old turned me on to this game about a month ago. I have been playing it every day since. I don't care how old you are, this game is excellent. Beware though....it's very addictive!!!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Lavish sets and costumes. Very authentic feel to it. I love it. Many hours of enjoyment, excitement, sex, be headings and fun.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this show.  We didn't really hear about it until recently so we bought Season 1 and Season 2.  I just ordered and received Season 3 because we were too far behind to watch it on TV.  Great show and highly recommend.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Gotta love amazon mp3, new taylor swift for like $5 ok. I don't listen to it as much as her last album, and there aren't as many songs that i can remember, or name. The stories aren't as good. But it's a good enough followup
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an amazing book like the other books, It's but this one really stood out. It's so thrilling and epic and your always on the edge of your seat. When you become attached to something that does not last very long gets you excited for the rest of this book. You not just get attached to the characters, you become attached with the book itself and so it stinks when it's over. I would highly recommend this book to any one over the age of 11. lots of great characters that died in this book, and to think of those people and the people that katniss has already lots is depressing, to see where she was then as a poor girl in district twelve with no one but her mom and prim, to some one who has accomplished so many things. Just think back to when Gale and katniss were hunting the day of the reaping. They thought everything was gonna be normal and like any other reaping. B<br />ut katniss was so wrong
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a wonderfully intriguing book.  It kept me wanting to sit and read which is not easy for me.  I am now in the second of the series, and I want to lock myself away and read.
B002RI90WM|5.0|perfectly written...<br /><br />I laughed, I cried, I got up several times to give my dogs a hug and silently thank them for being there for me when bad stuff has happened in my life. This book perfectly captures the love and support our furry friends give us without every actually having to say a word.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I waited many months for this 50th anniversary reissue to finally become available in November 2012 and it was totally worth it.<br /><br />Another commenter mentioned that there's no substitute for seeing the original 70mm print on the big screen, but after seeing this on our 60\\" plasma TV, I've got to think that this immaculate, dust and grain-free restoration looks better than any film print you were likely to encounter at your local theater in the 1960's.<br /><br />And I was TOTALLY stoked to get the 2-disc Blu-ray set with lots of great Extra Features for only fifteen bucks!!  The reminiscences with Peter O'Toole about the production and the vintage stills are almost worth the price on their own.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book  was so good. I could not put it down over the past couple days. Definitely get this!! :)
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Intimate look at the lives of our President's after they leave office.  Good to know that this 'club' exists and that for the most part, we have the benefit of their knowledge long after they have left the White House.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|A little shaky in the beginning, but, wow!  What a great read!!  Every woman should read this trilogy, especially if you want to put spark back into your relationship!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I took a shot in the dark and bought this book, and I'm so glad I did! Wonderfully written and suspenseful
0345803485|3.0|Okay, so I started to read the paperback copy of this book and only got to the part where Ana is interviewing Grey.  I quit reading it because I felt like I was reading the diary of a secretive, female, girl in her early teens and I just felt like it wasn't my kind of book.  I wanted to forget about it, but I keep hearing references to the book by so many people in so many places so, naturally, I really wanted to know what all this fuss was about.  I picked up the audio version of this book since I have about an hour commute to and from work each day so this would allow me optimal time to listen to the book.  Get ready to be slapped with repeated words and expressions and when I say repeated, I mean each word or expression is repeated over and over and over five thousand times over and gets very annoying.  I find myself thinking, \\"doesn't the author know any other words?\\"  I haven't finished the whole thing yet, but I do have to say that I do like the storyline.  It has a fun and witty platform and actually gives pretty good insight into how a girl's brain really works.  I'd definitely recommend this book to any guys who want to know how and why girls play their mind games with men they are interested in giving them all kinds of false impressions and the playing hard to get and the not telling a guy they like him and acting like they don't like them, which I've always been so confused about why they do these things.  My biggest complaint is the words and vocabulary the author uses.  There is another reviewer on here that said it almost perfectly.  Anastasia Steele spends most of her time \\"flushing\\" and \\"blushing\\" which happens to be the two words extremely overused that you will definitely get tired of reading or hearing after the first few pages or tracks.  It seems like every other word in this book is, \\"flush\\", \\"blush\\" \\"crap\\", \\"double crap\\", and \\"oh crap\\".  Ana makes it clear at least a hundred different times that Grey is a control freak.  I don't understand whythe author feels she needs to repeat this over and over and over again.  This is one of the things that really irritates me about this book, but the number one thing that really bothers me is how every other sentence is Ana saying, \\"I flushed\\".  I am beyond sick of hearing this expression.  Even though it still feels like I am listening to a young girl's diary, it is not as mundane as having to read it.  I will definitely be happy when I am finished with this book and I am more than likely not going to be reading the sequels.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome you will enjoy it plus it has . Automatic updates for different places like countries and cities the game also functions great s o enjoy
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great game!  Works on a trip or in the park. Eliminates the need to carry around a chess set for play.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is a &quot;go&quot;. Meaning... its worth the download and keeping it on you Android device. Its convenient to use without having to see all the giba on the regular Ebay site.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I need reminders keeping all my appointments. I put a note on<br />my computer screen and away we go.  Notes are basic, but it does the job.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|From writing to acting to beautiful settings and period costumes, Downton Abbey has it all and more and delivers it with a bit of wit.  Even if you're the type that doesn't like period pieces, you won't be able to keep yourself from being drawn into the very real human stories and drama.  A definite must see.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Disappointed that the Kindle Fire HD doesn't have camera and video capability.  This will work, but you have to hold it backwards, and be very steady.  Not easy.
B009S33I68|5.0|A MUST for any Military Historian focusing on Vietnam. You may have seen the movie. The book deals with the first major conflict with American and North Vietnam regulars. The battle itself set the strategy for the entire war. On one side (American) the idea was that we would seek out and kill as many North Vietnamese (and Viet Cong) so they would cease fighting due to loss of life. The North Vietnamese, on the other hand, thought that as long as they could cause a high casualty rate, the American people would protest and cause an end to the war. They were right.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!! Subway Surfers is the perfect game to play while waiting for the train, bus, in the doctor's office, or any where else!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A good book from start to finish. Very disturbing read if you  have a teenage boy. I was shocked by the ending.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|these game would br good if it didn't do something that you told it to do and as you r charging it it messes up
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really loved the game! It was to really worth the three bucks!!! Great storyline awesome animation. I would suggest it. It was awesome.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Cant say enough. Twists turns and love.  Ive read.most of the Ny times best list and this is a favorite I may just. Read again. Stop looking for your next nook here..
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you love the BIg Bang Theory, season 5 is a must! I am half way through this series and it is greatness.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I'm sad that he was shot before I could meet and thank Mr Kyle, he's an American hero. God bless his family
B007THA4FI|4.0|At first I was sure JK Rowling had let me down. The book was so dark and full of filthy language.  It was like a bad accident; you didn't want to look but couldn't stop yourself from wanting to know what happened. I kept reading in spite of my disgust and surprisingly the book was a good read. It portrayed the negative  aspects of humanity. At first I thought; are British really this way??  But then I recognized that all humans have those elements.  It just depends on our choices and circumstances.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This is the 1st book in a series, and it is better than the second one in my opinion.  A very good read and hard to put down
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Possibly a little slow, but overall a good movie. Deep issues involved and taking responsibility. Densel awesome actor... As usual great job in this movie
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much and it was very hard to put down once i got into the story
B001FB4VXU|2.0|I bought this because I had a few of the season 2 episodes but not all. So the DVD casing has come apart, which means that I can't properly close the DVD case. Something I'm frustrated about, and am not willing to spend an outrageous amount to have fixed, its to small of an issue to be fixed. This is something minor, but I keep good care of my DVD's so the fact that how they were handled in the mail means that they are broken in minor areas which is something I couldn't control is something I don't like. I like things to look asethically pleasing so the fact that the plastic casing has come apart, and that the closure of the DVD is broken so it doesn't automatically closes erks me. Lesson learned.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Stupid movie. I don't understand why Rob Pattinson would lower himself to this kind of garbage.<br />This is the first time I used Amazon to rent a movie and I was pleased with the rental just not pleased with the movie itself.
145210655X|5.0|Bought this for my sisters baby registry. It is not a childrens book, but a coffee table book. We had to buy a second one for ourselves! It is just too cute. The illustrations are adorable and exactaly what life would have been like for Luke with Darth Daddy around.
0525478817|5.0|wonderfull book, l cried i laughed and i loved it, recommend it to teens, but adults can enjoy it too
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great!!<br />No problems whatsoever, and it came much earlier than I had expected that it would. Very happy customer
0439023491|4.0|very exciting. a four because i dont think grown ups would like it, but all the way in for teens
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Great movie! This movie is full of philosophy and since philosophy is one of my interests, I was awed by its content.
0803738412|5.0|We are great fans of Julia Donaldson, having been completely hooked by the Gruffalo. This does not disappoint - beautiful meter in the language, with a compelling story. Like many of her books the message is that even the  small, and apparently weaker can save the day if only they use their brains. Here it is the generosity of the witch that ultimately saves her from the dragon. So nice. My 2 year old loves it, and we really enjoy reading it. (especially with a dragon hand puppet for use when it comes to eat the witch - a hit every time.) A good thing with the number of times it is requested! 6 months and still going strong, now.

0763644765|5.0|I was having a hard time finding an ungendered potty book, and we tried multiple. This one really gets the prize, a smiling baby that is easy for my daughter to identify with, and good language that she can read along with. I particularly like the inclusion of what the kitty and the doggy do (although now taking the dog for a walk includes very extended discussions of how he goes &#34;pee pee potty&#34;....) After 4 months, I now find her (at two) on the potty by herself reading the book - the pictures and accessible language are great.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|American pies are always funny stiffler is always funny. I would like to see a spin off with him as main character
B004ODLUGM|5.0|The story is fantastic, and the production values amazing - it is a truly enchanting movie. 30 minutes is just right for my toddler, and I have discovered more than one of my adult visitors completely engrossed by it. This is a very important quality is something your little one is going to want to watch over and over again!
1416550534|5.0|Enjoyed this book.  Kept my interest all the way to the end.  Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading.

0316224588|5.0|Rebus is eally the gold standard for modern detectives. It has been a while since he has been featured in a book, and one forgets the subtle way Rankin paints his subject. There are many copycats of the maverick cop, but most paint him too vividly. Rankin is subtle, and Rebus is alive because of it.  This book is another Rankin treasure.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like it I had one problem but its fun like instead of a couple of those monkeys chasing you its one big one I recamend it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downtown Abbey is by far the best historical series that I have ever seen. The show continues to get better every season.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br /><br />I have been a fan of Downton Abbey since the first episode transported me to another time and place.  I have watched with awe the brilliant attention to detail and wonderful actor/actresses and writing propel this show to be a continued hit not only in England but around the world.  I can't wait for Series 4.  Sure,  some things in 3 made me sad....I really wish the actor and actress who chose a different path would have stayed on at Downton, I for the life of me can't fathom why you would leave such a popular show that is such an international hit but to each his or her own.  I think it was handled as well as could be given the circumstances...I would certainly rather have Matthew die than him and Mary \\"separate\\" due to not getting along or some such nonsense and \\"easy out\\".  Either way, I think anyone with any taste for quality dramatic series would not just enjoy this series, they will adore it!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Bossypants was an interesting read and made me admire Tina Fey even more. It was interesting to learn about her background with her style and wit painting the picture. She is as funny, down to earth and beautiful as I imagined.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this now and then when I can't sleep. I love listening to the rain and little birds. It reminds me of home.<br /><br />Great for mixing sounds and noise levels. It's very easy to customize a set of sounds for yourself.
B0084IT59C|5.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is my favorite book of all time.<br /><br />Pure comedic perfection. The dialogue is superb. I fell in love with Ignatius and at the same time I was repulsed by his every move. All of the characters are entertaining.
B004Y042N8|3.0|I like this game, but every time I turn it off, I get sent back to the same puzzle. Like I'll do it and then five more after it, turn off the game, and it goes right back to this one puzzle.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i love this cant stop playing it and wanting to buy him cloths and new things and see how far i can go
B005LAIH2W|5.0|If you love action, you'll love this film, great story line and overall score.  You'll love it, I loved the special effects.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|i love the living dead...and you can get the shows the day after they air on tv :) :) :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|me and the kids love this and play it everywhere waiting for our food while i'm shopping its a must have to keep everyone busy
B000BNI99K|5.0|Really enjoyed his selection of songs. Was never a fan before but<br />enjoy the wonderful arrangments and his renditions.  It's a winner.
B0086700CM|5.0|got my sister into it she loves this to my kids not so much goes to fast for them but i like it trying to run for my life and getting money
B0091REZMW|1.0|It has not synced to my Facebook version. I'm having to start all over again! I'd gotten very far along in the game.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This is a great documentary film that does not go far enough in showing the reality of the gas patch.  When is the follow-up coming? The 4-corners region of the US could provide impacts for several films such as this.  This area has long been a &#34;national sacrifice area&#34;.  Wonderful work, Josh Fox.  Keep it up.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the subway sufer! It is fun,it was free and I love it.  It is the  only game that I play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun. You can even connect with facebook friends. Overall its a really fun game with doting trains to being chased by the guard and his mutt
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game gives you alot of hints if you keep hintting the hint button. So this game can be a challenge if you opt to look around instead of doing that. While i liked it okay I gave it four stars because it wasnt as good as a previous game I had purchased ( Mystery case files: Return to Ravenhearst )
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great way to pass some time. It is a little bit of mindless entertainment and a lot of fun!!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|It took forever to find this app.  I almost gave up.  Then it was hard to get it to install.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|BBC television... almost a guarantee of excellence. Wake up U.S.A.; we need some superior programs!!! Rich, well written, and excellent character development, however, very disappointed by episodes 8 and 9. The story line for Thomas Barrow and those characters surrounding him was disjointed, very contrived and not a historically believable response. Why have the writers given in to modern views on this topic? Have they lost their focus?  Hope to see the historical intergrity return to season 4 and a purer representation of the values of this time period.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app its so so so so so so so so so so so so so so fun PS I think Dean is kind of cute
B00683JK9K|2.0|This is an okay app, but it is difficult to move the pieces around.  It was more frustrating than fun or relaxing.
1475143389|4.0|I found this book to be very informative and interesting. The author usually gives evidence, with reference to research which has been carried out by various reliable studies, for his training schedules and his eating plans.I for one did not realize the importance of nutrition in getting the results you want. The author is also very willing, (as others have previously noted) to answer or give his opinion on any other queries one may have concerning the subject.
B0037VNX44|1.0|What a total crap show.  This could have been some high school kids senior project, and if it were, they would<br />have  never gotten in to college.
B003V1WTMM|2.0|I LOVED THE FIRST 2 BOOKS BUT THIS IS TO REPITATIVE. TOO LONG TO GET TO THE POINT  I W LL TRY TO FINISH IT THO
B0041KKYD8|5.0|Awesome movie, keeps you on the edge of your seat! I highly recommend this movie, clean before you put in the DVD player it skipped a lot at first.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great to see such a good movie in 3D, nice depth, felt as if we were actually there.  I recommend this DVD
B005LAIHCM|3.0|This movie was ok. Jennifer Lawrence brought this movie to life. The ending wasn't as great as I had hoped. This would be a great movie to rent rather than buy in my opinion.
B000W15AQ6|5.0|This is a great CD if you like a lot of eminem's older music. It's a mix of all of his music and is really great to listen to.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As a social worker, I have always wondered what goes on in the mind of a batterer when the victim finally leaves him. Nicholas sparks answered that question. Phenomenal book.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love this show!! Looks like season 2 is going to be great!! Looking forward to the rest of the season.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|NOT SURE IF IT IS WORKING OR NOT. NOT SURE IF IT IS WORKING OR NOT NOT SURE IF IT IS WORKING OR NOT NOT SURE IF IT IS WORKING OR NOT NOT SURE IF IT IS WORKING OR NOT
B006H3MJ7G|4.0|This was a great cd, loved many of the songs on there. Only gave 4 stars because there were a few songs I didn't like.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban always has a way of keeping his music fresh and new and this album is no exception.  I bought it for a family member and downloaded my own copy on iTunes - so well done!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun to play and very addicting. Can play for a long time and never be bored. I like the option of going back or restarting game.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh Groban always has a way of keeping his music fresh and new, and this album is no exception.  Great purchase!
B005LAII12|5.0|Good movie.  Family Guy type of humor, if you are a fan of the tv show you'll love this movie.
0060736267|5.0|Marvelous read, loved by the entire book club, all ages couldn't put it down.  You really felt the pain of the times.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was unsure if I would like this series, but my fiance insisted.  Great!  The quality was fantastic too!  We watched this on our IPad Mini and it was amazing.
0807014273|5.0|Viktor Frankl is inspiring, and this is my favorite book he wrote. It gives so much perspective and meaning to anyone's life. It's applicable to all. Great read!
0312330863|5.0|Will always look for his books in a store.  Have read many of his.  This one tops them all.  Have to laugh hardy at some of his stories
B009FB3XTA|3.0|I thought the music was very fitting in the movie, but it isn't as great to listen to when not watching the movie. I enjoyed the previous CD's more.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a story of heroism, concern for fellow man, chivalry and a great friendship.  Several authors/journalists have recounted this story.
B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|I know it is a classic, but it is a hard read now a days. Has a very sweet story though.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have only had this app on my Kindle for less than 24 hours; however, I use this app on my iPhone and benefit from it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app - wherever I go, I have the word of God with me. It has many translations so you can look at the ESV, NIV, NASB, etc. As well as language options, reading plans and the ability to highlight.
B0057VDGNK|4.0|When my girlfriend and I watched this movie we knew the music was awesome, sadly there were only a few songs in the conventional manner.  Most of the tracks were sound effects and simple rhythms.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|It's a great book of magic - well written. I love that you can rent it from the kindle store like a library.
B007L6VR12|5.0|At the time of ordering this video, the price was by far lower than that at either Wal-mart, target, or best buy.  Great movie!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Absolutely loved this book ! Charlie is a quirky and in depth character and the entire book keeps you guessing, highly recommend this book for teenagers AND adults, because everyone could use a change in perspective! Loved it.
B000683VI4|4.0|It was a really good movie, the story was really beautiful, as someone who has worked in an aged care facility I guess i seen it more personally than some, I shed a few tears but it didn't leave me blubbering like a baby.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|fun time waster. requires real money eventually tho like all glue games. just view it with a $5 price tag and you'll have fun
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Best music from them ever! You can hear that &#34;you get better with age.&#34; I would recommend it for all music lovers!
B00899F0G8|5.0|Keeps me guessing on who -A is! Can not stop watching this show lol. I love it & i do not want it to end!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|l just can't stop playing this game!  Controls are simple swipe and tap, accumulate coins quickly, and love the new venues. Highly recommend!
0345803507|4.0|I guess I was dissapointed that the story was 'over'. I recommend all three books i 'hung' on to this book and took my time reading it because I knew it was the last one. I highly recommend &#34; Fifty Shades Freed: Book Thre of the Fifty Shades Trilogy&#34;.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I found this book to be a page turner almost from the beginning.  Good character development and twisty ending.  This author continues to keep me interested in reading more of his works.
0345803493|5.0|Liked it very much! Very intriguing and erotic. The second of three, I recommend this book: &#34;Fifty Shades Darker: Book Two of the Fifty Shades Trilopy&#34;.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I  really enjoy playing this with the different levels.  It's nice for all ages, and it definitely makes you think.  I like the challenge.
0345803485|5.0|I literaly could not put this book down, it was one of the most romantic and and at the same time abusive story. This was the first of three book and I enjoyed this one the Most. I recommend this book 110%:  &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Cool but add more world tours like India , Puerto Rico and more. And more people to play with ... u do that u get more subway surfers players ;) <3
0312383320|3.0|I haven't read it yet, so I really cannot rate it. I hope to like this book:  &#34;Plum Spooky&#34; but cannot give it a fair rating at this time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The only thing i dont like is how long it takes for me to save up coins to buy characters and stuff. Other than that, its ADDICTING
0446585025|3.0|I did like it. It is very funny and I enjoyed reading it. People like Ellen are so witty and intelligent and make everybody feel good about themselves, so I recommend this book : &#34;Seriously...I'm Kidding&#34;.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My mom sister and I Love this game soo much! You should buy it ! The best part is ,it's free!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A tv show that is excellently written, acted, directed, shot and delivered is RARE. Downton Abbey is excellent and I have fallen in love with each character and how their stories are presented. Perhaps it doesn't have the wonder and awe that Season 1 or 2 had, simply because we were all so IN LOVE with *having* a show to be in love with (At long last! Hadn't we all forgotten what it was like to *aniticipate* the next episode of a tv show with such breathlessness???)...<br />Season 3 is thoughtfully and judiciously carrying out the stories as they were set up, and everything is true to form. No complaints here!<br />AND...what a delightful surprise to receive the whole rest of the season &#34;before its airing&#34; -- thanks Amazon Prime Instant Video! ;-)
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|It was here in the time they said it would be, works great and I couldn't be happier with my order!
B0053FANS6|5.0|Just received  and love this trilogy pack of these movies great action recommend to all in blue ray quality is the best clear and great sound
0553573411|5.0|wonderful book! cant wait to read the third book.  Excellent recommendation from a friend! Amazingly the ending was a huge surprise...which is not common in my experience.
030758836X|4.0|Did smirking Nick Dunne kill his gorgeous, albeit pampered, young wife? As I read for clues, the plot twists kept coming but I persevered ... persevered ... persevered - stop. Alas, about two thirds into the story, \\"Gone Girl\\" lost me.<br /><br />Flynn's mindbender is peppered with clever asides about marriage, co-dependence, and the perils of marrying a sociopath, but it's also decidedly lacking in sympathetic characters; if her people aren't flat-out crazy, then they're something conceivably worse: relentlessly cynical. But we all love a good villain, and the cat-and-mouse shenanigans between the less-than-perfect Dunnes are often delicious (imagine Nick and Nora Charles with homicidal streaks). The problem here is plot: There are simply too many \\"yeah, right\\" moments.
B006YW6KX4|5.0|My husband and I both love this movie, but him (born in 1944) especially.  I gave it to him as an early Valentines Day present and we just watched it.  Worth every penny for someone who loves the movie and has been waiting for a decent DVD release since forever.  Our old VHS tape is tattered and the regular DVD is a worthless full screen release.  The movie in this blu-ray is not only CinemaScope but so beautiful---I have no idea how they do it but we fell in love all over again.  This one is a genuine keeper.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Started a little slow and you keep wondering, where's the action. That's ok just keep reading and you will be rewarded. Amazing science and true sense of humor. Not the typical sci-fi book but worth time to read.
B0037HOWKW|5.0|My two grandsons, ages eight and ten, have loved Leggos for years.  When we discovered nanoblocks, they were ecstatic.  Especially my eight year old grandson due to his absolute obsession with anything and everything &#34;tiny&#34;.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It fell apart. Very Poor quality. It should have been tested a lot better before being sent. I will be filing for a rebate.
B0019IMVDG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Yes, it is graphic and vulgar, but the acting is great - as you would expect from De Niro, et al.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Love it!!!  Nice to actually have the music to assoiciate with.  Nice balance of different styles.  A good intro to classical.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Easy to use. Best remote program out there for my Kindle Fire. I use this program to watch movies stored on my home computer anywhere I can get WiFi.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This entry was much slower and less satisfying than its predecessors.  But if did bring a just conclusion to a great series.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|I am not sure I understand how to play this version even though I play it everyday. No fun at all!
0802473156|5.0|Easy read. I would suggest reading it together as a couple. Makes you think and act differently, in a positive way. Totally helped transform my failing marriage. I feel so strongly about this book, I'm buying as gifts for my married friends. It would even help a good marriage. It gives you self-awareness. Also, it helps you see things in a different light. LOVE IT!!!!! [remember, it is what you put into it......you get back what you put in.......just saying]
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game with good graphics and a lot of options for playing. Once you start playing its hard to put down. I am using on the kindle fire.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|What can I say about anything so unprepossessing and homely as this black protective cover for my Fire HD? Well, it works! What else matters?<br /><br />Previously I've stuck my Fire in a padded book bag while traveling, only to have it slip out when I wasn't looking. So I ordered up the Belkin case. It snapped right on, it didn't block access to the headphone jack or the charging port or the off/on switch, and I have a fine sense that the Fire's screen won't be scratched or broken in any conceivable use. The case has the further advantage that when I open it as I would a book, the on/off switch is always at the top, so I don't have to search for it. Altogether, a very useful item.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Super emergency flight scenes.  Whip suffered the classic battle of a man with a big ego battling addiction but the strength of his character pulled him through in the end.  We really enjoyed this movie.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Dragonstory is a really fun game.I enjoy playing it on my kindle since I haven't played it before. The only things bad about this game is that the eggs take forever to hatch and some rare dragons, you have to buy with gold. Other than that this game is awesome. The graphics are great and the quality is good.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|We loved this fast paced exciting movie with the emotional openings to these supposedly stoic professional characters.  Can't wait for the next one.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This Kindle case provides good protection and functions well. I haven't used the stand function often, often but as a reader it works well -- not bulky and holds my Kindle Fir HD securely.
0765325950|5.0|Hooray! I have managed to live long enough to complete reading the series(14 volumes published over 22 years). The pace definitely picks up to a somewhat surprising ending. I think that Sanderson has done an admirable job of finishing the series without altering the characters or plot from Jordan's original concept. Additionally, there are enough loose threads with the &#34;supporting cast&#34; to spawn at least a half-dozen spin-off series.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved this game but as soon as I got to where I really wanted to be it wont let me play anymore. everytime I click on the game it brings up the first menu then it shuts off. its making me very mad.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent novel full of twist and turns, really kept me in suspense.  Would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good romantic suspense.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first book I have given 5 stars too in awhile. Such a great story line and not a predictable book at all. Which is what kept me intrigued the whole time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun, and the graphics are nice and smooth. The only thing is that items that cost gems should be less expensive, or we should have more ways to earn them.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|As usual the book was better.  I know this - but I wanted to have this moving anyway.  And although the book was better - I still enjoyed the move.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book I could not put down it is so cute! And is a amazing story. Such I good book I loved it from the start
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Had to read this book for my book club and we had a great discussion when it came time. Mothers can do anything!
B003XYERRM|5.0|I love historical fiction and this book meets every one of my requirements for a great book--well written, entertaining, and educational. If you like books such as Pillars of the Earth or the author Philippa Gregory this book is right up your ally!
B00A2R9FM0|5.0|The long wait was totally worth it! I really enjoyed this new album, Lover Alot is my favorite song on the album! If you're an Aerosmith fan then its definitely worth buying.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Sometimes a little graphic but, a good read. Certainly not a childs book. I'm sure they toned down th movie.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this album. I love all of the songs on this CD. If you are a fan of fun, feel good music. This CD is for you.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|OMG this is sooo much better than the first temple run but alot more challenging though! ^_^ But it does freeze up at times.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It only let me play it for about a week and now I can't play it because it will not open.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I've been a fan of the musical for at least 30 yrs, having seen the first broadway production 5 times plus local productions at Papermill, NJ PAC, etc.  Needed more information on the story line.  Thanks - did get all the background cleared up.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great game.  The designers made this version different, challenging and fun.  Being an Angry Birds freak, I am thoroughly enjoying this game.  Can't wait to see what will come next!
B003JSU2NU|4.0|Of the soundtracks for this series I found the first and second ones great and listen to them both quite often (likely a few hundred times each). This soundtrack I didn’t find as appealing. Though there are a few songs like “Ours” and “Track 16” that I found mood setting. For the collection it is definitely worth and if you are looking for something different to listen to it is also worth it.
B00A3SHW1O|5.0|I enjoy hearing good strong beats when walking around for lunch time exercise and this is great.  Put in your headphone, turn up the sound and get the heart rate going.
0761163808|5.0|Our six year old grandson is fascinated with this book.  In fact, the entire family loves it.  Just wished I could find more like it for kids six and older.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are some good and some bad games but it is fun.I find it fun because you can best yourself at your own set scores.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I truely enjoy spending time playing this game.  Its a great way to get my horse fix when I am unable to spend time with my actual horses.
B00AW28HF6|5.0|A riveting story full of action and emotion. Gallagher fills each scene with vivid descriptions, a knowledgeable attention to detail, and cultural nuance. The settings are historically and politically topical and the story gives perspective to many international current events such as the Arab Spring. This is a fun, intelligent, fast-paced read. I can't wait for the next one!
0761169253|5.0|I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed reading this little book. Truly a treasure! Very well written. Information is fun and informative.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like that you get more diamonds as you level up and it has new room available. A fun time!
6305678715|4.0|Sean Connery and Mark Harmon together in a good movie.  Lots of action and suspense.  I liked it a lot.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I came to watch Downton Abbey thru my grandaughter's fiance.  I rented it from Redbox and watched the first season in one weekend.  My other grandaughter bought me the second season, then I purchased both as a birthday gift.  It is a classy show, good acting, wonderful scenery and great characters.  Like reading a really good book.  Hope it never goes off the air!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and interactive just like real. Easy to play. Great game perfect for  children and adults. I rate it a perfect five put of five.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is a great drama, fabulous costumes, and wonderful casting.  I didn't think I would like it as much as I do!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Incredible show incredible acting. Been watching it for years and still love it . If your going to watch watch from the very start.
0439813786|5.0|We saw the move, so my son already know the story which he loves.  He is 11 and he is also into drawing and architecture. He LOVES this book.  The illustrations are amazing!!  The story is even better than the movie.  This is definitely a keepsake!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't recommend this enough - amazing writing, incredible acting, outstanding costumes, history, great drama, moves along quickly, very addictive.
B009X01ELC|5.0|I love that you can use this to stand your Kindle either horizontal (for watching Netflix) or vertical (for different apps or reading your favorite books).  It also comes in a great assortment of colors.
B0036EH3TS|4.0|I love this movie and would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for this packaging. The case as a few indentations in it and an ugly wrinkle in the cover paper. Other than that, good transfer.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I enjoy working on puzzles so this gave me the opportunity to do it on my phone to past the time when I need to. The graphics and photos are beautiful. Great for the price.
0811821846|5.0|This book was not only a hit,  it was a COMPLETE WIN!!!<br />I highly recommend this book for any star wars fan of any age!
B00A3XWB10|5.0|This cd is awesome! I'm not sure why people say it sounds muddy, but i think it sounds very good on my stero and my 200 watt truck stero system. I have all there cd's not mp3's. Maybe there's a difference. All an All, it's great party music no matter how you slice it. And yes either you like them and this kind of music or not!! To myself and people i am turning on to this band ,we are blown away!!! I am not into the new U.S.A. bands of latley. They don't have this kind of vibe in yur face , hard hitting groove sound that i love to hear. (Old school Glam, Rock , Metal) I would recommend all 4 of there cd's for sure. Take a listen and you will be Hooked!! Don't let the name of the band detour you away!!  I hope they become very big in the U.S.A. sometime soon!!! Just to let you know. I'm 46 with a family and can stil rock with the best of them!! And they are the best!! Try them!! I DareYou!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i bought this for my grandkids. they love this game and keeps them busy and calm when they play it. my grandkids play this game together. i give this game two thumbs up
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Good plot it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time I can't wait to see what happens next
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I am not married, but have been with my boyfriend for 5 years. We already had a great relationship and this book was still valuable. As you are reading, the information seems completely logical and not at all ground breaking... however, it's often the things right under our noses that we don't pay attention to.<br /><br />After reading the book, my boyfriend and I both took the quiz at the back which helps you determine your love language. I learned that the language most valuable to him (physical touch) is the hardest one for me. I wasn't terribly surprised, but had never really thought about it. I absolutely notice a difference when I am stepping out of my comfort zone and paying attention to his language.<br /><br />The principles in this book are fun because the changes in behavior are immediate... and I know how much people love instant gratification!
B002U5EHB6|1.0|This series has none of the draw of the two previous, mostly because the characters have absolutely no depth, nor does there seem much of a chance that any will be developed. There's simply nothing to connect with. There's not a single figure who is likeable, funny, worthy of loathing...nothing. I gave it five episodes, and that's it. Too bad; \\"Stargate\\" and \\"Stargate Atlantis\\" ranks as two of my favorite TV shows of all time. This stunk.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|of the therapeutic model toward the future, and conscious, purposeful living. And a harrowing, riveting story. Certainly one of the most concise expressions of a psychology out there.
B002DD67XG|5.0|I never get tired of listening to these songs. James Taylor's voice and lyrics never fail to captivate me and help me relax. The song choices are very good and range from the sweet song, &#34;You've Got A Friend&#34; to the bluesy &#34;Steamroller.&#34;<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy !!
B006TVQU6C|2.0|For whatever reason right now there is a shortage of antec cases in the pipeline (I usually buy 300s) so I read the reviews on this case and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I always buy antec and never have had an issue with any of their cases before the one.<br /><br />The interior space and cable management are decent. This unit lacks front dust covers so I'm going to set it up to be neutral / positive case pressure, no big deal.<br /><br />My major complaint on this case is that it is made with by far the cheapest case materials I have ever worked with within the last 5 years. Back in 2000 there were a ton of $10-$20 cases that had cheap materials like this case that I had the displeasure to work with (boss was cheap) and like this case they always came bent up. This case came properly packed and with 2 beat up spots on it. Luckily I was able to correct them and I'm sure you can too but this is very telling on the quality if a case can't survive shipping.<br /><br />This is a major step backward. If you've never bought antec before don't let this review scare you off, just don't buy this case. One swift kick or vacuum cleaner incident will leave this case scarred and there is literally nothing you can do about it.<br /><br />Buy a 300 or better and save yourself the hassle.<br /><br />Edited: I'm taking a star off for not having any mounting hardware. My motherboard has 7 offsets, the case included 6 on-board but no additional hardware (screws, offsets, etc). That is unacceptable, it will cause new system builders to do stupid things (like leave offsets out) and not put enough screws in the system because they can't find enough.<br /><br />I would send this unit back if it wasn't cost prohibitive so I'll just keep it and make the improvements neededed. Stay away.
B005LAII80|5.0|Great movie. Story is well told through the action sequences, to just enjoys great  and the set pieces are great looking. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to enjoy an action movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent acting, full of surprises and the casting is perfect. The setting is quite wonderful and the old automobiles<br />Are beautiful.
034580404X|2.0|There was so much hooplah when it came to this book. Maybe it was my mind frame. I couldn't seem to get through the first book. I am not saying that it wasn't good, but for me, it didn't hold my interest.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Since reading this book I have lived the wheat free lifestyle and  feel transformed.<br /><br />A great easy to read account of this Doctors careful accounting of wheat free diet and it's remarkable results.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Thus far, this series has been the most incredible series I have ever read. It is intense, amazing, clever, and very well written. This particular book has ripped my heart into a million pieces with unexpected plot twist. Read this. Whatever you do in life, read this series.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I am more than satisfied with this purchase. Everyone who sees it marvels at what a great case it is
B002Y7ZEMG|5.0|In this short movie, you can see Michael's genius as dancer; and the smooth criminal caracter who want to protect children. So Cute! The sound is good.
B0000AC8N4|5.0|Great jazz from the masters. A part of history.  With Bud Powell on piano what more can you want. Thankyou.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has a similar premise to Temple Run. The cartoon style animation makes it a lot of fun to look at. I have spent a lot of time trying to unlock all the characters. I'm about half way there. I highly recommend this game. It's hard to pick it up and only play one run.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I was a bit hesitant about this type of game but I am glad I gave it a chance because it is really fun and entertaining! My grandson and I love catching new animals for our zoo...best thing is there is no cost!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was one of the most difficult, heart wrenching yet brilliantly told stories I've read in a very long time. I cried my way through a box of tissues while causing everyone sitting near me to question my sanity as I laughed out loud a few pages later. John Green's beautiful words are a true gift, and I will watch for more from this author eagerly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun but can be tedious at times... obviously some of the mini games are more fun than others but still definately worth the free price....
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Very impressed with this new artist.  I hate American Idol, so I never heard him until the radio.  Big fan now.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book great read great patriot he will surely be missed I'm glad he and others like him defend our country
B007HO392S|2.0|Love all her music, but I feel like she just tried to make money on this one.  She is getting a little trashy.  Where is the sweet girl?
B000056HOZ|5.0|This is a great video of the ever-evolving Bruce over the years. All his best music, and videos to go with the songs.
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|Extremely difficult to control, cannot get a fine line-cannot erase.  Probably great for toddlers or very young child.  Too frustrating for a 7 yr. old.
B00APUYN0I|2.0|This movie would have been great but the video was terribly pixilated  through the whole movie , and it played in stereo , this is HD ? I have a great component sound system and was so dissatisfied with the sound comming out of only two out of seven Klipsch speakers , especially  a musical ! Should have bought the Bluray .
B009P13RQY|4.0|The Sword continues to be consistant with releases: heavy, hard rock/metal, with identifiable infuences in their music.  At under $10 for this cd, with the bonus tracks, this is an easy purchase for fans of the band.
B00009L1OB|1.0|I don't know how this masterpiece album was Remastered.. should be Digitally \\"RETARDED\\".<br />The first issue sounds very good.<br />The peaks the highs and mediums sounds horrible like a bad ripped MP3
B00956UPSW|4.0|I am a fan of Down, and like this EPa; many existing fans should enjoy this new material.  There are what one would expect on this EP, some heavy songs.  Looking forward to future releases from Down.
B004UID2LC|1.0|When you first see this app, you'd expect it to be totally amazing, being able to download music and videos to your tablet. And that's what I thought when I purchased it. Although, it was overloading with ads - even inappropriate ones - that were useless, even if the app was not turned on! So, that caused a big broblem after the updated version: it gave my Fire a virus.<br /> So please, do not buy FREEdi YouTube Downloader.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a cool game.I love horses!!!  Love it!!I recommend this game to big horse fans!  P.S.  they have unicorns!!!!
B004J4WNL2|2.0|Starting out I thought I could use this book to learn more about myself and some how use that information to grow and use my introvert-ness as an advantage. This book basically went on and on about the definition of an introvert.... I know what an introvert is! I am one! I know how I think and work! I did not learn very much.<br /><br />I felt like she categorized all introverts to be shy and afraid, which isn't true, especially for me. I wish the book could have helped me learn more about myself and how I can use my personality and working styles to fit in and mesh better with society. This is basically a 300+ page definition of introversion.<br /><br />On the positive side there were one or two take-aways that helped me understand my level of introversion, but probably not worth reading the book for.
B0086VWCPG|1.0|I am so very disappointed.<br />I downloaded the free version and loved it.<br />Purchased the Pro version from Amazon Apps.  It is version 3.1.4<br />The current version is 3.6.1<br />The version that I purchased from Amazon will not upgrade.<br />I do not have the ability to map my runs, use Google Earth, auto update weather, or just about anything that the Pro version is supposed to do.<br />I am going to use the free version instead.<br />Any way to get a refund ?
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Nice book I have the old book edition, this is nice to have on the go. Don't have to carry extra material.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I borrowed the first 3 books of the Sword of Truth series from the library.  There are several more in the series, but they seemed to be predictable, so I'm taking time off from the series.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I really like how easy it is to use this app.  Not only does it provide a very bright \\"flashlight,\\" but it also gives quite a selection of lesser and colorful lights as well.
B001TMCBI2|4.0|If you're looking for cancer therapy, you have to be tenacious and very disciplined (and not in the poor house) to follow the recommendations in this book. It's definitely not for the person who's goes into something half heartedly. But overall, it gives good insight to health and wellness. There is great information to be gleaned and implemented by even the less disciplined.
B003D0ZNM4|5.0|&#34;Very Best of Arvo Part&#34; is a haunting and refreshing CD,  with a nice variety of selections within his unique style.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Brand new DVD's, fast shipping cheap price what else can you ask for. If you like the the first two seasons you must have this one. Can wait to see the last episode.
B0018RC7QE|4.0|Although the story felt somewhat slight while I was viewing it, this film has stayed with me as it has a kind of indescribable quality. Perhaps that's because \\"Falling in Love\\" is less about infidelity and more about the overwhelming feelings the two main characters have for one another and how, against their better judgement, neither can ignore these emotions. Moreover the production is augmented considerably by the talents involved as well as some wonderful Dave Grusin music (the main theme, \\"Mountain Dance,\\" is available on Grusin's [[ASIN:B0000001Q1 Cinemagic]] release). Not an out-n-out classic, but certainly a well-intentioned, well-made, mature look at the vagaries of the human heart.
B00AAZSH0U|5.0|This is my son's favorite book. We have the board book but bought the kindle version as well so that it is always with us.  He loves to do all the animal noises and recite the first 4 pages by himself. (he is 21 months).
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My granddauthers love this dvd and so did i.  A good story and the dvd was top quality all around.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|There is no direction on how to turn on the camera in the Kindle Fire HD...this apps is so easy to allow access to your camera.
B00A5IYXY6|5.0|A terrific cast portrays the denizens of a portside neighborhood who band together to save a young African refugee. This is a feel=good movie on every level.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I like this book allot. It shows that if you follow what is right you can't go wrong. Please read it, it is very good
B0035V35P8|5.0|Un clasico del cine de accion con artes marciales, muy satisfecho, era lo que esperaba y formara parte de mi coleccion
B009E3EY38|5.0|Led Zeppelin's Celebration Day is fantastic. The group never sounded better. The guys are top form and brilliant! Love it.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|I have loved &#34;Glee&#34; from the start. I hope there will be a Christmas volume as long as Glee Lasts. I have all 3 volumes plus all the other CD's.
B005IQZB14|5.0|What an inspirational book.  The writing was captivating, vivid, entertaining.. her experience consumes you. (So much that I was inspired to go on a backpacking trip to the Sierras!)  After post-book depression, I discovered that Cheryl Strayed was speaking and reading parts of her book at Pt. Reyes bookstore - YES! She is just the way you would expect in person as the character she perceives in her memoir.  Kind, attentive, gentle-hearted, funny, aware.  I caught a glimpse of her post &#34;Wild&#34; life at this reading. Her hubby and cute blonde kids running around a playground at the back of the barn where she was reading.  They were supportive and adorable.  So many people were touched by this book, including myself.  I hope the movie (starring Reese Witherspoon) will live up to the book.  But we all know books are better than movies, so it'll have a tough shot to compete with imagination.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.It was written so well a real page turner.I would recommend this book to anyone.It keeps you guessing and wanting them to be happy together.
B001ESYAJY|5.0|Fantastic !!!!! It is a great score that kept the movie moving along by giving the correct amount of mood.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders game was great!<br />STUPID 2o word requirement . . . . . . . . . .  . .
B008KO8KZ0|3.0|IT IS JUST A FUN THING TO HAVE.  I GAVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE IT HAS LITTLE PRACTICAL USE.  I ENJOY TAKING<br />PHOTOS FOR FRIENDS AND CHANGING THEIR FACES AND PRINTING AND GIVING TO THEM.  I ALWAYS ASK HOW<br />THEY WERE FEELING WHEN THE PHOTO WAS TAKEN.  GREAT LAUGHS.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I would give this game fully five stars because this game is awesome  . Great graphics people can't you realize that .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator app out there, big button display and very easy to use. Happy with this app. I highly recommend this!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|A co-worker suggested I buy one from amazon so I did and it couldn't be any more perfect .. It is streamlined yet functional.  Exactly what I was looking for
B008G8SFGO|3.0|I have listened to the cd all the way through and the only two songs I like are \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\" and \\"Wall of Sound\\". What I like the least about cd is the recording itself. I ran each track thorough a amplitude analyzer to discover what I suspected. This recording is an overmodulated and overcompressed \\"Monster\\" that is hard to listen to if you care for clean sharp sound at the top and bottom end of the sound spectrum. It's just piles of sound. The practice of recording/producing this way has been a standard in the industry for a long time. I believe the pros refer to it as the \\"volume wars\\" of which this album is a casualty. Same thing can be said about the new Rush album (Clockwork Angels). Go back and listen to previous Rush albums like \\"Moving Pictures\\" or \\"Roll the Bones\\" The production is sharp clean and edgy. Perhaps the vinyl counterparts are better than the cds.
B006M9NJFG|4.0|I like the slight tilt if the belt loop, it makes it easy to sit.  The rubber on the handle is going to melt for sure when I am forced to use it on camp fire.  However, for now, I'll continue to heat it on a portable gas fueled stove.
0307944689|4.0|I bought this book for my brother...Actually, I should rate this book after his exam...Anyway, is an affordable and pretty complete book. I like the fact that you have a CD with the listening and tests similar to the exam.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|WOW. I love this game. The graphics, the characters, I love it. I also really like how you turned the all loved Mighty Eagle into the Millennium Falcon.. Worth the money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is amazing. everyone who sees it buy it. I cant wait until online mutiplayer comes out. I just updated it to get armor.
B008NABUU8|4.0|I like this! It makes you think how to get the bridge built, under budget and safe.  Each level can be done quickly, and then you can stop until later or continue.  You end up doing &quot;one more.&quot;
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I wasn't expecting it to be as good as is was.........it was fantastic.  I'm making my husband take me to England so that I can visit the castle (Highclere) in person!  I love all of the characters, and I don't know what I'm going to do when I finish Season 3.  I wish that I could have a butler like in the series.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|My favorite part of this story is that it is historicaly accurate. The way the author weaves Allan's experiences throughout is just genius. I laughed through<br /> the whole book.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|If you saw the Stallone version, this is not it.  It's better, much more graphic, special effects are great, and Dredd never takes off his helmet, so it's not about who the actor is its the character.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Once my daughter starting playing it on my Kindle...she starting asking for a kindle for Christmas so she could play it as well.
B004GJVI5C|4.0|I had heard good things about this movie, and it defiantly lived up to expectations.  Good pace of moving, great views of Boston, action sequences were great, haven't seen the lady who plays the love interest before but she is good.  The &#34;crew&#34; were all played very well, and Hamm as the FBI agent, was great.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game was fun... I enjoyed it for awhile.  After playing it for awhile though I gave it up.  I sold my Kindle and obviously haven't played it since.
B00992CF6W|5.0|absolutely one of the best apps I have ever had fun fun fun a must have oh and by the way even though it may cost 6 00 it is worth it 100%
B0064T6LV8|3.0|This game was fun... I enjoyed it for awhile.  After playing it for awhile though I gave it up.  I sold my Kindle and obviously haven't played it since.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This is a movie that you have to closely follow.  It has a lot of twists and turns and is a little on the odd side for me but the hubby liked it.  For sure a guy flick.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game was fun... I enjoyed it for awhile.  After playing it for awhile though I gave it up.  I sold my Kindle and obviously haven't played it since.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|A great movie with a great story line!  We purchased this after renting it and I can't wait to show my daughter....it will be a while since she is only 4 months old but what a great flick for girls and women!
B004ECDNJU|2.0|This was kind of stupid.  I didn't really enjoy it much.  Deleted the game after about 2-3 days of playing it.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|It's a hands down guy flick just like the first one, which I don't mind watching with the hubby.  Packed full of big names but I can't help but wonder how much plastic surgery these guys have had.  They always look surprised!
B005VTS4EY|3.0|This game was fun... I enjoyed it for awhile.  After playing it for awhile though I gave it up.  I sold my Kindle and obviously haven't played it since.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Fantastic movie!  Great story line, great acting, though it was hard at times to understand what they were saying but I chalk that up to good role playing for the time period of the movie.  A must see!
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|Agent Pendergast always seems to get his way either through intimidation, harassment or blackmail.  He always seems to find a way to get out of a jam whereas everybody around him gets killed.  His arrogance and his insensitivity for his friends in this book became absurd and obnoxious.  i had a difficult time finishing the book and seriously feel Agent Pendergast should be retired..................
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Another great film by Mr. Eastwood!  Great story line, great acting, great cast, this is a must see movie!  It's good enough to buy!
B0057UAE54|5.0|I used to listen to this on 8-track with my boyfriend back in 1976.  Many great memories.  Greatest live album ever.
B00A0HQ7H8|2.0|Lana has better albums out.  She has a great voice, but I don't like the songs as much as I like other albums.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It starts up hard but you just have to get used to it. For myself I love  horses. I would go and ride them when ever I got to summer camp I would always pick to ride a horse instead of doing something else. For the future if I'm rich enough I worldwide get a horse for my self and my kid when I get married.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book a must read, you won't be able to put the book down after the first chapter! The book is very detailed in all of the missions and events that took place.
0061122416|4.0|Yes it is a simple tale but it is told so sweetly that the reader gets the feeling of sitting down with a weathered old man and hearing the adventures of his youth. There is wisdom in these pages. And it has become a modern classic because it make the reader feel truths that we know already but which sometimes get covered in our busy day-to-day lives. Don't expect a masterpiece but welcome a beautifully told wonderful story.
B008VJYWMY|5.0|I have followed Il Divo since they were discovered and have all their CD's.  I bought this one because it is a compilation of their wonderful hits and I never get tired of listening to them.  If this is your introduction to them, get it and if you already have their CD's, get it and enjoy.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|This is a packaging together of the Babel Deluxe CD, Live at Red Rocks audio, and The Road to Red Rocks DVD (which is the Live at Red Rocks show with some conversation in between songs). If you are coming across this, you are probably familiar with Babel, which is my favorite release of 2012. The extra songs on the Deluxe CD are good, especially The Boxer cover. I already owned the Babel standard CD, plus a live version of The Boxer, so I bought this because from what I'd heard Mumford and Sons brings it live (especially the last couple of years). It was either buy the MP3 Live at Red Rocks CD, or pay a few bucks more and get the Deluxe CD and DVD as well. I went that direction. The film is well shot, but honestly to me, the extra interview and pretty views shots were unnecessary additions. In fairness, those kind of things don't interest me in general, I just want the show.<br /><br />Now the real jewel here is the Live at Red Rocks CD. The band is tight, sounds excellent, and brings the energy. This is a case of the live performance outpacing the studio versions. It's an excellent show, and as per the usual, the Red Rocks venue is spectacular.<br /><br />I highly recommend this. If you don't want to splurge for this version, at least download the MP3 album. And if you care about such things, the packaging is pretty cool.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00000K2UX|2.0|I only found 2 songs I actually liked in this whole album the rest were forgettable and just plain boring from what I remember so I just wasted my money and could have just purchased the two songs I wanted in the first place.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this is just like pet pet salon but with hk charcters. i love it. its acctually quite addictive . worth getting and convelently free! five stars all-the-way
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Excellent story.  Have read it before and will definitely read it again.  Absolutely love it. Very enjoyable read. highly reccomend
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok this game is great just get the game its FREE and see if you like it if you don't you can always delete it
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Excellent story.  Have read it before and will definitely read it again.  Absolutely love it. Very enjoyable read. highly reccomend
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome book! Once I started reading the first one I could not put them down, I am getting the third one right now they pull you in & you don't want to put them down.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Excellent story.  Have read it before and will definitely read it again.  Absolutely love it. Very enjoyable read. highly reccomend
B004NDVJA0|5.0|I heard a song from this album on a radio program and fell in love.  After purchasing the album, I listened to it with my newborn daughter many many times.  This is a little gem, soft, passionate, beautiful and will weather the years.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome it is a challenge for me and the best part is that you get to have a hoverboard.
B00846REIS|4.0|Read all the reviews and figured I would try this book, as others say it is along the same lines as fifty; however, a lot different. The author has only hinted at a BDSM lifestyle. Both main characters have past to be reckoned with. I enjoyed this book and will buy the other 2 in the series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Fun quick read. Not too deep or complicated just enough action to keep you reading.a good choice for a rainy day
B000683VI4|1.0|Wasn't a full version of the movie, alot of parts were cut out, and it was a terrible copy. Even though it was inexpensive it's not right that I had to pay for the shipping to return it. I should have been reimbursed for that as well.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Exciting and fast paced.  Tied up lots of loose ends from previous novels about AGent Pendercast and Constance.<br />Fun to read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its great not bad.play it when your bored or waiting for something important . yup very interesting and fun,  not lame at all
B0063IH60K|3.0|I have fun winning quite often. The ads are a little distracting but not too bad since it keeps the game free.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Arrow is very creative and exciting the way they tie in different dc comic book characters into the plot season one is very entertaining so far and I think they should definitely make a season two going deeper into its comic roots
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Great to have the DVD's of the performance, as well as the practice.  The performance zooms in on the highlight of the moment while the practice is a view of the entire stage.  Then  the CD and accompanying stories give you fullfillment for those of us who would have like to have been there.  Surely if enough of us snatch this up they'll reunite for another?
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A must see for any music buff with a love for knowing &#34;how it all began&#34;. Very interesting and engrossing. Awesome...
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Standard plot but what was interesting was what the wife beater was thinking.  How twisted he was between love and hate.
B006LSZECO|2.0|My wife bought this book because a few of her friends had referred it to her. That was a mistake.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|Ok, so the story is a little predictable but Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher are awesome in this movie and have great chemistry. There are a few little twists and turns, and I like the personality Portman and Kutcher bring to their characters. It has all the charm a rom-com should have!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I bought the book by Shelby Johnson &#34;Kindle Fire HD User's Guide Book: Unleash the Power of your Tablet&#34; and tried to download this product, but when talking to a customer support agent, found out this program had nothing to do with my Kindle, and I can't take pictures on my tablet because it has no back lens.
B007XHWROK|4.0|This CD was a gift for my cousin, but I have given it a listen with her.  I would say that it is not 100% full of &#34;hits&#34;; however, the quality and organization of each song is good enough that you can enjoy the full CD without skipping through the tracks. The R&B influence is heavily present with this album, and Justin is really setting his roots in the genre.
B0097NGUJG|4.0|This album is very different and strange, but I kinda like that about it. Some of the weird vocals seem forced to be that way, but on occasion, it works.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|Seriously, Disney Nature has been releasing visually stunning documentaries every year on Earth Day that do more than impress the eyes, they touch the heart. Chimpanzee tells the story of a group of Chimps who live together in the Congo and face the struggles of life, love, and heartache. Little Oscar gets separated from his family during a fight for territory and a very unexpected caretaker enters his life at just the right time.  This is a great family movie that the kids and adults will both enjoy!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Bought a pair of Koss PortaPro's last week which sounded pretty good already, especially for $30. But my cousin suggested picking up the E5 saying they could use a slight boost. After reading some reviews I figured why not spend the extra $5 and get the E6. Though I is my first day with with them I notice a drastic and immediate difference. Bass now has a really nice little punch and mids & highs are very clear. First time I ever used a headphone amp and I now get it. This is going to make night shifts a lot easier. I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially to beginners like me. Instead of spending the money on some blah set of headphone with some rapper's name on this side do like I did and buy some koss portapros and this amp. Compared this setup to the $300 beats by Dre and it wasn't even a contest. Sure the beats had a little more bass but everything else was washed out. Didn't get a chance to use the amp with the beats but I don't expect much. Right now I am using a droid charge with the power-amp app, 320kbps MP3 files, Fiio E6, and PortaPro's. The E6 has has 4 EQ mods, first one just seems to amplify all ranges a little, second EQ is a bass boost type mode, third EQ is what sounds like a mid range EQ boost(not sure just guessing from what it sounds like to me), & the fourth mode reduces on all frequencies. It is easy to switch through each EQ mode by simply pushing up on the power slider quickly, which you hold for 3 seconds to turn on and off, slide down for a volume lock. On the opposite side is a volume rocker that increases and decrease sound by very small margins with each one click. Each mode has it's purpose and I've already use all of them, well not so much the 4th EQ setting but I have a few idea's of where it could be very useful. I am already very please with my purchase and at just under $30 it is an easy sell. What came in the package was two different sized 3.5mm dual ended male adapter, 1 mini USB charging cable, Fiio E6, 2 clear removable plastic clips & a multi-language instruction pamphlet.vable plastic clips & a multi-language instruction pamphlet.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally an OFFICIAL Pinterest application for Kindle Fire. Nothing makes browsing for hours and hours better than this app. It is super easy to freely flow through all the different boards and organize your own items. A+ 100%.<br /><br />Best part is... FREE!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is one of my favorite apps on my kindle fire! I just got on level 6 .  I just was playing and I got a really high score and  when I was playing I also went through two minds. This app is awesome you really should get it. It's free. And it drains no battery life what so ever. I'm so sorry if I spelled wrong. Please download the app. Thanks for your time!
B004EPZ084|5.0|This movie is hilarious. Totally did not expect the plot to take all the turns it did, kept me entertained for sure. I love seeing Jennifer Aniston in a more risque role, not so clean-cut and sweet as she usually does. Of course Jason Bateman is hilarious as well.  This movie is good enough to buy, you can watch it over and over and enjoy it every time.
B009A7E7SK|4.0|Like work out just wish after three weeks could see more results, maybe it just takes longer to see results
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Seems fine so far but there is a lot of scenes to watch. Great graphics, looking forward to seeing what else the company has to offer.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A good upgrade over version 1. I've spent way to many hours on this darn thing already with more to come,
B000YDG5W0|5.0|Great boots!  These boots are comfortable and there is really no break-in period...just lace and wear.  Previous reviews stated going a size smaller...i say at least one size smaller...Good tread, comfort, and look.<br />Wear and enjoy!
B001AFF25W|4.0|The book was common sense mostly but it made you take a look at how you procrastinate and not realize it. Follow the 21 principals and I believe it will help.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Very pleased, we have listened to the CD over and over.<br />Have recommended others to purchase.<br />We are watching for other CDs from Phillip.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Dr. strangelove is immediately recognized to be one of the most brilliant satirical films of all time.  It's brilliance lies in turning the tension of The Cold War and the threat of Nuclear War into a brilliant black comedy movie. It's full of memorable hilarious lines, quirky characters, and hysterical situations. The humor in this film has something for everyone.  10/10 highly recommended film
B007712XAU|5.0|My wife and enjoyed this mini series. The package arrived when promised. Can't wait to get the next several seasons.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great free app I downloaded for my Kindle Fire. Works well; never had a problem with it. Fun way to kill some time.
B009X01D9U|5.0|The Marware case is  close to perfect. It's very protective, and it allows the tablet to lie flat, or to stand up at several different angles, either in portrait or in landscape oritentation. The elastic band incorporated in the front cover keeps the case from opening accidentally. The rigid plastic inner shell assures that the tablet can't accidentally slip out of the case.<br /><br />The case does add slightly to the dimensions and the &#34;carrying weight&#34; of the tablet, the small increases in size and weight aren't objectionable. My one warning about the case is that once the tablet is firmly set into the rigid plastic inner shell, it's very difficult to remove it when you want to carry the tablet without protection.<br /><br />Even with those precautions, I can't imagine the Marware case being any better than it is. I'm very glad I bought mine.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a good book of substance. The atrocities that those poor children suffered all at the hands of mean priests and  nuns who only wanted to profit from them. Nothing has changed!
0765325950|5.0|22 years and 2 authors in the making, it was good to finally come to a conclusion in this series.  I must say that there were many, many threads of the story that were never wrapped up, but seriously it would take another 3 volumes to do so.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|Awesome movie you cant go wrong when your dealing with the Dude! I am glad I finally own this movie. Simply packaging but all you need is the movie in the case!
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|It's much better than I thought it would be when I first saw the preview. Characters are really entertaining and the songs are cute!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love...Love. I great read and easy read. Read this book in less than two days. Kept my interest the entire time. Highly recommended.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|After seeing the trailer repeatedly on TV, I had to purchase it. Given the \\"assumed\\" plot, with the upside down plane (I am a 12 year AF vet) and making Denzel Washington (whip)a hero was my kind of movie. I have loved everything Denzel has been in, and with a supporting cast of John Goodman playing a part he was born to play and with Don Cheadle how could I go wrong. I hate slow dull movies, overly sentimental love stories(which this was not), and movies like this one that don't end with the HERO coming up on top. That being said, when I watched the ending twice, the movie had to be what it was, to bestow true HERO status on \\"Whip\\" and the inner strength he found. Great movie,highlighting the horrible effects of drugs and alcohol, the refusal of help and endearing love, and clearly showing the weakness in \\"man\\" as he struggles to get free from his downward spiro. Watch it, buy it re-watch it, and share it with your friends. MAYBE someone with a weakness or character flaw might see themselves in Whip and learn to `FLY RIGHT\\". A full 4.5 star movie, but Amazon does not allow 4.5's and I only give 5.0's to true epics.
B001O2SIN4|1.0|I did not think it was detailed enough and it did not show enough of the good work they do and why they are orphaned
B007MAETA8|5.0|The only other time I'd heard Mayer was his fantastic \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" single. I bought this CD<br />after hearing a few cuts and was astounded. EVERY SINGLE SONG is brilliant. It doesn't matter if you're<br />sitting on the deck or cruising the Beach Road in OBX, this CD is the soundtrack to whatever you happen<br />to be doing. I just can't recommend it enough.
B007VYQ6DS|4.0|All I can say that it was brillant and the children loved it and I would recommend it to anybody
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Perhaps I watched this after too much hype.  Word of mouth told me what to expect in regards to that there would be something about alcohol that would be part of the storyline, which is there from the get go.  Unfortunately there was no one to root for in this.  Denzel played a despicable character from the get go, but beyond that and the fine tension filled scene dealing with the plane, an accident and his part in making the best of it, this film is a mess.  Here are some examples with the messed up plot, characters, and religous themes....<br /><br />  Plot devices.  At one part, to make sure Denzel is safe in a room, people with lots of money and influence are sure that he is \\"baby sat\\" with a guard right outside, yet with all at risk they never check any rooms next door?  Light spoiler for the rest of this paragraph - and what hotel accidentally leaves both a connecting room door unlocked and windows in the next room totally open (what hotel can you still do that in) and have the wet bar unlocked?<br /><br />  As to actors...For instance, John Goodman shows up at two different times in the movie, always looking like he is playing a \\"Big Lewbowski\\" chacter on steroids.  His latter scene makes one wonder if one is supposed to be watching a drama or wacky comedy.  Though I won't spoil the ending of the film, I will only say that if you do not figure out what will happen by the time you are halfway through the film you have probably nodded off.<br /><br />  It appeared that the filmmakers could not decide what to do with themes of God and \\"Higher Power\\" in this film, so though they splash examples of people who worship or speak of God throughout, they are usually relegated to total nutcases, or at least characatures of extreme fringe believers.<br /><br />  All in all this mess of a movie made me feel that I wasted time in addition to my rental fee.  Though each actor in this film os quite good, they all appear to be cut and paste from different types of movies.  Overall...a huge dissapointment.  In my humble opinion.erall...a huge dissapointment.  In my humble opinion.
0062197258|4.0|This was a good read. I think the author did a good job in writing this book. You will not be disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this and it ended well. I can't wait for the other movies to be made nonreaders can experience this too.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute and fun though to really get anywhere the game requires a lot of attention. Still one of a kind.
B00A83075M|5.0|My granddaughter and I wanted to see a movie, any movie; it really didn't matter what. We were lucky enough to choose Wreck-It Ralph! I was immediately intrigued by the concept--that a \\"bad-guy\\" character in a video game is tired of doing the same things every game. Ralph just wants a medal!<br />The characters are wonderful, the plot is a delight, and the way the \\"games\\" interface with the \\"real\\" world is hilarious! Vanellope is very endearing, and only wants her own game; let's just say there are a few glitches! Jane Lynch almost steals the show as Sergeant Calhoun,the the rough, tough quintessential soldier. And then there is the good guy, Felix, and the bad guy . . . oh wait! That's a spoiler!  Don't miss Wreck-It Ralph! ![[ASIN:B00B2DSK06 Wreck-It Ralph]]
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Love it Love it Love it. Really enjoyed all 3 books, would highly recommend them. Not my usual read but was hooked from the start. Too much sex (if that is possible) but the story was great.
B0040UAYI4|2.0|Bought this for black ops 2, Cannot change keyboard or mouse config.. useless until they provide edit software for osx.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I read this book really quickly and am on the third now, I think it is brilliant, bit over all the sex but enjoying the story line very much, trying to make the third book last as will miss Ana and Christian.
B001LV5OOY|5.0|Discovered this one on Spotify and loved it - so I purchased the actual CD so I could listen to it everywhere.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I found this book really easy to read, love the story line, half way through book 3 now and am loving it, bit over the sex now but enjoying the story.
B004DMAZQK|5.0|Discovered this one on Spotify, loved it, so I bought the actual CD so I could listen to it everywhere!
B006H4DBA4|4.0|A book you can pick up and read all in one go, makes you think a little. I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books including the one's she has written under Madeleine Wickham. It was ok for a short story but not as good as her others, The Undomestic Goddess and Twenties Girl are my real favourites.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|This has some wild and crazy fun. Lessons are learned and mistakes are made. You feel sucked into a world that is too crazy for you to be in, but you feel like being the spectator watching their every move. I enjoyed the movie and still have it to this day.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used it several times and to be honest it was more accurate than my local  stations.  It's got features that you can customize to your preference.
B00866JL96|4.0|I have read all of Sparks' books and thuroughly enjoy the movies.  The actors really portrayed the characters from the novel well and I was unable to look away from the screen the entire time I was watching.
1892005034|4.0|Easy read in short intervals. Techniques for communicating clearly and effectively can be used for all relationships. I highly recommend.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved the characters in this book, even though the female lead was frustrating at times.  The slight humor and how enjoyable the male lead was made the book a great read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was an amazing read. The book is written very well and I think everyone should read it. Love!!!
B007XF4J70|5.0|The movie is great & the copy of the film on Blu-Ray is crisp & clear to watch. It's a big improvement over my old VHS copy!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The puzzles are challenging but fun. I enjoyed this game a little more than similar puzzle games due to the small differences. I don't know what the difference is between this and the free version as I got this one for free. Not sure I'd pay $4.99 for it, but it is definitely an enjoyable game.
1600964990|4.0|Although this is Christie's first published novel (1920; set 1915 during WW1), & introduces my favorite Christie detective (Poirot), it isn't my favorite NOVEL of hers, although it is good.  I like the ambience of the early 20th century.  For instance, Styles is still lit by candles, not even gaslight!  Hastings has been wounded in WW1 & invalided out.  You'll find out how he & Poirot met.  And as usual, the characters and plot will keep you guessing, and admiring (and sometimes hating) until the end.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't put this down.  Makes you think how far would you go to defend someone you love.  Did he or didn't he do it?
B004O2AZHI|1.0|I think it is meant for European or Japanese blue ray players. I get it to work on my blue ray player or the playstation. I have not been able to watch it
B004GUSG4M|4.0|The writer kept me going from page one till the last.  The suspension was great!  All the description was vivid and alive.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awsome game! Much better than previous one. Like graphic enhancement and spped of the character movement. Overall really well made game!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow.... talk about an inspirational book. The start was fun & funny but after 60% it just picked up intensity...it's a great story about love, hope New tomorrow's and LOVE. love the way Holder loves, protects & cares for Sky. True love is patient, kind and does not expect in return that is exactly what I got from this book. Must add to your reading list!!!!
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Enjoyed Steve Martin and Jack Black showing a more serious side--- this is a lighthearted movie about the importance of relationships, setting priorities. Theme: follow your dreams and value the people in your lives. A guideline I use: a film is worth watching if I come to care about the characters. Given that criteria, this movie is a winner.<br /><br />As a birder, I enjoyed the story line and the transformation in Martin and Black's characters  as the film progresses. John Cleese does a nice job narrating as we view the many fine wildlife and landscape scenes. If you're looking for a major comedy, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an evening's entertainment, this may be for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down for long, was a really good read!  It's not only about the sex!  it's a love story  too.
B0002IOR6I|5.0|the vhs tape was perfect! it looke like i had buyed it 20 years ago thanks for everything this movie is rare
B004SH40BQ|3.0|It works great but can easily get lost- there's no way to attach it to your device when not in use! It also needs an on/off switch.
6302787068|5.0|the aladdin vhs tape perfect just new everyone in my house love the movie and wanted it so much on VHS even had to buy another VCR thanks a lot!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|If you're intrigued by the concept of multiple, loosely connected, yet totally distinct storylines, I'd say go for this.  Don't expect any great revelations or neat and tidy explanations of anything, however.  Mitchell leaves that totally up to you.  Some parts are much better than others.  I don't think I'm alone in finding the first storyline quite tiring.  If you can wade through it, things get much better.  Hundreds of pages later I'm still, &#34;ya, so what&#34;.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|This is a great and underrated film. The picture looks a lot better than the older DVD I owned. The price was perfect for this hard to find bluray
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I read for pleasure, and this book was a delight.  The character development is suburb, and there is a wonderful unfolding / revealing of the plot as we walk along with Harold.
B005FISBTO|5.0|my husbanc loves dexter.  we dont get showtime so this was the perfect way for him to be able to watch it.
0937381888|4.0|I've been considering delving into the homebrewing world and thought it would be good to educate myself first.  This book tells you everything you need to know in order to get started.  I'd recommend it to anyone interested in brewing beer.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|to buy this record. It should also come with some TOMS, a pack of american sprits and a busted typewriter. Cuz you're totes gonna repair it...sure.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Sound City isn't just some nostalgia piece about a certain music studio, some incredibly designed sound board or even rock and roll history. It's a movie about people who take chances together, love what they do and gives us a glimpse into how it all happens in the first place. Props out to Mr. Grohl, you did it the right way!<br /><br />No problem streaming the HD version to my PS3. Wasn't quite blu-ray but very good.
B00005JLEU|4.0|I love me some Miyazaki fo sho but damn! This movie is cray! Giant baby! Parents turning into pigs! Mysterious town with an unmanned buffet! Girl sold into laundry slavery! The god damn no face! What the hell!?! I am so glad I chose a Daily's Frozen Wine slushy to guide me on this Japanese cinematic journey.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|I think that this might have been the first thing that I downloaded on my Kindle. I enjoyed hearing the Christmas music. I played it over and over. Thank You!
B0059H05VI|3.0|I do not recall ordering this at all. Adam Levine, while a sweet piece of eye candy, mostly sounds like a parade of dying cats.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|I believed from the information that this might be a fun game, Maybe, I did not get all the information I needed to play  the game.<br />I just looked at the screen and looked at the screen and looked looked at the screen.  It was interesting, but what was I suppose to do?
B00992CF6W|4.0|I loved the pc version  and this is awesome for the device it's on no lag but the problem is it removes having to shape your crafting and that's one thing I liked about pc

B004IFYMYI|4.0|There are already hundreds of opinions and interpretations of the film, its acting, directing and influences via film noir, so I will dispense with those and focus solely upon the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray<br /><br />Once you get past the first few scenes displayed as gritty and grainy as the characters of the film, you are presented with a stunning transfer of the video to BluRay and your home screen.  The film must have been remastered as my Standard Def version doesn't look nearly as good.  The colors of the city, the skin tones and contrast are all beautifully rendered for your home theater.  The whites appear as if they were 95 IRE and really brings home the excellent contrast on this blu ray version.  Once past those opening scenes where the grain and grit is clearly deliberate,  there are no artifacts or ghosting of any kind and no noticeable or distracting grain that wasn't meant to be there.  5 Stars for the movie and 5 stars for the video transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />The Audio is DTS HD MA 5.1 and the lossless audio clearly makes a heck of a difference.  All audio levels are nicely balanced and the dialogue doesn't fight with the musical score which is mostly a soft jazz.  The score is very nicely spread across the front stage and the separation of instruments is in a very comfortable stereo spread.  The audio of the film is the only reason why I dropped this film down a star to 4.  There is no use of your rear channels or even the front left and right channels, nor your sub LFE channel at all.  Even during the shooting scene at the movie's end, where a gun shot should have been placed via a discreet channel, all the action, all the dialogue and all, except for the jazz score, is coming down your center channel.  Not clear on why they did not use any directionality for the many foley effects but that is the only negative.<br /><br />There are more extras with this Blu Ray than you can sit through at one time tho I did sit through many.  The BR also contains all the extras that were on the original release plus lots more including several still shots on a nice quality paper with the DVD's case.<br /><br />While I might not watch this film again for another year, I am very glad to have the upgrade to Blu Ray as it is heads and tails superior to the Standard Def version I bought a few years ago, plus, you can't beat the inexpensive price.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksalso contains all the extras that were on the original release plus lots more including several still shots on a nice quality paper with the DVD's case.<br /><br />While I might not watch this film again for another year, I am very glad to have the upgrade to Blu Ray as it is heads and tails superior to the Standard Def version I bought a few years ago, plus, you can't beat the inexpensive price.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Saying this is a coming of age story just doesnt cover it. This movie is great and shows the difficulty of a teenager in high school facing pressure from his parents and just wants to get away from it all. This film would be great for people of the relating age group and even adults alike.

B001GXF2YY|4.0|Great read not too flow just enought movement with the story line to keep you interested in where the different characters play their roll
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I'm not one who usually reviews casual games, but despite the fact that this is a very standard run and gun I can't seem to put this game down. Its my &#34;go-to&#34; when I have a couple minutes to kill. It has continuous goals and achievements that assist in leveling up. Well made and enjoyable in small bursts, I have zero complaints about this one.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I've been playing this on my kindle fire and its already so outdated that I can't visit my friends towns and do quests that way! the only reason I don't just start over on another device is that I spent money on this version and my save doesn't transfer over to a new device. So either fix the updates on the kindle or give us the option to move our games to another device
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I was very pleased with the quality of the blu-ray transfers on these films. There are no cracks or pops in the soundtrack that I could pick up at all, which was certainly not the case with my original DVD copies (goodness, how bad was that copy of Holy Grail?!?) and the picture was really well restored. The packaging was really well done too. I am super pleased with this collection!<br /><br />If I were to have a complaint, it would be that I didn't find the bonus content as enjoyable as I have with other collections that I have picked up from Paramount, but I'm likely in the minority. I would have been more excited about a full commentary track instead of the snippets of set footage, but that is 100% personal preference.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I noticed a very minor error in the author's recounting of a true story. He wrote about the B17's radio operator's fondness for his radio equipment and it's tubes, transistors and chips. Tubes yes, but transistors and microchips belong to later eras of technology. This sounds like nitpicking, but it raises a question about how readily the author embellished the story with further mistaken facts. Aside from the question of authenticity of minor technical points and probable fictionalized conversations, the book is generally a highly interesting read. I am amazed that so many men from all combatant countries continued to fly into battle to face a highly probable chance of a horrifying painful death.
B008KW43TE|4.0|Did not expect such a unique sound especially from a member of Odd Future. I am very pleased to hear such creative lyrics and sound in contrast to the usually r&b formula laced with to many rapper features and for the strippers club hop. Bottom line, buy it, its worth every penny.
B000FA5STS|3.0|This book really stretches the readers' imagination. The plot line while interesting is not believable or in any way based on reality. Fiction it is and fiction is what we got. It keeps your interest but it is too transparent as fiction. I like somewhat believable fiction.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Another attention grabbing volume carrying the main characters to a new arena with all new challenges and totally new strategies
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|monotonous dialogue.  rehash upon rehash of character emotions. We get it!  Move on!!  The plot began to get mildy interesting at the 75% marker.  I would never recommend this book.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Great. Funny. One guy I love to read by far. I swear I grew up with guys just like him
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I like Tom Clancy. Interesting story, current and well researched and written as always. I have read all of Clancy's stuff and while this is not one of his best, it is still interesting. The actions of the characters are many times out of the realm of reality but it is fiction.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone. It's a great way to learn about Greek mythology and its just a good adventure book. I have read the series about 5 times. I just absolutely love it. :)
B009PJ1Q82|4.0|James Sallis is undoubtedly an excellent author. He has a way of writing that is both languorous and compelling at the same time; however he can also be confusing, ponderous and minimalist - which are not necessarily criticisms. This tells the story of an ageing, ailing, Vietnam veteran, hit man, who is on his last `hit', when someone gets there first. Christian finds it strange that such a lowly target was picked in the first place (a low grade run of the mill accountant) and the fact that someone gets there first and messes up.<br /><br />He is being investigated by Detective Sayles, whose wife is also dying, he becomes obsessed with finding the guy after being left a cryptic clue involving the ambiguous, internet selling of `dolls'. Add to the mix a young teenage boy, whose parents have abandoned him, and who is surviving by selling second hand tat on the internet, and you have a strange triumvirate, that sort of becomes a crime novel. Oh and Jimmie the young lad, is also having the dreams that belong to Christian the hit man.<br /><br />This is a short book, with short and often economical chapters, some merely more than a page long. It has a quality which had me making comparisons to Cormac McCarthy, but Sallis is nowhere near his league, he seems to try to emulate the descriptive flow that McCarthy has, but he never captures the beauty of the language nor the poetry in the every day or mundane. He is though, compelling and kept me guessing, but its not what I would have termed a crime novel either. There is very little crime, the police do not exactly give Sherlock Holmes a run for his money, in terms of criminal analysis, but it does work. There is an attention to detail and the abstract that brings a humanity to the work, it will not be to everbodies taste though and is one of those books that you may glean more from on a subsequent reading. Whilst I was not bowled over, I still finished it in three sittings, so I must have been caught in its thrall. If you like off beat stories which do not hold your hand and not answer all the questions you may want, then this will be one for you.like off beat stories which do not hold your hand and not answer all the questions you may want, then this will be one for you.
B009X00E18|5.0|love it, Kindle inserts easly and cover is secured with elastic band.  The cover can be used to form a stand which works great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am addicted to temple run. it's the only game I play. I absolutely positively no doubt in mind,I love it
B003UBTX72|3.0|I thought this book was a little boring in parts, perhaps because (not being a musician myself) I didn't appreciate the sections on the history of guitar construction or music composition. Still, there were quite a few entertaining parts, so as a huge Stones fan, I'm glad I read it. I found Keith very likeable.
B00ACHXHII|4.0|I have not heard this set yet, though I do plan to order it.  I have heard some of its contents in LP, and I must say Constantin Silvestri is one of my candidates for world's ten must underappreciated conductors.  However, this is not, as labelled, Constantin Silvestri's complete EMI recordings.  These are his complete non-collaborative recordings.  If you want to hear the piano concerto recordings he made with Samson Francois or the Beethoven Violin Concerto he did with Yehudi Menuhin, for example, you will have to get the EMI complete boxes for those artists.  But, this is still a must for all those who find Silvestri an important and interesting conductor, and that definitely includes me.
B000URWYTS|5.0|What a thorough perspective on a complicated woman who has been &#34;done wrong&#34; in history. I loved it, related to it, did not want the inevitable end to come.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|Wow, it has merit! Spotted this when I went looking for the &quot;Elephant&quot;(EVERNOTE), which I found, but this does what I have tried to do with another app, and couldn't. I found it about 12 hours ago as in 10:23pm so I can't say it's gr8, or  a dud! Sure like the heart being (pink) though! Could have been red! Still would be playing with it
1594744769|5.0|Very imaginative and unique story. Very good at creating great visual images in your head.  This is a fun little book that you read in between other &#34;serious&#34; novels.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game but it does have glitches!<br />Also it crashed and started me back at the beginning!  It is fun<br />so right now I am going with it but if I get that far again or further<br />And have to start over I won't play it again!!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I have every CD that Andrea has released and have never been disappointed.  This CD is a winner again.  The songs are beautiful and I can listen to over and over again.  You won't be sorry with this purchase.  Andrea - please keep them coming.
B003Y3AZSW|5.0|I love this set as it matches all my stainless steel appliances plus fits flush against the wall taking up a minimal amount of space.  I can use one board for poultry and not worry about cross contamination.  Also they are very clean as they fit nicely in my dishwasher.  Much better than the usual plastic boards that are unsightly.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found the three books very hard to put down. I was not sure if I would really like them but found them fascinating .  Once started..impossible to ignore, completely satisfied with myself for reading th series.  Now to find something else as riveting.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This is a funny, entertaining and date I say even a bit heartwarming movie. They really pulled it off and made it suitable and enjoyable for anyone in the room. I love how my three year old will actually grow up not scared of monsters bc he'll be so used up laughing at them in movies like this and Nightmare Before Xmas.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Fast paced and addictive! You will love the story of Ethan and Lena and their love for each other that seems to have road blocks at every possible turn...

0385528752|5.0|One of the best books I have read listened in recent times.<br />Change is hard. But Change has some patterns. By Providing guidance to your rational mind (riders), emotional mind (elephants) and shaping the path (environment) you can definitely speed up the change process.<br /><br />A well structured book with clear narration.<br />\\"Change is not an event. It is a process\\"<br /><br />A must read for anyone who wants to change their company, lifestyle or even society (perhaps)
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Just another mass market piece of fiction. It is poorly written. Each character speaks with the same voice despite representing cultures from around the world and their stories are almost offensively stereotypical. The zombie tale is clearly outlined but the human factor is missing. None of the characters seem to be disturbed or scared or sad at losing family members. Each \\"interview\\" recounts facts without much emotion. I sludged through until the end but it was a waste of my time. I wouldn't recommend.
B0093LINT2|5.0|this is a DIY computer - so if you are not sure what you are doing - move on and save the headache. but if you do know or you are willing to learn - it's a nice little computer - everything you need to run your TV, or whatever - this one didn't have a Ethernet but for about $30 you can add wifi/Bluetooth- I chose an USB wifi - which works - but the internal one is probably better and frees up a USB port. added the 128 Gig drive most people suggest. fast and silent - not sure but probably pulls about 40watts. Add a wireless keyboard/mouse too.  I've installed Windows 8 and I've even install Hyper-V to play with Linux while I watch Scooby Doo reruns - (pure bliss). again not for everyone but if you know what it is or think you know - you want it.
1589949811|5.0|Nifty game, decent price.  Solo play works real well.  Looking forward to trying a few of the expansions. Would recommend Youtube tutorials as the rulebook is a bit tough to soak in all in one (or two) readings.  Good sound mechanics.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books are some of the best I've read in a long time. The story is what drags you in but the characters keep you there! I absolutely loved every minute and I don't usually revisit books, but this had so many elements, it's definitely worth rereading!
0385344228|4.0|At first I was put off by the style, seemed slow, but then I became anxious to get back to the book.  I had to resist looking at the ending............you wanted to know!!!  Resist the urge, it is worth the wait. I have ordered, from Amazon, the other two books by this author and looking forward to reading them.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|Haven't played Mahjong for a long while, couldn't figure this game out.  Sure the game is great, just me not understanding it
1616614609|4.0|This is more of a cautionary tale than a review, but I feel that potential customers must be made aware of 3(THREE) things before they make a purchase decision:<br /><br />1)  This game is a card game in the same vein as Magic: the Gathering, Thunderstone, and Pokemon. This is not a \\"one-and-done\\" purchase. The game gets better the more cards you have. But there is also a problem with this...<br /><br />2) You need more than just one box. Because it can be customized(as the above examples can) and because Netrunner has VERY SPECIFIC deckbuilding rules, it must be noted that the decks inside the box can be best describled as \\"barely playable\\", especially on the Corporation side of the ball. With only the contents of ONE(1) box at your disposal, merely CHOOSING WHICH CORPORATION you wish to play LOCKS UP TO TEN CARDS in your deck that you CANNOT CHANGE while maintaining a rules-legal deck. When the game premiered at 2012 GenCon, it sold out in minutes as people were buying 2 & 3 boxes at a time JUST to be able to customize their decks for play.<br /><br />3) Unlike other card games as above, this is STRICTLY a two-player affair. No amount of rules adjustment will allow for more that two players to play at a time. On the same side, no amount of rules adjustment will allow you to play this by yourself. Before purchase, ensure (as I did) you have AT LEAST one other person to play this game with you, or ensure your moth ball supply is up to par.<br /><br />As a side note, I recommend www.amazon.com/Android-Netrunner-Lcg-What-Ahead/dp/1616615451/ref=pd_sim_t_1 as of the available data pack expansions, it contains the most new Corporation cards to better customize your deck (side-side note: as of this posting, Amazon.com has none available, and no re-stock information. So good luck with that.)

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game reminds me a lot of facebook games, use resources and energy to do tasks like train or feed your horse. It is fun as long as that iscwhat you are looking for. Sort of like a horse version of farmville. For a free game its not a bad way to waste a few minutes.  :)

B000001DVD|5.0|Def Leppard was originally a great Rock 'n Roll Band...one of the best. Then they changed into a pop band with a few decent songs. This release is their best rock in spite of the fact that Mutt Lange did such a great job with Pyromania. When I want to listen to DL, this is what I listen to. My only regret is wondering just how great of a R 'n R band these guys could have been if their original lineup had stayed in tact.
B0043D2FB2|3.0|I was actually very happy with most of the material and even most of his interpretations. But then he started to try to sell the belief that Buddhism is atheistic in nature.<br />Now I know that many atheists actually do Buddhist practices like meditation, deep inner reflection, and trying to concur desires but the truth is Buddhism is not atheistic the texts constantly talk about janas and jans i think that's how it was said. but the point is they constantly talk of Indian gods and yes they are Indian you can tell by the way they talk. Also no Atman or Atman doesn't really matter because life force is life force and though it may be different when you get down to it it is bastically a soul, and I know plenty of you will argue about that with me but I have read up on pretty much the majority of all the beliefs in all the religions and yes life force is the same as soul. I mean if Buddhism didn't believe in a soul to some point it would not need all this life force crap eighter.<br />I would suggest to all people looking in to this spiritually to look up Jainism there is a lot of misconceptions about Jainism but I found it to be a much less contradicting belief.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I would suggest that only true fans purchase this set in that it is way too pricey to buy for your kids to only have them watch one disk and have the rest set on the shelf from now to eternity. Nonetheless, the video quality seems to be very good.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Addictive. surprised many older players. They are the ones who play for months or years. There is a forum where they chat and become friends. folks from all over the world play.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am still playing this game even though i have almost all the dragons. Max level etc. You will become so addicted you will try to get all of your family members playing just so you can get more gems!
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I am just amazed by the singing and quality of this TV show.  I watched the whole season in 3 nights - couldn't stop!  I am so impressed with the actors and actresses in this show - just excellent.  If you haven't seen this, you don't know what you're missing.  Much better than Glee, the other &#34;musical&#34; show out there which I have watched from the start.
B005LAII1C|1.0|All the hype had me so excited to watch this movie. Too much about the love story between Ted and mila kunis and not enough of the Ted story. I was very dissapointed with this movie. It has been my biggest movie dissapointment in a generation!
B0099G4Y26|4.0|There are a couple of really weak songs on this album (Just Give Me a Reason and, ironically, The Truth About Love), but the album is highly enjoyable.  I don't understand the criticism over the language.  The explicit label is there for a reason! There is some cursing, but it's definitely not over the top.  The album also deals with sexual issues (mostly, but not always in a sex-positive way), so it's not really appropriate for children.  However, if those things do not offend you, this is a fun, upbeat album with tons of replay value.  Highly recommended.
B008602KQI|2.0|I don't know if you have read running man and then watched the movie but the same happened for this. The things they omitted and changed to me ruined it. Maybe if I had not read the books first it would have been better.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved the series. Especially books 2 and 3.  I am sad they are done. I look forward to the movies!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I used this to convert my RS 232 to USB for loading firmware onto Propietary circuit boards. This cord worked great and I have used it with up to windows 7.
0060853972|5.0|I got hooked on Neil Gaiman awhile back, and have yet to be disappointed by anything he has done. Read this book-and then read anything else that he has written.
B009RH973I|4.0|Works well does as advertised. They now come with a charging hole. Sadly the one i bought for me did not but i liked it well enough to get another for the Kindle i bought for my mother.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This is a fun game once you get past the thought about how this could easily be a true world reality.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Snooze fest overdone with horrible acting. I can not imagine why this was so popular a movie but I watched it once and gave it away.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|After seeing this title on every &#34;Top Ten Recommended Teen Books&#34; list I came across, I decided I needed to read it.  I'm glad I did.  I loved the character development and snappy dialogue!  Chuckled out loud several times, cried several times.  I have recommended this book to many of my students.  Even my son read it and loved it!  Don't miss reading this one!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie but you need to have watched all the others in the genre from this movie company to get the full benefits of how good it actually is.
0439023513|5.0|it seemed i waitted a long time for delivery but i went with standard- shipping -costs more than the book---everything was just as stated and well worth it.i will do it over and over again  thank you for keeping books in my life
B009ANP4F4|4.0|I love to see movies similar to this one. Although there wasn't any famous actresses and/or,actors I still enjoyed it thoroughly.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put the book down!!!!  I loved it.  This is a very hot and passionate story.  Finally, a book that captures the hidden desires of many women and men.
034580404X|5.0|Amazing books!! Just couldn't seem to put them down. I hope they come out with more books like this. I would so love it if they would make more books to these 3!!
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Great, this is a good product and I am only filling this out because Amazon keeps bothering me to do it.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I LIKED THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE SETTINGS ARE DIFFERENT DAYS. I ALSO LIKED THE BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS VERY FUNNY. THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ.:)
B004RKC4PI|4.0|The CD collection is great. These are some of my favorite Aerosmith songs. I already owned all the songs, just not on the same CD. The only problem was the CD jewel case arrived cracked in several places. Jewel case was not as tough as the love!
1609611543|5.0|The information in this book has been very helpful. Since I started to eliminate all wheat products, I have been losing weight.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|My friends and family loved this movie, and i knew i had to get the soundtrack. It is great music to work out to!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The music is great and I can listen to it when ever I want. Would recommend this to everyone who enjoys the music.
B0072X2O66|5.0|Just an unreal combination of musicians with the drum master Mike Portnoy leading the charge. This album contains an excellent mix of pounding progressive riff heavy rock with a couple ballads. The remaking of an old Duran Duran song is top-notch. Russell Alan is absolutely BRILLIANT! One of the best rock singers of all time. Combine that with the unique guitar work provided by a tricky/flashy Mike Orlando who can pound out 64th notes without trying and you have the best heavy rock album made in 2012.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good read by David Baldacci. I am a huge Baldacci fan and read all of his books. This one is written in typical Baldacci fashion. Even though the plot seemed to be something that I had read in another book or seen in a movie previously, it was still a very engaging book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game!! The graphics and images looked so real. I love any kind of hidden objects game. I would love to see a sequel to this game.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the best &#34;been there, done that&#34; books on the war in Iraq. A good blend of action and personal struggles back home. It's a tragedy that Kyle was murdered before he had an opportunity to do more for veterans. He was a good soul and will be missed by many.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think this game is amazing it's got good graphics and its fun to do at your own time I think they should add great Britain for the world tour I'm not going to put full stars until u add great Britain thanks
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well-written and offers hope for all of us as we age and face death.  It encourages us to be who we are and live without fear, even while we seek to grow in our capacity to love and focus on what is most important in life.
146500632X|5.0|Its a calendar. The Product is pretty good. I would buy again. Good value for the price. I would recommend.
1906735875|5.0|What is there to say, it's the very first Judge Dredd stories ever. Sure, they are cheesy and a bit immature, but they give a great insight into how Dredd evolved into one of the most iconic comic anti-heroes ever.<br />Love it, and so happy they are bringing all of the stories out for the US audience
0062213423|5.0|My daughter liked it. The Product is pretty good. I would buy again. Good value for the price. I would recommend.
B004BSFC46|3.0|Good stitching, but I can see where the velcro that keeps the bracelet on would wear out by the time one kid got through with these.  Also, as a toy that is supposed to stimulate, my baby couldn't care less about these guys.  He'd rather chew on his blanket or his glowworm.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book beyond words...and that's saying something.  The storyline was fantastic.  It had so many unexpected twists.  More importantly, they were realistic twists.  There were a few times I actually laughed out loud at Sky's humor.  Loved it from cover to cover!!!
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|little twist on a calssic arcade game. fun to pass the time with because who doesn't love playing classic pac-man
B007BFSYMS|5.0|the sounds are very realistic and the quality is extremely good.  it is very soothing to listen to when blocking out other sounds.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The dark knight series have been my favirite of the Batman movies. Maybe because of the chicago filming or Christian Bale as the lead but you will enjoy it
B009MO57H6|5.0|If you have followed teh Resident evil games since their inception,this is just another great movie in the line of Movies based on the video game. Many I see do not like it, but they must not be RE fans.This movie is action from start to end. It is exactly the way it should be and the script for this design is perfect. Another great Movie, I will add to my collection of RE memoribilia......can not wait for the next installment which I hope is more sooner than later.
B00406UK7S|5.0|This is one of my favorite battle movies ever!! Hardcore, realistic battle scenes. The whole movie is very realistic and well filmed! NOT a cheesy fantasy film!! Hardcore bad asses running for their lives from a ruthless brutal army that has a gorgeous but ruthless tracker who has a special kind of hatred toward the Roman army for killing her family and cutting out her tongue as a child so that she may never speak badly against Rome. If you enjoy movies like 300, Iron Clad and Gladiator, you will enjoy this movie! I own well over 500 movies and this is in my top ten!
B005LAII62|5.0|This is an absolute Great Movie.I loved it as did my daughter.This is one of those movies you can watch over and ver and it not get old. Loved every minute of it. Highly recommend this for the entire family.
0307887960|4.0|but it didn't motivate me.  Maybe too many words and not a great deal of substance.  Guess I need to work at it a lot more - but this book will hopefully help.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Did not like the writing style. Struggled through first half, took til the second half to get invested in the story. Did a lot of just skimming in the first half. Would not read any other books by this writer.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|All i can say is its a classic. Watching it in color is like watching a new movie, definitely recommend anyone that has seen it in black and white to watch it in color, or even if you haven't seen it before to give it a shot i don't think you will be disappointed .
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Beginner and super slow is good for me--I love it.  It makes me feel like I can play the piano.
B009T3AHDE|5.0|I liked the movie very much. i think it is impossible to describe it. It was very very weird. The limo was cool.
B008458O3S|3.0|But the app closes automatically after every 6 or so puzzles. I like this variation of the flow style game. I think it's a nice innovation to the genre.
