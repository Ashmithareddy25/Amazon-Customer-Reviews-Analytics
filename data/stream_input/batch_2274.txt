B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It gave me hope that my non believing Loved ones can change their views on God and Heaven.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|We weren't too sure about this show when we first started watching but now we absolutely love it! Already had the first season so I bought this for my boyfriends birthday we were so excited to watch it<br /> Can't wait till the next season starts up.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|You can feel the passion of Dr. Alexander's experience in his words. A great link between science and religion. It is interesting to note what he DIDN'T experience during his coma.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Absolutely love this series planning on buying all of the seasons! One of the best shows on TV today! Not recommended for children though.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I had purchased this movie as Clint Eastwood is one of my mothers favourite actors, upon seeing it, she commented that it was different than all his other movies she has seen, but it was excellent, a good storyline.
B009KEN87O|5.0|fantastic game. visuals are simply stunning. brings me back to the days when i was just a sperm in my dads epididemus
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Exceeded my expectations in every way possible.  You cannot go wrong with such a great story and having it told via video.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|Never even Gog past opening screen. Maybe I just didn't give it enuff chance but I did not like it. I love to waste time on my kindle, but this was to wasteful evn for me
B009KEN87O|5.0|fun and easy game play. reminds me of old school games like space invaders. instant classic. will definitely keep playing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really good game when ever I'm bored I just click this game.But it could be a little easier to do everything. You should be able to have a choice on what character we want like: Girl/Boy Thanks!
030758836X|2.0|I did not really enjoy this book.  It was a waste of my time.  Would have thrown it in the trash if I weren't reading it with my book club.  Crude language, not much class.
B0089OBLDO|2.0|I purchased this for the specific purpose of using my Xbox 360 Madcatz SF4 TE control stick on my PS3, for fighting games...<br /><br />...basically so I would only need to buy one expensive set of joysticks instead of two and be out $300 more.<br /><br />At first, this convertor worked great. I plugged in my stick and had marvelous response, perhaps only being off by 0.01 of a frame if at all (not that I could approximate it, just trying to convey a feeling using a number).<br /><br />However, after a few weeks, the response became HORRIBLE.<br /><br />I don't know why, or if there's some kind of accidental order in process I pulled off the first time and not thereafter, but now it just sucks.<br /><br />I push a button and a second later at least, I get a response. A real disappointment.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|This scanner really has a poor image resolution and color quality.<br />Evidently, it uses a small camera to view the slide, but it's low-resolution. Also, the white illuminating l.e.d.'s don't provide an absolute even coverage (You can see it, when there's no negative in the slide), which of course will show in the scan.<br />I expected the plexiglass negative insert to be finicky (which it is), but the plastic has defects in it's surface, which are picked up by the scanner. Dirt inside the plastic insert can't be cleaned, either (it's spot-melted together). The scan has dirt-specks you can't do anything about.<br />The color balance is WAY off, and washed-out.<br />Finally, you can't do a direct scan to PC (including viewing the image real-time). It has to be stored into the scanner (did I mention you need to buy an SD card?), then transfered via USB, through a second menu. Which means you have to leave the scanning action, and transfer the pictures, to see what you got. Then you can use an image software to correct the scan.<br />I really hoped this would be a low-cost, quality scanner, but it isn't. It's just a low-cost, low resolution scanner. It wouldn't even give small JPEGS (400x600dpi) that you could put on a website.<br />Sorry. If you want a high quality negative scanner, this unit won't satisfy you.<br />I'm surprised there were so many &#34;positive&#34; reviews (were they &#34;plants&#34;?). This is really more of a toy than a scanner.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|If you are thinking about purchasing this DVD, you must already be a fan of the show. I have been a fan since Season 1, episode 1. I own Seasons 3 and 4, plan to purchase Seasons 1 and 2 and Season 5 as soon as it becomes available. Castle is a great show. The acting is very good, especially Stana Katic's portrayal of Detective Kate Beckett is flawless. She can make you cry, she can make you laugh. She's also so amazingly beautiful, you don't mind looking at her for all 43 min. of each episode. I guess you can say I am a fan. Nathan Fillion is perfect as Richard Castle, and the rest of the supporting cast make this show as great as it is. If you want a combination of a procedural with some comedy and romance, this is the show for you. However, I would advise the buyer to start from the beginning. There is a lot going on with all these characters. They have grown and evolved over the years, and a new viewer might be a little lost without the benefit of the background stories, especially Det. Beckett. In short, I recommend all the DVD's very highly. Oh, and the quality of the product is also great. No complaints here.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Interesting storyline, cool graphics, fun puzzle's. Nice adventure game but there are better point and click adventures out there. Wish there was an accompanying walkthrough, I've been stuck for a while now. I'm sure I can figure it out so it's not too hard as to be maddening. Buy the game, take the journey to this twisted little town, but make sure to bring holy water or a crucifix because something evil is afoot!
B004AGI2L4|5.0|Love the movie. It's very entertaining. If you like action and adventure then this movie is what you need to watch.
B003M6G86E|5.0|What can I say I'm a big fan of this show.  Love the characters and the actors.  I find it moving, funny and even educational.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is the kind of game I like.  Neat graphics, easy to grasp gameplay and mindless fun.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but isn't the whole point of a voxel to present data in three dimensions?  Seems kinda pointless to code it for three dimensions when it's clearly a 2D shooter.  Whatever, it works and is great fun.
B00942Y94I|3.0|Ok so I liked the books, not great litature, but ok.  The movies are also ok.  I would have liked to have had them more in line with the book.  Despite the bad acting... or maybe because of the bad acting...I still enjoyed the movie
B004GYOQ6A|3.0|These labyrinth games are a challenge, but in my experience the sensitivity of the tilt sensor in my phone was set too high and it made it exceedingly difficult to navigate the ball through anything but the most basic of boards.  I'd definitely recommend trying the free version first to see how well you can manage with your phone or tablet's sensors.
B008QTV3X0|1.0|I finally was able to purchase Homeland and was anxious to watch it. After all of the great critical acclaim and the stamp of approval from Obama, I expected more - a LOT more. There have been plenty of shows on prime-time TV with much more to offer. Take away Showtime's ability to add as much sex, profanity, teen drug use and all of the other stuff that the big four can't air, and all you are left with is a measly skeleton of a show that becomes more predictable with every episode.<br /><br />If you want to take a chance on Homeland, buy it on a format you can return (I bought the digital download, so I'm stuck). Better yet, rent it. But if you really want to watch a series with something to say about society post 9/11, watch Battlestar Galactica instead. It has a LOT more meat on the bone.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|The time I spent playing and checking the game's features was enjoyable, but it seems more geared towards the 'cutesy' end of the spectrum.  This on a tablet would probably be a great game for younger kids, but for me, a so-called adult?  it didn't light any fires.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|THis show is everything I want to see in a British drama. And then some. Plus the music is gorgeous.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|Definitely a game that'll give maximum fun on a tablet, but it also works fairly well on a phone.  The controls are pretty smooth, as is gameplay.  Didn't find any lag or issues during my time at the helm.  I'm all about time killers that are quick to grasp and can be picked up and put down quickly, and this fits the bill.  It might get old quick in long term play, but for a short diversion, it's a pretty good choice.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|If you liked X-Files, you'll love this one. Grabbing your attention right from the start, and then it becomes only more interesting.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|It's not that the graphics are bad (they aren't) or the gameplay is too easy or hard (it's about in the middle), it's just that these types of games just don't hold my attention for long.  Paranormal Agency is no exception, despite the intriguing backstory and setup.  Of my two devices (Samsung Galaxy S Showcase and HTC Droid DNA) it didn't work very smoothly on either one and crashed a time or two on the Showcase.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My husband loved the series and he can't wait for the next season to get here.  His only negative comment was that he was &#34;disappointed&#34; in the ending.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Look, if you're looking fast actin' shoot 'em up action, this is the wrong game for you.  It's slow, methodical, Zen.  And like the original Quell game, it's going to challenge you without having you break a sweat.  Beautiful graphics and music help make this one of the best puzzle games in the entire app store.
B00000K3UU|1.0|A year before Johnny Knoxville even dreamed about trying to kill himself, Adam Sandler came up with the idea of flushing his brain down the toilet before jackass did. Big Daddy has Sandler living the contemporary American dream by living off of somebody else. Somehow he got a girlfriend (she probably felt sorry for him). Tired of him being such a loser, she dumps him. Somehow he ends up taking care of a kid who doesn't talk in order to prove he is responsible to get his girlfriend back. The kid doesn't respond to anything until Sandler accidently gets run over by a car. The way the kid laughs at people's possible injuries, he would probably have an orgasm if someone died. After he realizes the kid's potential, and starting him out at a young age, Sandler gives him full-on loser training. He continues entertaining the kid featuring a stick placed strategically in a skater's path with him tumbling down and practically breaking his neck. I heard a rumor that suspected terrorists at Guantanimo are subliminally tortured with Adam Sandler movies and makes them beg for water boarding. Sandler eternally becomes known as the original jackass as he trips, falls, and no matter what he does or says, there is always people proving their low I.Q.'s by showing up in droves for his movies as they chew bubble gum and text message all the way through. After &#34;Big Daddy&#34;, the media exploded with real and fake versions of intentional, predictable, bodily harm resulting in a new sensation of people having to break bones, or bleed to make us laugh. I guess we got too bored with regular comedy. The vhs of &#34;big daddy&#34; needs to be pan and scan, mono audio, black and white, with no chance for a dvd release, but unfortunately it is on dvd.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock has been very dependable. Not much more to say than that...short, sweet and to the point...OH, you can customize it to and have several alarms set for several reason...I'm up to 4 so far...
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Anti-Spoiler: If you are unfamiliar with the story of the six American citizens who escaped from the U.S. Embassy during the hostage crisis in Tehran, 1980, it might work better if you do not read any more beforehand in order to save some element of surprise. Either way, however, ARGO is quite gripping, and the information declassified in 1997 should be significantly interesting to all. Even those who already know how the basic story comes out should find human interest and a compelling narrative in the details of how it all apparently occurred.<br /><br />Many have complained that ARGO has a made-for-television feel to it. I agree, and consider that one of the film's strongest points. It's easy to understand why many who are used to today's expertly hypertech film production are disappointed or at least dismayed by ARGO's atmosphere. Its subject is neither \\"current\\" nor what most of us consider \\"history.\\" Ergo, the straightforward and unsensationalized cinematography helps to capture the mood of these events and also contributes to the time setting, i.e., really harks back to 1980.<br /><br />Excellent script: Especially insofar as the CIA and State Department are concerned, it made me think, \\"That's how the talks must have gone.\\" The news bits and reenactments of the demonstrations in Tehran are equally mesmerizing. There were times when I wished for subtitles of all the chanting and other Iranian dialogue, but at the same time, I like the way ARGO allows room for anyone not fluent in Farsi to sense the gist of it all.<br /><br />Though his acting performance is plastic indeed, Affleck's direction of this film is truly fine, and the acting by most of the other major players, particularly those who play the would-be hostages and those who play the various Iranians, is good and often great.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Boring movie, unnecessary nudity.  Even the well known stars do not help this movie.  I'm usually a fan of Jaoquin Phoenix, but not this time!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|There were two occasions that the episode stopped and reloaded towards the end.  The picture was a little hazy and grainy every once in awhile when the scene changed.  But I loved being able to watch this season on the computer.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book.  Loved the perspectives from both....and the ending was so cool..not knowing is always such a fun ending
B004LZFWJO|1.0|Wish Kindle could install Facebook version! Kindle game doesn't keep you at the level you earned - have to start back at Level 1?
B008VBYN80|5.0|I got it to burn down time before I went to a friends house and ended up playing it there to!Then played it with him when he downloaded it and we used wifi.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is great! One of my favorite Sparks books Ive ever read. His books are excellent and the digital and convenient way on kindle makes it a plus.
0765325950|5.0|I waited a long, long time to hear &#34;the rest of the story&#34;.<br />Sanderson did a good job finishing Jordan's book.
073937771X|5.0|Loved this book!  This is a great set to read from Stieg Larsson.  Would recommend it to everyone.  This is a must read!
B0050PYNOY|5.0|Deschanel is hot, Portman is hotter still, Franco does a good comedic turn and McBride is debauched and fun to watch.  But I think that Hardiker steals the movie as Courtney.  it's a really good fun movie to watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|very classy and fantastic drama and season 3 ended with unexpected and tragic turn.<br />I enjoyed the sensible, witty conversation between characters and lovely costumes and settings.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I really hope that they do the rest of the Salander stories with Rooney Mara.  She just absolutely made this movie for me.  I enjoy watching it repeatedly looking for more details and plot notes.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Great album. Definitely worth the purchase. I can listen to the entire album without skipping a song. Happy Justin's back.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I read this book when it first came out and it is amazing. I was totally engrossed in it. I don't think I did anything for 2 days but read this book. It was very intense at times, and the end just had me jumping out of my skin. I would definitely recommend this to everyone!
B000A6EXNO|5.0|Been looking fot this eye cup, too bad my camera guy does not stock it, keeps my nose  from smudging the screen and extra light coming in from the sides.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I chose a 5 star because the show is the funniest show I've seen in years.  Characters are perfect, especially Sheldon.  I have and will in the future recommend my family and friends buying this DVD, one because I'd like to see all the stars on the show make a lot of money and two, because I don't want to share my DVD for fear of it getting damaged!!!!  Shipment was quick and price was great.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Shirley Nebel
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|There just are not words to describe how amazing this album is.  Mumford and Sons never disappoints.  Great work guys!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I think mystery manor is a very good game with lots of rooms and mysteries to discover and win you can have friends to and you can go to their manor.
B005HSL626|5.0|When i got this i thought it would be a smaller version... ...But when i played it, it was the full game! So really get this app.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Exciting movie, never stops moving from the time it starts, until the movie is over.  Looking for a action movie for a Friday Night,<br />This is it!  Highly recommended!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This series gives an excellent feel for the first world war and England as it was during the war.  Great cast.
B009MO5G90|3.0|&#34;Resident Evil:Retribution&#34;(2012) directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Alien vs Predator, Death Race) is the fifth movie in the Resident Evil series. The movie takes place mostly inside a computer generated world that is located underwater in the Arctic Circle. This movie seems to be somewhat a departure from previous films in the series being more sci-fi action than horror. Upon first viewing this film in 2D I didn't feel that this film was particularly captivating given its rather generic characters and predictable plot, but watching it in 3D I just can't get enough of it. This is a fun, visually rich film which takes us through a myriad of environments. For those with 3D you'll be smiling from beginning to end as the images are enthralling and spectacular. This movie is a visual treat with beautifully directed and constructed environments which moves quickly from scene to scene without boring the viewer. Obviously a lot of money and thought was put into the visuals of this film, and the limited characters and story line really in the end don't seem to matter too much. Like a beautiful painting one just wants to gaze at its marvellous images.<br /><br />Other recommendations for movies in 3D are Prometheus, Tron, Underworld:Awakening, Avatar, The Avengers, and Alice in Wonderland.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|The nude scenes are a little different, but all in all it was a desent story line. Seeing all the girls come back at the end shows how someone who is &#34;special&#34; can effect your life in more ways then just the &#34;sex sessions&#34;
B008PE9GSA|4.0|if you love 70's-'90's ZZ Top - catch these guys live at at venue near you!...their sound system is guaranteed to blow the balls off a charging rhino at 50 paces!...this is the best 70's-'90's ZZ Top cover band touring the planet right now!
B006HGXGWU|2.0|Curtis (Michael Shannon) has dreams, visions, and panic attacks that show him a terrible storm is coming.  Neither his wife (Jessica Chastain) nor any of his friends/relatives/co-workers have these dreams/feelings so poor Curtis is left to feel that he has gone crazy.<br /><br />He sees a psychiatrist, visits his schizophrenic mother, and researches and builds a storm shelter just in case the dreams turn out to be real.<br /><br />His wife gets frustrated with the obsession with the storm shelter as she is trying to get hearing implants for the couple's deaf daughter.<br /><br />This movie drags on and on and not much happens.<br /><br />If you're okay with watching a character study of schizophrenia, this film might work for you.<br /><br />If not, you may be disappointed.<br /><br />If looking for a recommendation for an interesting albeit bleak apocalyptic film, you may want to check out \\"The Road\\" with Viggo Mortensen.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great app and lots of fun. Didn't realize this great of graphics were in a free game. I strongly suggest downloading it.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|My nephew recommended this movie to us and we were very happy we followed up on this one. The story is based on a true story and captures the relationship between a wealty, paralyzed man and his unlikely caregiver. It was such a joy and so inspiring to see the affect each character had on the other. The movie is French and so does have subtitles, but it is not terribly dense paragraphs to read. After we were a few minutes in, I almost forgot that I was reading, that is how much the story draws you in. I noticed the genre was comedy/biography, which though that is true, it is much more. That being said, you will laugh out loud! I have found myself thinking back on this movie and have recommended it to several people. My nephew was so moved (he works in the healthcare industry), that he has decided to purchase the movie. It really is that good. Watch this one, you won't be sorry!
B002QKZLZ6|2.0|don't need.....never use.  just an extra accessory that came with my headset.<br />Sits in my desk drawer along with my pet rock.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is the best because it has surf boards in it and soo much cooller stuff like jetpacks.
1594744769|3.0|It was a good fun book but the Writer didn't seem to know what to do once he found the children. Up to that point I thought the book was very good. Between the poor villain and badly executed love story I went from eagerly filliping reading each page to slogging through it. However the ending implied that the next book in the series may be better as they now have an actual conflict. Bottom line may be a weak opening to great book series or it may continue to reveal in mediocrity.
B004EPYZTE|5.0|Many of times I have watched a film that was a box-office flop go on to become a revered cult classic: Citizen Kane,Dune, Fight Club, Flash Gordon, Caligula,and Blade-Runner(one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made).<br /><br />The problem with Conan the Barbarian 2011 is that everyone keeps comparing it to the Conan the Barbarian 1981, both of these films are great movies in their own right. The thing that people should do is to not compare the two movies to each other, but compare them to the source material. Have any of you actually read the Conan stories written by Robert E. Howard?<br /><br />Conan The Barbarian 2011 brings Conan to his actual origin story; Howard did mention that Conan was born on a battle field and that he was an accomplished warrior before the age of 13. The bloody violence of this film captured the violence of the books. Jason Mamoa's sword choreography was far better than Arnold's swordsmanship in the original. I will admit that the main villian fell short of James Earl Jones' charismatic performance of the original. Rose Mcgowan stole the show for me in this version. The 1982 version did have one of the greatest sound tracts ever recorded.<br /><br />Conan the Barbarian 2011 is an incredible and refreshing retelling of Robert E. Howard's greatest literary hero. In time this film will get the credit it deserves, and it will become a cult classic. Personally I love both the 1982 and 2011 versions the same.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|Did not like the game.Was kind of boring to me.I didn't get the point of it. I will order a different one.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|Best one seen so far,for weather apps. I love the simple use of the app. Way to go..ppl keep up the good work
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|A bit of history and hard times, the series is easy to follow and has a great cast. Al Capone is in his early years and is well cast. The story moves quickly and has many surprises. Very entertaining.
B009KEN87O|5.0|its been a long time since I've played an old arcade game like this the games controls are simple and the goal is obvious. This game should have 10 stars in my mind
B009X01C64|5.0|great product and great uses. I would buy this product again and again. I will do business with them again!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can I say...it was great!<br />I love watching all the episodes back to back and not waiting a week in between for the next show.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|This book was the perfect combination of humor, wisdom, and the complicated nature of teenage life. Green writes in a way that binds all of these things together in a bittersweet harmony. I loved it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a really fun game u should try it if ur an animal lover. I would recommend it to anyone
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book was really good i think it was better than the maze runner. I hope the next book is as good.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This application has all the old classic look and feel plus cool new things that make it feel more new
B0083Z614S|4.0|This was a really good book. It talks about that y out can't judge a book by its cover and that you can't always hold on tothe past
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Una serie excelente bien adaptada, la presentación de esta edición superó por mucho mis expectativas, las imágenes y la cuja son increíbles
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is amazing. It not only has AMAZING graphics considering its for kindle, but an awesome multiplayer. Plus since it has no chat, there is no inappropriate talk. An overall amazing game with endless days of fun (I've been glued to my kindle screen since I got it)
B009KEN87O|5.0|Downloaded as a part of the free app of the day. I've only played a little bit so far, but I'm loving this game. It's a fun little twist on some of the arcade classics. Levels are done nice and sensibly, so I don't feel forced to marathon through the game.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Movie was educational, intriging and exciting, keeping you on the edge of your seat as it played out the drama. Very good!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've owned these headsets twice. I sold them the first time because I didn't game as much and didn't use them. I bought them at a great price last year ($70) and again was not disappointed! Highly recommend as I have purchased and returned 5 different headsets over the past 2 months and still nothing really comes close to these!
B004478GNI|5.0|This product was purchased as a gift for my grandson age 8. He loved it and put it together in no time at all.
B00886XQO0|3.0|I wasn't too impressed with this headset, I wanted a completely wireless solution for gaming and I got it with this headset, no doubt. However, the sound, while loud, sounded like everything was happening in front of my face and not in a the surround sound that I thought I was getting. Even with the presets and surround sound angles (which made things kind of worse) I just was not satisfied. I have a pair of X41's that i had to go back to and the difference was night and day. The Tango's just sounded muffled, noisy not crisp and clear. I loved the wireless features, the bluetooth and pairing worked without any problems but I just couldn't get past the poor surround sound...or lack thereof.
0440422973|2.0|I thought this skimpy little volume pretty good until it utterly broke down when the Kranks could not tell their 23-year-old daughter about the cruise.  How ridiculous!  Wouldn't she have been flattered that they couldn't spend Xmas without her?  And the pressure from all the neighbors?  Would they really be like that?  Skipping Xmas is not a bad idea to me.  But of course, on page 167, the line about how dark was Enrique going to be, and how relieved they were when he was not at all, raised hackles and displays Grisham's Mississippi roots rather nakedly.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game reminiscent of space invaders. Easy to control. Installed without any problem and doesn't take a lot of space.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|Watch Alien, now watch Prometheus.  Beyond the great cast and expensive effects, this film is let down by a wafer thin plot and poor direction.  It just doesn't have the excitement, pacing, or character development of Alien to which it was often compared.
B0012X6FR6|5.0|Buy this now if you like Jazz and Bill Evans. it will be a worthwhile addition to your collection. You can believe it from a collector.
0446547573|3.0|Set in idyllic Southport, North Carolina, Safe Haven centers on the budding relationship between Alex Wheatley, a widowed grocery store owner with kids, and Katie, a timid young woman with a secret. What starts as a friendship naturally develops into mutual attraction. Just as Katie thinks she's safe from her past, however, it comes rushing back in the form of Kevin, her violently jealous husband.<br /><br />To be honest, I found the characters to be unremarkable and a little bland. Alex is nothing more than a nice guy, and Kevin is a garden-variety psychopath who harkens back to Biblical scripture whenever faced with a moral dilemma. What really worked for me were the harrowing flashbacks to Katie's past, which allow us to see exactly what horrors she's running from. These alone possess enough dramatic tension that made it hard to put the book down. The ending is a bit predictable, though it does contain a sweet twist (I myself don't care for sentimentalism, but I still found myself going, \\"Aw[...]\\") Recommended for the deeply sentimental who are looking for a nice, safe read.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|If you want to heat Stan Getz with another group (The Oscar Peterson Trio), then this is want you want. I f you don't believe what Stan said about this effort with Oscar and the boys, then find something else. But as a person who likes Stan and Oscar, I say get it in your collection.
B00BLGDFH2|5.0|This soundtrack features legends like Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield, and Sir Paul McCartney recording alongside future legend Dave Grohl. Highly recommended! Also, the companion documentary is must see for any music fan!!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love how the same actors are used and yet they don't remind you of the other characters they played. Very good acting
B005USZML4|5.0|I reccommended this series to my grandaughter.  They are so good.  great to read on vacation. I will get the next one.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|This album has been dismantled by the producer Timberland and I think Justin Timberlake should work with another producer for his next album whenever it comes out. Justin Timberlake is becoming predictable.<br /><br />First album Justified was a classic and was basically an updated version of Michael Jackson Off The Wall and gave him something to build on, but he completely ruined it with 2nd album FutureSex/LoveSounds that did not win a Grammy like his first album.<br /><br />The 20/20 Experience should have been the 2nd album because he has built on his first album because to me it continued where his first album left off and has a Michael Jackson Bad vibe, but the problem is the music does not really flow well. Too many unnecessary long tracks. I don't mind artist's putting long tracks on their albums, but make sure they are meaningful, stand out, and not forgettable like with Mirrors, which is a great song that you don't even realize or care how long it is because its enjoyable to listen to just like Gun's & Roses November Rain song.<br /><br />I just feel like something is missing from this album and all theses songs were just mashed onto one CD without considering the transitions of songs. To be fair the album does start well and promising, but gets messed up in the middle somewhere. I would not be surprised if there was another version of this album released later this year because there must have been plenty songs omitted. It would be interesting to see what songs were omitted and whether those songs would have made a better album overall. Thank God I got to preview this album free from my computer and did not waste my cash.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun to play for anyone that loves horses. It works cause you don't have to have the space for a horse. I think it is good for any age.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is another love story that just completely leaves you wanting more and more causing you to continue turning pages and keep reading. I can't wait to read the next one!!
B000YABS8E|4.0|Enjoyable, made me laugh, which is the purpose of watching it.  Great actors, Christopher Walken, Sissy Spasek.  If you like lighthearted comedies you'll like this.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|This is okay because I dont have a camera on my  kindle so I havent had a chance to play with this yet.
B000MKD9P6|3.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Not my favorite.  Actors were good, the story just didn't hold my interest, it was predictable.  Not much comedy to it.  Meryl Streep was good, she played her character so well that I really didn't like her.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely love this series. This is such a great love story and the author has a way of making you continue turning pages to see what is going to happen next.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Can't get enough of this app!!! It's only stopped on me twice. I mean that it wouldn't open the camera or the camcorder. And even then, this app has a little help thingy where it tells you how to solve the problem. There's exactly 5 problems that can be solved! The memory has never become full and I've only deleted 3. And as for those of you who rated this a 1,2 or 3 stars, open up to what this app can do. In my opinion this is an amazing app. It is the best camcorder app that has ever been on<br />a Kindle Fire HD. I don't use it for camera, but it's worked nonstop all the times that I've taken pictures on it. I know, it may seem a little boring to some people, but it WORKS. That's the thing. It's never said that the app is unable to play and shut down on me. It's always opened quickly, no dilly dally. I completely recommend this app.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is seriously addicting. Once you start you just cant stop even if some puzzles stump you it feels like you cant stop until you figure it out.
B00BFUC8RC|1.0|Boring!! !!! !!! !!! !!! !!! !!! Not much else to say about it. Uninstalled and forever in the cloud
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Very well written and directed. Acting was authentic for the time and geography. Great action and finally a movie that followed the true story line with just a few embellishments.
B007MCTTHY|1.0|Got boring real fast. Will not play this again. I prefer something a little more than this game.sent it to the cloud
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are so many reason why this book is fantastic. It is beautifully written, it's characters are fascinating and real in so many ways, it allows you to think critically and ask yourself big questions, and it moves fast enough to keep you from getting bored. It's funny and sad and brilliant. I've read it five times now and still find new things to love about it. I have 3 copies, 2 physical and one on my kindle, just so I can share this experience with them while allowing myself the experience again. I cannot recommend this book enough.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Loved reading every word. The love shared between them permeates the pages. I felt as if I was right there with them. I often wondered what Robert's journey was like after our friendship at Pratt. I regret loosing the autographed copy of William Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience that Robert & Patti gave to me. But I feel like Patti has given us all a modern version.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This was a great movie.  Really cannot wait to see Captain America Winter Solider in 2014.  This is one of Marvel's best comics.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Best movie for all ages. A true Disney movie that will have everyone laughing<br />And kids wanting to see it again & again.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|A fantastic book that's even more raw than the first. Sometimes the chapters for the more uninteresting characters led drag on and leave bored but would turn into an eventful and important piece of the story. Though Martin likes to go into immense detail with his writings it almost seems as everything is important that he writes and goes to set the mood perfectly.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Such a great family movie loved the music and all the beautiful animation and bright colors, must purchase family movie!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had seen the Movie before I started the Series. The first book was good, and I was definitely drawn in. But predictable because I knew what was coming. I enjoyed getting the extra information though. After I finished reading the first book I watched the Movie for a second time and it made the Movie Experience so much more fun! With this book I had no idea what to expect. I was consumed! Even while doing dishes I had my Kindle propped up so I could read at the same time lol Wow, just... Wow!! I laughed, I cried so hard in parts that I was angry with myself for allowing my eyes to water and keep me from reading further.  I am in love with these characters. They have become so real to me. In some ways replacing my own friends and family for a short time because I haven't gone out or had anyone over since I started reading. Lol This will be the end to this break, I need to start the third book now. ;)<br /> Even if your not an avid reader, I highly recommend this Series!!!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Watch it with my 5 year old and my 15 year old daughters with my husband, all around great family fun movie!
B005HSL626|5.0|A fast paced agility game. Testing both eye and hand coordination.  Enjoy! You need to sort the fruit from the bombs.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Recommended by a friend.  I ordered it on my Kindle  -  read it within 24 hours.  My husband then read it the next day.<br />We both thought it a great read.
B004NELBPC|1.0|a new feature now places an advertisement on top of the news story and prevents the news from being displayed.  I removed the ap; it is now useless!
B002M9WW30|5.0|I am Rocky Fans.<br />Blu-ray quality is excellent.<br />It is perfect to have all collection about them.<br />Especially the bonus disk.
1451638450|1.0|I have loved this series and reread my favorites about every year.<br /><br />I almost didn't buy this book after being disappointed by \\"Cryoburn,\\" but succumbed to temptation because the story of Ivan (and Byerly) MIGHT cause McMaster Bujold to put in a little extra effort.<br /><br />Wish I could get my money back.  I don't know whether she has lost her writing chops, or is just lazy/seduced by fan adoration, but this book is poorly plotted and stodgily written.  She ignores what could be interesting developments and slogs along with her boring protagonists.  At least they achieve what they seem to aspire for:  mediocrity.  She doesn't even make it that far.<br /><br />I'm done with shelling out money--inter-library loan from here on out (if I bother).
B000002TLX|4.0|Turns out there were more songs that I liked on<br />this one than I had ever even heard especially<br />if you want to chill out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Five star.  Was engrossed by the story concept.  I look forward to reading sequels, or prequels . Keep them coming.
B001RHPJBU|3.0|It was almost exactly what I expected; nothing spectacular<br />but nothing truly disappointing either, so it was allright<br />but nothing to write home about.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|It doesn't take long at all to get used to the prediction, since it looks at all your correspondence (with your permission, of course.)
B00BCZUAE8|2.0|I'll make this pretty simple,this album has no Heart. Most great music should move the artist & the listener in some emotional direction, track after track, minute after minute I found myself in a frozen vegetative state waiting for something exciting to happen.  Sure the production is exquisite & full of artistic flourishes, but Mr. Timberlake doesn't sing with the same passion, conviction, or vulnerability that he displayed on tracks like \\"Cry Me A River\\" & \\"What Goes Around.\\" Nor do I hear the Sexual Seduction from Future Sex Love Sounds.<br /><br />  For most of the 20/20 experience JT tried to play it too cool, too smooth, & the end result falls a little too flat.  Most songs are one note, with no musical crescendos.  The song writing isn't catchy or clever.  Suits & ties, bubble gum flavors, spaceships, we get it cute metaphors & entendres but nothing lyrically catchy or powerful.  The one thing that make Justin who he is, is the biggest reason this album disappoints, his singing. Like the title suggests, its as if Timbaland made beats for this album first & called Justin to fill in some vocals...20/20 would make for a pretty good backstage after concert jam session though but I expected more after waiting 6 years.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|This movie was good, it started slow at first then u get pull in the plot. It will keep u guessing.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|It was good but not a great movie. I guess I was expecting more.<br />But see it at least once. But not twice
B00APUTEBG|3.0|This movie was just ok. It downloaded fast,so that good. But for just passing time u can watch this movies
B00786XVOG|5.0|Saw Yanni Live in person, so this was a must buy and well worth seeing it over and over again as Yanni is a gift from God.
0240815807|5.0|This book is chock full of all the little tricks that are so basic we overlook them every time we start producing. I cannot recommend it more. The only comparison I can come up with, which honestly is unfair to this book, is with The Art of War. You can sit and digest it all at once, or just a page or two at a time. And then do it again, and again. It's a great reminder of the little things which set a mix apart.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|Excellent Movie Daniel Day Lewis and all! A must see for all Daniel Day Lewis fans.<br />Fascinating story, don't miss this one!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Enjoyable series with chemistry between the actors.  At the end of my work day, I find myself relaxing in this series' law offices.
B002RXMG00|5.0|Terrific film, suspensfull, great story development, pacing was good, all around a film that kept you on the edge of your seat back in 1960 through today.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Quickly get into game play no long intros or setup junk.  Fast casual fun that expands as you progress. Love it.
B0002SVW3O|5.0|This first record of Sigur Ros is a perfect mixture of different moods, sounds (partially dark) combined with some great music. Facing the fact that the band changed their style afterwards, maybe this is not the best recommendation for getting a first impression, 'cause &#34;Sigur Ros&#34; itself is much too complex for defining it with just one (especially this) single record.<br />&#34;VON&#34; was my first SR album a couple of years ago and it simply made me courisous and thirsty for more.<br /><br />So just sit back, listen - and dare to dive deep into the different scenes and moods of this musical masterpiece.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|It took me a little while to get used to the language, but once I got used to it the story was beautiful. I have never read these classics, so it was a wonderful change to read something different. The characters are so rich and deep. Plus the innocence is so nice
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like this game as when i am lonely it make me relax s I have a husband that only wants to watch Fox news, Or NCIS 18 hrs a day.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|We absolutely love the kindle version of this game.  My five year old son built a car with wheels all the way around, so it doesn't matter when he flips.  Too funny!
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Have to watch the movie again.  Slow in spots with a smooth increase in action and pace.  Ending was awesome setting up balance of series.
B009YU6FJM|4.0|i'm a deftones fan and I understand what to expect of them. this latest offering certainly delivers. of course, some fans may disagree and would prefer to hear something more reminiscent of previous recordings which is understandable. but as people grow, their paths and life experiences alter. this has an affect on individual's over all being. chino and the gang are no exception, hence the gradient palette of the deftones' entire catalog.<br /><br />if you're a metal fan, or someone looking for variety -give it a listen.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Totally absorbing.  Better than Book 1.  Started Book 3 as soon as I put Catching Fire down.  Totally recommend it.
0345803485|1.0|I'm speechless...I can't even call this writing. What an insult to women, men all over the world.  How does anyone relate to this garbage.  I skipped so many pages, I should have just read a summary.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I have not finished this book yet. A very good read hard to put down anxiously awaitng the ending.<br />Mini history lesson.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I like the game a lot. its old retro style with a few tweaks to the graphic engine<br />good gameplay<br />8 bit/not that true<br />fun lots of levels
B006MW3V6U|5.0|great period movie, love the characters, keeps you interested in what is going to happen next. O'Brien is a character you are waiting to see when she will slip up and get fired.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a quick, easy read. Entertaining from first page to last. The format of the book was also intriguing.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|My husband and I LOVE our platronics voyager pro bluetooth with the exception of the earpieces wear out.  Now that we can get CHEAP replacements, we love them even more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever made! It's really is worth the money! You won't disappointed! If you love designing buildings or mining or other stuff then this is the game for you!
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This is a great movie.  I thought my daughter would be scared of it, but in the 2 weeks we've owned it, she has watched it at least 10 times, no joking.  Santa is funny, well voiced by Alex Baldwin (and I'm not a fan of his, so that saying something) Hugh Jackman as the Easter Bunny is my favorite, he's got that little attitude that is funny to me.  My only concern for parents with little kids is the Boogie Man.  I don't want to do spoilers or anything like that, but I can see where some kids may find his character scary, I thought for sure my daughter would be as a 6 year old but she wasn't.  Overall, my whole family really enjoys this film, I'd love to see if they could pull off a second one that would be as good as this one.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I generally avoid movies that are made from books especially when the book is a favorite but I am glad I made an exception with the movie Life of Pi. This was so well done and completely captured the intent and beauty of the book. I only wish I saw it on the big screen instead of my kindle. I imagine it would have been spectacular. Either way I highly recommend this movie anyone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game my son loves it. He loves the movies and creating families in the game also likes scrat game
B0067R0APK|2.0|have the original AccuWeather which is much better. I hope the accuracy of it is better but I don't know yet.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|Still a style of his own, with a newer sound.  definetly there is a song for every mood! And you will noticed the wink to his earlier sound.
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|I want to view this again since the new film version w/ DeCaprio is to show in May.  I have certain expectations.  I want to see if I am right. JMM
B0043EV774|5.0|This was a wonderful movie! I was very pleased with the quality of the 3D. It was very enjoyable to watch.
B008OOYALE|5.0|enjoyable app that is perfect for playing at the doctor, dentist, or any other need for a short time filler.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun and highly addactive!  I didn't expect to really like it but I am absolutely loving it.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Good book. Slow start but good. I loved the ending.<br />It took me almost half way through the book to really like it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Keeps you interested from the beginning.  Love this game. Lots of action,  beats the first version hands done! I'm not sure if this one can get any better.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a really awesome game. Keeps my attention. I love it. Thanks for an awesome game. Keep it up.
B0007OCG56|5.0|I have seen Spaglish on Hbo,Cinemax and Showtime.This movie is very funny  Adam Sadler does a good job Reommeded also
B000IZA9NK|5.0|Retro-style Action Hero, Sky Captain (Jude Law), plucky NY newspaper gal-pal (Gwenyth Paltrow) and buddy (Giovanni Ribisi) must find a mysterious scientist and save earth. Many surprises, from dominatrix alien-looking woman in goggles, to armies of huge flying robots. I loved \\"Capt Frankie\\" (Angelina Jolie) as eye-patch wearing previous girlfriend now running an elite air force base hidden in the clouds.<br /><br />Film is full of 30's style snappy and witty dialogue. The art deco style visual effects, green screen cgi, makes each scene bigger than life and dramatic to watch. Fun characters. Dramatic cgi visual effects. Great Sci-FI.
B007THA4FI|1.0|For American readers, it was very hard to get past all the British vocabulary, and hard to get into it. I will retry in a few months,
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Although I got this on accident (I already had the regular DVD), this version is closer tot he book and for the life of me I cannot understand why they cut the 8 minutes that this includes in the original version.  I am so happy I have this now as it brings more humor that was sorely missed in the original version.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I started reading this book while I was waiting for another book to be published. It was a very funny sexy story but kept sex to a minimum. The characters where believable and it had a really good underlining meaning. What i liked the most was the lesson if you let you past dictate you future you will let love pass you by. It read this book in less than 2 day only because i could not put it down.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I was a little skeptic at some of the reviews and thought how they could make this and complete with more modern games with great graphic. well, they made a great version and so much more fun then I remembered. great job on it! game play is very simple but very effective.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|excellent match game with a vivid display. The story line is pretty much in line with the actual book,  so kudos there.<br /><br />Gameplay is very easy and accurate.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the only way to control the volume is through the options screen. The volume button on the phone does not affect it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The personalities of the character's in every episode was entertaining, it's one of those you wish would never end. Please bring us more!
B00457WZEI|5.0|The DVD of War Horse was a great movie and good quality. Being able to purchase it from Amazon allowed me to have this movie without having to drive 150 miles to the nearest store to us that would have it
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I installed this on an older Pandigital Planet.  I have used it for a couple of years, and it works great!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I downloaded this game for my husband, he loves angry birds. He and our grandchild love to play against each other.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app I can't believe it's free I want it to stay free but I can't believe how great. This app is.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this for my daughter her chose this for her reward for getting honor roll again. I take it she enjoyed the book, because every moment she got she was reading, didn't put it down until it was time for bed
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Lee child is a wonderful author. I am addicted to this series. Just wish they would have cast someone closer to jack reacher's physical description when they cast the movie Jack Teacher.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game is so much fun and frustrating at the same time. It makes you think, because you have to stratagize
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Out of all of The Next Generation movies, 1st Contact set a benchmark that sadly was not met or exceeded in the following movies. It handily brought various elements from all of the series and seamlessly incorporated them into a very satisfying ride.<br /><br />I don't quite buy into the 'Trek Prophesy&#34; stating all the even numbered movies were good, while the odd-numbered ones were bad. In my humble opinion, First Contact stood alone in the field of Next Generation movies, with Generations trailing second in the North 40. The rest were mind pablum.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|If you are not yet addicted to Mad Men, then you should watch this from Season One, and become addicted like the rest of us. Interesting story line, and wonderful to watch if you grew up in the 60's. I love Mad Men and highly recommend it.
0316069434|3.0|I have all his Harry Bosch books and frequently re-read them in order.  This one wasn't as taut as a lot of them. Maybe it is the long delay between his books.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|The movie is great, loads of fun.  The blu-ray is packed with tons of extras that will definitely satisfy the most avid fan of the cornetto trilogy.
0399160450|2.0|Ever since he has picked up co-authors his books have not been worth purchasing.  I have a huge collection of his old works and did not feel this one, or the previous, worth keeping to re-read.  Definitely will not buy in hardcover again.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|The blu-ray comes with lots of extras including 3 &#34;documentaries&#34; on the actual events surrounding the fake movie Argo.  Commentary tracks and deleted scenes.  Well worth purchasing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really enjoyed it! So glad I took the chance...sucked me in from the get go. Way above my expectations. Cheers
B007REV4YI|5.0|Fantastic movie for a james Bond lover! I would suggest this movie to all James Bond Fans! Keep up the good Movies!
B009KEN87O|5.0|It's done so well, I can't believe I'm playing it on my phone. If this is an example of things to come from this developer, count me in as a soon to be paying customer! Great job, folks. Get this game! It brings back that old arcade feeling, while keeping today's technology in reach.
B009KEN87O|5.0|this game has a great feel similar to the old style galaga game. it automatically fires so all you have to worry about is moving and dodging. it's done very well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING & I CAN'T WAIT TO READ MOCKINGJAY!<br />it was a thriller and I couldn't stop reading in
B0041JENFO|4.0|One of the biggest problems I had with \\"Predator 2\\" was that it abandoned the atmosphere of the original \\"Predator\\" movie. As for the AvP movies, forget it.<br /><br />Well, \\"Predators\\" has a completely different cast and setting from the original... yet it successfully captures that grimy, sweaty, blood-stained jungle quality. The difference this time is that all the humans are also vicious killers of one kind or another, and strong performances by Adrien Brody, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne and the rest keep us invested despite the nastiness of some characters.<br /><br />Eight people find themselves parachuted into an unknown jungle: Royce, an American mercenary (Brody); Isabelle, an IDF sniper (Braga); Hanzo, a yakuza enforcer (Louis Ozawa Changchien); Nikolai, a Spetsnatz soldier (Oleg Taktarov); Mombasa, a Sierra Leone death squad member (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali); Cuchillo, a cruel cartel thug (Danny Trejo); Stans, a serial killer on death row (Walton Goggins), and a seeming harmless doctor named Edwin (Topher Grace).<br /><br />At first, the eight people have no idea who they are doing there, or how they came to be there. They have even more questions when they realize that this jungle isn't even on Earth.<br /><br />But that isn't their biggest problem: someone is following them through the jungle, and slaughtering these seasoned killers one by one. Also, there's a crazy guy (Laurence Fishburne) who may be a lot more dangerous than he seems. Their only chance of survival is to somehow kill the alien Predators that are following them -- assuming they don't kill each other first.<br /><br />When I first heard of \\"Predators,\\" my first thought was that it sounded more like a remake than a sequel. But it does successfully twiddle the original formula -- the humans are all professional killers, none of them know each other, and there is no safe haven for them unless they are able to somehow get a spaceship. Even the \\"obfuscate the heat vision\\" scene is turned on its head.<br /><br />But at the same time, director Nimr&oacute;d Antal and producer Robert Rodrieguez GET it. They know why the original movie worked, and they successfully twiddle the formula without losing what makes it good. The story is simple and mostly straightforward (with a few easy-to-predict twists), with the sweaty, bloodstained atmosphere of people trapped in the jungle.<br /><br />The one big problem? Well, halfway through the movie we're introduced to the idea that there are different breeds of Predator, and they hunt each other as well as other species... it's never explained enough. It's a bit confusing.<br /><br />I was initially skeptical of the casting of tall, skinny Adrien Brody as the lead character, but he's frankly pretty awesome -- a lean, wiry, cold-as-ice guy who has a soft spot for \\"nice\\" people. The gravelly Batman voice is a little off-putting, though. We get it, you're tough.<br /><br />And the other actors all do brilliant jobs, fleshing out their characters -- each one gets pros and cons to their personality, no matter how repulsive they may be. Braga and Taktarov are especially good as the only \\"good\\" people in the group, who seem to have stable compassionate personalities, while Changchien manages to make a likable, interesting character out of only a handful of lines and a truly awesome kendo duel. And yes, Grace has a wonderfully chilling performance set apart from the assorted soldiers and enforcers.<br /><br />\\"Predators\\" catches the tone and atmosphere of the original \\"Predator,\\" then twists around the entire formula.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Omg!! This game is soo amazing. It is one of the best games I have ever gotten. There are tons of cars that you can buy with the coins you earn racing! There are cars, people, and even really cool extra that you can get! The graphics are very very good and you can play forever no paying or dumb advertisement.

B00005JPUN|2.0|I'm amazed it took Hollywood as long as it did to churn out yet another adaptation of Jack Finney's classic \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\\"<br /><br />And to give the writers/director credit, \\"The Invasion\\" does its best to update the classic tale of body-snatching aliens for the 21st century, and has some solid performances by Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman. Unfortunately, the movie has clearly been ripped to shreds and sewn back together, with major plot threads dropped and an incoherent second half.<br /><br />The space shuttle Patriot unexpected crashes back on Earth, and a strange fungus-like substance is found clinging to the wreckage. One of the people who encounters it is CDC director Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam), who pricks his finger on a piece of debris.<br /><br />Then his ex-wife Carol (Kidman) begins to notice things -- dog attacks, strangely stoic children, Tucker's determination to spend time with their son Oliver, and a patient who claims \\"my husband is not my husband.\\" When her friend Ben (Craig) is called in to examine the Czech ambassador, they find that he's covered in a weird plasticky skin wrap.<br /><br />They soon realize that a strange alien intelligence is infecting people, and taking over their minds and bodies when they enter REM sleep. The thing is, there may be a few people who are immune to their influence -- and Oliver is one of them. Now Carol much save her son to save the human race, but how can she stay herself when the whole world has been taken over?<br /><br />First, some praise. \\"The Invasion\\" does its best to reimagine the \\"body-snatchers\\" story for the 21st-century -- instead of making duplicates of the humans, the aliens possess the bodies of their victims. And rather than imitating the 1978 movie's ending, this one takes an approach more like that of Finney's original novel -- or maybe \\"War of the Worlds.\\" Whichever.<br /><br />Done well, this could have been a diverting sci-fi story. Certainly the first half is a pretty suspenseful affair, with lots of build-up to the inevitable discovery of alien invasion.<br /><br />But then... it all falls apart. The second half appears to have been ripped to shreds and reconstituted, a cinematic Frankenstein's monster that lurches pitifully to a rushed conclusion. Everything feels uneven and chaotic, with some scenes (Carol's stay in the convenience store) dragging on for what feels like hours, and a final scene that feels like it was tacked on hastily.<br /><br />Also, some important plot threads and characters just... vanish. The suggestion of psychiatric drugs producing immunity is abruptly dropped, and two characters' fates are never explained. One is hit on the head with a hammer, and the other escapes the possessed... and we're just never told anything more about them. What?!<br /><br />One thing I cannot assign blame to is the actors. Kidman is all porcelain chilliness, but with a core of fire inside when her son is threatened. I have to wonder if she chose this role as a subtle jab at her ex-husband -- she plays a psychiatrist who keeps herself awake with pharmaceuticals and saves the world from her brainwashed drone ex, whom she whacks on the head with a hammer.<br /><br />The rest of the actors are pretty good, although not given much to work with. Craig gives a solid hearty performance as a doctor who feels more than friendship toward her. Jeremy Northam also does a pretty good job, although he mostly just plays a blank-eyed villain.<br /><br />\\"The Invasion\\" has the bones of a decent sci-fi flick, but the second half degenerates into a messy, chaotic, confusing disaster. It's a shame, because the actors could have done much more.tty suspenseful affair, with lots of build-up to the inevitable discovery of alien invasion.<br /><br />But then... it all falls apart.

143447299X|5.0|Everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... or at least the Hollywood version, with green skin, boxy head and bolts in his neck.<br /><br />But the original creature is quite different in Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" which starts off rather slow but builds into a tragic, darkly hypnotic tale about tampering in God's domain, and the terrible consequences that come from it. Also: if you create a new creature out of dead body parts, don't disown him or he'll kill your family.<br /><br />During a trip across the Arctic, a ship picks up a starved, half-frozen man named Victor Frankenstein. As he recovers, Frankenstein tells them his life story -- especially about how he became fascinated with science, and developed a process to reanimate dead tissue. Eventually he constructs a new creature out of dead body parts, and brings him to life.<br /><br />But while the creature is intelligent and articulate, he's also hideously ugly. Horrified that he's not beautiful, Frankenstein flees... and has a nervous breakdown. Wimp.<br /><br />But months later, the murder of his little brother brings Victor back to his home, where he figures out that the creature was involved. And to his horror, the creature now wants a mate. But the loathing between them -- caused by Frankenstein's disgust and the creature's increasing bitterness -- leads to even more tragedy...<br /><br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those rare novels that is almost beyond classification -- it's gothic horror, it's sci-fi, it's a tragedy about scientific ambition that goes where it shouldn't go. Mary Shelley was only eighteen years old when she began writing this book, but she interwove religion, science and a fiercely intelligent knowledge of human nature into it.<br /><br />Her writing is a bit stuffy at times (\\"All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own\\"), but that's because it was written in the early 1800s. Despite this, Shelley's writing skills shine in the more horrific moments of the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work. Victor is actually a pretty horrible person -- while he's a tragic figure whose unnatural ambitions end up destroying his wife, brother and father, he's also incredibly cruel and callous to the creature because... he's ugly.<br /><br />The creature, on the other hand, instantly gets our sympathy. He's intelligent and childlike at first, but his ugliness causes everyone to immediately hate and fear him. When him becomes embittered and eventually murderous, you still feel sorry for him.<br /><br />Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those few, rare horror books -- it adds a little more of that scientific gothic atmosphere to a classic tale of horror, slime and sorrow.the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work.

B005603236|4.0|Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and Jane Austen deviated from her usual form for \\"Northanger Abbey,\\" a mellow satire of the genre. And \\"Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey\\" manages to translate it well into a movie, with what seems to be gothic fantasies and scheming set in the middle of a sunlit English countryside.<br /><br />Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.<br /><br />When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.<br /><br />\\"Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey\\" does an admirable job of adapting Austen's novel, evenly balancing out its two sides -- on one hand it's a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels, and on the other it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. It has some eerie moments, but most of them seem to be fantasies of Catherine's -- lots of sword fights and dungeons, with her trailing around in a big white gown.<br /><br />It's also beautifully filmed, with ivy-drenched cottages, vast stone castles, grassy yards surrounded by lush trees, and even the pale-lit streets of Bath. It's a stark contrast to the dark, gloomy world that Catherine imagines. And the writers translate Austen's stately prose very well, with some clever dialogue (\\"Now I must give you one smirk, then we can be rational again\\") and some beautifully romantic moments as well (\\"I told him that I felt myself bound to you, by honor, by affection, and by a love so strong that nothing he could do could deter me...\\").<br /><br />It also has some very solid casting -- Felicity Jones projects wide-eyed innocence as Catherine, and she's just pretty enough to be striking without being too much so. JJ Feild is deliciously sexy and just a bit impish as Henry Tilney, and Catherine Walker has a brief but well-acted stint as Isabella, who may be the most naive, clumsy gold-digger in the world. There are also some excellent performances by Catherine Walker (as the gentle, conflicted Eleanor), Liam Cunningham, and William Beck.<br /><br />\\"Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey\\" is a beautifully filmed, well-acted adaptation of Jane Austen's gently satirical classic, and preserves its spirit admirably.

B007REV4T8|5.0|The Daniel Craig movies have really injected new life into the James Bond franchise, but \\"Skyfall\\" is possibly one of the best Bond movies EVER.<br /><br />This movie is not just a brilliant Bond movie, or a brilliant spy thriller, but a brilliant movie in general -- beautifully filmed, combining the old-school James Bond formula with a very 21st-century brand of terrorism. But what truly elevates this beautiful movie is Sam Mendes' focus on both Bond and M, and the terrible costs of living their lives.<br /><br />A hard drive containing information on double agents is stolen in Istanbul, and Bond (Daniel Craig) nearly manages to get it back. But he's accidentally shot by Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. He's not dead, obviously -- but he uses this as a chance to retire to a tropical island.<br /><br />But then MI6 is hacked by a cyberterrorist, and their headquarters is blown up. Bond reappears in London to offer his services to his country again, but he's obviously not fit for duty -- physically or psychologically. Despite this, M (Judi Dench) sends him back out to find the cyberterrorists before more agents are killed.<br /><br />The trail leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former agent who specializes in cyberterrorism.  He blames M for his torture and mutilation, and is determined to destroy her career before killing her. Even capturing Silva isn't enough to stop him, and soon Bond must flee London with M to make a final stand against Silva.<br /><br />If there is a underlying question to \\"Skyfall,\\" it is this: Does an old-fashioned agent like James Bond belong in a world of cyberterrorism and individual extremism? Well, yes. The nature of conflict, evil and cruelty will never change, only the media through which they are spread. It's expressed in a lovely speech by M, which seems to say, \\"So what if it's the age of Bourne and Fast & Furious? Bond is timeless.\\"<br /><br />But Sam Mendes does sow some seeds of doubt about the \\"old guard\\" -- M is coming to the end of her tenure, and Bond is beginning to crumble from the physical and mental damage he's taken over the years.<br /><br />Mendes' direction is truly spellbinding. The action is gritty and often brutal, but set against backdrops of breathtaking beauty -- a nighttime apartment lit by glowing jellyfish, Bond drifting on a boat surrounded by luminous paper lanterns, and the creaky polished beauty of Skyfall itself. But he never lets us forget the brutality of the villain's ways, such as when the token Bond girl is brutally shot in the head.<br /><br />The movie also takes the chance to dip into the relationship between M and Bond. They have an untrusting, almost antagonistic relationship, with Bond knowing he cannot truly trust M, but also knowing that she does what must be done. And as he encounters Silva, Bond begins to see the creature he could choose to become, but his essential decency holds him back.<br /><br />Craig and Dench rule this movie, and both of them are blisteringly good -- they give stoic performances with strong emotions roiling under the surface. Craig's performance is particularly brilliant -- this is a Bond aching and riddled with scars, but he still has the strength he needs. He also has some deliciously sensual scenes with Naomie Harris. Shaving never looked so hot.<br /><br />But who can forget Javier Bardem? He also gives a glorious performance as Silva, a flamboyant cyberterrorist who hides his hate under a perpetually laughing face. Only when confronted by the woman he wants to kill does he show his true rage.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" is not just a brilliant James Bond movie, but a brilliant movie -- in action, in writing, in direction and in character.

B009KEN87O|4.0|It's kinda like a cross between Space Invaders and Galaga, imo. I know that doesn't sound like much, but the mechanics and level designs make it fun again. This is a great game.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Yes I liked the movie no doubt, however prolonging it to drag out into three features just shows how money hungry the movie industry is.  For the sake of art........... I am not an expert and far from it but I do know what I like and what I don't like, I did not like how this feature was filmed.  The warm hue that was present in the Lord Of The Rings films is missing.  It looks almost animated, something visually was lost in this film.  I did read that a different speed of film was used for some reason however I visually cannot see why.  The Rings series seems clearer and more comfortable and pleasing to watch to me.  Oh well.  I am greatful he filmed this series and I do find it enjoyable and do suggest it to viewers.  So I should just shut up and let you the viewers decide:)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|There is not enough good to be said about Evernote. I use it everyday, and would he lost without it. It's very easy to learn and you can basically run your life with it.<br />I recommend it for your work, home, school and anything else you can think of!  :)
B00006LFGD|4.0|Singing duets seems to bring out something in Barbras voice, a richness and detail that is sometimes missing when she sings alone. I said SOMETIMES, not always.  There are some good things in this album and some real duds.  I am not a Barry M fan but her duet with him here is spot on.  They both sound very good and harmonize very nicely together. The other real treat was her duet with Josh Groban, another real classy number. Lots of emotion from both of them. I also enjoyed her Gershwin duet with Frank.  The disco stuff has seen its day and bood bye.  The other stuff is rehash from other albums, her Don Johnson duet, the Kim Carnes duet are all \\"stuff\\"  but what one person does not like another may so, so much for that.  I always enjoy Barbra to a certain degree even when its not all good.  The world is a better place with her voice in it, how about that.

It was thought provoking and challenges the concept of time travel, the butterfly effect, and the consequences of our actions.

Great read, and prepare to spend a lot of time with Jack Epping! Also recommend reading this on an e-reader so a dictionary is within easy reach.

1451648537|5.0|&#34;Steve Jobs,&#34; though written by Walter Isaacson is as much another product of Steve as was Apple II, Mac, iPhone, and on.  Steve not only gave Walter everything he had, he energized Walter to &#34;go beyond&#34; what maybe even Walter believed possible.  Just like Steve was not a particularly introspective person (even if he did know himself...he was too obsessed with shaping the world to be obsessed about what shaped him), Walter avoids analyzing Steve;  simply saying, &#34;Here's the product, I think you'll be fascinated.&#34;  And we are.<br /><br />Steve Jobs, clearly brilliant in his oeuvre, is by turns one truly nasty SOB and one compelling leader.  Isaacson tells Steve's story with such an abundance of anecdote that we feel we were there throughout Steve's wild, amazing adventure.  If you would like to know how one person can be a force of nature able to shape the reality of mankind, read Walter and Steve's book.

The references to the old &#34;frankenstein&#34; movie are not lost on those of us who love the old classics, and the animation is amazing. The story is touching and has a moral, yay!  Thanks Tim for another great story in film!  Couldn't wait to purchase it for my collection.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Predictable but ok Sparks book. There's a twist at the end that s kind of strange I think!  Sous recommend tho
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I give this CD five stars because it is a great listen from beginning to end. I really enjoy this group as writers, producers, and artist!
B001GCUNWQ|2.0|This movie is targeted for younger kids why do they have to put unnessary crap to make it rated pg 13. I don't think 13 year olds are interested. The age group that would want to watch this movie is under 10. What happened to the wholesome rated G movies.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|I hesitated buying this, what with all of the negative reviews (though the good ones outnumber them). But I took the plunge and bought the $15 suede model of this case.<br /><br />I've always loved pouches, and I've had them for every smartphone I've owned. So, I knew some of the negative reviews here were stupid. I mean, they're just plain dumb. Like &#34;you can't use the phone when it's in the pouch.&#34; Uh . . . yes, that is correct. That's a feature, not a bug. Also, &#34;the pouch was too tight!&#34; Pouches tend to be tight when you first get them. This is the nature of the beast.<br /><br />However, THIS POUCH WAS NOT TOO TIGHT. It was flawless upon the first use. This right away gives it 5 stars in my book.<br /><br />The pouch itself has reinforced walls, so its a bit thicker than some of the pouches I've owned, but it's sturdy and it'll definitely protect your iPhone. The pull tab is a nice feature. Pouches do tend to make it hard to pull the phone out, and this makes that problem go away. Finally, the card holder doesn't lead to an empty cavity. It ends at card depth. I don't know if this was an early design flaw, but if so, it has been corrected.<br /><br />So overall, this is a fantastic buy. For 10 or 15 bucks (depending on the model you want), it's totally worth it.
073947653X|5.0|This most excellent book is the real come back of this great writer after the (short) period of less inspired writing (2005-2007) and it is also one of most successful continuations of stories written long time ago by the Great Master of modern horror - H.P. Lovecraft himself.<br /><br />Concerning the first point, let's just remember that in 2005 was published the \\"Dark Tower\\", seventh and last installment in the magnificent saga King was writing since early 70s. It was in my modest opinion his highest achievement (if we except \\"Pet Sematary\\" which is still my greatest favourite) and the amount of work it needed certainly took its toll on the writer. I was very afraid that his next works would be lesser in quality and if \\"Colorado Kid\\" was still very honest, \\"Cell\\" was a disappointment. So it is with a heavy heart that I opened \\"Lisey's Story\\" - and I was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />With this book clearly Stephen King is back, with his infantry, cavalry, artillery and train. Not only this book is great but it is also one of the best he ever wrote. Some of the reviewers below complained about its slow start and this is correct. This book starts very slow, but I believe this is deliberate - the story is after all about a grieving widow (Lisey), who, two years after the sudden and painful death of her husband, is still shellshocked. In fact in the very first pages she just managed to collect herself enough to start cleaning the office of her late husband.... and this will lead to all the other events described in the book. So, please, be patient with \\"Lisey's Story\\". It MUST start slow and it DOES start slow. But if you persevere (about 150 pages) your patience will be rewarded - and you will suddenly see those first pages in a totally different light.<br /><br />The great achievement of Stephen King is to offer us a book which is in fact a perfect mix of two stories. If we cut all the supernatural elements, we still obtain a very good short novel about memories of a happy past and the present grief. The fantastic part of the book, once added to it, is a very well written, very dark and extremely interesting story in large part inspired by Lovecraft.<br /><br />Influences of Lovecraft are visible in some of King's books - the most direct are present in some of his earliest short stories, when in the later books they became more discreet but even better. For exemple we have a short vision of Ithaca in \\"Pet Sematary\\" and in a very King-esque joke, the devil in \\"Needful Things\\" says that he got his car in the high country of Leng... Here Lovecraftian influence is much more present but still in a very discreet manner - do not expect any \\"Necronomicon\\" findings, and there will be no \\"Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!\\" every two pages. Instead, we have the atmosphere of Lovecraft books and some of his creatures, which are (typically for King) called with childish names, as one of the characters met them as a child and still calls them with names which he gave to them in this time. There are the laughers, the \\"bad gunky\\" (which we do not see other than in its effects) and especially the \\"longboy\\", who, I believe, is actually one of the Great Ancients (considering his size and power).<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed this book, but I agree it is not easy to read - also, it tells a story of a woman in her fifties, so it is not recommended for the teenagers. They will probably not understand fully what it means to be in a long (and childless) marriage and then stay alone... with just the grief, the memories of happy past, some dark secrets from the past and a perspective of lonely old age...ries of a happy past and the present grief.

B00AFEXRME|4.0|I enjoyed this film but my husband a pilot was not impressed. He thought it was too far fetched but for a good drama worth a look.
B000MV9026|5.0|Me and my 6y old daughter we saw this movie seven times at the cinema (including three times in its Polish version) and then even more times on DVD and we were both terribly impressed. Even as an adult I must say that I felt in love with \\"Happy Feet\\" - the stunning image quality, the great story, the impressive music, the very intelligent dialogues, the humour and the message of course.<br /><br />In fact this movie has a double message - the \\"green\\" one (have some pity for our planet) and also the one about accepting handicapped members of community. Very early you will see that the main hero is handicapped (according to penguin standards in this movie) and his problem can not be solved. Ever. So he has to live with it as has the whole colony.<br /><br />There is more - there are elements about the difficulty of communication between civilisations and the hard choices that face the established religion (yes, there is a penguin religion in this movie) in the time of a cataclysm. A great thing in this movie is that it avoids creating villains in the penguin society - even the most antipatic and usufferable characters have their story and their point. In fact the only villains are predators who eat penguins - skuas, orcas and especially the sea leopard, one of the most impressive (and scariest) creatures I ever saw in a kids movie. The scene with the sea leopard is actually the only one which can really scare the youngest kids.<br /><br />This is a terrific movie, in which every scene is perfect - nothing can be cut or added without spoiling it. I absolutely do not agree that the second part is worse, in fact I believe it is one of the most emotional and impressive moments of the cinema and not only children cinema. The travel of the main hero outside the borders of the world, his imprisonment in an alien world and his desperate attempts to communicate with aliens are incredibly described. And the solution of all the problem is actually just a little girls smile in one of the most moving scenes I ever saw...<br /><br />See this movie and you will fall in love with it. And your children will greatly profit from seeing it too - even if they do not get all the message, they will probably at least start to practice tap dancing, as my kid did...e of the most moving scenes I ever saw...<br /><br />See this movie and you will fall in love with it.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finally finished the last book. I really enjoyed the series and am sad it's over. I would definitely recommend this book to all.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Usually I read the book, then see the movie, and still prefer the book.  This time I saw the movie (loved it) and then got the book (loved it more). Even if you've seen the movie I highly recommend the book, the writing and characters are first rate and engrossing. It's a moving, thought provoking novel.
B001EVM41W|5.0|I have never seen a cuter movie with Sandra Bullock I loved this movie thank you again for the chance to watch it
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Skylar Astin should be in more scenes.  :)  Actually, the only thing I don't like about this movie is that they cut the original first scene in the radio station down.  It was SO much better - and made more sense after watching it - in the extended version.<br />However...it's only because Skylar needs to be seen AND heard....
B003VANOFY|4.0|Summary, this headset is great. Great sound, great mic, comfortable right out of the box, surround sound still amazes me! Would definitely refer them to a friend, as they were referred to me by a friend.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Wireless. Great range, I can hear people clearly and they can hear me. Good range, I can hit the fridge (20ft) with no change in quality.<br />- Battery. Charges in about 2 hours to get 8-10 hours use on 7.1 surround. Only had them for a couple of weeks, so can't comment on lifetime.<br />- Sound is great. I started to play with the equalizer a bit, but decided to just leave it off.<br />- They are medium weight, I would say. After a few hours of use, I do start to feel them a bit, but nothing an adjustment doesn't fix. No head squeezing our headaches that I have had with other headsets.<br />- G keys - Nice feature, but I don't currently use them. May be good for listening to music, next and previous song, pause and play, etc.<br />- Surround works great.<br />- Build quality - very well built, they don't feel cheap like they will break.<br />- Mic - Very crisp and clear, others noticed a big change for the better the day I got them.<br />- Voice changer - Neat little ability built into the software, can be fun to play with.<br />- Noise cancellation - not like the Bose set I have for air travel, but very good to the point that it could be a con! I had music playing on a fairly low volume and the wife had a whole conversation with herself when I first got them. When she realized I hadn't heard her, she tapped me on the shoulder and I hadn't even realized she was talking. We had a laugh about it...but I don't think she was thrilled!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Sound - depending on what you are looking for, it can take some troubleshooting to get everything just right. I stick with the default, so it wasn't really an issue for me.<br />- Weight - This can be an issue after several hours of use, but as stated above, a little adjusting and it is comfortable again for a while.<br /><br />This was an upgrade from a $20 set of on ear Logitech headset and mic. The difference was huge. Highly recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Amazon had the item to me quickly, safely, and I was happy!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a good alarm clock. Very basic - not a lot of extras.  Easy to use interface lots of selections for alarm tones.  I really like the weather feature that indicates current temp & wind speed.  You can't go wrong with this one - and best of all....it's free!
B00BHMETKC|2.0|The movie was just okay. We have all seen this script before in a thousand other movies. Although the movie's real life premise was indeed interesting, the script and directing was just unable to harness this dramatic and emotional narrative. Camera work was shaky to force tension; I hate it when novice directors do this -- it just makes viewers motion sick. Also, Ben is simply a terrible actor. He emotes nothing, and with a beard it's less than nothing. I almost felt as if there was a movie being filmed and he was silently photo-bombing every seen. They sold us this directorial masterpiece and we bought it. It just didn't even come close to a masterpiece and someone must have \\"bought\\" them the Oscar. Life of Pie should have been Best Picture; it out ranks this bar-none. Politically, I am convinced that this Oscar was bought -- this picture's fame was manufactured and purchased with Hollywood politics and a massive press push. Wait till it's at the dollar rental.
B00127RAJY|5.0|LOVE THIS PRODUCT! CAME IN THE MAIL FAST AND SHOWED THE EXACT RESULTS I WAS LOOKING FOR, BUT I DID NOT LOSE AS MANY POUNDS AS I DID INCHES. THE INCHES FLY OFF, BUT I ONLY LOST 4 POUNDS IN THE 30 DAY PROCESS. YET YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO REMEMBER, MUSCLE WEIGHS MORE THAN FAT!
B00B99KJR0|2.0|The game is not near as good & addicting as Atlantis.  In fact, it  becomes boring as the game progresses.  There is no timer to indicate you are running out of time,  just suddenly a warning pops up, then a few seconds the game ends. There is no instructions to figure what the power-up levels are and when to use, no way to choose which to use and ineffective to use until you power-up to the one use two directional bomb.  These are just a few gripes.  I will be uninstalling and going back to Atlantis, sure wish they would make some updates to that.  Another thing, I have the Pro version of 80 Days, yet between every 3rd or 4th level I was bombarded with an ad to try Atlantis & no was to permanently dismiss the ad....especially since I already have Atlantis.  And, when the main character reaches the final destination, the game starts completely over, rather than ongoing as with Atlantis.  No way to see what the total score is other than completed yellow stars. Really needs improvement & please fix the issues.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson did an amazing job of conveying the complexities of an exceptional and unusual man. While some of Jobs' quirks, e.g. his most peculiar eating habits,  were never explained (and perhaps couldn't be without psychoanalysis,) they all seemed to fit together. The computer details were understandable, even for a non-geek, and the marketing strategies were fascinating. I have only recently acquired my first Mac and the book made me look at it in a whole new way. Having lived for a long time in a pre personal computer world, it is amazing to me how the thinking of one man changed the world.
B001HC8516|3.0|I think there is a lot of truth in this book but nothing is this cut and dry. However, being new to the dating scene, it did help me set my own limits of what I will accept and how to let go of unhealthly situations.
B00ANW33CM|2.0|I couldn't figure out how it worked--and didn't feel like taking the time to figure it out. Not enough fun.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I think this is a profound book that will really challenge your thinking about your faith, your beliefs, and your values.  It is a great book to read wtih a group to stimulate discussion.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking to do some serious self-inspection and need to make some changes in their life.
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|yes, a bold statement but definitely applicable.  10 great songs, no filler, no wizardry, no gimmicks, just an absolute corker of a record.  that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I absolutely love this show!!!  The characters are quirky and hilarious!  I find myself laughing with every episode!!!  Love it and for anyone not watching this show....what are you thinking?!?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use. Simple and big enough to see. Use it for all my everyday purposes. AMAZING. Just get it :)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Best time you cn have for the pricce.  Dont quit this art and color app happy having hit bing bingo
B000025D7S|5.0|I'd had this CD before and tried to find it again to share with a friend back in the early 90's.  Had absolutely no luck, so when I thought of searching Amazon - and there it was!  I am so happy to have a copy for myself again (old one was scratched) and the new one to send to the friend who originally gave me this.<br />Excellent CD, so good to hear Gershwin as sung by contemporary artists, and I'd listen to Meatloaf sing that type of music all day!  I recommend this CD highly
B007GE2H3G|3.0|like the comic book, enough of a plot to hold my interest and well made quality illustration to please the eye!
B009KEN87O|5.0|You will love this Invaders game that takes you back a couple of years to the arcade. I found myself not beeing able to put the game down and being very entertaining.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|Don't have a lot to say baout this one.  If you liked Resident Evil, you'll probably like this one.  The surreal imagery is what most captivated me. To be trapped in such a hellish world with no way out is the greatest horror, but the plot gets a little bogged down and the action stalls a bit.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Two kids under the age of 10 and both love it.  Playing together and teaching tips and creating new adventures.
B000I8HIR2|3.0|Silent Hill was better.  To emphaized this point, I have to say that I really can't remember too much about this one, but I do remember almost everything about the original.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|My wife wanted to watch this, and I feared a movie version of Glee. I was happily surprised by how enjoyable it was. Good mix of story lines, music, and comedy. Very entertaining.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Don't waste your money or time, just don't do it. Kindle Fire HE owner.  B l a a a a a a a a h h h h
B00003CXBK|5.0|Played well, not a thing wrong with it, Was a really good movie, not as good as other Miyazaki movies, in my opinion, but wonderful in and of itself.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|Superb story telling and cinematography. Ben Affleck demonstrated his acting and directing talents par excellance.<br />I was riveted to my seat experiencing a level of intensity I've only experienced first hand, face to face.<br />Flying F-14s and experiencing Carrier night catshots,<br />to patroling Southern Lebanon and living in Beriut as a member of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO).<br /><br />At the time of the event depicted in Argo I was off shore in the Arabian sea on a carrier as a member of the carrier airwing fighter squadron. It was my first deployment.<br /><br />Affleck and the rest of the cast put me &#34;there&#34; in the moment, moment to moment. I was again living an experience from the 70's that is still vivid in my mind today. See, I had lived there...in my case it was Beruit during the Lebanese Civil War before the Marine barracks and the Israeli invasion (another first hand experience). I had been on the street in the middle of the complete chaos. I was there  again just the other night.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Wow what a series!! Shipped quickly in great shape! can't wait for season 4 . Anyone else hate the new review process where you have to have so many words?
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I rented this yesterday, and went to watch it today only to find out that it was no longer available for streaming and had been removed from my video library.
B00684J49U|5.0|Was very happy to get it and enjoyed it alot.<br />I had all week end to watch it. What a great way to spend my days off.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Alright, so the story line is a bit corny. the game play is smooth and the objectives are appropriately. challenging.  Overall, its a very nice game that I would recommend to others.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I went from start to finish on this book in less than 24 hours. I simply could not put this book down. The story and the characters suck you in and make you feel like you are there with them. Very exciting and emotional book.  I can't wait to get started on the second one.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I have never reviewed a book before... but felt the need to share how I completely loved this book from beginning to end.<br /><br />I have read my fare share of fantasy books but never have I found one that is so raw. The life story of Kvothe is not one of glory or heroism... but one of hardship, misery all while exuding courage and determination in finding the truth. Book #1 is fantastic, book #2 even better.<br /><br />Although Patrick Rothfuss is a fairly new published author, theirs maturity in his writing and I for one cannot wait for the 3rd book
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It came on time with no problems at all I recommend anyone to buy stuff for them because myself was on time and then they are very reliable.
B0086213XW|2.0|I'm not sure if I was in the right mindset when I watched this movie.  I was looking for a lighthearted comedy, romcom sort of movie and definitely was disappointed.  I just found it to be one of those \\"too close to real life\\", depressing type of movies.  I was also quite confused about why we were supposed to dislike Seth Rogen's character and cheer on Michelle Williams'.  Wouldn't recommend.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|the best of the best, i like this kind of books.. i love it .. everybody need to reed this
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Shipped within 24 hours and got to my house within 2 days.  I needed this product for work right away so I couldn't be happier.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Shazaam is great for identifying songs I hear anywhere.  I downloaded it to my smart phone so that I could use it anywhere I go.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the game. It is very challenging! Have it on both my Samsung Tablet and Galaxy SIII. I got in on amazon due to it being a trusted site.
B007XF4J70|5.0|What can I say...  I know, in the immortal words of Victor Laslow, &#34;Play the Marseillaise!&#34; ,  a nod from Rick and you have one of the greatest and most moving scenes in cinema history.  I've seen it dozens of times, but still feel the emotion well up in me everytime.  In Blue Ray clarity it was that much better.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was inspiring and very funny and I wish that I had all of the books but I don't it cost to much money but I like the book Anyway
B008KRJWEK|4.0|This game is cool just wish that you could get more money on a run you probably only make 50 coins  and you  need 15000 to buy a car
B009AP2G26|5.0|Good quality product and fast service. Would recommend to others. Great diversity of topics and great music. Teaches some good values like treating everyone with respect and equality.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|Good luck with your new album of the big friendly giant squid and the snow leopard's first of James. They have you hanging out with your new album of James Patterson NEVER finishes and meaningless the kingdom and meaningless and meaningless and exciting.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Won't install on my kindle tablet, shows purchased..but just won't go any further. I want to give it zero stars but that option is not available.<br />The strange thing is the thanksgiving version installs no problem.
1599290642|5.0|You have to really like this art genre to appreciate this book.  I buy this book every year for my son's birthday. He looks forward to it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I'm not from the old Atari era but this is so much fun to play. Dinner then some games with &quot;better graphics&quot;.
B004SUDQE0|4.0|I saw this movie years ago and when I saw it for such a good price, I decided to buy it.  It is just a fun movie.
B0000636NQ|3.0|I was saddened by the recent news of Alvin Lee's passing. I'd lost track of his work for many years & unfortunately it takes bad news to sometimes get re awakened to someones importance in this world. Alvin was important in the world of Rock & Blues guitar. I picked up the CD version of this to repalce the lost or traded lp of UNDEAD that I once had. This is for me the real starting point of 10 Yrs After. The 1st LP showed they were promising albeit a bit restrained. UNDEAD takes the shackles off & shows what the band could really do. This is live at \\"klooks Kleek\\" & produced in 1968 by the venerable Mike Vernon for Deram records. The result is an honest serving of British Blues Rock bar none. Alvin & Co are well up to the task & basically serve up some red hot jams. Alvins guitar skills come to life on this LP. The trademark hollow body Gibson recalls the smoking tone of BB King & even some of BB's phrasing too. Lee, while not a great singer was very serviceable as lead vocalist & only got better with each record. Why 3 stars? Some of the \\"jams\\" are too lengthy (such as on I  cant keep from Crying) or by covering tunes made popular by Cream like \\"Spoonful & Cross Roads\\". Alvin does those songs very well but will always be judged by Claptons \\"note perfect\\" readings. Also those tunes are too closely identified with EC. But, to those who love UK blues like Cream, Fleetwood Mac, early Zep, J Beck Group, Mayall etc, will enjoy this stuff. Its honest down & dirty bar room rock & features the original version of \\"Im GOing Home\\". I perfer this to the Woodstock version as its tighter & more focused. TYA, went on to make some good studio records including Ssssh, Cricklewood Green & Space In Time. But, this is their best 'live' document.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|A movie that has everything you could ask for, drama, entertainment and a good plot.  The battle was done tastefully!!!
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|Like others, I had been hearing all the hype for weeks.  Have really enjoyed his music in the past.  But this is so disappointing. Its just really bad.  I so enjoyed his past songs, cry me a river/sexy back.  This is just a whole lot of squeaky-ness, high pitched, weird vibed music that I just could not relate to at all.  Not to mention all the lovey dovey songs really made me wanna throw up it was poured on so thick. I really think that woman of his wrote all the lyrics and made him sing these songs.  Can't recomment it at all, sorry JT.  :(
B00004RJ71|5.0|This movie included nonstop excitement from beginning to end and really showed viewers a taste of Mexican culture and pride.  Even though alot of the movie took place in prison it stilled showed unity amongst different races which I enjoyed most!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I really liked the first book so decided to get the second book of set.  This book as good as first one.
0385349947|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter, an engineer, who works in a mostly masculine world and she loves it.  She says she wished she had these insights years ago as it would have saved her a lot of grief.  The expectations are different for men and women.  A smart, aggressive woman can be considered too bossy but no one would think that of a smart, aggressive man.  Every working woman would profit from this book.
B0096BIENY|5.0|2 CDs of Il Divo music is a bargain of beautifully recognizable music.  One doesn't need to speak the language to understand the message in the music.  Selections are classics & modern-something for everyone.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Each level brings new challenges and puzzles. Someone compared it to Angry Birds, and there is a hint of that here. Yet its more about problems than a battle with those evil pigs.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|While you will find a few favorites in this album, this is truly a showcase for new and beautiful pieces.  After listening to this album a few times, I felt that I had known this music for years...it's so comfortable and Grobin's delivery is beautifully effortless...at least to this listener.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I didn't have much excitement for this title when I saw it was the FAOTD. But after I started to play it I found it to be quite fun and reminded me a lot of the old arcade days when I was a kid. It's a very well done remake of a classic and I will for sure be finishing this game up in the future.<br /><br />If you liked old school arcade space invaders then this game will probably tickle your fancy.
B007M45PMU|5.0|A few of their songs are a little slow, but overall I really enjoy the album. It's great music for listening to at work or studying.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Great book. I. Loved. It<br />Tons. Of. Fun. Characters. And. Twisted. Plots a great. Book. For. Anyone  and everyone Ppl Poo
B0095R76EW|3.0|Overall the movie had its funny moments, but it was kind of slow throughout. Not great, not bad, just ok.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This is a movie that if you have never seen, it is worth watching. Sean Astin is so young! These kids really did a good job, and when I was a kid watching this, it was all the things a kid could want from a movie. Pirates, treasure maps, caves, adventure, and the barried treasure. As an adult, it is sweet and cute. This is a movie about a bunch of kids who come across a map for barried treasure in the attic! And guess what, the treasure is in their city! So, they seek it out to save their neighborhood. It's a story that has values and it has good acting. I liked it.
B00ARAO0WM|5.0|Good action movie that's fun to watch. There was a bit too much unnecessary swearing for my taste (I don't mind some, but this movie seemed like it was trying to hard). It was fun to watch though.
0316228532|5.0|This is not the kind of book you read on the beach. It is not the kind of book that gives you a delighted rush as you anticipate the ending. While I had no trouble picking the book back up once I'd put it down, and I'd read past when I meant to go to bed, I don't know that I once asked myself the question \\"What will happen next?\\" like I would with a good adventure. I would be hard pressed to call this book fun to read. I love those kinds of fun books, but they're not the only kind. The world needs this kind of book too.<br /><br />This is a book that English majors can write papers about. This is a book you can dissect and discuss and find more and more layers and juxtapositions and themes. This is the kind of book where you can discuss the characters with others like they were actual people, and not fictional portrayals of people. This a book that lets you talk about writing or story telling as a craft.<br /><br />This is a book that challenges your sympathy and understanding as it makes you make a snap judgement about a character and their situation at first only to find you actually feel very differently as you get to know them. In fact, you feel differently about them depending on what they're doing, or whose point of view is predominate. It is not a book where what happens matters or is even particularly interesting, but where what people do and why matters. This is the kind of book that makes you angry at the characters for not making connections with others that could make all the difference, which makes the times that they do make a connection all the more valuable. This is a book that makes you angry at the book, for making such an unfair world. This is the kind of book that haunts you the next day after you've finished.<br /><br />It's not an \\"easy\\" or a \\"fun\\" book, although I certainly appreciated its own dark humor. I also personally didn't find it a trial to read either, though I did sometimes wonder why I didn't given how hollow and isolated it felt attimes to be curled up in the perspective of these imperfect people who don't get the benefit of an omniscient view. The ending made me angry and sad and made me think. I highly recommend it, but go in expecting to be challenged.
B000EQ5HSK|4.0|Canon lens hood are always of great quality and fit well, but when combined with the 17-55 F2.8, it's HUGE. The lens already makes my t4i a bit front heavy and this only exacerbates that, but it works well. Just wish it didn't have to be so big.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great to know the weather, so i can be prepared, it is also great to know where the destinaion i am going is going to be good weather or bad
0817439390|5.0|For someone just past a beginner in photography, this is a great book. It goes a little more technical than some super basic books, but its so well written with picture examples that everything makes sense.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Do not like the idea of this one i like word games better, they are more challenging  Not my style
B008K9UZY4|4.0|The game plays true to the original Sega CD game plus it has some extras thrown in, the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is the controls on my Android device some times isn't as responsive due to the virtual controller on the touch screen.This causes Sonic to run into things and lose rings from time to time even though I pressed the other way or jump button. I can play the game just fine, but its harder to get all the secrets.<br />every thing else plays just like the other releases.
B0093ST02E|5.0|I enjoyed the story, and the acting was excellent. The quality of the download was perfect.  This is not a movie with a lot of Sarah Silverman, but she played her role well
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|My whole family enjoyed this movie full of action and also the message of team work and love were there as well. Great overall choice
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I bought this set because it was the most reasonably priced box set for my 8 Weeks of Harry Potter movie marathon.  I was a little shocked when I put in Disc 1 and discovered that I was not watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone... I was watching Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.  Not a big deal, but the page should probably include something that says this is the British version, as I expected the U.S. version since I was shopping on the U.S. Amazon site.
B003UMW68Y|4.0|i like the movie and like to watch it at least couple times a year.<br />could of been better if there was a digital copy
B006LSZECO|4.0|Never realized that she was such a dark writer. Kept my attention though.<br />Started reading her earlier books now and am enjoying
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I really like this game, I wish things didn't have to cost so much and it was easier to earn special items
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you love dogs, racing and a love story this is the book for you! I enjoyed the author's unique way of telling the story from the dog's perspective. It made me laugh and cry.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|At first I did not enjoy this book mainly because this book was a required book for my English class, however, after the first three chapters this book came alive in my opinion and I would definitely recommend it to fiction lovers.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have two pages on Facebook so am on there a lot. My one grip is that you cannot enlarge the font. As a senior reading 6pt font it is almost impossible so there are a lot of things I can't use the Fire for with Facebook. I only use this when I am in a bind and can't get to my computer.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel is a great little program. It keeps you informed of weather<br />forecasts in your area. It is easy to plan when you have forecasts at your finger-tips.<br /><br />  Highly recommend this to all ages.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is probably the best freebie in the world. FM stations world wide. Classical music from the BBC. Or Rock from Los Angeles. A radio station with every conceivable genre of music - this has it.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I like this book because it had so many word that  help me spell and check all the words I miss spelled and I dislike this book because it did not have all of the words I need it to spelled right
B008YKGQR4|5.0|My first review on this wasn't good and I take that back. I downloaded it again and looked more closely at it and found that - hurrah - you can expand the font which you cannot do on the other version of Facebook that comes with the Kindle Fire. This app is a definite plus. I highly recommend it. You get the full screen page not just the news feed. Definitely 5 star!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Let's face it once you've read one Pendergast novel you pretty much know what will happen in the others... He gets involved in a case, manages to find himself in an improbable situation, outnumbered and facing certain death, but then he uses that amazing mind and years of rigorous and clever training to wrest victory from the arms of death and of course save the world or at least the day while doing so.<br /><br />And thats why I love him... He is the last gunslinger, clearly good to the core and we can always count on good being triumphant in the end.<br />In a world of seemingly ambivalent heroes and blurring lines between right and wrong it's good to know you can always count on Pendergast.<br /><br />A page turner like every other Pendergast novel!
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you are a solitaire buff than this is a good app. And it is free. It gives you options of 'random deals' or 'winning deals' or with another player. I do find however that their 'winning deals' aren't always winning deals. Overall I find it easy to play and would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of solitaire. The one drawback is the popup ads at the bottom as you play. Odd since I paid extra for a Kindle Fire and no ads.
B009KEN87O|5.0|What a great little game this is. It has similar game play and style to space invaders, galaga and zaxxon with some surprises too. Around level 30 they start integrating other classics such as pong and Tetris! Crazy fun!  On a few of the boards I saw a glitch where code was displayed in the upper right hand side of the screen. Strangely enough, the game treated these characters as enemies and allowed them to be destroyed by firing upon them, though this was not a requirement for clearing the level. I love this game. I find it just as addictive as it's cabinet sized ancestors.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|This has always been one of our favorites. It's a tense thriller with no holes in the story -- it all makes sense and it is all really well done. Harrison Ford at his best and a satisfying take on the old TV series. Rent it or buy it -- well worth it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a hard book to put down. I was in the mood for a book like this.  Lots of twists & turns.  I highly recommend this book!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|A compilation of great songs and great performances.  I can't believe that Tom Cruise can sing--and he does a great job! And Alec Baldwin singing? You got to hear it to believe it.  Saw the movie twice and want to buy the DVD.  If you like Glee you'll love Rock of Ages -- Even if you don't like Glee, there are great songs by Journey and Foreigner that will keep you humming all day.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great sounds and graphics make this game a keeper.. It works great on Asus tablet running ICS. This is the best space invaders genre game I've seen for Android.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I recently bought this dvd since I've used 'Bob's' Biggest Loser exercise videos and I've heard good reviews on this tape. However, suggesting a weight loss of 20 lbs in 30 days is irresponsible without basing this on how overweight a person is and without encouraging physician advice as this is very rapid weight loss. Further, I was quite dismayed at the notion that 'anyone' can do jumping jacks, including another reviewer with 'bad knees'. Whether or not you can do jumping jacks is not a function of how much you weigh. However, I have sever arthritis and one knee is reduced to bone on bone. So THIS 'anyone' has doctor's advice to not do standard jumping jacks or other high impact moves. I can walk in place and move my arms in the proper motion, but jumping and hard hits will place me back on crutches. I almost didn't buy the tape because I was so angry at the total nonsense and lack of judgement in this advice! Please consult your doctor's advice on what you can and can't do! Anyone who relys on this lady's questionable advice may do themselves real physical harm. Most people can find excercise they can do, but Bob's tape seems more reasonable on providing alternate moves for real needs.<br /><br />______<br /><br />Updates: I've watched the DVD I purchased. This is the worst exercise video I've ever purchased. Jillian's form is pathetic. Every once in a while, she throws in a comment about form and what not to do to that might cause injuries, but overall, good advice is missing. I winced watching the knees bending to the floor and extending far over the foot during lunges. The cardio is boring and nothing but jump rope and jumping jacks. This is not a tape for anyone with knee joint damage.<br /><br />You will also have to stomach Jillian's endless noise of stressing and pushing the body. Yes, you must work hard to see results but you do not have to do high impact aerobics nor do you need to do the worst excuse for squats ever to be marketed to the public. Absolutely hideous and going in the trash.<br /><br />The ONLY redeeming parts of the DVD are the ab workout segments. I know Jillian has faced critics and claims to have certifications to teach but that doesn't mean she is qualified or that she has any working knowledge of the body, joints, and proper exercise form. At least no knowledge is evident in her ridiculous claims of weight loss nor in her horrific examples of exercises. Please talk to your doctors and do a hard workout that doesn't hurt your joints!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|dearly loved this book......hard to put down! Thought that I would savor his book but as it turned out I read it in three days .......darn it was suppose to last longer.:-)
B0036EH3UC|5.0|There is simply no comparison, Gallactica is the best series to have been on TV in YEARS. The acting, the sets, the story, the special effects, put Gallactica so far ahead of anything else it's not a fair comparison. Sci-Fi needs to do MORE series like Gallactica, this is the show that made Sci-Fi a must watch network.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|good game. if lagging try deleting other apps or games. that happened to me so I deleted like all the free games that I dident play and it stoped lagging like that.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|This game made me disappointed. The very first game I bought that was like this (had a story, most like a videogame like from ps or Xbox) was avatar, so my elections were very high.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|this game I play on facebook all the time now it wants me to start a level 1 no needs to be fixed!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Ok game great way to waste time kind of like a where's waldo haven't had to pay for any extra content
B008DM4OTA|5.0|If your little one is intrigued by medicine/doctors/EMS...this is the app for them. Excellent is all I can say. He can fix ribs, apply topical ointments to &#34;boo boo's&#34; and retract swallowed objects from stomachs. That is just the tip of the iceberg. Highly recommend it !
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I loved the game. It is soooo much fun and I think the little penguins are so adorable. The game  is really fun and I can't stop playing it. I would say people ages 5 and older could easily play this game.
B008NMT684|5.0|Great puzzle/matching game. My 3 year old loves this. The graphics are superb and it works flawlessly on my kindle fire.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the new update for this. its more sleek and I love how smooth it runs. always accurate weather and the setup is great. love it!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Hard to use app, doesn't run smooth on my kindle fire and asks you for money to continue to next levels ( starting to become commonplace with a lot of app's now a  days). Did not like
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I like the messages throughout the story and how Albom makes you get in the story. I read it in a couple of days.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Season 1 and 2 were great....now this is really setting into my mind. Each show becomes more and more depressing. I have slowed my pace at which I was watching this.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book showed me that life is short and cherish the moments and the people who you love and loves you back. It's ok to write down how and what you feel , and maybe what you wrote at that moment it helped you ,but maybe it will help someone else.AMAZING. I recommend this book to everyone. One of the best books I've read.
B002WY65W4|5.0|I love the tale in this movie.  Compare this to the never ending drama of the Walking Dead and you'll wish there was a &#34;Freinds&#34; version of Walking Dead on TV.  Who said zombies had to be dull?  This also has one of my all-time favorite cameo roles.  That scene with the &#34;big star&#34; is simply awesome.
B009KEN87O|4.0|This is truly genuis, but can't get past the pixels on this large tablet. Due to otherwise small file size and low permission, will keep this one to see if it will be updated. Great control and no instructions needed.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Hi I'm 13 years old I have been wanting to watch this movie for a while now and finally got the chance I would just like to first off by saying its insperational
B00AQM8H9I|1.0|this app was a horrible disappointment when I recently purchased it for my 1st gen. kindle fire.  I have played the game on a number of other devices without issue, and I have played other apps by this developer.  however, this game repeatedly force closes and/or freezes and is un-usable.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this clock is very useful. it is very loud so it can wake you up&hellip; and the loudness can give you a little shock so your up and awake as soon as it goes of. and it is very easy to use just in case you have never used an alarm clock
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really liked this book a a lot.  It was riveting and then after it was over, it was one that you contemplate for a long time.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is awesome. I love this game<br />In the game you have to move around and shoot your enemies<br /><br />It is the best game I have ever played
B009MFKO3M|5.0|Tame Impala takes a definite step above other good retro Psyc rockers, like Dungen, by incorporating more contemporary elements and by writing memorable songs.  Every track is good, though first song is a bit of a misdirection as there's nothing quite as abrasive on the remaining 11 tracks.  If you are on the fense about buying, check out Apocalypse Dreams - a fantastic song that sums up everything good about this album.  Love the 70s keyboards and the McCartney-esque baselines. I just saw them play in Texas, and it was quite the party.  The touring drummer really stood out.  If you like this, check out their other major release, Innerspeaker, as well. Enjoy.
B0084670FU|1.0|Tried to watch this movie the first time - lasted about 20 minutes, then fell asleep!  Tried to watch it the second time - lasted only 5 minutes!  It certainly won't win Brad any Oscars!  Too boring.
B002WCLG48|3.0|Some of the stories are good, but others leave much to be desired.  Overall, this is something that any true Halo fan should at least watch once.
B0090SI44M|5.0|This is one of my husband's favorite movies.  It is easy to get lost in the cute story, and the graphics are great.
0765367297|5.0|This is a must have for ANY Halo fan.  Eric Nylund is easily the best Halo novelist I've read by far.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is a very versatile cover as it protects the tablet well and acts as a stand for the Kindle Fire.  the case has an elastic band that can be utilized to keep the cover tightly shut or, when open, to keep the cover firmly against the back of the case.  It is well designed to hold the Kindle Fire in place without fear of it falling out.  I would highly recommend this very affordable and well crafted case.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|We love this product and have had not problems with it since getting it.  This has possibly been the best baby prodcut we purchased.  I love the fact that I can watch my baby sleeping on my iPhone from work; its awesome!  I also love the features on this device including the temperature and humidity of the room, the night light, noise maker, and alerts.  Probably my most favorite feature is the fact I can talk to my baby while I am at work and watch her look back at me through the camera.  The temperature and humidity reader is great to make me aware of the temp and humidity in her room especially at night.  I can monitor it and make adjustments if needed.  The night light and noise maker are fantastic for helping my baby sleep.  Sometimes she just looks at the night light (we have it set on changing colors) until she falls asleep.  The video monitor has been so helpful for night-time to ensure my baby is safe, and to see what the problem may be when she is crying before I have to get up out of bed.  But of course the thing I love best is being able to watch her sleep or play in her crib while I am at work, and being able to talk to her through the monitor.
B0094K1K8I|1.0|However, it was truly poor, simple-minded contraptions, a waste of time, and a contrived ending not supported anywhere else in the plot.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|THE BEST SHOW! MY HUSBAND AND I LOOK SO FORWARD TO<br />WATCHING THIS ....GREAT SHOW FOR SURE, BUT WILL SUCK YOU IN!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Wow excelente game. Nice 3d feel to the graphics plus totally retro feel. Love it. Cool weapons and power ups.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a addicting game for me all the updates was FANTASTIC. Everything thing in the store is great characters, prizes. The 2 things that are my favorite is the Easter eggs and the SUPER Mystery Box.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I'm going make it short, it's excellent! no if buts or maybes, its just plain excellent. Now for those of you looking for a movie solely about \\"The Hobbit\\" you may be disappointed but for people who want the full Tolkien experience, that is all the things mentioned in the lord of the rings and its appendix as well as alot of other material, then this is perfect. Was the meeting of the white counsel in The hobbit, no, was it mentioned else where in Tolkiens books, yes, was the battle to reclaim Moria in the The Hobbit? no, was in mentioned elsewhere, yes.<br /><br />So no it's not got \\"alot of filler\\" it's got a full rounding out of the Middle-Earth story.<br /><br />The ending still has me trying to hold back some tears
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Hilarious, timeless humor.  I love this movie and my family watches it every Christmas.  I enjoy this movie at any time of the year.

1616550414|5.0|Every Nintendo, Zelda fan, every gamer must read this! The reason? If you want to understand The Legend of Zelda Series, if you are curious, or simply because you want to know more, this book will provide several answers. Its reading is mandatory.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|It's no wonder how enjoyable listening to the music of six to Rodriguez is!  This is a five star record !  Hoping to catch a show in the upstate NY area... Oh please!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an enjoyable and entertaining little game. Easy to pick up and play even for quite young players. I like how it keeps updating the locations to try and keep it fresh.
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|I've always liked thrillers and I liked this one a lot.  The only thing I didn't like were all the ghosts going around, but the acting and the rest of the movie is quite good, in my opinion.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|A &#34;new&#34; Wagnerian tenor (for me).  Had just seen PARSIFAL in which he was transcendent. (Along with the other cast members!)  He sounds wonderful.
B004LWZWE2|5.0|I love live performances that are filmed &#34;documentary style,” nothing too fancy with the camera work, no excessive use of visual effects or silly contrived performances like music videos.  You get to see a moment in time capturing the artist doing what they do.  This DVD is just that and it captures AC/DC in their prime.  It’s a must have for AC/DC fans and for anyone who is interested in the band I think this movie can even make some new fans.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I am an addict when it comes to playing.  Just wish you had more layouts to choose from. Keep up the great work
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever I I did I did this I did this to I did this to take I did this to take up I did this to take up space
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was like a dream.  Excellent visuals...absolutely wonder filled.  I could not wait to get home so I could continue reading.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|At first I expected the graphics to be similar to the original, I know that’s crazy. Needless to say the graphics were actually really good. The CG blended well with the live action even in Blu-ray and on an HD TV. We watched it on our 60&#34; and it still was great. Recommend the movie for fans of the original &#34;The Thing.&#34; I love that they kept the same theme but created a unique story. Plus you got to love a movie that has a strong heroine in it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun. And I am not talking about the band. I really like this game and the design and options are great just great. Really the only reason was so I could very 250,000 points but whatever. Great game really!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Really fun and haven't had issues so far. Hard to put down! All 3 modes are fun and challenging to play. Best of all? It's free!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This book was very good. I would read it again and also recommend it to others for a good read.
B000002W9Q|3.0|This is a nice soundtrack, but the cover was cracked. I'm sure the Compact Disc is fine, but still. It is a great gift.
0307387178|4.0|Cheapo Into the Wild for my son's English class.  Rather than wait for the district to bring out the books from storage this was a fine way to get the book in my son's hands.  I'd certainly do this again though I wish they had equally inexpensive versions of the thick and heavy textbook.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Part of the problem with Kindle is that I don't really research books thoroughly before I download them. My criteria for a download is far less stringent than for buying a paperback. So I am often stuck with books I wouldn't usually buy in a bookshop. This book is a good example. That said, I quite enjoyed the book as a holiday read. It is a macho counter-terrorism novel centred in Afghanistan. As far as the genre goes it is OK. I haven't read any other Vince Flynn books including earlier books in this series, so a lot of the references to previous adventures were lost on me. That said, I managed to get to the end, but it wasn't particularly satisfying to be honest.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Rango is not outstanding, but it is fun and worth an evening of enjoyment. It can easily be stopped and restarted for spanning a couple nights to fill in after work is done. It also teaches good morals about sticking with good, which will ultimately prevail, even though at any particular moment is seems doomed. In that respect, it's good for adults, too. Anyone who doubts that doubts their own religious faith.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa<br /><br />Get this book and<br />Enjoy 'll of this great ending to this book awesome book read read read read
B0094K1YHK|3.0|Kind of a stupid plot and less than star quality acting, but funny and entertaining because of its imperfections.  Worth a try.
B001P3SA94|5.0|One of my favorite movies.... it came quickly and I have enjoyed it many times. I am glad I was able to find it had searched a couple of other places.
0765325950|5.0|Beautiful detail, book moves quickly bringing you up to date with all the assorted characters, several unexpected twists and many people you have known thru the books die.
B00942X8PY|5.0|ONCE YOU GET PAST THE EASY LEVELS, YOU HAVE TO START USING THE BRAIN.  I THINK IT IS A GREAT GAME TO STIMULATE THE OLD BRAIN CELLS.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A beautifully filmed and scripted series that will engage the entire family. The scenes of the English Countryside are reason enough to watch. The storylines take us back to a more simple time and lifestyle; a time in which values really did mean something. My family quickly watched all four seasons and hated it when the series ended.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was sick in bed with the flu for 5 days straight. I watched all 3 seasons which kept me very entertained & not dreading my situation as all! I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys thoughtful humor & period dramas. The costumes are wonderful & each character is fun to watch progress over the years. Love it love it love it! Can't wait for season 4!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love, love, love having a place to keep track of all the things I see that I love and it is so much easier on my kindle.
030758836X|4.0|This is the first Gillian Flynn book I've read. I thought her writing is excellent.<br /><br />(Spoiler)<br />THe book has a lot of twists and turns. It dragged me to liking Amy, Nick as the bad guy. Then, a revelation from Amy made me root for Nick instead. And the story goes on, me guessing how the story will end.<br /><br />I wished that it ended both of them being punished, but the book's ending makes a great movie ending though!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is such a fun game. I recommend it to any one looking to have an adventure. IT'S AWESOME!  :)
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This was a very small book. Only 77 pages and only 3x5 in size. Content is very interesting though, so I downloaded the FULL book.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I expected more out of this book. It didn't remind me of the traditional Wimpy Kid series. I liked it but, it bored me with the concept. I loved the characters and story, but I think it should've been longer..
B000R8YCAO|5.0|The Memphis Belle is a fantastic story about a plane and its crew who flew 25 perilous missions before going home. It was a time of global conflict where daylight bombardment over fortress Europe in the effort to destroy Nazi Germany was one of the most hazardous jobs in the Army Air Corps. But it had to be done. In the movie we follow a crew of ten young men as they go about the task of flying and dropping their deadly payload of bombs on crucial targets located deep in the heart of Germany. These targets were munitions plants, ball-bearing factories, and all kinds weapons of mass destruction. The Americans flew during the day and our allies flew at night. It was a 24/7 undertaking based on good weather over the target area. But the cost was high but necessary to obtain supremacy of the skies over Europe. The B-17 Flying Fortress with a crew of ten was one of the great weapons of WWII. German fighters would dive out of the sun with all guns blazing as they attacked the slower flying bombers. For safety and to be a more formidable targets the flying fortresses would fly in formation in such away that all their guns could bear on attacking enemy fighters. But even with this strategy the allies lost many planes and crews. This is what the movie is all about; the great sacrifices for God and Country. Early in the war the Americans and the allies losses were very high! So it was decided that if a plane and its crew could fly 25 missions they could all go home. Their war was over. This gave all crews a goal and a boost to the morale of the countless squadrons fighting the air war. They would go back and tell the American people the good news and also sell war bonds, which were later called victory bonds. The Memphis Belle was the first plane to accomplish this feat. It is really quite a plane. In fact the Memphis Belle is still flying today. I had the opportunity to see her in a flying in at Eglin AFB in Florida some years ago. The original pilot was still at the controls. He has passed now; in fact most WWII Veterans are passing. It is all due to the aging process. It is a fact of life that we all must die sooner or later. During the air war over Europe this was a reality of life that was experience first hand by many. The film brings it all out very clearly! For those who did not experience WWII either doing their duty or on the home front supporting the troops who were fighting to save the world from tyranny, this is a must see film. We owe a lot to the generation that went to war. The film with actual aerial combat footage of dogfights in the skies over Europe illustrates this in a big way! Due to the high losses in crews and planes early in the war with maybe 500 planes going out on a bombing mission and only 250 returning a goal was set when you flew 25 missions you could go home. The film has a memorable scene of the Memphis Belle returning to base crippled and all shot up with many of the controls malfunctioning. Yes, friends she got back to home base on a wing and a prayer. The Memphis Belle in only 108 minutes tries to capture on the screen the many mishaps that may befall a plane and its crew over enemy territory. There is one nail-biting scene where the Memphis Belle is the lead ship because the other two planes leading the squadron had been shot down so it was up to the Memphis Belle to lead the rest of the flight over the primary target. Below the AA-guns were firing and the flak was as thick as bees. Then just as they approach the target the visibility is poor. So they must go around again. The film captures the horror and the courage of the crew as the bombardier takes control of the aircraft to successfully lead what is left of the squadron over the target for the second time. But lo and behold the target is clear and they proceed to drop their bombs. When they turn for home they realize that they have taken some major hits. Then in the final scene, which I will not reveal shows the great skill of the pilot, co-pilot and the crew. Yes, in today's world many young people do not know what it was like to fight in the air war in the skies over Europe. This movie Memphis Belle will be a great education for many. We should also thank God that we had such brave men as these and we should thank all veterans for their contributions in keeping the world safe. God bless them all! I recommend strongly that everybody see the film Memphis Belle.ot and the crew. Yes, in today's world many young people do not know what it was like to fight in the air war in the skies over Europe.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|It's a tough read ( 900+ pages ) but well worth the effort. Goodwin's scholarship and writing style is excellent!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Wow! What a suspenseful thriller this story evolves from just getting on a subway train in downtown and heading uptown. The story has these bad guys who also have bad guys and they seem to come out of the garbage and sewers at 2:00 O'clock in the morning. Jack Reacher has his hands full because the good guys put obstacles in his path every time he has something good going and following a very plausible clue. But the other problem is that the secrets are everywhere. In the end Jack Reacher can only trust about three people...oh but I am not going to spill the beans because that is what everybody wants Jack to do but he is not buying it! I tell you from page one to the end I could not put it down! So I stayed up until I reached the very end. Then in the morning I read the last few pages again to make sure I had not missed anything! Well Jack Reacher doesn't and that is how it all began on an uptown subway train in New York City. I strongly recommend this story but not for those who have a weak heart. SO put on your running shoes because you will need them when you follow Jack Reacher in search of the truth.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Just got this bag and I already love it. Easy to use and adapt to my gear.  I would buy it again.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Excellent movie. Edge-of-your-seat suspense. I would watch it again. People need to keep in mind that this is a movie based on real events; it's not a documentary.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with the main character. Not enough depth. And, some of the direction was questionable; as in, why would have the people who were trying to escape, by pretending to be part of a film crew, seem so scared all the time. You'd think that the director would have them laughing and joking with each other, and pretending to be part of a film crew.
B002WY65VU|5.0|one of my favorite movies. my son's favorite as well, we lost ours so I was looking for another copy. perfect condition, great price, shipped on time and quickly. i would deal with this company again.

B009HELT3C|4.0|Good popcorn film. It is MUCH better the MIB2. I keep being surprised by Josh Brolin. He seems to be quite the chameleon. It is not a genre defining or important film in any way, just good fun.

0345535421|5.0|During one of those endless nights when I just couldn't put Clash of Kings down, I wondered: \\"Why aren't there more books like this?\\" George Martin has created one of those most deeply involving and satisfying series out there. In only two books, he has crafted real characters involved in the horrors of war. Many of the reviews below accurately describe the way that Martin creates characters of grey, rather than comic book black and whites. Many of the scenes in the book fit well with dark and somber lighting. This is not your daddy's fantasy novel.<br />Martin's characters bring a more realistic spin on knighthood and war. Cersei describes it best to young Sansa when she destroys the young girl's romantic view of knights by remarking that knights are for killing, nothing more or less. And kill they do. The battle scenes are raw and unglamorous, like the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan. Its all very realistic and gritty and heck, it makes sense: what do you really think happens when a not-so-sharp sword is swung haphazardly at another person: I've never seen it firsthand, but I'm sure its not pretty. It may be an oxymoron to claim that a fantasy book can be realistic, but this series is: after seeing the battle scenes in Braveheart or Gladiator, I have a deeper understanding of the horrors of sword fighting in, say, the medieval times in English history. Martin's story is realistic in the sense that it doesn't gloss over the horror and pain and terror of battles and the rage of the people who fight them.<br /><br />Martin's series is a hardcore fantasy adventure for adults. While other authors cater predominately to a younger fantasy audience, Martin seems to write for the \\"college and beyond\\" crowd (at 50, I'm well beyond). Sex scenes, like the battles, are not glamorous in the least. Whereas characters in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series constantly blush and stumble at the very thought of even kissing a girl, Martin's characters think lewd thoughts, perform graphic sex scenes, etc. Yes, its not for all ages, or for every taste, but for those of us who are tired of the same old antiseptic stuff, Martin is a mature breathe of fresh air.<br /><br />Meanwhile, he continues to awe me with his story telling. The different kings are now in open conflict with each other. Whereas Game of Thrones focused on the Starks v. the Lannisters, in this installment, it seems as if the entire land is in termoil, with no less than six kings fighting each other and attacking each other. The battles are terrific, including the climactic battle. (no spoilers here)<br /><br />One other note I feel compelled to make is that Martin has created strong and independant female characters in his series. People might assume, based on the reviews, that this is a male-dominated story. Nothing could be further from the truth. Martin spends as much time writing about the female characters (Sansa, Arya, Catelyn Stark) as the male characters, and the female characters rule (i.e. Cersei) and fight battles (I won't reveal any specifics on this point except to say that Martin introduces two female warriors.)<br /><br />Martin has created a real world, with all the vices of our own, and given all his characters life. Here's hoping that other writers take note.form graphic sex scenes, etc. Yes, its not for all ages, or for every taste, but for those of us who are tired of the same old antiseptic stuff, Martin is a mature breathe of fresh air.<br /><br />Meanwhile, he continues to awe me with his story telling.

B00797MB0O|2.0|This did not hold my interest, I found it so boring that I couldn't even finish it. Very disappointing flick.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|There are many religious implications in this movie, and I think that is why I have read so many negative reviews..some people were offended by the portrayals because they did not represent what the viewer believed to be accurate within the context of the viewers specific faith so they were.... offended. If your fanatically  religious or get upset easy, don't watch. For everyone else, I found this movie to have an excellent pace and plenty of action, slow points are minimal and it has a strong &#34;re-watchable factor&#34; that even other good movies sometimes dont have.  (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition)
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|...for about four hours. I'm a huge fan of match 3's and the direction 10000000 went with it was thoroughly entertaining. For being a $1.99 paid app, I wish it was a little harder/longer to get to 10000000. Still, very fun while it lasted.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is absolutely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and I am reviewing it years after the first time I saw it, and its still hilarious. Not every movie is funny to every person, and I am sure there are people who hate this one humor being subjective. I am convinced that most people that see this will LOL....I have read that the french were collectively dismayed at this perceived attack on the fashion industry and rejected &#34;Zoolander&#34;, it only made it funnier to me.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|Game is fun, moderately challenging due to layouts of the maps.  The reason I give it a lower score is that on the TF101 it crashes after nearly every level, forcing you to redo them approximately half the time.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am not a Stephen King horror fan, but did enjoy this book. It was interesting and thought provoking, as there were so many angles which needed to be covered, and I felt the author did so
B0098460O4|5.0|Tremendously impressed by Jonathan & Charlotte on Britain's Got Talent, had to have their first album for my music library. The selections are all very good, their treatment of &#34;Unintended&#34; and &#34;Everybody Hurts&#34; are great!<br />I'd recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys music!
B00B99KJR0|1.0|See it on amazon website account but It cannot be downloaded to device thus it is un-usable.  But it was zero dollar purchase so it is just a waste of time but not actually money.<br /><br />4/2/13 update... OK, now it shows up and I can install it. This is just another \\"color tile matching\\" bejewel clone.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It is okay but when I need it for school it really helps when we have tough words I count on this haha
1603425381|5.0|Super nice borders, very colorful, with charts and explanations. I am very happy  to get it. Thank you very much.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I don't believe that this is an original idea at in, in fact, it seems exactly like a fanfic I could read online. That being said, I don't find movies like this very often, and I really liked it.<br /><br />The movie came on time and was packaged very well.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun action game.  Simple to learn and can be addicting just moving from one level to the next.  I would suggest it to friends.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great game but too easy . Keeps mind alert but I would like more difficulty. Still I  keep playing. Having fun lol
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I enjoy the variety of music on this album.  I often listen to it on my way to work.  It's upbeat and melodic.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book Is simply amazing... I'm a college boy that is stressed with homework, but I'm so glad I managed to find the time to read this book! I finished it in a week..
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really fun, when it works. We have it for kindle and iPad. There is always one problem or another. If Natural Motion could fix the issues, this game would be 5 stars!<br /><br />I recently tried some things Natural Motion told me to try.  Now the app is gone all together.  The problems with this app make play a lot less fun.  I lost a really good profile in which I owned a zebra and had to start all over again. If Natural motion can fix issues and make things more affordable in the game, it will be 5 stars for sure!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|So sad it only lasted one season. I really found myself caring for the characters on the show. You have to watch the movie Serenity, it's a great wrap up to the show. Get busy living or get busy dying. Down with the alliance and hurray for the Brown coats. Got a job to do, we will do it. Don't much care what it is. You're a part of my crew. Should still be on tv !
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This is one of those albums where you can listen to the whole thing without skipping tracks. This album takes you to its own little world when you have the headphones on high. Again thank you Amazon for the reasonable price and fast delivery.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Loved it, absolutely loved it. You don't need to have watched the show to enjoy this incredible rich and moving story. If you have watched the show, make sure you have some tissue around. Tears will be shed. And you will also laugh out loud and enjoy this fast paced and visionary tale. Now please , please, please make more movies with the crew. Keep them safe Mal and they cannot keep the skies from us.
0345803485|5.0|Loved it from the first page.  Was very easy to get into and couldn't put it down.  Fell in love with the characters instantly.  I just loved it and can't wait to see what the author has in store for us in new books in the future.
B000SEGQNS|4.0|People don't have time to waste when they're browsing through the web. And don't make them think, either.<br /><br />Steve Krug's book is all about taking a common sense approach to web development, especially usability. He wrote that there's no such thing as an average user, everyone is different. So, as you can imagine, developing great websites that appeal to most people is almost like climbing Mt Everest wearing sneakers. It's a lot harder than it looks.<br /><br />Mr. Krug has created an easy to read, conversational guide on what usually works in attracting visitors to a website, and to keep them returning. He points out some of the pitfalls, like how everyone wants to get their finger in the pie of the Home page, to the point where it could become bloated and useless.<br /><br />Heard of 'Street Signs' and 'Breadcrumbs'? You will when you get to the part about making sure visitors know where they are and where they're going on a website. As much as people hate getting lost in a shopping mall, the same is true on the web.<br /><br />There's also a substantive section on usability testing. How important it is, but also how it's not necessary to go overboard with it as well.<br /><br />While it doesn't take long to get through this book, which happens to include useful illustrations and cartoons, you do learn a lot of things in this bestseller.
0345803507|5.0|How many times can I say it?  I loved it...I loved it....I loved it.  Where is book 4 and on and on and on.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|I had Genesis songs on tapes many years ago and have some Phil Colllins CD's but I missed many of the songs I had listened to when he was with Genisis.  I decided to purchase a CD that had the most hit songs so I bought Genesis Greatest Hits CD and have not taken it out of my truck CD player since I first put it in.<br /><br />The  CD plays one hit after another and their music is so soothing that I really relax listening to the songs while driving home from work.  Even if I have had a bad day, I find this CD one that can take me out of my funk and by the time I reach home, I'm feeling better having listened to Genesis.<br /><br />I really like this CD.  I have enjoyed it more than I thought I would and money well spent, in my opinion.

B0091HVMVO|5.0|Of all the recent \\"big box\\" classical collections from major labels (Decca, RCA Victor, Mercury Living Presence, EMI Eminence, etc.), this is one of my favorites. In terms of scope, quality of performances, sound, and packaging, it's superb. I love the concept of these multi-disc label \\"samplers.\\" Drawn initially by a handful of performances I know and love from my LP collection, I have enjoyed exploring pieces and performances new to me through the CDs in this box. Of course, not all of them are \\"my cup of tea,\\" but I'm already finding new favorites as I make my way through the discs in this set, and for only about two bucks a disc, I don't mind that some will probably get played once and never again! I'm especially grateful that Philips/Decca/Universal has chosen to supplement the original albums in many cases with extra tracks. Most of the CDs in this set run over 70 minutes, and a handful go well over 80! (Caution: if you have an older CD player, it might have some trouble with the extra-long-play CDs. Fortunately, I've not had any trouble so far on mine.)<br /><br />As others have commented, the individual CDs are presented in \\"original art\\" jackets, and the set has a very decent booklet with detailed track listings, photographs, discographical data, and a nice little PR piece about the Philips label. (One wonders, though, for such a technology-driven company, why they couldn't manage to get pictures that aren't so heavily pixillated as the images on 110, 112, 113, etc. that look as if they were nabbed from some low-res internet JPG.) My only complaint with this set is that the individual CD jackets do not contain detailed track-by-track listings, only brief content summaries. To find out what is on CD 33, track 11, for example, you'd need to open up the 182-page booklet, flip through it to the listing for CD 33 and read the track listing there. They could have easily printed this information on the back of each CD jacket. (I have this same gripe with the Deccabox set.) It's an inconvenience, but still a relatively minor complaint in the grand scheme of things. (Incidentally, CD 33, track 11 is one of Reinbert De Leeuw's marvelous piano performances of Satie's beautiful, haunting Gnossiennes -- No. 3 to be exact!)<br /><br />Others have posted detailed content listings and commented on the nicely-constructed box that houses the set. As others have noted, the sound is superb and the performances sublime. What a terrific bargain! I bought this set the day it came out and I've never regretted it for a moment. If you are considering any of the classical \\"big box\\" label samplers, this should be at or near the top of your list.
0345803493|5.0|I couldn't wait to start on book 2.  I was so glad I got the 3 book trilogy as it was 5 seconds after I finished the first that I was into the second.  I loved it!

B00BHMETKC|4.0|this movie is just as good as the reviews say it is. what a great film! Ben Affleck should be proud.
B00005JOA0|1.0|This was a wretched adaptation of a very good book. Extremely disappointing. The detail and flow of the story are altered and the ending is changed. The music is horrific. The heroine is portrayed as a raving lunatic instead of a beautiful, principled young mother. The leading actress was terrible!  Please! Surely someone can turn this book into a good movie!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great job! This game has it all for the retro enthusiast. Great graphics, gameplay, physics, controls etc. It has some really cool features I was not expecting! I was already impressed, but upon further gameplay I was amazed! I'm going back to playing right now!

B002TYZKIM|3.0|The quality of the DVD was excellent.  I watched this video on TV and I guess I thought there would be more to the video.  It got a little boring to me.  But I would recommend it to Michael Jackson fans that want to have all the memories of him.
B000YABYLA|5.0|very cute and quirky movie! Perfect for a Firday movie night if you want to watch something to laugh and cry at. thumbs up!

B00003CXWV|5.0|Johnny Depp is at his best in this classic true story of drugs, life, adulthood, money, and love. This film is by far one of my favorites and for good reason. If you're thinking about watching this for the first time, I promise you will be hooked and unbeliveably astounded by it. If you have seen it, you know the magic behind it, and I would recommend buying again! Great soundtrack as well!!

0316017930|5.0|\\"Outliers\\" by Malcolm Gladwell is a very interesting and informative book to read. The book illustrates and analyzes the paths to success by laying out many different case studies. For example, the book gets into details about the success of Bill Gates and what happened that caused him to become one of the richest Americans. There is also a 10,000 hour rules which tells you that in order to be an expert at something, you will have to contribute 10,000 hours of practice. Why is Bill Gates successful? A large role that played into his success is his opportunities that were given to him in his teenage and college years. He had numerous chances of operating computers in those years which enabled him to program all day and accumulate his hours up to 10,000. In the 70s, the chances of a teenager and a young adult programming on a computer are very rare. This is just one example of case studies in the book, for more details, read the book, there are much more of these similar case studies of successful people. It is definitely something that worth your time to read.<br /><br />The first part of the book is basically concepts and social phenomena of people who got to the top of the ladder. Such as professional Canadian hockey players are typically born in the first three months of the year. The book goes into details of analysis into this phenomenon and gives detailed explanation. In the second half of the book, the author gives real life situations and scenarios of how these concepts and phenomenon apply and analyze the positive or negative outcomes such as why Asian kids are better at math than American kids. The book is generally very informative and there was a large amount of research done to write this book. This book is highly recommended. No matter who you are, when you read into this book, it will grab your attention and interest you. Try this book! It is definitely worth your time.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This was such a great movie, my boys loved it they wanted to watch it over and over again. Makes a great family movie night.

B004SI663A|5.0|Anyone who watches his show knows he is more than just a comedian.  He has a lot of social commentary and reflections on living on both sides of the pond.  He also does not glaze over his own weaknesses and shortcomings.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an amazing detailed account of the preparation, dedication and courage of the members of the United States military to carry out the mission of hunting down UBL.<br /><br />The sacrifice of all of the men and women (and their families) who serve our Country must never be forgotten or trivialized.<br /><br />God Bless our Military.
B008G33NFC|5.0|Tarja has the voice of an angel. This dvd show that she really loves what she does. You can not help but smile, as you watch this. It is a great dvd. I would recommend this to all Tarja fans. She does all her popular songs. Doing them live takes them to another level. The crowd reaction is incredible. This is a fantastic dvd.
1402760663|5.0|Dee Brown's story of the west doesn't read as controversial as it once did, but his writing is still sharp and crisp, and the stories of America's original peoples are as mesmerizing as ever.  It's like watching a boxing match of a fighter you love that just won't go down even after the fight is lost.<br /><br />It's the photographs, many contemporaneous with the last days of free peoples, that steal the show and make this edition worth having even if you read the tattered paperback version thirty some years ago, as I did.  Or more recently, for that matter.  Good as Dee Brown's text remains it plays second fiddle to the haunting images scattered across almost every page.<br /><br />The famous Rinehart photo of Hattie Tom on page 230 alone is worth the price of the book.  The reproductions are large, often full page, and glossy.  My personal favorite is War Memories on page 474, but there are literally hundreds to chose from; the text runs to 525 pages, excluding the index.<br /><br />And no, I don't know anybody associated with this book or make any money from it.  I'm a history teacher who will use these images to start conversations and introduce points in class.  From this perspective I've rarely seen a better text, and none specifically about Native Americans.  It's also sturdy and will last, always a concern for teachers.
B001R0XNSI|5.0|good company cold steel! good buy for price would reconment it to friends! good as plane ride to replace knife
B009JZTOG8|2.0|I really got into season 0ne. This was good for the first couple of shows but I see the line forming to jump the shark. It got too waked way to fast. I would like to say unrealistic, but it is over top fantasy. I just didn't like where it was going..
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love this game. I put on my phone and both kindles so I'll have something to do..it's a great way to kill time .

Book One sends you into this galaxy of interwoven plot lines, and Book Two expands your scope. Even if you love watching the series on screen, you'll want to dig deeper with these addictive volumes.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is equally magnificent as the writer and speaks directly to the soul.  Her messages are inspiring, thought-provoking, and practical.

I aspire to live my life fearlessly and savor each moment.<br />Thank you, Thank you,Thank you Anita Moorjani for sharing your magnificent experience and to all the wonderful souls who made this book possible!
0425264386|5.0|This book had all the right ingredients.  It has adventure, suspense, adventure and mystery.  I enjoyed reading this book and the first Lee Child book.  I also saw the movie and enjoyed it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great movement and graphics. Too often games are over complicated for smooth gameplay on a mobile device. This is excellent. Drag your ship around while it auto fires and blast enemies!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|&#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&#34; is a superb addition to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Jackson has effortlessly blended elements from the LOTR trilogy into The Hobbit, while still injecting it with its own unique town and pacing. Pacing. This is the part that most people get hung up on. I have to be honest and say I LOVE the more relaxed pace of this film. It reminds me of the true epics that were made so long ago, like Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur, or The Ten Commandments. The Hobbit: And Unexpected Journey makes you feel as if you are on the long journey with Bilbo and the dwarves. One of the greatest elements of the slower pacing is how much more of Middle Earth we get to see.<br /><br />In some ways, The Hobbit is even more of a true epic than the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy. More than just a &#34;good vs evil&#34; story, The Hobbit tells a very large tale represented by only a few key characters. The attention to the political landscape, and the fall of an entire race, brilliantly represented by Thorin Oakenshield, from glory to obscurity, make the stakes in this film incredibly high.<br /><br />As far as the blu ray goes, the transfer is impeccable. The detail is excellent, and colors are deep and rich. I haven't watched the bonus features yet, but I can't wait to dive in!
B0085LMFAE|5.0|One of the very best albums of the 80's.  Downloaded, hadn't heard it since I gave away all my vinyl.  What a treat!
B0001HAISG|5.0|Great Version with a great cast.  Mermaids scarry instead of like Areil and others scarry to little ones. Small scene though.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|These are very easy to understand execises that don't seem like much but they really work.  You can pick 5,7 or 10 minutes.  Try the free version and when it gets too easy upgrade to the full version.  The butt and leg workouts really toned me up!  The cardio is short but will get your heart pumping and is better than nothing if you don't have much time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love it!  Can't wait for the 4th season.  Captivating, interesting, educational, pure entertainment.  The characters are like family.  Excellent writing and unexpected twists and turns in the story.  Maggie Smith as the Dowager is great.  Her body language, facial expressions, mannerisms and dialogue is seamless acting.  What a hoot Maggie and Shirley McClain were.  And Matthew better not have died in that car crash?!
B005K17RU0|1.0|This was one of the apps that I used to use the most.  You could quickly look at what the weather was going to be and ber easy to use.  Now it's become a complex computer geek's dream. Deleting.
B000002J3W|3.0|My deepest apologies for any fan that thinks this is Skid Row's best offering. This album is barely comparable to their first two records. I'm not saying that this album is completely terrible, but it doesn't hold a candle to the debut or \\"Slave To The Grind.\\"<br /><br />Skid Row waited over four years to release a follow-up to \\"Slave To The Grind.\\" I honestly believe that all that time away from recording is what's responsible for this album sounding so different. I know it was released in 1995, but other melodic rock bands were still releasing solid stuff in the mid-90's. When I first got this record, I could hardly wait to hear what these guys had some up with now. I mean, the band that gave us \\"Slave To The Grind,\\" how could they top that? Well, they couldn't. This is what we were left with, an almost alt-rock sounding Skid Row, which for my money isn't what I wanted to hear. Some songs weren't all that bad, \\"My Enemy,\\" \\"Beat Yourself Blind,\\" and \\"Breakin' Down\\" were listenable, but a lot of the rest was less than awesome.<br /><br />Skid Row released two absolutely terrific albums in 1989, and 1991 respectively. These guys were just a little different from the run-of-the-mill hair metal bands of the day, I know. Skid Row always tended to lean a little more to metal side of the hair metal genre, but this is just not as good as I came to expect from these guys.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|The Devil Wears Prada staring Meryl Streep is a wonderful story about determination and finding a way to do what it takes.
B000002IQW|5.0|Skid Row released two absolutely terrific albums in 1989, and 1991 respectively. These guys were just a little different from the run-of-the-mill hair metal bands of the day. Skid Row went a little more to metal side of the hair metal genre, and along with their harder edges tunes, they wrote some killer melodic rock tracks as well.<br /><br />\\"Slave To The Grind\\" is easily one of the best albums of all time, not just the early 90's. Everything a hard rock fan could want is present on this album. This thing has huge choruses, monster guitar riffs, and the production us simply out of this world. Once again, the band comprising Baz, Snake, Rachel, Rob and Scotti is in top form. This album really should have put these guys in the same breath as Metallica and Megadeth, but for some reason, they are eternally lumped in with every other late-80's hard rock band. Every song on this album is a killer, and naming favorites would just be as easy as naming the whole album in its entirety. Just know that every song is butt kicking awesome.<br /><br />With this album, and their debut record, Skid Row should have been set for the coming decade. However, when grunge hit and wiped out everything melodic rock related, Skid Row held no exemption cards. They were simply pushed under the rug like every other band from the era.
B008220DGE|5.0|The Master Philip staring Seymour Hoffman is a dramatic story about effecting change in people,  some of the methods are interesting to watch.
B000002INR|4.0|Skid Row released two absolutely terrific albums in 1989, and 1991 respectively. These guys were just a little different from the run-of-the-mill hair metal bands of the day. Skid Row went a little more to metal side of the hair metal genre, and along with their harder edges tunes, they wrote some killer melodic tracks as well.<br /><br />While Skid Row's debut isn't the classic \\"Slave To The Grind\\" is, this is still one of the better releases of the genre. Sebastion Bach's vocals are second to none, and the musicianship of the rest of the band is all top of the line stuff. Rightfully so, this album propelled Skid Row on an upward spiral that saw their sophomore record top the charts in 1991. There really isn't anything bad to say about this album, unless you don't care for late-80's melodic rock music. The best tracks on the release are \\"I Remember You,\\" \\"Rattlesnake Shake,\\" \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" and \\"Big Guns,\\" however, there really isn't too much not to like on this album.<br /><br />These guys are considered one of the genres best for a reason...they are. This album, and their follow-up, are two of the melodic rock scenes finest offerings ever. There's no way any fan of melodic rock music will not absolutely love this album and this band as well.
B00BF11STU|1.0|I fell asleep after the first 15 minutes. The characters are dull and serious.  I couldn't follow along at all.  Why did I pay for this movie?  I want a refund ASAP.
B001O54NKS|4.0|Dokken released their third studio album \\"Under Lock & Key\\" in 1985. Dokken played a very radio friendly style of melodic rock that was all the rage in the 80's.<br /><br />\\"Under Lock & Key\\" is an almost essential release for fans of melodic rock from the 1980's. There really isn't any filler on this album, just songs that aren't as great as the rest. This album helped solidify Dokken as one of the top-tier rock bands from the decade, but their follow-up record put them over the top. This record has everything a good 80's rock record needs. It has catchy choruses, huge production and terrific songs throughout. It doesn't hurt as well to have some of the best musicians availible at their positions either. Most songs are winners, but \\"The Hunter,\\" \\"In My Dreams,\\" and \\"It's Not Love\\" are highlights.<br /><br />Dokken are really one of the genres best. To have no Dokken in your collection is a crime, and should be punishable by law. I'd suggest their \\"Back For The Attack\\" album to start with, but this record is good as well.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a friend, and I was totally engrossed in it. I loved the characters, and the ending came as a surprise.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the ultimate game of all time and if you get this game get the update it is so fun and you can play with other people
0316017930|5.0|My wife received the book \\"Outliers\\" as her birthday gift. One night, I casually started reading it and was hooked to it. It is one of the best book, I have ever read. Like many others, I was always curious to know what makes a person outlier or extremely successful. Writer Malcolm Gladwell delves deep into this subject.  He explained using examples why various famous players, lawyers, businessmen, artist etc such as the Beatles, Bill Gates etc became outliers. In gist, he explained hard work, luck i.e. a person at right place at right time, and cultural background contribute to a persons success.<br /><br />The claims in the book are backed by facts and figures. It is must read and very entertaining. I recommend it and give it a 5 star.<br /><br />Happy reading !!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this jewel blasting game better than any of its predecessors. It is quick, has lots of levels, lots of options, lots of color,  and really keeps you entertained.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I like John Mayer's music, Its contemporary, yet<br />understandable.  He has others that are better, but<br />I would still recommend this one.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore & Ryan Lewis do it again.  I've been a fan for a while and this cd is no exception.  Quality music.
0452289963|2.0|Sorry - Guess I just didn't get it.  Never finished the read.<br />That is why I can't recommend, no offense to Mr. Tolle.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Nice book by King. If you like historical fiction/science fiction...then you will enjoy this book. It is also a great throw back to a time that was beautiful but ugly.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I purchased my Kindle Paperwhite and was reluctant to purchase a case that would remain attached to the device at all times...<br />I'm a purist when it comes to certain things, I guess. Anyway. I didn't want a bulky case, so I opted for this pouch. It seemed lightweight, yet durable enough for my needs (I'm not going skydiving with it; I just want it to keep my Kindle safe in a bag or if it drops from a reasonable height).<br />It works great and I can't complain! Since I'm a mechanic who gets her hands dirty often, I appreciate that the case is not a magnet for dirt. I've managed to keep my Kindle and this sleeve clean. Woo!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I love how the book was written, a very good recount without being too graphic. I also enjoyed the photos and journal excerpts
B009UX2YAC|5.0|FUN, ADDICTING, COLORFUL. I really enjoy the way this game manages to keep surprising me even when I think that I understand its pattern.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case is hard and is not good on the eyes make phone look much bigger and quality is bad and cost an arm and a leg.. don't waste your money.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good functions, easy to use, works like a charm. Very glad I downloaded this. I recommend it to anyone. Enjoy
B007N85POS|5.0|Great fun south of the border with the Angry Birds gang.  Rescue the captive birds from smugglers and blow the smarmy monkeys off their perches.  Great bonuses, I also like the daily reward to help you get high scores on those tricky layouts.  Those guys at Rovio are SICK!  Love all the bird games, have them all.  You will love Rio, especially those pesky monkeys that screech when you blast them off their perch and they go sailing.  Too much fun!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's fun and twisty...time slips away! Engage the brain for some fun and use your imagination. Plan your routes and move on. Have fun...<br />.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My grand daughter saw the movie and wanted to add this one to her collection, she was very happy to get it
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Such a cute movie! Kids love it, and it has very little &#34;scary&#34; parts for young children. Has a lovely cast.
B00136JQMI|5.0|What great tracks from a more mellow and melodic Miles.  From be-bop to blues to fusion. His music and career evolved so much but he was always ahead of the curve.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a fun, addictive game, but it's also expensive. Buying gems is a complete rip off. Otherwise the graphics are good. My siblings love it!
B00A72989U|2.0|Should have listened to the samples more closely.  Too much rap for me.  Will be more careful in the future
B002OEBMN4|4.0|Ahhhh yes, can you ever go wrong with the Slayer boys?  No.  Not if you dig them!  This is a great disc, it's 100% Slayer doing what they do best!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie for family night with my girls! I recommend this to all families! I wonder sometimes if this really could happen in real life!What if?
B008GFI4KY|3.0|More of the same, but it's fun!  This disc is better than the second one...but if its your time checking into the band...please do buy the first one!
B0002V7O3S|5.0|This is a true story about aliens and spaceships and the effects that it has on people.  Ironically, I do not believe that any of the actors were known about in Hollywood - they were not big-name actors - but, did wonderful in this movie.  I will watch it many times in the future.
B000BP86OG|3.0|More of the same but its fun!  This is worth the trip if ya dig em!  I do like the disc!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|great game enjoy the hell out it ! long time plus level base game is awesome! good Job and keep the<br /> coming
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A book beautifully written about love and how life sometimes gets in the way. And remembering that the small things, that seem just insignificant are what is important.
0062082353|5.0|wrote in a maner where i could picture everything. could not put it down. any vet would love this book.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|I've watched this dozens of times.  Fun movie and great music so if you love the 80s and movies then watch.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|It was an awesome movie from beginning to end ! The movie made me think back on my childhood memories of believing in Santa and the tooth fairy ! I absolutely loved this movie :)
B0013FDM7E|5.0|You didn't here much when it was in the theaters, but this movie is great.  The remake of Omega Man which was a great one too.
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|Some how I ended up ordering a blue ray. Gave it away to someone who could play it. Tryed it again and ended up ordering what appears to be an 'on demand' service for one program.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After hearing everyone rave about this I just had to watch it and I am glad i did! What a fantastically arranged show! History, soap opera drama, it has it all! I absolutely loved this show and cannot wait until season 4!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The Kindle Fire finally gets a true Facebook app and it's a waste.  First of all, the app is very similar to the old Facebook app with no true improvements. What's really bad, however, is that it doesn't work.  About 60% of the time it just continuously loads and never takes you to the page you want.  My newsfeed never loads with this thing. Deleting this garbage till Amazon and Facebook fix it.  The old app that takes you to Facebook Mobile is better.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Believable spy heroine although her motivation for being one is extremely subtle.Tone of the novel is a rosy grey. It is not one of Mcewans best endeavors altough the artist's touch is very evident. He paints a believable picture of the English anbience seen through a dusty window. Highly recommended for reading on a lazy afternoon.
B00A8LRIEW|1.0|Love All there work, But this Album Sucks!!! Sorry Guys I've enjoyed all your efforts. \\"The Other Two\\" \\"Electronic\\" \\"Dub Star\\" & Of Course \\"Joy Division\\" This is so far below your standards. I<br /> pre-ordered the album as soon as it became available. Anxiously awaited listening to it. I'm still a fan and always will be.
B00013RC66|4.0|Thrillers tend to be more driven by plot than character. Not the case here. As good as the plot for \\"Black Widow\\" is, the characters give it greater gravity.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Theresa Russell plays a gorgeous, sexy woman, who befriends rich men, marries them, then kills them in ways to not arouse suspicion. As she does so in widely separated areas of the U.S. she doesn't arouse suspicion. Almost. Enter dowdy Debra Winger from the Justice Department. She has a hunch these deaths might be related. She talks her boss into letting her switch from inside researcher to field investigator so she can head to Hawaii and ensnare the Black Widow.<br /><br />The plot here is good enough, but the juxtaposition of the two characters is what gives it its resonance. On one hand you have the sexy black widow. She treats her ensnaring of men as a job. She studies the guys she wants to marry. She studies the things they like to show compatibility so as to heighten her chance of becoming the lover, then wife. Then there's Debra Winger. All she has is her job. Her hair style is low maintenance. Her clothes are nondescript and fit her like potato sacks. Her boss wants to get into her knickers but she's more like one of he guys. She's intrigued by Russell and, at some level, admires her....sexuality(?). She gets a taste of that life. And, though she keeps her eye on the ball, she's not the same gal at the end as she was in the beginning.<br /><br />Bob Rafelson helmed this outing. It's directed well, shot and cut well. The music is good and it has that slick, Hollywood sheen all over it. I like how I was sucker punched in the end. They led me down the path and I followed. I liked it and thought it was clever. If thrillers are your poison, this will satisfy you.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Chuck is one of those underappreciated gems, I'm not sure if it will ever go into syndication so I bought it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this app is awesome. I recimend it to girls because I am one and this is pretty fun. even in survival, it gets hard but it is fun! I totes recomend it to girls!
0385342055|1.0|Okay, the first couple of Shopaholic novels were rather fun...but this has taken it too far for me. Reading about a spoiled kid, for whom you quickly develop an active dislike, and her indulgent, verging on idiotic mother, is more than I can take. Enough with the shopaholics.  In this case, I think the mother and her mini side-kick should both be enrolled in a shopaholic anonymous program.  And I don't want to read about it, either.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy was unlike any other books I have read. I have thouroughly reading enjoyed all three books immensely
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Evidence seldom lies.  It can be misinterpreted or it's significance missed....but it's always there.  You just have to find it..or not.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Always like Craig.  Was glad to see the role &#34;M&#34; played.  However, all are getting old.  Next one should be interesting.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Our book club chose this book and I had never heard of it before.  Didn't have any expectation of liking it.  I was delightfully surprised how much it held my interest.  Looked forward to reading it and had a hard time putting it down.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  It was recommended by our children and reluctantly watched but glad we did.  Good plot, dialogue and action.
B00942G4UA|4.0|Watched this with our 10 and 11 yo and it really spoke to them.  Although I knew most of the info presented in the movie and generally eat organic and avoid processed sugar, flour, etc., transitioning my family to my eating habits has been a slow evolution.  This movie revved things up a bit and I'm pleased to say that after watching it, my son has become outraged at McDonald's and Tyson's -- even sneered at the fact that KFC advertises the fact that they use Tyson's, as though it were a good thing.  I definitely recommend it for families who want to make their kids more aware of what is going on with our food supply.  I could say the same thing a zillion times as a parent and not have nearly the impact that this movie has had on them.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  One of the best.  Even though we knew the outcome it was a nail-biter and kept us on the edge of our seats.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|On any dive more than 12' it is a must.  Shoot a video with it and another without the filter and you will be amazed how much better the video with the filter looks.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Fun game! Easy to get coins yet it challenges you.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is able to download it.
B007N85POS|5.0|This is a wonderful game. It is very addictive, fun for all ages, and I hate to put my kindle down.
B009P5S11G|1.0|I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this CD. There's one good song on it: Stay. The rest is awful! Save your money!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was very worth the money I paid for it!! I would and will probably spend the money to continue the story in #2. My whole family played along with me!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This is the greatest thing since sliced bread!  I can download it on every device and have all my files no matter where I go.
1451695195|4.0|For those of us who have a sense of the presence of God, Dr. Alexander's book will serve as a reminder of what really matters most in life.  I think the book is beautifully written and worth everyone's time and attention.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|It really is a great read, a little sci-fi and a basis on true conflicts of decision making. For a juniors read, adults can be just as addicted to the series
B009POCG2C|5.0|Saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and loved it.  Had to have the DVD,  so we can watch it anytime.  Would recommend this for everyone.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|Even though its a young adult novel, it is appealing to the adults for the exciting suspense and decision making process Harry goes through.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|got this for a gift and from what I have heard, they thought it was funny.  Have always enjoyed the national lampoon's movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so so much.I love animals so that's why this game is awesome.also my favorite animal is a horse.
B00BF11STU|5.0|A really interesting perspective on the killing of ubl. I really liked it. I wish we could still do some of those things to detainees.  Thos mfers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Book was riveting, many twist and turns in the plot that kept you guessing. Ending was not as expected. Good reading.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Takes me back to 1980. Great job. I'm loving it. If you come up with &quot;Centipede&quot; I definitely wanna buy that one.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|after washing first i phone it was recommended so I tried it.liked it but hard to hear incoming calls and cant hear music as well. But I like the security of having it .Grand kid often drop it. But I haven washed it yet lol
B004X8W4A4|2.0|I haven't even finished book. It was not interesting to me.  I prefer the TV show. I won't buy any more of them.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|a wondrous marriage of song and film.  i was blown away by the pace and intensity of ryan goslings performance; a beautiful film.  explosive action though slowly paced with excellent character development of the man, his girl, and her boy.  mad men female partner makes a surprising appearance as bad girl during the robbery set up.
1250027624|5.0|The photos & commentary on the characters of this great series is a must read for all enthusiasts. Have shared with family who are now fans also. Eager to see Season 4, etc.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|I found the book boring, corny, and simple and as my headline says not for the sophisticated reader. A big miss.
B00008G7UF|4.0|I Like Meg Ryan, I Enjoyed the movie a couple of sceans I would not have missed. Kevin Kline was funny.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Could not get in to it.  Difficult to follow, Don't know if free version had some omissions with abbreviations or what was going on in text?
B0041KKYEM|1.0|I did not like this movie, I only watched about the first fifteen minutes and it made me sick. I burned it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Amazing book. Would recommend to everyone who likes Tina fey or anything she has ever done. Highly entertaining and s fast read
B00006ZXSK|5.0|My favorite story from my childhood. This was so different, but a wonderful new take on the original. working in the historical figure of Leanardo D. was so funny. Loved the Prince such a royal reality. The step mother was true to form, as were the step sisters. Loved the other staff. But Cinderella was different her spunkiness and continuious striving to satisify her step mother despite her attitudes was amazing. I really enjoyed this movie.
098478280X|5.0|I wish I had read this book 90 days ago. I wouldn't have blown a great job that I really wanted.<br /><br />This book goes beyond the usual answers to questions likely to be asked. Instead of telling you what to think it teaches you HOW to think. This will prepare you for the hard edged interviews that ask you to go to the white board and write code in front of a group of people. It's not impossible if you know that it's coming. I didn't and I did well but not enough to get a job offer. If I had read this book first and knew what was coming I think I would have nailed it.<br /><br />Sample: Write an algorithm to produce the angle in degrees between the hour and minute hand on a clock. The book doesn't tell you how to do it but how to go about reaching the solution.<br /><br />Priceless!!
B00A85EMVK|4.0|Love the 3D. Looks awesome on my tv. Sound is great makes me feel like I am right in the plane.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I bought Draw Something but it won't let me download the one I bought on my kindle. Kind of aggravating.
B007CW2FCA|5.0|If you like Beethoven's popular piano sonatas you may not like this collection.  I had no idea that Beethoven composed so many piano sonatas until I purchased, received, and played this collection set.  A lot of the sonata's sound almost the same and unless you want to hear all of his sonata's I don't recommend this set.  If, however you want it on hand just in case you feel like listening to Beethoven's genius and want to have his full piano sonatas as a collection(that is what this is, a collector's edition) then you'll want this.  Claudio Arrau is a very good pianist of which I also have in my vinyl collection. It's nice to get him on CD as well.  I would recommend this to a friend.
B00A757EFW|4.0|thanks for a step back into a time I wasn't born into but later learned to love. I wish I had a joystick.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app I think its fun awesome probly whey one loves this app oh and in 18 years old
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I am STILL addicted to this game. I have spent too much on hints, it's ridiculous! Great game, guys! Thanks.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Keeps you guessing to the end... And beyond!<br /><br />Really?? I have to write 12 words? Who says? That's some crazy stuff.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|To be honest, it's very slow and doesn't upload like it should. Maybe it's just my kindle though. Who knows.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game truely Retrolicious. I enjoy the look and gameplay is fun and addictive. I recommend this title all day long.
B00881VLCE|1.0|The puzzles never were too difficult. I wish I could use my own pictures as a puzzle as well. Thanks though!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't wait to watch. The quality of the filming, clothing, accents, old cars is amazing. Please carry more classics like this in the future.
B00BRR66SA|3.0|Most of the album doesn't live up to the promise of the first couple of songs.<br />\\"That Girl\\" is good.  But the other tend to be extended beat tracks with very<br />little musicality. Undoubtedly the live performances will be excellent and<br />will make the songs more memorable.

B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Please don't let you children watch this movie.  It was a good flick, filmed to dark, gave us a good old fashion creep out.
076115678X|5.0|i have curly hair (obviously) so when i searched for ways to go natural after i finally decided to give up on the 7+ years of hair abuse i came across this book that i have never ever heard about as i never paid attention to my hair since my only solution then was straighten it. Now so so soooo glad i found it, learned so much from it and most definitely recommend it!!
B002VX3RCW|4.0|We already had Freddie the Firefly, an early favorite, so this toy has not gotten quite as much love as that one, but I like the different sounds and textures.  Lamaze toys are always a good choice for the under-1 set.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Keeps me busy when I just want to play a relaxing game and enjoyabvle game. Fun for all ages. My whole family has downloaded this app.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Liked the step by step learning that reinforced the message of the book. Slightly dissatisfied for the last 20% which probably went past a bit quick with less explanation. Would love to have seen more about how things were done rather than just a &#34;fait accompli&#34;

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin should have titled the record, the 20/20 masterpiece. This is the record of 2013.Love love this album. I can't wait to get home and hear the record on the sound system. thanks justin for another great one.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Clutch keeps delivering the best music in my opinion, my two favorites are track 4 and 7,have yet to be disappointed with any of their music
B003VANOFY|5.0|I do get the little beep every so often as others have noted. But it only happens a few times a day and I use them all day at work. The wireless range is very good and remains clear. Mic is clear too. You could get better sound with a wired set but for wireless this is really good.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|My wife and I loved this movie:) Really, loved how humor and compassion can be mixed up in a life of suffering.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have enjoyed playing. I'm still learning how to control things but I believe I will have it worked out soon.

B007REV4T8|5.0|Finally a Daniel Craig movie worthy of the old time Bond genre! More like it, please! Suspenseful and edge of your seat worthy.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks continues to write books that you feel as if you are there with the characters. Of course, picturing the movie helped, but the writing and story line were delightful.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|This might take a few more listens to the teenage crowd expecting a bunch of \\"Sexy Back's\\", but Justin Timberlake has grown a lot as an artist in the past 7 years, and this album reflects a mature talent. I kind of chalk up the mixed reviews similar to what Prince has gone through in his career. As he grows and expands his style and offerings, some of his fans are disappointed, however this is BY FAR Timberlake's most ambitious material. I believe people should wait a dozen listens all the way through before writing a review. Growth takes time, and sorry folks there isn't any Future Sex Love Sounds much on here, but open up your music minds and grow with artists before dismissing it as such a letdown. Also 80% of the people will download the MP3 file, and again sorry.. you are missing out on a lot. Compressed MP3 files or Spotify do not do music justice. Shame only about 20% care enough to listen to this on vinyl or cd, on a good system and really HEAR an album, not a collection of radio friendly hits. I'm personally glad that Justin Timberlake has brought \\"Album Backs\\" and left \\"Sexy Back\\" to Justin Beiber.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I usually never write reviews but this game is awesome so there you go 5 stars -yes definitely an old school feel but not boring at all - Id give it 6 stars if it wasn't for the game's name :-)
B007REV4T8|5.0|On the 50th anniversary of the Bond films, &#34;Skyfall&#34; was a big hit with lots of action and a terrific theme song!  After we saw it in the theater, knew we wanted a copy to view again.  Always love the speedy shipping too.

B00AIBZJLG|5.0|It has been more than several years since I viewed a Cirque Du Soleil video and we have never seen the live shows.  Worlds Away is simply a spectacular assortment of their best performances from other shows.  For those who are not familiar with Cirque Du Soleil, it is not your average circus show with elephants, lions, and scads of aerial theatrics and jugglers and clowns.  This is an extravaganza from beginning to end that includes a minimal plot, fantastic costumes, dancing, special effects-visual ,physical, and sound galore!  We will be viewing Worlds Away many more times and would highly recommend it to those who will appreciate a not so ordinary circus show that is extraordinary!

0345529057|5.0|Was worried about the quality of the books since the box set was so inexpensive (I actually triple checked to make sure I wasn't inadvertently buying a kindle version -- I don't own a kindle, I like my books real & not behind a screen) but I have to be 100% honest, the books were in great condition & I'm not sure I have ever been this pleased with an Amazon purchase! Would absolutely recommend these sellers & buy from them again!<br /><br />The books arrived so quickly I wasn't sure what package I had received that day since I wasn't expecting the books for another few days!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|The movie is a great glimpse into a time past. It's also got a compelling story driving it that is bassed on true events.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Spooky but  kept me wanting to continue playing, especially when the crazy whispers would come out of nowhere  and scare me.
B005WYFLNU|3.0|We had purchased the Dress-Up Pad a couple weeks after we bought the Melissa & Doug Habitats Reusable Sticker Pad, for our 2 year old daughter.  She does great with the Habitats Pad, the stickers are all a good size and can easily be placed on any of the scenery sheets (if you want, the dinosaurs can be placed on the farm template, with no problem.)  However, the dress up sticker pad isn't this way; the template sheets of the girls are not interchangeable with all stickers.  For example, some of the girls have one arm in the air, so placing a dress with long sleeves won't &#34;work&#34;... the arms stick out, and I feel it takes an older child to understand that.  Secondly, the stickers are smaller and some are white, which blend in with the paper background making it harder for smaller children to see/use.  ***One BIG Suggestion:  For all of her sticker sheets, reusable or not - it makes it a lot easier for small children if you first remove the scrap that surrounds the stickers.  I do this with all of my daughters stickers and reusable forms, it makes it a lot easier for her to get them out herself and less likely for her to rip them in the process.

B00AATV046|5.0|Samuel Goldwyn's THE BISHOP'S WIFE (1947) was released a year after Frank Capra's [[ASIN:B000HEWEJO IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE]], and the picture is in a way related to it. Both are Christmastime stories of angels sent to help someone, and both feature little Karolyn Grimes as the main characters' child. (\\"Look, Daddy! Teacher says, every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings.\\")<br /><br />\\"The Bishop's Wife\\" is Loretta Young. Her husband, Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) is trying to raise funds for a cathedral, but he's confounded by Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), a curt, wealthy widow and primary donor who wants the edifice to be a memorial to the late Mr. Hamilton. When Henry prays for Divine guidance, an angel named Dudley (Cary Grant) appears.<br /><br />A side story concerns Prof. Wutheridge, delightfully portrayed by Monty Woolley. He's an aging, atheistic historian with a severe case of writer's block (been working on the same history of Rome for 20 years).<br /><br />Dudley gets involved in everyone's life, bringing joy to all he comes in contact with except the man who conjured him up, the bishop. Partially scripted by Billy Wilder and Robert Sherwood, this is a story filled with magic, a few neat special effects, and lots of love. Highest recommendation!<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.5) The Bishop's Wife (1947) - Cary Grant/Loretta Young/David Niven/Monty Woolley/James Gleason/Gladys Cooper/Elsa Lanchester/Karolyn Grimes/Regis Toomey

B007PC3HFG|5.0|MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was a dismal failure as a BBC television special, and justly so. In fact, it was so awful the program was never aired in the United States. Unscriptedly ad-lib and haphazard, the film's occasional musical performance highlights couldn't redeem what was a silly exercise in group personal excess.<br /><br />Conversely, the American record album of MMT (ironically unavailable in Britain) was a wondrous thing indeed. Inside the record's foldout cover are several pages of 12\\" stills taken directly from that strange movie. The LP also contain the complete song lyrics. Best of all, several Top 40 records that weren't a part of that original TV show were used to flesh out this set.<br /><br />The majority of the songs on this Xmas '67 release received a great deal of American AM radio airplay at the time. No other US Beatles album contain as many chart topping hits as MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. Pretty good for what at the time was considered a letdown for all involved and their fans.<br /><br />In many ways, MMT holds up better than SGT. PEPPER'S. Musically, if not cinematically, this was the Beatles at their height as a cohesive group.<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[2:51] Magical Mystery Tour<br />[3:00] The Fool on the Hill<br />[2:16] Flying (Instrumental)<br />[3:56] Blue Jay Way<br />[2:29] Your Mother Should Know<br />[4:36] I Am the Walrus<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[3:30] Hello, Goodbye<br />[4:10] Strawberry Fields Forever<br />[3:03] Penny Lane<br />[3:03] Baby, You're a Rich Man<br />[3:48] All You Need Is Love<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 36:48

B0057H0H4K|5.0|Recorded between 2/22/69 and 8/20/69, [[ASIN:B007Z2IAAI ABBEY ROAD]] (SO 383) was released on September 27th, 1969.<br /><br />This last and best Beatles album was a fitting cap to a stellar career for four lads from Liverpool, the likes of which will never be seen again.<br /><br />\\"Abbey Road\\" was created after [[ASIN:B000TBGGOE LET IT BE]] but released prior. The feuding Beatles went into this project by putting aside all differences for the music's sake, and knowing it would be their last LP together. George Martin agreed to oversee their sessions only if things were done his way. The results were truly spectacular.<br /><br />Discover the greatest rock band of the 20th Century, or relive the final Beatles miracle that, with the able assistance of Mssr. Martin, came to life at the Abbey Road studios.<br /><br />Highest possible recommendation!<br /><br />TRACK TRIVIA<br />George Harrison played moog synthesizer on \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Because.\\" John came up with the structure for the latter after Yoko played  the chords of Beethoven's \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" backwards.

After the frustrated drummer walked off the WHITE ALBUM sessions, he got his inspiration while cruising on Peter Sellers' yacht. The first line of \\"Something\\" was inspired by James Taylor's \\"Something in the Way She Moves,\\" from his first and only [[ASIN:B000LYDPJS APPLE album]]. The line \\"Here come old flat-top\\" was nicked by John from Chuck Berry's \\"You Can't Catch Me.\\" An infringement lawsuit from Berry's record company ended when the Beatles bought the company outright.<br /><br />Paul and George Martin devised the 16 minute song medley that is this set's highlight.

B0094K1WZE|3.0|Will watch again sometimes. Got sleepy on it. Started out with lots of action.I liked Tom Cruise and his costar.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Video quality is good, but I don't like it as much as the Borgia's. I will continue watching because it is still a good story.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it, it is large enough and bright enough to see. It helps to relax a person. Something we need every so often.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This novel is very entertaining and has enough twists and turns to keep the reader's attention.  While the ending is somewhat predictable, I thoroughly enjoyed this fast, entertaining read.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|I can not open it on my kindle !! Maybe my grand Daughter can help me when she comes to visit.<br />Guess you've figured out I am elderly and a bit slow. Thanks.
B007HO392S|4.0|Love the song Blown Away.  The album seems to concentrate too much on death/revenge, but the songs are great and good driving music.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Totally unique sound: I don't hear Country, Rock, Pop, or Jazz, but rather a synergistic blend of them all.<br />Amazing vocal harmonies: they are right on (or \\"spot on\\"), as if they've been singing together for years.<br />The lyrics are interesting and fun.  The melodies go places you wouldn't expect and it all just works.<br />You can practically hear their smiles as they are singing.<br /><br />Before this album, I wasn't a big fan of Kenny Loggins, and I didn't know Gary Burr or Georgia Middleman.<br />Now I can't get enough of their music!
B004I744AS|5.0|I put in a word into search and then as if by magic that word will appear, like herpes after a drunken night spent with that special &quot;lady&quot; friend you have to pay to spend time with you.<br />Then a definition casually shows up, rips you out of the car, and beats the knowledge into you. And it's not just one definition, no, it's three or four. The first ones usually a noun, then comes the verb (verbs never fight fair),  but you know that you're really going to be walking away from this dictionary without any questions or currency is when the proper noun shows up. Shows with its flashy CAPITAL LETTERS, that general sense of entitlement, and the willingness to stomp any other kind of puny noun at a moment's notice.<br />So you might as well rate this  app five stars to begin with because by the time the definitions show up and the way they use that word in a sentence, you'll have nothing left to input into search slot.  Nothing but the shame of knowing you could have gotten to the same conclusion by yourself but now you're broke, beaten, and itchy.<br /><br />All and all though, it's a good app I'll continue to use. Probably daily.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The storyline is very impressive, The graphics are outstanding, and overall, definitely one of the best mobile puzzle games of all time...

B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I thought this move was hilarious! You might have to have somewhat of a twisted sense of humor to enjoy this movie.  I'd say if you don't, you might not want to waste your time or money. Be prepared to laugh....a lot.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the app it's GOOD.  But...every time I exit and come back I have about 70 more gems than I used to.  So I'm afraid that it's buying gems for REAL MONEY!!!!  I would not get this app unless you want to lose REAL MONEY!!!!  Otherwise it's an okay app.

B005K2Z2O2|5.0|I bought a Timbuk2 messenger bag over twenty years ago. Bullet proof, rain proof, could carry an immense amount of stuff with reasonable comfort. I'd still have it but when you loan something to your kids... I have a small messenger bag by Timbuk2 which I still carry frequently, and when I bought a Paperwhite, this was the logical choice. I like to read with minimal distraction, so I don't like covers that you leave on, so this one is my favorite. If I lost it, I'd get another right away.
B008IBP24C|5.0|Just love everything about it. I could watch episodes every day.  It will be hard to wait for Season 4.
B00A8OQBGU|5.0|I've been on the Biffy train ever since I listened to Puzzle because I had to know what kind of sound a band with a name like that produced. I have never been so thankful for a discovery of a band like this.<br /><br />Biffy is classified as &#34;rock,&#34; but these gents truly play everything - there's hints of epic anthem rock (&#34;Different People&#34;), bagprog (bagpipes + prog on &#34;Stingin' Belle&#34;), ballads (&#34;Skylight&#34;) and plain old pop (&#34;Pocket&#34; should be making apperances in rom-coms). But it's done with such a diverse musicality that it never feels boring. I also really appreciate the new and inventive time signatures and changes throughout the songs.<br /><br />Buy this album and Mon the Biff. You'll never be the same.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|This story could've been good, but the writing is killing it.  The tone is flat and the characters are just thrown together.  Sentences read something like, \\"this happened, and then this, and then this happened...\\".  Maybe the author meant for the book to read like pages from a young girl's diary?  This book is no \\"gone with the wind\\", or \\"the help\\" - which are two books some of the more positive reviewers are comparing it to.  I have to finish it, I guess, but I'm scrolling along quickly just to get to the end.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|This is definitley experimental (and even dated) pop, but it's done so well that you don't mind some of the production. The middle of the album (particularly the &#34;That Girl,&#34; &#34;Groove&#34; and &#34;Mirrors&#34; stretch) are undeniably catchy and will sound terrific live.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|I loved it as a child now my grand kids are enjoying it too. Thank u. I'll krrp purchasing these wonderful memories for my grand kids.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|We've liked this woman's voice since we first saw her on Graham Norton's show.  Her lyrics and her music rock.
1616550414|5.0|While offering insight on many Zelda games in the series, the in-depth focus on Skyward Sword lets you see the game from a developer's perspective.<br /><br />Do you like The Legend of Zelda? Own this book.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This is the second Josh Groban album that I bought for my wife.  I like it just as much as she does.  If you like his other albums, you will probably like this one, too.
0399157565|5.0|Daughter loves Cornwell books.  Too graphic for me!  Makes a great gift for her though.  Waiting for the next one...
B000NVIXDW|5.0|If you liked Frank Sinatra, this young man's voice will bring back old memories and create new ones.  We love it.
0756405890|5.0|This book has to be my favorite series! I am not a big reader, but these books have me hooked! Definately recommend it!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele.  Lyrics of rage and sadness and love and loss.  She is always superb.  This is just another album that proves how wonderful she is.
0062200909|5.0|This &#34;art & design&#34; book is a great addition to a hobbit-related reference collection. Excellent resource for details and information!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is one of the very first Josh Groban albums that I purchased for my wife and it was superb.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|The roman is excellent, very well written but I miss the characters and plots from Miles romans (especially from the first ones). The roman presents an &#34;upgraded&#34; version of Ivan but still he is not a match for Miles. I read with pleasure the novel, the plot was interesting with many funny situations. I highly recommend reading the novel even by those who are not familiar with the Vorkosigan universe.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The media produced wonderful images and the cast was extraordinary.  Wonderful graphics added a substantial element to the entire film.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Love a book that keeps you engaged right to the very end.  This was one of those books.  It's a psychological thriller.  I will be looking for more books from this author.
B0038AUY96|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down! Awesome and thrilling to the bone read! Would definitely reccommend to my friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 7 year old daughter loves this game.  She says that it is very addicting to play and will keep her busy for a little while.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Its wonderful watching a show about an Era long gone. A time when there was still honor and chivalry. Beautiful cinematography.
B005KELW26|5.0|I bought this for my wife's Kindle Fire and couldn't be more pleased.  The magnetic clasp ans interior pocket allow her to carry notes and papers with her so she's not burdened with having to carry her purse as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author!  I love all of his books....once you start reading it, you have to finish it before you can put it down!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|How wonderful to be able to sit down and enjoy a movie that is inspiring without being insipid.  Highly recommendfed.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This book was really good at the beginning and made me want to keep reading.  Then it got boring. I kept waiting for them to get caught by the FBI at some point, but that never happened.  There should have been more plot twists and turns.  Their plan went off too perfectly to be believable.  I probably won't read Grisham again.
0345536886|5.0|John  Grisham always writes an exciting book, from beginning to end, making his characters very real and the their situations unique, but belleveable.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I was dying to finally get this game.  Once purchased I couldn't log into FB.  So disappointed.  That was my whole purpose.  So I contacted Amazon and the same thing happened to them.  So they gave me a link to contact the owners of the game:  [...]
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Where is he whwn we need him? He could straighten this country out. This is good TV - I miss it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I really enjoy the game. The different types of dragons are cute. The only negative thing I have to say is about girting your neighbors. It will only let you send to 3 people a day so if you get more than that then you have to pick which 3 to give back to..It's not fair to them. That's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.

B001223BLU|5.0|All the best tracks from one of the best groups of the 60s. Good to have all in one place.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|This soundtrack is so colorful.  It really takes the audience on a journey.  I just wish the composers would've composed full-length music, instead of 3-4 minute made-for-movie songs.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I am so addicted to this game that I don't have time to leave a long review. Buy it, you'll love it.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I saw the movie not knowing much about the story.  The trailers didn't quite pique my interest.  I thought it was a beautiful movie with a vainglorious story about a protagonist and its pet tiger.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.  This turned out to be such a wonderful film with such an inspiring story, it moved me to tears.<br /><br />But the movie (and the story) isn't perfect.  One thing I didn't quite appreciate was Pi's pronouncement for &#34;God&#34;--although I can see how odd it would've been for him to call out &#34;33 million Hindu gods&#34; or &#34;Allah.&#34;  As a atheist, I didn't quite care for the religious value of the story.<br /><br />Nonetheless, his story of finding hope in life after a total loss is worth the time to watch over and over.
0525953728|5.0|In \\"No Easy Day\\", it takes you on the mission to kill Osama bin laden in a way you didn't think was possible. This book caught my attention from the time I laid eyes on it. Once I started reading, I didn't want to stop. Even though I knew it wasn't going to be easy waking up for school the next morning, I still stayed up reading this intense novel.<br />  I really appreciated the fact that the author put so much detail into the book, from how high-tech the gear was to how they shot all the enemies. I also liked how the author talked about all the training he and the SEAL TEAM 6 had to go through.<br />  Overall, best book I've read so far even though it's the only book I have ever finished. I highly recommend it to those who have an interest in the Navy S.E.A.Ls.
081299471X|5.0|It's a modern classic, this piece of art.  I've never read anything quite like it.  He moves about his stories in their own unique styles so effortlessly.<br /><br />The Sonmi story is by far the most engaging.  But I must say as someone who's lived in Korea, he makes a few hiccups in regards to Korean geography and language, which can be distracting--if I were to recall, I remember Michell talking about a &#34;Mount Taemosan&#34; but &#34;san&#34; in Korean already means mount/mountain, so it effectively reads, &#34;Mount Taemo Mountain.&#34;  But for most readers, it won't even be noticed.<br /><br />The movie, though it perplexingly received a mixed critical review, is also worth checking out.  The story on both media made quite an impact on how I view the past and the future.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its great to occupy some time when you dont want to get into anything major. each game takes only a few minutes to play games range in difficulty and with a good selection. i find myself playing at night before bed to get points built up to unlock new games.. great app
0762777931|5.0|For Real. Wow! I learned a lot by reading this book. Kris is a quirky writer, and this book is directed at women. It makes alot of sense. It has a 21 day detox in it and a lot of recipies. I have been doing the detox for 5 days now. I feel amazing!! I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Seasons 1,2 & 3 were excellent!  The acting and learning about the nobility class in England was very inspiring!  I'm learning how to hold my knife in my right hand and eat with my fork in my left hand.  Fun!<br />So far there are no problems with the dvds.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The characters were so real.  I felt that I got to know  each one.on a personal level.  I would highly recommend this book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I kept stopping myself from reading it because I didn't want the story to end! I can't wait to discuss this with lnlbookclub.com
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is a simple shooter similar to galaxian and galaga. Power ups are slways good. Graphics are not the fanciest, but look good. Samsung S3
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|I have been a fan since the beginning and I love how they have evolved with time.  If I want to listen to 80's rock, I'll listen to one of their old albums.  This album is perfect for this stage of my life.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It is unfortunate that the majority of books today cannot even compare to the classics some of us have had the fortune to steal a glance into, the opportunity to live in a world greater than our own, even if it is just for a little while. The Night Circus, however, is not what people today deem \\"works of art\\" but an example of what books should be.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Movie was exactly what was expected, good character action and performances. Reccommend others to make sure they watch it or buy it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a awesome game I totally recommend it.  I'm always excited to play this game. It's fun and safe.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|Did not live up to my expectations that were formed from watching the first two movies just didn't seem to make it!
B001DJ7PR8|1.0|don't know why I bought this - had forgotten that i'd seen it and must have bought it for the sake of Scarlett Johansson who's a babe. Anyway I don't like this movie because it's decadent.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I thought I was getting a camera.  I didn't know that it was for Spyke.  I don't use Spyke.  When it said camera, my image was camera.  I won't use it and think it should be made clear that it is Spyke.  My I Pad has a camera but not a good one.  Also I do not understand  why anyone would have to pay for it.  Just don't get it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|loved this movie. it was subtle, gentle, intelligent, great acting, just the right balance of everything. I can't believe people rate all kinds of junk 5 star and this one has a 3 star average :) too funny.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|My friend told my to get this and I am glad that I did.  I need a address book that Is can be close to me.  I have looked at it a started puting infomation in it.  Now, all I have to do is finish that.  It will be so convienient.
B004499LX0|2.0|gave this movie good chance but it didn't do the job. it has some interesting scenes but overall it's 2 star at best. loved Jolie - superstar great acting gorgeous.
B0063IH60K|2.0|There was a certain card came that solitare has but I can't find it.  Looked at a few games and no instruction of how to play the game. Since I don't play many card games it would be nice to have easy to follow instructions.  Therefore dissapointed.
B008L1F91A|5.0|The design is spectacular, highly detailed facial expression, wonderful colors, just great. stands well to the base. the box it comes is excellent
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|Not enough prompts for me after I enter a word.  If you have any ideas of a better dictionary I would be very interested.  My husband does better than this in his sleep.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It has great graphics and story line. It is easy to play and has just enough of a challenge to be fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It had romance and suspense. I couldn't put it down. Take this one to the beach. In the end there was a lot to think about
0761169253|1.0|... overrated ... he may 'steal' ... but no artist is he ... black marking typeface? ...<br />possibly helpful for the undeveloped, clueless, digitally-oriented, isolated, insulated, middle-America pre-pubescent, adolescent ...<br />many quotes of other people ...<br />lightweight, surficial and cartoonish ...<br />not provacative ...<br />nothing in depth ...<br />regret purchase ...
B007AJFSJW|2.0|Krugman is a Nobel laureate, yet I'm amazed his analysis of baby-sitting co-op is so utterly flawed. He gave this example in two of his books (I only read two). His example is this. In Washington DC, bunch of folks (yuppies from how he describes them) got together and decided to form a baby sitting co-op. People would be issued vouchers good for 1 hour of baby sitting. If another couple baby sit mine, I'd give them 1 voucher for 1 hour and I get vouchers for baby sitting other couples' babies. Given the limited number of vouchers issued, some (many?) decided to save them for a day when they really need them, so they baby sat more than they went out. This resulted in \\"depression\\" as there were surplus of couples willing to baby sit, but not as many to go out (ie, use the vouchers). Their solution was to give out more vouchers. Then the people had reserves and they were free to go out and ended the depression. So Krugman's conclusion is that government should print more money to get out of depression. HOW WRONG HE IS!<br /><br />Baby sitting vouchers are not money. They are wealth. No matter how many vouchers there are, it is still 1 hour of baby sitting per voucher. But money is not wealth. Printing more money merely raises the cost of bread, not have more bread to go around. Think of it this way. What would happen to price of bread if the minimum wage is raised to $99999999999999999/hr? Would it still cost $1/bread? I repeat myself: no matter how many vouchers there are, each still earns 1 hour of time. Better analysis of his example is if the government goes out and gets things of value (not paper voucher or paper money) and give to people. How do you do that?<br /><br />Ghenghis Khan came close. Go and plunder another country of their goods and services. Goods in terms of all that people might want, be it silk or gold or whatever. Services in terms of all that entire people might want, mostly in form of slaves. I say \\"all\\", because in the co-op example, the only thing of value in that universe was baby sitting time, which was increased by more voucher. In that case, \\"government\\" gave all things of value without any possibility of inflation. What is value in real economy? That's everything anyone would ever want.<br /><br />Reading his books, I got the sense that he doesn't really discuss things with the people of other side. He brings lots of straw man arguments, many of which are pretty ridiculous and easy to knock down. But he fails to dig deeper and give very few meaningful thoughts which leaves me wanting deeper discussions. I did like few topics such as the way he discusses inflation and currency \\"adjustments\\". In the end though, you get very little out of the book unless you're a dogmatic believer who champions his ideas without any critical thought.<br /><br />Finally, I'm not an economist and I didn't have dogmatic left or right stance before I read the books. But more I read, the more the right side (ie, fresh water economist) makes sense. And it doesn't help that renowned left economist such as Krugman has such glaring flaws in logic and sometimes in history. I still have an open mind. I'll continue to read from both sides of the aisle, including some of Krugman's work, and always with critical eye.
0938045695|5.0|great book that is walking me through the whole RKC cert. guidelines and prerequistes. A must buy for all KB lifters.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I love this movie and it is safe to watch with anyone in the family. I'm looking forward to my upcoming movie night with this movie.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Compact, still can put my head on side of a  pillow with these, sound is great, does not hurt my ears, AND most important, it stays in my little ears!<br />Using it for movies on the computer!<br />This is the best product I have ever purchase in my long life... Really!!<br /><br />Eileen H Yaeger, NY
B000VOC90Y|4.0|very good<br />It's a big bag with lot of room and it's very easy to put a laptop inside<br /><br />I'm happy this pourchase
B003HE2B9E|5.0|I heard Ori interviewed on the radio and decided to give it a try... And glad I did. Her playing is great and I was surprised how many sings I recognized. Looking forward to trying more of hers

B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a fun little game, definitely has the retro feel from when i was a kid. I enjoyed the first few rounds, expect to play the rest as soon as possible.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Random Play or Winning Play you can. Use your skills and every game is a winner. Have not tried the multiplayer option, however, I am sure that is as successful as the rest of the options I've tried and liked.
B008220D7S|5.0|This movie was awesome and funny, A must buy movie. Lots of laughs. Better than knocked up and just as funny as Ted. Do yourself a favor and rent or buy this one.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great action movie full of good actors and includes some very good humor - well worth watching - enjoy ...
0307719774|5.0|I got this more than a year ago, and I'm keeping up with it. Its fun and can take as little as one minute to fill out each day. Its fun to see what I was doing and how I was feeling exactly a year ago.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|I am speechless with awe and wonder to this epic movie of sheer swaggieness.<br />However many scenes were quite danky.
B009KEN87O|5.0|really cool ,  kinda combines space invaders and astroids, and the controls are really easy.  great overall game and lots of fun
B0011Z31V8|5.0|Includes big hits &#34;1999,&#34; &#34;When Doves Cry,&#34; &#34;Kiss,&#34; and &#34;U Got The Look&#34; and others.  To fit 18 songs in, the album has single edits of &#34;I Wanna Be Your Lover,&#34; &#34;1999,&#34; &#34;When Doves Cry,&#34; &#34;I Would Die 4 U,&#34; &#34;Sign O' The Times,&#34; and &#34;Diamonds and Pearls.&#34;  This doesn't really bother me because I heard most of them that way on the radio originally.  If I could make my own best of Prince CD, I would have taken &#34;Gett Off&#34; and &#34;Money Don't Matter 2 Night&#34; and replaced them with &#34;7&#34; and &#34;Delirious,&#34; plus added the single edit of &#34;Controversy.&#34;
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game reminds me of some of the games on WII, but on my kindle fire.  My granddaughter likes this game.  Great to occupy some waiting time.
B005OP7162|4.0|Revenge is a great new series to pick up and watch.  It's not one of my favorites, but a really good watch.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to watch a new series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I reread this trilogy every couple of months, it doesn't get old, and I usually find something I've missed or forgotten each time
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Got this for free and love the graphics. Good time pass. Takes some good skill too. One of the better games out there!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Excellent treatise  on the workings of the young adolescent mind. I expected the main character to be a milk toast shy kid so he was a surprise. Realistic account of the more subtle bullying that goes on today.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Second best of the hunger games series. End was cut a little short but I cried a bit. Good read.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Great little Retro shooter, with some new tweaks&iexcl;!&iexcl; Small in size and very fun...just played it for half an hour solid. Glitches once in a while from end of level screen: oh well, loads back up fast:-) And I'm sure it'll be fixed in an update soon&iexcl;?&iexcl;
B000NHQZ1S|5.0|Loved this movie.  It's interesting that this was like a film school type project.<br />Will keep watching this movie again.
1616550414|5.0|This book is a must for any legend of zelda fan.  It is a bit biase towards the more recent games but the details on the older games are still very interesting.
B000YMQI6E|4.0|I like the movie.  It was hard to watch in some parts.<br />I felt that the story line could have been a little stronger.<br />Maybe more the believable aspect of the story I questioned.<br />The acting was good in the movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome only 1 way to make it better make a sequel that is co op bary and fill.  F2f hedgehogs gfgcbcncjgcbch B-) p.s. that was just s t necessary
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I downloaded this app for my kindle fire and I've had nothing but issues with it! It won't load pages, won't let me click links, won't go back to my news feed after I've clicked on an article (I have to restart it every time). It freezes up, shows pictures distorted, and I've had to uninstall and reinstall twice. Unfortunately,the app store doesn't seem to have much selection for really good Facebook apps so I guess I just have to deal with it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is a standard real time city builder game dressed up as My Little Pony.  Great for kids, and adults can get into optimizing the Ponyville' s output in bits.
B00BP4WAZS|1.0|Noisy violent and definitely not appropriate for young kids.  My 6 year old granddaughter insisted that all her school friends had seen it and I rented it for $4.99. I pulled the plug after about 10 minutes.  And we wonder why kids are hyper adhd and prone to bullying and violence!!
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|I didn't like the way she writes. It didn't seem to flow correctly and there were some parts that were stretched out to much. The idea of the story was pretty good though.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Attention grabbing film that shows some of the real behind the scenes work that goes into the criminal defense system.
B000065V3H|5.0|Great, classic movie! Disk and case were in great condition and I was able to enjoy this movie with my family.
B002N2LEVM|3.0|I'm disappointed this show was cancelled.  After watching season one's final episode, I just watched the series finale. I then went backwards to view the other episodes.
B000R8YC1S|5.0|I love this movie, I was a little disappointed that I didn't get the box cover with the DVD though.
B000000XB9|5.0|I have been to see Creedence Clearwater Revisited (without John Fogerty) twice in the last year and this CD is almost the entire concert and sounds the same as the guys playiing in it.  Great memories
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Love it fun funny my kids won't stop playing they learn an lot andddddddddddddd they are in the love it fun funny shot at the chance to work with all of the love
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it. Each shows make you want to watch more. Rick is a little weird but that makes it interesting
0143122061|3.0|I've just start reading it and my gut feeling is that it will ignite a lot of thinking and criticism.<br />The style of Mr. Ferguson is great.
B00AUU2KI0|4.0|The movie and the book really compliment each other. great deal fast service and why do Ihave to write more than i want to say to satisfy this NOW stupid review
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game to play. I am like addicted to this amazing game. It is hard to put down this spectacular game.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the app, it's fun! But it WILL NOT stop going back to the home screen after it said at the bottom &quot;welcome back to amazon game circle&quot;. I'm always having to uninstall it and install it again. I like it, but I don't like the app.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am truly an instant fan. Thank you for sharing this with the world. I was pulled along the entire time.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|This is got to be one of his bests albums he has the songs are all off the chain this CD is that shot!!!!

B009KEN87O|5.0|Reminds me of game play of my youth when a quarter provided me with entertainment at the arcade.  Time was cheaper then,the world less complicated and so was the game play.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I really love this app! The update is totally satisfying! I love how it is really fast and never glitches. :D sooooo cool!!!!!!
B004XQO8VO|5.0|This happens to be my favorite movie of all time!! I love how quirky Wesley Snipes is in this flick and Stallone is his usual good guy badass!! I would recommend it to anyone!
B006X5L6VS|1.0|Without the internal compass the graphic does not move without touching and dragging it around.  I  probably did not read the fine print prior to purchase.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've been playing with this app for some time on my tablet.  I like the magazine format fine. However on my tablet I kept getting lost going to the next page....accidentally closing the app or ending up in a different section than the one you were reading.  However you can go settings and change to list style, with scrolling. This has made it more comfortable for me to use on my tablet.<br /><br />The app will read in your feeds from Google reader.  You can see them by swiping in from the left side.  Swiping from the right will allow you to see other  popular news.
B009KEN87O|5.0|fun. Brings me back to my old 2600 days then with one power up brings me to my old Sega master system days. Awesome time wastet.
0689835604|5.0|Cute book!  Baby loves to lift up the pages!  One of her favorites!  The pages do get bent a bit.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great old school game.  Brings back memories of the arcade games and hours of fun.  Nice easy control. Great work on this game shows.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|This is the second time this has happen on Amazon Instant Video. I ordered a 48 hr rental of the movie. Amazon charged me and I watched 1/2 the movie....went to finish (within 48 hrs) and its not available. What's up with that?<br /><br />Amazon, if you are going to offer a service, offer a service! No wonder Netflix is blowing you away on instant video....you guys just can't seem to get your act together.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a Civil War writer of books based solely upon Official Records and primary sources written by the men who experienced the uncomfortable camps, tedious marches and bloody battles of that horrific war, I found &#34;No Easy Day&#34; to be squarely in the center this important history genre. From my studies of the experiences of men who took place in the American Civil War 150 years ago, I discovered many, frequently subtle, similarities of the experiences of &#34;Mark Owen&#34; and his fellow Navy Seals. In my opinion, this fully authenticated his book about another important event in the military history of the land of the free and the home of the brave.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Mix of galaxy and asteroid.  Simple graphics but fun to play. Just downloaded and have already played for two hours straight.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This whole series has been addictive.  I didn't see it on tv but have been trying to watch an episode each night or so and I can hardly wait to see how each season will end.
B00BF11STU|2.0|Director failed to tell a story. The CIA agent is unbelievable. The anger of the CIA agent is weak. The posting of the number of days of inaction on the glass wall is silly, weakly played. The Seal team played by weak unknown actions, thus, overplayed considerably. Th film is on the level of B-films of the 50s. The film has as little drams as did the series of films, Hopalong Cassidy and Roy Rogers of the 50s. All flimsy and people trying to be dramatic and serious. Everyone too self-conscious. I am glad I waited to rent rather than pay big bucks at the theatre. I am weary of these jingoistic and flag-waving films. Resembles the the propaganda films of WWII. At least in those films Americans were the good guys and women -  and the Germans and Japanese were the torturers.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A lot of my friends were talking about this show so I decided to purchase it. I'm so glad I did. I love the elegance of the Crawley family and their home Downton Abbey. I enjoy watching the servants and what their jobs were like during this period and also all the different scenarios that are constantly changing. I just ordered Season 3 and can't wait to watch it!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I loved this because it teaches while being an interesting story. Mitch Albom never dissapoints me. I look forward to his next book.
B005CMSDLE|3.0|This too was another Christmas present so I didn't watch so really can't give it a review at this time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the game because the horse is really cute. Also I can't own a real horse so this is a great substitute.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Unlike other extended features/bonuses.. this movie documents the filming from beginning to end and is narrated by Peter Jackson. It is basically full versions of the snippets from his Vlog (video blog) that he posted on the official website during filming.<br /><br />The movie. Meh. Its more &#34;fun&#34; than LotR trilogy with much more humor and adventure than blood shed and battles. But, this is how Tolkein wrote it. I purchased it via Video On Demand as I retired physical media a few years ago.<br /><br />The HD quality was just as good or better than a Blu-ray disk. I could have purchased it for $2 cheaper on Vudu, but I wanted to make sure I purchased from a cloud storage video service that I knew would be around forever.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Well written and very interesting.  I don't recommend it to anyone under the age of 16 mainly because of the language an being grafic.  But it gives a view of the war through the eyes of the men that are fighting it. It lets people know what is really going on over there.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|every song is worth listening too at least ten times only if all musicians would make a good cd to listen
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the third book I read by Colleen Hoover. I couldn't put it down. Loved the story line and I love that her leading male characters are good guys that respect their women.<br />I would recommend this book across all age groups, women and men.
B004EBZX6W|1.0|But it does not refresh if you leave it on (you need to close it, reopen). The main screen shows all available, but I could not find any other features - like how to focus on only 1 ...
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|With great graphics and just enough challenge to keep the games interesting, this app is perfect for someone that loves this type of game. Easy to pause between levels (but sometimes hard for me to stop playing) and has no flaws on my ICS Android tablet. Perfect!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Great children movies and family highly recommend.<br />my children would love to watch again, story was great and fun and laughter
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Not very entertaining..unless you are into potty humor!  Too unrealistic for me.  Men do not talk to teddy bears and Teddy bears don't curse!
B00APUQT7I|2.0|nothing too exciting about the movies, it was not that great.<br />story was too long and boring. I'd almost fall asleep on this movies!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well crafted and gripping. Novel concept. Great value. Believable characters. On the whole, a very enjoyable read. I will look for others by this author.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Just a adult spend whole life with teddy bear and got so attach forget he's out grown itself. It's wasn't for me.
B0009X75UG|5.0|I consider this album as One of my Very Best purchases. This Great Musician can make you travel through Time and Space with his Art. One of the selections on this CD can be used for a particular movie from the 60's, Cleopatra, when she travels in her galley. There is never a dull moment with this album, the effect never wears away.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Really enjoyed the suspense,  and a MOTHERS LOVE So realistic and educational, just WOWED ME TOTALLY, came to me as a recommend for a book club, many read twice and still enjoyed. Did not dissapoint for a GREAT READ.Great realistic read. LOVED just give it a chance, it is a book that gets better with every chapter.Something that most people can relate to,especially THE MOM. A BOOK that makes you wonder what next?YES highly recommend to any avid kindle reader.I'm getting tired of the FIFTY SHADES THING, wanted a great novel for a change and this delivered.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my favorite game.  I play it for hours and hours. You'd think I'd try something else,but no!  What else can I say,\\"I'm addicted.\\"
B009GESJH2|5.0|I saw Mr. Rock and Bob Seger last week and it was fantastic...picked up Rebel Soul at the show and it is really good.  If you like classic rock, mixed up with some country, hip hop, and blues...buy it!  Catt Boogie, The Mirror, Rebel Soul, Let's Ride, and Celebrate are my favorite tunes...but it is solid from start to finish.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I Love every song! Bruno is so soulful. I would buy anything he put out. I love it. Love it LOVE it!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong and this is a fun game.  Sometimes I have trouble seeing if a tile is clear to match but that just made it more challenging for me.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I generally like Justin, but this CD is a waste of space! I only like 2 songs on this 10 song monstrosity. Several of the songs are like 8 or 9 minutes long. After a few minutes the pain just got worst because it was extra long. I wouldn't recommend buying this.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but am very pleased with this game.  I love to solve puzzles and this game suits that need.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great read.  You always are looking for the next story twist that is surely around the corner.  Not a great literary block buster but a fun read.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I was excited to see this Pac-Man game but, upon further inspection, I was greatly disappointed. It wasn't like the old game I played.
0790737345|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out on dvd.  I fell in love with the movie.  Nicholas Cage was stunning and mesmerizing and Meg Ryan was awesome.  The premise of two different souls meeting, accepting, and loving one another should be the basis of how we should be to each other.  The movie was breath taking.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great for a summer read. Its definitely not just another love story where to the couple ends up madly in love, they are brought together by fate. The ending has an amazing twist, which was my favorite part. I recommend reading the book before watching the movie, the book is 10x's better!
0451228731|4.0|Fast paced read with a lot of action and a good bit of gore.  The main concept is very interesting.  A dead video game mogul creates a program (daemon) to cause a lot of havoc on it's way to achieving its goal.  Difficult to know who the bad guys or the good guys are but that is part of the story as well.  Difficult to review this one without a spoiler but I recommend it and look forward to reading the second concluding book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 ia a fun game for everyone on our home! The graphics are great and the challenges are addictive.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Glad I purchased this when it first came out, besides I got a great deal one it as well.  However, main reason is Norah Jones' voice, beautiful.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|The music is so moving, the performances were perfect.  This is the dream cast for Les Miserables. The perfect DVD.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this; it was great to see how it all started again. This is a must have if you're a walking dead fan!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|She is such a great writer - took a dark subject and total created believable characters ... Read it hour after hour.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am ready to publish my first book and this book has been a tremendous help!  It's user friendly and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to publish an ebook.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I am currently trying to increase my credit score &amp; this app has been the perfect tool to help me. I am very busy but this app doesn't let me forget. So easy to use, too. I use it more than any other app on my Kindle!
B003G4W49C|5.0|this book is amazing when i read this i was just on the edge of my seat. It was fantastic and the ideas of the future are very realistic but still very cool.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|Another amazing Lego....lots of great details from the movie! My son found it challenging to build but loved it. This is a great toy for 9-12 year olds.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book. Hard to put it down. The racey parts are fun but the love story is very touching. Can't wait to read #3!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I purchased this book because of the reviews up top...\\"couldn't put it down\\", \\"best first kiss\\", \\"Holder...fan me please\\" and all of those reviews are accurate. *BUT* someone, somehwere should have mentioned the intensity of this book. I started this book at 6pm and finished it at 10pm the same night, needless to say I couldn't put it down. I was expecting a romance, and it was, a brilliant one... (again) *BUT* I would have never purchsed this book if I had known where it was going, I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but certain sunjects discussed in this book are NOT entertaining for me. I lean more towards the fantasy. I refuse to spoil it for anyone it's a great read but proceed with caution, I couldn't sleep peacefully afterwards and it's still affecting my mood the next day... If you like intense, real pain with equally intense real pleasure all mixed up in hard truths, please purchase this book, you wont be disappointed, I'm only reviewing this cause I wish someone had given me a heads up. This book was just too intense for me.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I really liked this move.  It should have won the Oscar...but it didn't so this is my attempt at redeeming that injustice.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book is simply amazing in the way it is formed and built.<br />I absolutely love young adult books.  All those negative reviews are not true.  This book is,&#34;dabomb.com!&#34;
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|This movie was good.  Funny parts, awkward parts and crazy parts...but that is to be expected from Seth Macfarlane.  Overall solid
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I love this band,kind of like Janis Joplin meets Ella Fitzgerald, catchy tunes, great strong female vocalist,saw them on SNL Iwas hooked!
B000W29V3I|5.0|This disc is great and true to form it took me back shall I say several years. I am handicapped and need to budget my money but I put several of their other discs in my wish list. Down load them soon.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Good movie to share with my grandson in the man cave, and the women in the family like it as well.
B00AJMTZ50|5.0|once again Clapton proves that he is a master he gets an old recording out of  the closet dusts it off reworks it adds a couple more tracks and it sounds like a million seller. What more can be said about a master other than the ease of which Amazon music Down Load system Works Flawless.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This movie goes into Bond's past and explains much of what opened up his path to Eton and on into MI-6.
0920668372|5.0|I still can't read this book without crying.  I gave it to each one of my 5 children on their 18th birthdays.  Each one of them cried when they read it.  Now as my last child turns 18 I will buy one last copy... Life is as they say \\"Very Short\\"
030726999X|5.0|Can't believe there will be no more stories from Steg. I waited a long time to start the series and finished it in a month, great story, great read.
B001S86J1C|5.0|This is a great movie that takes me back<br />The bluray has nice extras including interviews with all the cast<br />Highly recommend this version
030746363X|2.0|I like his other books but to be honest I didn't like this one. The only thing that seems to be useful is the abs section and that's actually a free article somewhere online.<br /><br />The author did mention that you just need to read the fundamental and pick and choose whatever section after that. In general all the sections seem like a collections of random body hacks that doesn't really relate much to each other. Abs, superhuman, sex, sleep, etc...<br /><br />Shrug.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I Love Pinterest!  it gives me a chance to just zone out sometimes and de-stress.  I also get to do virtual shopping for outfits, jewelry, shoes, gifts, kids and Holiday items. I love finding quotes & Bible verses  that always lift my spirits and make me feel better & funnes that really do make me laugh out loud.  I also have a place where i can express my political views and find others with the same views!  When I need meal or snack ideas I can find one easily just by using &#34;search&#34;.  The best part is that I can easily look at many other pins by others & pin their ideas & suggestions to my &#34;boards&#34; it's very easy to do too!

1616550414|5.0|since i hear about this book coming to English I couldn't wait for having it<br />This books is mainly focus in the latest game of Zelda but covers all characters and villains from older games.<br /><br />Dark Horse did a great job translating and printing all information from Japan version of the book, at the end of the book is the Manga for the Skyward Sword game.<br /><br />Now I'm waiting for my Japan Version of the Book, having both will look nice in my collection.

0765365278|3.0|This book is 1250 pages long.  Is it worth the substantial time investment to read? Although it wasn't terrible, I'd have to say no.<br /><br />If I invest for 1250 pages I expect a great story with a satisfying conclusion.  Neither were fulfilled.<br /><br />As others have mentioned it is too long and too slow.  The first few hundred pages are very confusing because the story skips around between characters in a bizarre world with little in the way of explanation or connection leaving the reader befuddled at times. Things become more clear after a while, like 600-700 pages later.  That's a long time to be semi confused and is frustrating.<br /><br />**semi spoilers**<br /><br />Many of the weird confusing bits of this world are never explained.  Why do the women hide one of their hands at all times, what are all these goofy \\"spren\\", why can't men read, why did the murder in the book's beginning occur, why do chasmfiends produce gems ... ad infinitum.  In a book this long I want some answers but get very few.  It all ends open ended with almost nothing resolved.  In Mistborn each book had a nice satisfying conclusion, don't expect that here.<br /><br />Many of the characters are annoyingly one dimensional either really bad or really good.  No GRRM here. The main protagonist is particularly unrealistic.  He self flagellates himself over every person harmed or killed who is in any way associated with him, which ends up being a long list. He is helpless and despairing most of the book them demonstrates superhuman prowess in battle.  I just didn't believe this character.  Way over the top.<br /><br />To get someone to commit to a 10 book series with each book topping 1000 pages you really have to set the hook deep.  I think I will be able to wiggle free of this one.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I knew everyone was talking about Downton Abbey and I'd seen the first few but having it on my Kindle Fire HD is amazing! I love it and am so glad I can watch it whenever I want.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book is so good! I love historical fiction and time travel. This book is so interesting because the characters have lived though hundreds of years of history. The settings are vivid, the plot is fun. It's a blast!<br />Thanks Deborah! Can't wait for the next one!
B006WXHJNU|5.0|Awesome, loved it, it was great, I hate writing these.  It's just great, why do I need a minimum of a certain amount of words.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|While I liked the movie quite a bit, the ending bothered me so I decided to pick up the book (especially when I saw it was recommended for people who liked The Perks of Being a Wallflower and John Greene books). While the ending of the book is technically the same as the film's ending, its treated very differently and the conclusion is arrived at in a completely different manner. A completely different, wholly more satisfying manner. I really enjoyed Quick's writing voice here and the only real criticism I have of the book is an event in the book's third act that really stretches at the boundaries of plausibility. Overall, though, a fast and enjoyable read and, perhaps more importantly, a very respectful and creative look at mental illness.
B002ZG997M|5.0|Awesome, loved it, it was great, I hate writing these.  It's just great, why do I need a minimum of a certain amount of words.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. It is one of those books that you stay awake at night and think about long after the last page has been read.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This is a very functional simple calculator with a whole lot of functions.<br /><br />I use the programmer keypad the most because it has binary and hexadecimal settings.<br /><br />Calling it an advanced calculator is a little misleading because it does not implement a computer algebra system or any plotting functions.
B001EBWIUO|5.0|Its been long time since I saw this movie.<br />It still stands great and I believe one of Bogey's best.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I Love the series. I am never bored with them and can't wait for the next book to be published!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the.best game ever. You should buy it. You can do anything you want. Let your imagination run wild.
B008220DGE|1.0|Really stupid.  Movie has no plot.  You don't need to buy this movie or if you do make sure you dont pay a lot.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Same as its always been. An older movie that you may enjoy. Good story line and acting. Its an original.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|OMG, this is such a lovely film!  I was so smitten, I sent a copy to my daughter in college who shares some of my tastes in movies.  It took a little time to understand the little girl's accent, but it is such a sweet movie.  Share it with your favorite people!
B001CTGQBK|5.0|This is a classic, movie works just fine. If you enjoy older movies this would be one of them to enjoy. It has worked just fine so far. Good older classic movie.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|Great writing and directing.  Plot was well materialized on the screen.  I would watch again or recommend to our friends.  Great flick to add to the play list :)

B00BESJYAY|4.0|I liked it because it was a story of a kid who satyed positive despite many obstacles. Also, despite being a surfer movie it wasn't filled with a lot of &#34;kawabonga dudes&#34; or &#34;narly&#34; like dialogue. Just a great story.
0811879542|5.0|A very interesting book that has my whole class of 5-year olds engaged and wanting more! It actually caught my attention first while I was browsing around in a bookstore and I was sure that it would excite my children, and it did! Never before have I felt that story can be so engaging and yet so educational in its 2d format (a little of patterning was mentioned, and counting as well). Just wished that the pages itself are hard paper, rather than the normal one as repeated reading is sure to spoil the book in no time.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book opens your eyes to people who face abuse from a family member. Sad, but true that it happens in real life, but a happy ending. Hopefully it will give encouragement to someone in the same situation to get out before it is too late.
0670026603|5.0|I can't stop thinking about this book, on so many levels. Very powerful insights without hitting you over the head with them. Loved the well drawn and understandable characters with all their complexity.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I'm don't really go into the temparatures of the CPU and check to see how cool it keeps it. All I can say is that it works! Has enough paste to use on 3 or 4 CPU's

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie and viewed it as such and not a documentary.  Altho the facts were declassified several years ago, there have always been rumors of help from our good friends, the Canadians.  To be fair, it IS possible that not all of the details were declassified, and hence the fictionalized story or even that the Canadians did not want to be put on the spot for helping us.  As we all know serving in the middle east is a dangerous place to be assigned and perhaps some secrets need to be kept.  The fault that we found was in the language, particularly with Ben Affleck.  He has been in a number of movies, beginning with \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and each movie has contains the F word.  It is hard to believe that Ben Affleck cannot find another word to express himself, other than the F word.  I find this a shame that I would even assume that this is a word in his daily life, exposing his little girls to such language. I would respect him more if that word was deleted.  Have we come so far as to be only be able to express ourselves in foul language? Drawing in an audience should not have to rely on foul language, but a good story as was Argo.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Great perfomances from Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale, and Jessica Biel. Action packed and a little twisted in the plot. Good movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|good game for the Kindle Fire Hd. I am still trying to master the on-screen controls...grandson still destroys me!! fun to play and the price was RIGHT!!!!

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Love this book. Reinforces what I already know by faith. I love that this Dr. who thought he knew all about life and death received a loving lesson from our awesome God that he can share with all of us.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|As a lover of the books, I doubted the TV series could match them. I was wrong. I absolutely love this show. Great acting, great sets, even some good changes from the original novels. Can't wait for third season!
B006M7JCC2|1.0|The author had lymphoma which is a highly treatable cancer.  She received several rounds of chemotherapy, and she then recovered.  She writes well, but she tells you that your attitude has everything to do with the disease.  This could discourage others from receiving the life saving treatment that she had.  If I could give the book less than one star I would do so.  I hope that no one takes this book seriously.
0307352153|4.0|It is good for both introverts and extroverts to read, though extroverts may feel defensive as they read it. I would have given five stars if there had been more discussion about navigating intimate relationships such as parents with their kids or couples and how to handle the conflict that naturally arises.  There is some and I suppose you can infer it from the rest of the book, but I realize that was not this book's primary focus.  Overall it was well written and very informative on the subject.  It left me wanting more, so I will be looking for other books on this aspect of personality.<br /><br />If you think you are an introvert, you will find affirmation and support.  Cain explains that there is scientific evidence for the idea that this is a biological trait.  What our society does with this is the question.  We live in a society that places a higher value on &#34;extroverted&#34; behavior.  How can introverts make themselves heard in that environment?  How can introverts and extroverts be considerate of each others strengths, weaknesses and needs?<br /><br />If you are an extrovert in a relationship with an introvert, it is good to read to understand them better.  You will need to remain objective as you read because it can, at times, feel as though it is &#34;us&#34; vs. &#34;them&#34; and it is possible to get defensive about yourself as an extrovert.  The point is understanding the other personality, not defending your own.  It is very attractive to your partner that you would care enough to understand them better.  Even better if you do it without being asked. :)
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|Having read the books prior to watching the series - I'm disappointed about how off Season Two is compared to the book.  The First Season was spot on with book one!  I was really looking forward to Season Two....but three episodes in, I was confused, and quite honestly, sill haven't finished watching it.  I will get around to finishing it so I can see how Season Three goes - but I'm not in any hurry at this point. As usual - the books are better.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Hip hop has come a long way. I don't know what I love more about this CD; the fact that it isn't record label influenced or the fact that it appeals to multi-generational listeners that want and enjoy quality music. I hope Macklemore and Ryan Lewis don't fold to the industry and the big money. Keep it authentic and history will reward you!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I've really enjoy this album.  My son was stunned I'd even heard of the group let alone owned the album.  Everybody knows &#34;I Will Wait&#34; but my favorite cuts are Babel and Broken Crown.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who loves a great story. You will not be able to stop reading until you have finished the book.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Despite the weird &#34;noise&#34; on the first track the album is enjoyable and different. Brittany Howard's vocals are dynamic and the guitar rifts are outstanding. I'm glad I saw them on SNL otherwise I never would have bought the album.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run is a perfect game for my daughter.  There are new features and even a zipline.  Temple Run 2 is fun and challenging.  But its not to hard
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|At the end of the first book it wad just curiosity that pushed me to the second book, however the ending of the second book required me to read the third. This book tied up the series quiet nicely leaving few openings for a new book but the possibility is still there.  The characters almost tripled in this book making it difficult at times to follow and keep track of every one.  A good read for a long weekend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It has become one of my favorites. The girls i babysit really like it as well.
B004SMLIRA|4.0|Review-<br />  My son loves this book. It is easy to follow and does a great job teaching colors and different animals. This book is well written and executed. The pictures are well defined and easy to look at. Gwyneth Paltrow reads this book and she is really good at it. She is easy to listen to and really brings heart to the story. If your child is learning to read this would make a great beginner book. It is designed with 2-5 year olds in mind. But my 6 year old is learning to read and he loved it. Another great Beginner book from Macmillian.<br /><br />Publisher-Macmillian Audio<br />Reviewer Rating 4 Stars<br />Reviewed by~Lora<br /><br />Thank you to Esther at Macmillion for the donation of this book to the Read for your future book program in exchange for a honest review.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it's a great game. I just love it. It's probably just because I love horses but I do love this game
B000002VE5|5.0|Best album ever! I love Patti Smith so much I even started to buy the casette versions. You will not be disapointed.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is amazing.  I can say I did cry. There  is a twist to the story and it was amazing. I would highly  recommend this Book.
B00BRUYQFC|3.0|I am a HUGE Justin Timberlake fan, and I was sorely disappointed with this album.  The songs are all over the place and don't fit well together.  Plus, too many ballad-y songs for my taste.  I was also disappointed to hear barely any Timbaland influence, unlike Futuresex, which is noticeably heavy with his talent.  One can tell why \\"Suit & Tie\\" and \\"Mirrors\\" are singles....the other songs fail in comparison.  And what does \\"suit and tie s*** tie s*** tie s***\\" mean?    I'm going to see him in Detroit this August.....kind of wish I'd heard this album before buying my ticket....I might not have been so eager to spend $120.  I bought the tickets based on my love for his previous album.  I sure hope the concert isn't a lot of guitar-on-a-chair-in-a-spotlight lovesongs......
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I would choose this book because it is really good and by far my favorite book EVER! And it will keep you interested for quite a while.
0425252868|5.0|I will soon be 70 years old and I have read dozens of WW2 books and I found A Higher Call to be one of the best written most moving stories I have ever read.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  Once I started to read it I did not want to quit until I was done.  It is primarily the story of a German fighter pilot, and how his path crossed that of a B-17 bomber.  That any of these men could survive the war with any trace of decency and sanity is truly a miracle, many were not so lucky.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|A very engaging story that was rich with detail.  The switching back and forth fro present to past kept it very interesting. I will definitely recommend it to friends and reread it.
B0096CDG0O|3.0|I have this on my smart phone and I love it but I downloaded this one to my Kindle fire and it's not as much fun because it makes the game too large, you have to move your hand around too much.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Jonny Lee Miller is amazing as an American Sherlock Holmes.  I love his quirky, off-center, portrayal of this genius detective.  His staccato speech is as endearing as it can be disturbing when Miller's character is struggling with putting his thoughts into language that non-geniuses can understand.  Miller also conveys Holme's inability (or refusal?) to conform with society's niceties if it at all interferes with his work.  Yet, his growing affection for his once sober companion and now apprentice detective, Joan Watson, is evolving.  I do not believe anyone other than Jonny Lee Miller could accomplish the  shy but obviously fiercely proud and, perhaps, confusing emotions that Watson brings out in him.<br /><br />Lucy Liu is a fantastic American Watson. I had my doubts: a woman portraying Watson?  How would these two disparate characters ever meet in a believable scenario?  The writers did a perfect job bringing Watson and Holmes together.  Lucy Liu projects strength and endurance (and one really needs endurance when dealing with Jonny Lee Miller's Holmes) as Holmes' sober companion and yet, as the series evolves, Liu reveals uncertainties, weaknesses and a growing determination to fully enter Holmes' world.  Her timing and delivery as straight man to Miller's Holmes is perfect.  I love the way she mutters little cuts and chidings just loud enough for Holmes to hear but not loud enough to elicit an immediate response.  Not to mention she is gorgeous, fit and appropriately stylish for a surgeon-detective-in-training.<br /><br />The staging is spot on.  Holmes neither requires nor appreciates extravagance which he could easily afford if he wanted it.  The set is minimal.  Table, chairs, a bed, walls, floor.  The kitchen and living room see the most action regardless of the lack of furniture.  Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu's characters fill any room they are in!<br /><br />A wonderful show that I hope will be on for a very long time.<br /><br />Note: the lack of comparison to the British &#34;Sherlock&#34; was entirely intentional.  These are two very, very different shows that, with the exception of the main character, have little in common.rison to the British &#34;Sherlock&#34; was entirely intentional.

140120841X|5.0|this is a great story, the art is a bit old for my taste, but the story its whats importand.  Recomended for any fan of Alan moore, fans of the Movie.
B00B7IJDMA|3.0|The Walking Dead Original Soundtrack Vol. 1. First of all, instead of putting the powerful, mood setting, theme that we fans love to listen to at the beginning of each episode, we get a piece of crap \\"remix\\" that sounds like someone is having a seizure with some fake computer generated whiny sound. I am a purist and I love originals. The original theme for The Walking Dead is absolutely amazing. The strings are so emotion evoking and fit this awesome series perfectly. You can hear some of the original behind the really annoying pinging sound that resonates throughout the entire...whatever this noise is.  The people who put together this collection of Walking Dead music have done the fans a real disservice by not including the original theme on this CD. The rest of this CD is great. There are two songs that are favorites of mine that make this a worthwhile investment. The first is Take Me Home. Awesome song. Jamie N Commons' vocals are hypnotic. The second is Warm Shadow. It is a remix, but it is so simple with an acoustic guitar you get lost in it. Wow, I have to find the original of this one. I would have easily given this 5 stars if the original theme of The Walking Dead was on it. Extremely disappointing. Don't get it if the only song you like is the theme, because it isn't on this CD. If you want some great music, except for track number 2. Get it.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is very fun and exciting<br />You should read this book<br />Our the heroes of Olympus series<br />READ IT!!!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I thought this was going to be a horrible space invaders clone, but it turned out to be really well made and fun. It's got that old school space invaders feel but has modern graphics and gameplay as well as some new elements.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I can't wait until their next album comes out. Reminds me of Janis Joplin. They are a great band with good synergy
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My little nephew asked for this for Christmas.  I receved it without any delays and it is one of his favorite stories.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|love it that it zips to protect my Kindle Fire from dust & crumbs from my purse.  This is my second one, I wore out the zipper on the first one after a year.  I would recommend this
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I liked this CD the first time I listened to it, and every time I listen to it, I like it a little more.<br /><br />Rodriguez reminds me a lot of Bob Dylan, and I guess that's part of why I like it.  It puts me in the mind of the late '60's and '70's, but still seems relevant today.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to any music lover.
B00BJA2VFW|1.0|I could never get it to download.  I did exactly as it asked me and I waited and waited and then it would be finished and I would get an error message saying that there had been an error and please download it again.  This happened over 3 times.  Since it was just a matter of me pushing the install now button it has to be a programming error.  I NEVER received the game, I wrote to Amazon and told them of my problems and now I do not have to worry about it anymore.  So--the one star rating is misleading, because I can't give it a rating at all.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|It's all about fit, finish and bang for the buck!  Thank you Mayor for everything. I often wonder if \\"better\\" is even possible.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|This is a fun little movie.  I enjoyed the story and the message.  My kids really liked it too.  I think it is one of the better recent kids movies to come out.  But over all it is a good story for kids and a fun one for adults too.
B003CH8X02|5.0|I was surprised by this album. While not a total departure from his earlier work, it's got enough prog elements to satisfy the most discriminating listener.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I love this movie.  It was a blast for the kids, but even more fun for the parents.  I loved all the video game references and the story line was lots of fun.  The characters are a blast and I really enjoyed it.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Honestly I forgot that there was a first movie, after watching all the extras on the second two with footage from this movie, I had a lot of questions. This movie did not disappoint, great story telling, and great cinematics
B007REV4YI|5.0|Since I was a teenager I've enjoyed all the Bond films.  I own them all and watch them very regularly.  Of the &#34;new&#34; Bond films Skyfall is definitely the best. A strong argument could be made that this is the greatest Bond film of all time.  I absolutely enjoyed it and I can't wait for more.
B00B23O96A|1.0|clapton lost his recording instincts a long time ago. his choice of producers, songs, and musicians is lifeless and lazy. he stated in rolling stone mag. this year he does not like nor feel comfortable making records. so my advice to him is please stop. his studio album output for the last twenty years and more has been unfortunately awful. someone light a fire under this guy or encourage him to retire.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|First off, I'd like to say that I have been a diehard Bowie fan since about 1988.  I love most of what Bowie does, and I really love him as an artist.<br /><br />It is only my opinion that the 2nd half of the album is better than the 1st half, with the exception of \\"The Next Day\\" and \\"Where are We Now?\\"<br /><br />Tracks that I REALLY liked on this were:<br />#6 \\"Valentine's Day\\"<br />#8 \\"I'd Rather Be High\\"<br />#9 \\"Boss of Me\\"<br />#11 \\"How Does the Grass Grow?\\"<br />#12 \\"You Will Set The World On Fire\\" (Great power ballad!  Sounds A LOT like \\"Bang Bang\\" from his \\"Never Let Me Down\\" album)<br />#13 \\"You Feel So Lonely You Could Die\\"<br /><br />The one song that I absolutely HATE on this album is.. \\"If You Can See Me\\".  It's just really weird to me.. reminds me almost of his \\"Outside\\" album which I really disliked with the exception of only a couple songs (\\"Heart's Filthy Lesson\\" and \\"Outside\\"), too much talking- not enough singing.<br /><br />I still really love Bowie's \\"Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\\" album from 1972, and I also enjoyed \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\".. so I guess I'm a bit partial to his early stuff.<br /><br />But, I would still recommend this album for all diehard Bowie fans like myself.  Overall, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B009RH9HDS|1.0|I bought this case even after I read all of the horrible reviews on it.  It looked like the kind of case I was looking for and I liked the color choices.  However it does not hold up to everyday use.  It's impossible to hold and read, my kindle fire is always popping out of the case even though it is initially securely popped into the hard case and it's cumbersome.  If you want a $30 case that doesn't protect your Kindle then please feel free to buy this product, you won't be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I didn't see it coming. I thought I know but it was a good surprise. I really enjoyed this book.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This book had me in stitches from the first page. As well as its pure entertainment value, it gives valuable insight into the realities of Asperberger's syndrome. It certainly educated me. The author is to be congratulated for his imaginative powers and for maintaining a clever story line and plot to the end. Highly recommended.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|Very enjoyable and well produced collection. Plays like a sampler of Joe's career. As a long time fan, I love all of the references to bits and pieces of things that he's done over the last 40 years. Plus the songs are pretty strong throughout. The Jeff Lynne production is quite apparent, but justlends the album a cohesive and professionalvintage meets modern finish, like a lot of care went into it all. Joe sings and plays as well, if not better, than ever and has not lost a bit of all the idiosyncrasies that make him who he is. His ever present enthusiasm, personality and humor are still very much present. Very inspiring to see a guy that's made it this far, and with many miles on him, still  giving his best. The James Gang with Joe was the first big time pro rock group that I saw live as an early teen. That was my moment when I thought that I would like to do what they did. I never made it as big as Joe, but I've spent a lifetime honoring him and others like him for giving so many of us so much enjoyment. Buy it for a good old time listening experience that's not just stuck in nostalgia. &#34;Play This Record Loud&#34;, like the old the old vinyl records used to implore us, printed right there on the label. Now, those were the days!
0895292211|5.0|This book was mentioned in an article I was reading and it certainly paid off to purchase it. Very informative.
B00AJLHULW|5.0|...and if you're not, just buy it and you'll probably become one. A slight departure overall from the most recent efforts, which were a little heavier and diverse. This one finds a groove and sticks with it for the most part. More of a theme album. Even the guitar tone and playing is meant to be simpler and more consistent throughout, which works just fine in this atmosphere. I've heard that Robben stuck to the same basic setup/settings (mainly a vintage Epi Sheraton set to the neck mini-humbucker only). Nice selection of vintage tunes, mostly just off the beaten blues/rock path, but all contributing a to a warm, inviting &#34;take your shoes off and turn down the lights feeling&#34;. Music for adults and those who are perhaps old at heart in all the right ways. Give it a try, artists like Robben are rare today and need our support.

B00AYATBP6|5.0|There is nothing more that can be said about this CD that hasn't been said by the published reviews and the customer reviews here. This is a beautiful album - the production & engineering is incredible (as to be expected from Alan Parsons), the band is just phenomenal - lead and melodic lines mesh between instruments such that the unison lines sound like a single incredibly multitimbral instrument, the rhythm section tight beyond belief... Steven couldn't ask for a better band to support the material he wrote it seems exclusively to meet their talent and capabilities. The subject matter is really dark - Edgar Allen Poe type material with a common theme of haunting and wasted lives in unfulfilling relationships (at least from my perspective it seems to be that). I'm not terribly fond of the title track nor The Pin Drop... Raven seems to be trying to hit the Wilson target that he has tried to hit on PT albums such as In Absentia - the closing track that is ambient and atmospheric with a repeating vocal motif building to a crescendo. This is the closest I think he's come to hitting a very good representation of it, but it doesn't do anything for me really. The Pin Drop - my primary complaint is it's a bit shrill to me. But for any other artists or band those would be stellar pieces, I just have high expectations for Mr Wilson given some of the absolutely amazing music he's put out over the 20+ years he's been doing this.<br /><br />That said, the remaining tracks are just amazing - bands such as Yes who put out recycled material from past writing sessions (ref: Fly From Here) should look at this CD and use it as a benchmark for what they should be trying and striving to achieve going forward. This is a crowning achievement from one of the busiest people in music these days - someone who is continuing to stretch their compositional and instrumental chops into uncharted territory, and is highly successful at it.<br /><br />As Alan Parsons said in his Innerviews interview with Anil Prasad (and I paraphrase) - It would be a travesty and a tragedy if this CD didnt get the success and sales it deserves. This is a must have album.with Anil Prasad (and I paraphrase) - It would be a travesty and a tragedy if this CD didnt get the success and sales it deserves. This is a must have album.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I was very excited for the new Wes Anderson film to come out and Moonrise Kingdom did not disappoint. This DVD combo pack was a really good deal because I was originally just going to purchase the digital copy because I have no need for a DVD, but the price of the DVD/Bluray/Digital copy was only a few bucks more and I couldn't pass up on the deal. A perfect addition to any Wes Anderson collection.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|The book starts in the past where Catherine is traumitized by her then boyfriend.  It then jumps to the present.  So there are two stories going on.  Back and forth but very well documented.  She's OCD bananas in the present and was pretty loose in the past.  She has moved so as not to be found by her ex-boyfriend who is now out of jail.  So she constantly changes her habits.  She has been betrayed by one of her friends and is found by Lee who then is very bent on revenge and tells her of his past love Naomi and what happened to her.  The ending was great and the suspense of the whole book kept you turning pages.  Looking forward to the next book.
B000ZN802W|3.0|It was just alright.  I would never watch it again.  It dragged on in some places.  It was worth watching, but only once.  It was not really what I had expected.  I thought there would be more adventure.

B007FDE4Y8|3.0|At least 4 stars for small and lightweight consumer size camcorders, but terrible for DSLR. It's just not big enough to balance the weight of the DSLR, even with a lighter wide lens. 5 star build quality, the stabilizer arm just isn't long enough to take away the rock-and-roll, and as that's the point. If you shoot DSLR, step up to a unit that gives better options for counter balancing. As you'll be increasing the overall bulk and weight, seriously consider getting one with a load-bearing vest. Your shoulders and back won't be screaming at the end of the day, and your clients will praise your top-quality work.

I purchased this thinking that it was standard notebook size not small enough to fit inside my pocket. I think it would be great for future reference to post the dimensions of the product along with the product description. There is no design flaw or problem with the actual product. I guess I should have taken some extra time to read the reviews and see that people were saying it was small design.

I love this whole book but honestly the only thing I did not like much but yet in way I liked it because it took me by surprise was, the thing that happened to Augustus. The author has all his readers believing one thing will happen, yet the very opposite occurred, that's the part I very much liked. I would recommend that teenage kids that tend to take their precious life for granted, or those who have cancer that choose not to do anything in life, just because they have cancer. The reason why is because this book provides more than enough things, statements, reasons, or examples on going out to do something and just have an adventure and fun. If that makes since. Anyways really good I recommend this for anyone especially for those I stated earlier. I am looking forward to reading a few more books by John Green.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|This is a mediocre movie.  There is so much from the old movie but not in a good way.  Similar characters.  Same music.  Some types of battles with foes.  Same types of scenery. Same if not similar lines.  Lots of running.  Things so similar that it was just really boring.<br /><br />Even stranger, the dwarves are ridiculous looking, caricatures of Disney characters.  Heck!  One even looks like a Klingon.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very well made easy to play great controls<br />That's all i have to say but i need a twenty wood minimum
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a standard game. It was once one of the best games but it still remains a great game. a little physics involved whether you know it or not.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|This movie wasn't at all what I was expecting. I found it very depressing and sad. I was very disappointed.
B009IH0ICG|4.0|Could be larger but works well for smaller items that you plan on  grilling. would recommend. heats up quickly and handle stays cool.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I just loved the interaction between the father and daughter and how it grew. I also loved the way the movie ended.
1616550414|5.0|This book is awesome! Great for getting your history of Hyrule straight. My only complaint would be that I think they dedicate too much of the book to Skyward Sword
1932735410|4.0|Very comprehensive and well organized. Much more in tune to the flow of the testing structure. The diagrams and images are much more clear. The tips and questions at the end of each chapter are &#34;Gold&#34;.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I read them all & was upset to not finding the end. when will the last one come out?  Hurry up!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its crazy but I do love this game.  There are a few minute glitches, I don't like that it will not accumulate point even under the random game mode, nor under the other option.  I would like to see that, otherwise I still play it all the time just like I did with a real deck of cards!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Always suspense about next movement and never a dull moment between love, darkness and drama with tension of  lust and wanted desire of new world for innocence to be taught levels on  only could imagine in an acceptable society!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Wow, if you like to move fast this is the game for you!  I started with 2 cards.  Then moved to 3! Be prepared!
B001TM14VC|5.0|For all of you Top Gun lovers, do not miss this one. Wonderful to see it in HD. Enjoy the show!
B004T32SOK|5.0|Works perfectly. I am able to load documents and pdf files for my Kindle fire. If you're looking for cloud service for your Kindle Fire then this is the must have app for all your needs.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I didn't think it could get any better than Bared to You, but I was so wrong. Not as graphic and a deeper storyline...I can't wait until the next book comes out!
B004UID2LC|1.0|Was a waste of time adding it to my kindles.  When I get time I will be deleting this application.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Lots of fun. It's like all your favorite old school 8 bit games rolled into one: Galaga, Space Invaders, Asteroids, etc.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is very good for the price and it has amazing graphics. I would recommend to anyone who likes good games. AMAZING!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Finally, another app that just completely nails the controls and marries it with fun game play. I don't do &quot;virtual&quot; d-pads and buttons, which is why I believe systems like the Nintendo 3DS will always be around. But games like this, with simple, one-finger controls truly take advantage of a touch screen platform.<br /><br />Excellent game - thanks Noctua!
B008ODZNLG|5.0|I don't like sushi at all, but I thought this was a great movie about a group and one guy in particular who wants to create the highest quality product possible....
B0045XICB2|4.0|Ok. This must be a pretty good book, because as the story continues the drama gets a little better. I guess I will need to watch the rest of the saga to see how it ends.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|When you just need simple calculations this calulator is great.  Buttons are large and I like that it keeps a history of your work.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a awesome game and if you buy it you can update minecraft andi always asked my friends to play with me and there is skelektons and zombies and creepers.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|They seem to be mired in inter-personal conflict at this point. It's all rather silly really, both men leading the conflicting groups are basically bonkers by this point.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was better than the first I thought. I was glad it gave answers to questions I have had from the first book. I can't wait for book the!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|excellant read.  fast paced all facts tie in together and create a cohesion of plot character development in the end.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|the game to me is really cool and very fun to play. the best part is in the tunnel. 5 stars!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I've been a Jodi Picoult fan for many years, and can't get enough of her books. The Pact is among her best. She puts the reader inside the heads of her characters, and compels us to keep on reading from page one through the epilogue. I hate to reach the end as it's like saying goodbye to dear friends. I'm now anxious to start the next Picoult novel .. keep them coming!
B000HF6XPY|5.0|Loved this movie when i was growing up and i just had to own it and amazon had it for a great deal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is the best. Very addicting though. Its fun, exciting and filled with adventures. nothing could be better. I play this non stop.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was looking for anreplacement RSS reader after the Google Reader announcement.  I wanted something that worked acrossboth my Kindle.and my desktop.<br /><br />Feedly is just the thing I need.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Very intriguing story line, kept me in suspense for the entire movie.  Also, the language was clean, nothing dirty about it.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Crazy Formula is a good game that will keep you occupied for quite a while. The puzzles are difficult but not impossibly so. It wasn't overly complicated. And didn't have outrages permissions.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, which wasn't brilliant by any means but was entertaining nonetheless.  It had a 70s film feel to it, with some good acting by Brian Cranston and Tate Donovan.  But Ben Affleck is a scene-ruiner throughout.  Again and again, he's like a piece of wood thrown into an otherwise convincing scene.  I never realized how truly terrible he is until this film.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Cannot stop listening to this album!  Anyone can relate to the lyrics and jam out to the beats..not to mention Macklemore is super cute.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It was free, which is a plus. It just takes forever to get anywhere in the game and you are constantly stuck waiting to recharge your energy so you can keep playing
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|\\"But bin Laden is there. And you're going to kill him for me.\\" says Maya.  This is a long movie at about 3 hours and most of it is about the CIA tracking of Osama bin Laden in the 10 years between 9-11 and the date he was killed in Pakistan.  The entire movie is actually well made and provides suspense and surprises despite the well known episodes involved.  My only wish was the movie director had included more graphic views of UBL during the raid before and after he was KIA.  very few factual errors in the movie, but overall the movie stays with the truth story, and maintains a trust with the viewer.  The reconstruction of the UBL compound looks spot on, the gear the actors who portray Navy SEALs all is as close as you can get to real SEAL loadouts.  Well done, I saw this at the movie when it first came out and got the DVD as soon as it came out and intend to watch it over and over.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great show. One of the most original T.V series I've seen. Bought it so I could watch it over and over to see if I missed anything LOL.
1781161313|3.0|I very much appreciated the depth of the written presentation. My biggest complaint is the many juvenile photos and artwork (sketches really).
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Great movie my Wife and i loved it. If you  are into shows like glee. Then you will love this movie.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I only purchase Sony PS3 accessories for my PS3. I rarely use third-party devices. This is especially true of the PS3 controller. I am a big fan of the design and it just works best for me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I literally missed the characters in this book when I finished it. I loved it! This book is the perfect example of different perspectives. The story mood of the changes depending on who the story is following. As a writing teacher, I really enjoyed that. This is one of my favorite books ever.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|Love this book both times I read this. I can not wait to finally read forever. Such a great read great story
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I never watched the Big Bang tv show until season 5.  I was hooked.  I have bought all seasons episodes and have watched many times.
0307277887|5.0|First book of the &#34;Dexter&#34; series I read..as an author, Mr. Lindsay is in a class by himself..beautifully written, a page-turner, if you like the series on Showtime, the books make the series look like network sitcoms.
B0063GORYU|5.0|May sister is hooked on this came (plays all 4 suits)  I only do 2 suit game.  Much more fun than regular solitaire.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Good beats, great vocals, and I like the lyrics. I would definitely recommend it to you if you enjoy the samples.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|All other seasons would have received 5 stars, however I found episode 10 with the spanking of Amy less than funny.  Also, with all the gun violence I saw no humor having Sheldon being shot by Santa with a cannon (even though it was a dream)
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Same as the first book -- Entertaining world and storyline, but I have major issues with all of the authors who continually write stories about wimpy teen girls. This main character is so weak in character and ideals. This is not the kind of fictional character with whom I can relate, nor do I want teen girls to have another weak and dependent example of teenage romance. Romance is possible, but the girl needs to have her own identity and strength!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My only problem with this game is that I have beat all the levels and puzzles.  Wish I could go further, but no point.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it I spend most of my free time on my kindel playing it it's so addicting I it's like temple run except a lot more fun all of my family loves it it toetally deserves 5 stars it's very cool
1451624468|4.0|Unfortunately, it was over my head.  It enlarged my imagination even though I wish I understood science better.  For instance, throughout the book the author referred to a flat universe.  I never quite understood the concept.  I wish he would have put it in simpler terms.  I felt like it was a brilliant book for scientists to read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved the entire concept of time travel and a thorough history lesson.  I would love to see this in a movie!
1451683405|3.0|I think the message is that how one conducts his life is not just some random thing.  It's a product of everything that has come together to make up that person.  Perhaps it's a new slant on that idea, but it seemed to me I already knew that.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Love this movie; won 2 Academy awards (best supporting actor; best original screenplay) Have all QT's movies but this one till it's in stores 4/16/13
