B00A757EFW|2.0|The Android PAC-MAN is the same idea as the original one but is much harder to play with a touch screen.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Hard to put this one down.  I never read Stephen King, but this book isn't the typical horror story I expected.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I really liked that I could sync between my phone, my tablet and my computer.  This worked for both books I purchased and those I loaded from my pc.  However starting with version 4.1 I not only lost the sync ability (it is now greyed out) but version 4.1.1 dies when I start it.  I have gone back to 4.0.2 for now and I do not allow any updated for kindle.  There are other features that I like, ie changing font size, being able to change screen brightness, using volume control on my phone and tablet to page forward or back.<br />I am hoping that Amazon will fix the problems soon.  If they do, I would rate the Kindle for Android with five stars.
B00DHNJCKQ|2.0|While the acting is fairly good, this film has a silly plot, is predictable, and there is no chemistry between the two leads.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I am still struggling through this book. Keep waiting for the plot to develop. It is disappointing as I loved this authors last two books. I will finish it and hopefully there will be some awesome turn around but not much time left for that to happen. Would not recommend it.

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|AIC carries on , great disc , gets better with every listen. Thanks to Jerry C. and the guys, keep it coming. Saw the band in concert in Birmingham at the BJCC concert hall, show was fabulous, hope they come back again. Next time I hope they play some more tunes from The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very impressive for a horse game you can download on kindle ipad or phone.  I definately don't mind playing it
B007MAETA8|5.0|as John goes thru some of his changes, and further matures in his music,...he continues to bring songs forward that show his craftsmanship in songwriting,... and his musicianship goes without saying -saw him in concert in Tuscaloosa before I bought the disc, and he played many of the songs from Born and Raised...wish I was more familiar with these new tunes before the concert, but sure glad I have the disc now. Thanks John.

B000HKW7E0|5.0|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has become a perennial Christmas classic for its timeless portrayal of a family, brought together to fulfill the oft stated holiday ideal of spending time with family, The movie gains its appeal by so accurately exaggerating (ever so slightly) the dysfunction that comes in assembling so many diverse or even eccentric personalities together over the holiday backdrop in a way that every family can relate to.  Truly, every family has a Cousin Eddie, in-laws who are always critical, parents or grandparents who are supportive yet always did something more or better when they were young.  In essence, the appeal of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is less as a holiday film than it is a comedically brilliant, albeit an accurate portrayal of how families coexist with one another, all in the name of the &#34;family&#34; bond.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is a great way for teens and young people test out your brain straigth and a lot more

B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game looks fun and the description sounds great , but when you open it up you realise you can only give hair cuts to two peeps . The other  one's your have to pay extra money for AND, you have to buy extra accessories ... This game is NOT WORTH IT !!! Get toca boca hair salon instead... hoped this helped
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun. You can play so many games and you earn them. which I think is half the fun of the game

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Good reading.  Each and every one have been good to watch or to read.  The Isaiah 9:10 gives you much food for thought.  The book &#34;Does God Play Favorites&#34;  gives good insight into the Jewish faith and is substantiated with reliable sources.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I play Minion Rush on my Kindle Fire. I love that it's a free game and it's similar to the popular Subway Surfers app. It's very cute, especially if you enjoyed the movies, and, of course, it can be extremely addicting!!! My only complaint is that when you first download the game, it runs very slowly. Occasionally when loading, it will freeze and the only way out of the app is to shut down the Kindle Fire completely. That is a tad irritating, so hopefully that can be fixed. Overall, the graphics are great and the game is fun for kids and adults alike! :)
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|The game is fun & worth the $2 even if it wasn't the FAotD. Game play is nice, controls are intuitive.  There is a bit of a learning curve, better documentation would help.  Thanks!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game.I like all the new levels that I unlock.and the d different hiding spots that there is.
0307720748|5.0|I had one of Richard Branson's book sitting on my shelf for 2.5 years until I finally picked it up and started reading. I could not put the book down. Once I was done I ordered this one and the same thing happened. I could not stop reading.<br /><br />Now I usually read only business books of some sort, I am clearly part of his target audience, but I even my wife now shows interest in reading this book.<br /><br />What I like about the book? Richard Branson's style of writing makes it easy to read this book. He is very honest and upfront with quite a few things. I find this book to be extraordinary. The way how he built the Virgin empire is impressive. This is not some CEO who got rich on cashing stock options. RB is a hard worker who likes to have fun and along the way he built a 'few' businesses (a few hundred that is). This autobiography is almost more like a novel, but then it is not. It is motivating and inspiring. It provides lots of business related tips and tricks, and then not. It is refreshing to read for sure.<br /><br />What I do not like about this book? Why did it take me so freaking long to pick up his books and start reading them. There should be an advisory of some sort on the book: Read immediately after purchasing or life will end as we know it. I do not have to say anything negative about as I really like it.<br /><br />In one of his other books Richard Branson says he expects to work another 30 years or so. I hope he does and that he continues to share his stories and adventures with us. He is a truly gifted man, not afraid of a good challenge, and he does business in an ethical way - something so many other businesses have forgotten. If I could meet with one great person of our time - Richard Branson would definitely be on my lists.

B0055B7IPE|5.0|Up is a great movie for all audiences.  I love the focus both on adventure and relationships. A must see!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The film prompted me to finally read the book. It took months to get there, but it was worth it.  The biggest negative was pervasive references to Greek, Roman and French historical or literary names unknown to me, many of which are also unrecognized by th built-in dictionary.  The dictionary was,however, a big help.  The old-fashioned language really stretched the vocabulary.
0439023491|5.0|This is my favorite series. I am an avid young adult reader, and this is by far the one I recommend to everyone. My whole family read it and became addicted. We re-read multiple times as well. Can't find a better book or series!!!

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I played this online ALL. THE. TIME. I wish it was free (or at least for the day) because there's no need to spend money on it when you can go online and play it, unless it's on a mobile device like me. sites don't work the same as on a computer. great game though!
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|Works great. No need for a graphics card on diablo3 or WOW...playing both games cpu only gets to about 22% or less and is throttling back to 800-1ghz. Its spot on saves power. Better graphics!

0316017930|3.0|While Gladwell brings up interesting theories about our inheritances, he does not actually prove anything and thus the book is more entertaining than scientific.
B00821PCJS|3.0|It's ok but rather hokey at times. Especially with the kiddoes that have the critter stuck through their spines. That's pretty gross.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Eric and his friends are simply brillant.  Music that touches the soul.  You can't ask more for anthing from them.  If you are a lover of the guitar, you will enjoy this one.
B001RHOJSE|5.0|Well narrated and rich in pertinent details of an era that even science fiction will have hard time emulating it. Human nature is such that crimes against humanity continue to take place but we seem not to be touched by it and people by the thousands die because of poverty and hunger, specially children. Read carefully the epilogue, it helps to understand the complexity of the legal system vis a vis the moral issues involved. Great book.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan has produced a highly readable text that reflects an exhaustive study of the Bible and many other sources. I feel that Aslan casts a bright light on the early Christian Church. The first chapters focus on the period before Paul's version of Christianity would be the dominant one within the Church. Before Paul, Jesus Christ, Aslan asserts, was viewed by his followers as a Jewish zealot who claimed he was the messiah, come to create a Kingdom on Earth. This pre-Paul Jesus was a mortal man on a mission to drive the Roman occupation force out of Palestine and to overthrow corrupt, venal Jewish priests who twisted God's laws. In the decades before Christ and for decades after He lived, there were many Jews who claimed to be the eagerly anticipated messiah. Aslan notes that several of these self-proclaimed messiahs were executed.<br /><br />Some of the topics carefully and lucidly examined by Aslan are: The turbulent Palestine that preceded Christ; John the Baptist and his impact on Jesus; the role of Pontius Pilate; the importance of Jesus's brother James; and Jesus's assertion in Luke (24:44-46) that earlier scripture had predicted that the \\"messiah would suffer and rise again on the third day.\\" Aslan points out that there is no other such statement in the scripture. Aslan also masterfully tells of Stephen's martyrdom and its impact on Christianity. And there's Titus's vicious destruction of the Temple in 70 C.E. and its impact on early Christianity.<br /><br />Aslan devotes many pages to Paul. Paul played a pivotal role in the emergence of a Christianity in which Jesus is literally the son of God. The Kingdom of God is a heavenly kingdom. Faith in Christ is required to gain entrance into the Kingdom of God, not a strict adherence to Jewish laws. Of course, this general theme is very well known to Christians, but Aslan explains how it developed.<br /><br />I am not a theologian, but I have had this experience: I picked up scholarly works about a topic similarto those explored in Aslan's work and quickly put them down because they were so boring. This book kept me engaged and made me want to learn more.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000JQV68A|5.0|GREAT STORY put together in terrific prose.  This is a shining example of how stories should be told.  At first you are happy along with the young couple enjoying life so much but then they get all the way down and out, so sad.  No way could you put this book down without finishing it.  I gave it five stars but were there 20 stars, I would have given it at least 20!!<br />Read and enjoy,<br />Alton Gloer N w Georgia USA
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|A charming look at life at a retired musicians and singers retirement home. The acing is superb and Dustin Hoffman's direction brilliant. I enjoyed every minute of this. If you like English movies, you will most certainly enjoy this one. Billy Connelly. Dame Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins and the always great Tom  Courtney each turn in a spectacular performance. Very well done. Will watch it again.

0756655307|5.0|This is a great book for any lover of marvel comics. It has pictures and short summaries of each character (though I did notice that a few of the lesser known ones are missing, which is what I'd primarily use this encyclopedia for).

B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Thanks G5 for making another great game. I think 4.99 is a good price for these games but wish they would give you a buy 1 get1 option.Keep up the great designing !  Love the little bonus extra play!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|That this show lasted only one season is a real shame. The cast of character is diverse and well written. Here you will find Sci-fi, comedy and drama. Although it has a space cowboy feel to it it doesn't come off as contrived just as the way things are due to the political environment that has left many poor and planets somewhat off the beaten path. This is a gem from an earlier day of The Avengers director Joss Whedon.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I absolutely loved this show when it was on the air and being able to watch it again from the beginning is great!! If you've never seen then watch!!

B00C2IJJE6|5.0|The book packaged bluray edition is slightly nicer but other than that you can't go wrong with this one. The movie is as you must know, amazing. The bd transfer is great and the 7.1 audio (I only have a 5.1 system but it was nicely done and I'm sure the 7.1 could only be better).
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|the game is very good. its bloody it has more than one shark.I give this five stars.-kakashiabidiah productions. its. awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwsommmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeēeeeeee
B00CW665VI|1.0|I purchased this book based on the 5 star rating it had and amazon best of 2013 so far labeled that it had. Having looked at the reviews I was really looking forward to reading it.<br />Personally I found the writting style to be very annoying. There is nothing about Drew that makes him a likeable character. The author seems to have placed a man with the virtues of a high school jock in an adult situation and called it a romance. The characters are very basic. I had no idea what other reviewers found amusing in this book. I found it boring and I will be honest I couldn't be bothered to finish it. The only saving grace for this book is that the editing is much better than most kindle books these days! I would not purchase from this author again.

B004K58GSO|5.0|What a gem of a western. Part of Howard Hawk's trilogy (Rio Bravo, Rio Lobo) that came in response to &#34;High Noon&#34;, this is 2nd behind Rio Bravo but still studded with excellence. From the beginning title score composed by Nelson Riddle and sung by George Alexander, with artwork by the western genre master Olaf Wieghorst (who has a cameo in the picture) in the background is perhaps the best western commencement in film history. The plot follows a sheriff (Robert Mitchum), a gunslinger (John Wayne), and a young stud (James Caan) going against the troops of a corrupt cattle baron (Ed Asner), they confront the lopsided odds against them with grit and efficiency. Quite a contrast to the wimpy character played by Gary Cooper in High Noon. Great message, great Americana, great movie.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|This show keeps getting better and better!<br />I can't believe they can still find new plot lines. Just when you think you have seen it all, this show delivers more.<br />And yes, for the most part, each episode is summed up nicely.  :) Which is my favorite part.

B000PC0S5K|5.0|A New Earth is certainly a book that will live on. While Tolle's claim that the whole world is transforming in consciousness is not backed up by any evidence, his explanation of the ego and pain body are brilliant observations of the dynamics of human behavior. It may sound like new-age mumbo-jumbo that is easily derided and puts so may people off, but give this book a chance. A New Earth fills in the gap that neither our culture nor our religions explains--what our feeling really mean and where they are coming from.

0062127241|3.0|I had hoped that Townshend's memoir would give us some insight into one rock music's most creative and original talents. Sad to say it doesn't. It's not for a lack of content; Townshend does provide a \\"Warts and All\\" portrait of himself. He doesn't shy a way from his bouts with drug and alcohol abuse, his egotism, and his crippling self-loathing. There are names dropped everywhere and you do get an insight into the business practices that royally screwed over artists when they were trying to break into music. But if you are looking for an understanding of The Who's music and how the band's evolution occurred, you'll need to look elsewhere. Townshend's focus here is on Townshend and it is literate, interesting, but rarely insightful.
0307474259|5.0|I used to be very smug about how healthy I thought my low-fat eating habits were. Then I got a physical and discovered my lipid counts were horrendous. My first assumption was that it must be hereditary, since my eating habits were so good. The doctor told me to cut down on foods I hardly eat in the first place (eggs and red meat), so I felt like I needed a different answer. I browsed books on Diet and Nutrition that were well-reviewed when I found these books by Taubes. From the reader feedback, it sounded like \\"Atkins\\" to me, and since I always thought he was an irresponsible quack, I was highly skeptical. But I couldn't ignore all of the positive feedback, so I started reading.<br /><br />It wasn't long before I felt completely duped by everything I thought I knew. Taubes lays out his heresies in such a well-documented, logical manner, I found it impossible not to be convinced. I was converted from a fat-counter to a carb-counter. I started eating more eggs and meat, not less, and did my best to cut out as many refined carbs as I could, giving up bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, and switching to low sugar versions of foods I couldn't give up (eg oatmeal).<br /><br />After just 4 weeks, my lipid counts showed amazing improvement. My cholesterol was down 40 points, my triglycerides were cut by more than half, and my HDL actually went up.<br /><br />I won't go so far as to take everything in this book as gospel; eg I can't justify any recommendation of processed meats, but in terms of the overall theory espoused in this book, I'm a complete believer, and I've got the numbers to prove it.
B0068AWQQ2|5.0|Just what you'd expect from the movie trailer and poster. Mostly respects the original version's storyline about a vampire who moves in next door but nobody believes the teenage hero even as neighbors go missing. Fun effects.
0307352145|5.0|The premise of \\"Quiet\\" is that introverts are undervalued and overlooked in our culture, despite great contributions from that population.  Cain does a masterful job of integrating academic research (and some fascinating studies), anecdotes, and advice from psychologists.  She explores how introverts and extroverts view the world, how our culture values different aspects of their personalities, and how both personality types can modify their styles to be more effective.<br /><br />The book is set up under the following parts:<br />1.  The Extrovert Ideal<br />  - The Rise of the \\"Mighty Likeable Fellow\\"<br />  - The Myth of Charismatic Leadership<br />  - When Collaboration Kills Creativity<br />2. Your Biology, Your Self?<br />  - Is Temperament Destiny?<br />  - Beyond Temperament:  The Role of Free Will<br />  - \\"Franklin was a Politician, but Eleanor Spoke out of Conscience\\":  Why Cool is Overrate<br />  - Why Did Wall Street Crash and Warren Buffett Prosper?:  How Introverts and Extroverts Think Differently<br />3. Do All Cultures Have An Extrovert Ideal?<br />  - Soft Power:  Asian-Americans and the Extrovert Ideal<br />4. How to Love, How to Work<br />  - When Should You Act More Extroverted Than You Really Are?<br />  - The Communication Gap<br />  - On Cobblers and Generals:  How to Cultivate Quiet Kids in a World that Can't Hear Them<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book to introverts, to extroverts who interact with introverts (all of us!), to business leaders looking to better understand how to motivate and engage a diverse population, and to parents.  Kudos to Cain for the research and thought put into this book!
B00992CF6W|2.0|Well compared to the computer and Xbox versions this feels watered down EX. less idems, bad controls,slow gameplay,and worst of all how small the landscapes are.Next there is a huge problem that needs to be fixed  how slow the sword is .overall it's a watered down game compared to other variations.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I find it difficult to write about this book; there simply aren't the right words.  I seldom cry when reading a book but with this one the tears came streaming down; I couldn't help it.  I loved the relationship between Liesel and her foster parents.  I could go on and on about this book but I don't do long reviews.  Just read this book; you won't be sorry.

B000HZHBIM|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie as I had just completed watching the series when I chose to watch it. In my opinion 2, 3, 5, and 6 were all better films. 4 was even rather enjoyable though not exactly exciting. I suppose the sole issue I find with this film is the slow pacing and lackluster climax it exhibits. I know that the film is old enough no one would care if I spoiled it but I won't, overall it was just really okay. I liked it but I didn't love it. Now, the Wrath Of Khan and Search For Spock were both excellent.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|Worked on my XT but not on my new Windows 8 notebook. I downloaded the new Windows 8 driver but still no go.  I think the guts need to be upgraded or something before it will work and sadly, Amazon does NOT say what versions of Windows this is for (or other systems). BOOOOO....

B000OCXIDK|5.0|I bought this because it was on the list for my book club, and I really enjoyed reading it.  It is not something I would have normally picked to read myself, which is a shame because I would have missed out on a great book.  Very engaging, wonderful story, and I didn't know what was going to happen until the very end.  Very vivid descriptions too.  I finished it three months ago and can still picture everything in my mind.

B005I6EU48|5.0|I had my Kindle on my nightstand, in this cover, and a friend saw it and was so curious to see this old book not knowing it was a Kindle.  Needless to say, he was impressed and thought it was super cool.<br /><br />The look and feel of this cover is exactly what I was looking for.  My Kindle is held securely, and it's easy to hold and read.  I'm pretty sure this cover will never come off.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I wanted to say I love this movie, and why are there so many average and negative reviews! First off, we shouldn't be comparing it in any way to the original made 30 years ago, because this movie was a new, slightly different version of the original made by the director of the original. So why are so many people expecting the movie to be like the original. The reviews saying that they wanted to see a Bruce Campbell cameo in the film?!? Lets get real people this film didn't need Bruce Campbell to be good and wouldn't have fit in this version regardless! This film was done very well for a remake when most nowadays don't even compare. The plot was solid as well as the acting. The scare and gore factor were top notch for any horror fan. I can't wait for Evil Dead 2, because this film was amazing on all levels! I have to say if you want it to be exactly like the original with the campiness and chessy acting, don't even bother viewing and writing a negative review. If you are open to seeing a newer version of this film with more horror, gore and no humor then give this film a try, you won't be disappointed!

B009CG1YZ8|4.0|The movie is great, a  cult classic. The inability of amazon to stream it was annoying. It was restarted about 6 times during the show
B00C7L8DM2|3.0|I'm a fan of Aaron Eckhart. I think he's got more leading man status than it seems like most movie producers are willing to give him credit for, because if he's not playing second fiddle in big-budget fare, then he's playing front-runner on derivative B-grade shlock like this.<br /><br />Shlock is harsh, I'll admit. The film isn't bad, per se. It's just doesn't try to transcend beyond any of the usual spy/thriller cliches that dominate the genre. Eckhart plays Logan, an ex-CIA operative who works for a security company by searching for flaws in their various safety/lock-em-up devices. One day, after a rough night with his daughter, Amy, Logan returns to his company to find that not only is it gone, but so is every single piece of evidence proving that he's worked for them. Wha happa?!<br /><br />Turns out the company wasn't what it seemed to be, and so begins the movie's long spiral into predictability. What could've been a taut action-paced thriller is crippled by a needlessly convoluted plot. Those extraneous twists and turns are there, I suspect, to detract from the fact that the screenwriter couldn't really come up with any inventive or clever ways for Logan to show off his CIA skills, and so we are left with happenstance, silly levels of brutality, and tedium to make up for the gap.<br /><br />To distract from this there is also a paper-thin romantic subplot (involving a female CIA agent who may as well have been a mannequin for as detailed as her character was). Plus there is the traditionally annoying teenage-daughter-doesn't-get-along-with-Daddy subplot. Please, for the love of God, can Hollywood get some screenwriters who know how to create teenage characters? They don't all have to be entitled, self-important, irrational whiners, do they? Of course, Logan having to lug Amy everywhere complicates things, but not in a way that's tense or intriguing. Instead, Amy shows preternatural skill at detection and evading when it furthers the plot, and she shows an agonizing level of idiocy and pubescence when the story is in danger of going too fast. (What's this? Logan and Amy have successfully evaded death and capture for twenty minutes? Well, then it's about time for Amy, for no reason whatsoever, to have a tantrum about how her uber-skilled father is a bad person so that she can storm away to be on her own and get caught.)<br /><br />Throw in a handful of characters that have as much depth and complexity as a Barbie doll, add some grade-school level espionage tricks (the kind Encyclopedia Brown might employ), and an ending that may as well have been scored by a punctured balloon sputtering around a room, and you have a film that -- even if it couldn't have been amazing -- could've still risen above its final, mediocre offering. Worth it for the first half, but keep the Hoover ready because, by the final credits, you're guaranteed to have thrown more than one handful of popcorn at the screen.onizing level of idiocy and pubescence when the story is in danger of going too fast.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book deals with death, but it's more than that. It takes you through both struggle and strength simultaneously. My favorite part is how the narrator will divulge the end of a section first and then describe all the events leading up to it. Perfectly written!
B000YRY8BG|5.0|This political thriller is brilliantly plotted, deftly written, and perfectly cast. An attractive young political intern is hit by an Underground train and a petty thief is shot, execution-style, after placing a call to her cell phone. A political and police investigation begin, and there is slowly emerging evidence of a massive cover-up at very high levels. David Morissey stands out by far as conflicted politician Stephen Collins, whose dedication to his cause is undercut by his sliding personal ethics. John Simm has a nuanced performance as the investigative reporter Cal McCaffrey, who is Collins's best friend, former campaign manager, and--well, it's complicated. No spoilers here. The effervescent Kelly Macdonald, in a thankless role as grim, critical reporter sidekick/buddy Della Smith, nonetheless shines with the little material she's given. James MacAvoy, suitably winsome and with a boyish grin, charms as Dan Foster, the maverick freelance reporter with questionable methods, and BIll Nighy as the editor-in-chief of McCaffrey and Smith's newspaper is wickedly delightful, as only Bill Nighy can be. Marc Warren is perfectly slimy as a low-life manipulator; Polly Walker doesn't get to do much other than weep and look tormented as Stephen's wronged wife Anne; and Philip Glenister, as DCI William Bell, in charge of the criminal part of the investigation, shows flashes of the brilliance he brought to his role as DCI Gene Hunt in &#34;Life on Mars.&#34; It's hard not to sit and watch all six episodes in one go.

0061733199|5.0|Short of crash landing on a remote desert island or being in a zombie apocalypse, it's hard to imagine what need a normal person would have for this book, but it makes for great reading. I bought it in order to run a kids' day camp based on &#34;The Hunger Games,&#34; and it was full of helpful information on knots, first aid, building fires, making shelter, and foraging for edible plants. The author clearly knows his stuff, the directions were easy to follow, and the writing style was clear and informative without being dry. I used it as a supplement to my dad's Boy Scout Manual from the '40s.

0984183523|5.0|I used victor Cheng's website as an introductory to case interviews. I felt the book is more into reasoning why the structure is impotant, more examples of the structure, and reinforce the structure into your mind so you can make those winning points into your habits. the video is more focused on the practical skills a candidate should have and less focused on the structures. As I went through the book, I realized building the structure and the reason why such a structure is the most important skill a consultant should have.a good example is the MECE discussed well in the book but not in the videos.<br /><br />I would say this book is a must-have. and you should use that to reinforce your reasoning of building a structure for your case interview preparations.

B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Ever since dropping on the hip-hop scene back in 2004, kanye west has dropped at least 1 good album the \\"college dropout\\" and since then hasn't dropped anything solid since then. Yeezus is the \\"sixth\\" latest album to be released by kanye and this album has 10 tracks of which none of the tracks are good. Kanye on this album shows no focus at all and his lyrics are basic as it gets, this album is so bad it reminds me of jay's new s****y album \\"magna carta\\" where there is no passion, skill, or thought put behind it's product and rather comes off rushed to the point that it's quite difficult to discipher which song is which.<br />Overall this album has no identity or direction and personally i wouldn't recommend.<br />To be honest it's somewhat to be expected coming from a rapper like kanye he's never really had much vocal game to begin with: no delivery, passion, word play, skill, intensity, creativity e.t.c. so i don't think people really should be mad at kanye much.

B000RW3YYA|5.0|Packaging was brand new--(but see UPDATE Below)sealed in cellophane, and played well(*except see below-Update). These are regular DVD's - not Blue Ray (fortunately as I don't have a Blue-Ray player). I watch these on my large laptop computer and there's no blurry picture or mislabelling. Subtitles appear on all discs in English. I wish there was an option to turn those off though, sometimes they are distracting. Other than that - GREAT TV SERIES - and I really believe that studios in this country need a heads Up on what they should be thinking about - a show that has run for 14 years including spin off's is a great show- not one you should cancel - just bring in some new writers if your old ones can't cut it on new ideas.<br /><br />UPDATE: July 20, 2013-- I should have played all the disks before making the above comment. I purchased Season 3 and Season 4 at a reduced price/markdown from $21.99 to $9.99 each-- thinking it was a bargain. Season 3 played fine through all 25 episodes- However, in playing the disks from Season 4- disc's 3 and 4 of the Season 4 set have problems and 5 episodes on those discs would not play at all. On examining the 4th disc-I found signs of some chemical along the edges that would not rub off, the #3 disc didn't have that chemical but the disc stopped several times and I had to remove and re-insert it a couple of times to get it to work. --  I'd be wary of any further \\"bargains\\" in dvd's.

1417675985|5.0|My Sisters Keeper is a great book. The Fitzgeralds were a perfect family with one boy one girl and a lot of love. Everything went spiraling downhill when they found out Kate had acute promyelocytic leukemia. Kates mom, Sarah wanted anything to keep her baby girl alive. Brian and Sarah (the Fitzgerald parents) went to a doctor and made a specific combination of their genes, to make a perfect genetic match for Kate. They named her Anna. Anna's first donation to her sister was her umbilical cord when she was born. She was born only to let her sister live. She went to lawyer Campbell Alexander and she sued her parents for medical emancipation when she was 13. Her mom thought she was doing this only for attention. But she wasn't. She did it because her older sister told her to do it. Jodi Picoult is a great author who captures the reader and makes the reader want to find out what happens next.

I rarely am on my kindle when it charges so the cord doesn't get moved around a lot, but I think the wires inside are damaged again.  This is way too fragile. Amazon replaced it the first time at no charge back in November of 2012.  I had to order another one that I received in May of 2013.  Now it is doing the same thing 2 1/2 months later.  It will only charge if I have the cord propped a certain way. At $10 each, this could add up pretry quick.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|While the storyline is similar to the Fifty Shades of Grey books, it is so much better written and less contrived, if that is possible.  I feel more for Gideon and Eva than I did for Ana and Christian.  I want to know the rest of their story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is really fun and you can  change the minions clothes and you get to play with the cute little minions
B00DU74U74|1.0|This movie was ridiculously stupid. I couldn't watch the whole thing. Just a stupid concept. Stupid...didn't make sense. Sorry....just being honest.
1401311083|5.0|A gossip columnist, rock stars, an athlete, lawyers, PR people, and even a limo driver are involved, but it all makes sense in the end. It has a \\"what's next\\" air to it, and as an easy read, I was through it in two days. I think \\"Richard Castle\\" found his footing with this one. Heat Rises was his first attempt and it's hard enough to write a novel when you are an actual person, let alone when you are ghost writing for someone who doesn't exist.<br /><br />Bravo.
B000I62JBE|5.0|I didn't know about Amazon movies, but was happy when I found out about it. I have been wanting to see this movie again for a while.

B001LF3YQK|5.0|I needed a wipes case but don't use Huggies or other brands that give a travel case. I found most of the other cases on Amazon to be expensive or flimsy looking.  I have really liked this case. Yes, it's bulkier, but it also holds a ton of wipes (I have never had them dry out, though they are constantly being used and replaced, so rarely in for more than a week). The red dot does not come off easily, in my experience, and the case itself is easy to open for refills. I will actually be purchasing a second one for a back-up bag.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This was such a fun read-easy to understand and reaffirmed many years of research. And, as expected all the experiments work! She writes with love and humor.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini never fails to intrigue me with his stories.  His language is rich with detail and his characters become friends.  Another splendid weaving of many different lives and stories showing how each affects the others.  I am a big fan - cant wait for the next book!
B0016OM3TU|3.0|If you are a Bud Powell/Lester Young fan, this movie is interesting.  The story is a mash-up of the two musicians' lives  with a heavier emphasis on Powell's.  There is no question of Dexter Gordon's genius as a horn player, but his acting is wooden and almost embarrassing.  Yet, the movie asks to be viewed. I didn't really like the film but it was so satisfying to hear the music.  And, most of all, Herbie Hancock's score is mesmerizing!
0307352153|1.0|The author does not know how to construct an argument.  She has strung thousands of pieces of evidence, some of it questionable, together with virtually no justification for how the evidence supports her claim.  It's hard to believe that she is a lawyer.  She must not have studied rhetoric in law school, which is difficult to believe.  Maybe it was a class that she just didn't do very well in.  I believe the book sold well because the topic is an interesting one.  However, Cain's treatment of it leaves much to be desired.

1400069289|5.0|Duhigg manages an almost impossible feat and writes a life-changing, scientifically solid page turner that is massively inspiring, to boot.<br /><br />If you let this information in and apply it to your own life, rather than approache in with an attitude of \\"well, that's interesting to know,\\" you can have the life you want, especially if you realize that the only thing that's keeping you from that is all the things you won't/can't do.<br /><br />Now you have the tools to change that to \\"can/will.\\" This is, there can be no doubt about it, a self help book, but not a \\"self-help\\" book.<br />Through understanding the mechanics of habit forming and alteration, you can design any habit that will support what you want in life and repurpose any habit that is stopping you. If that's not helping you, then I must be misunderstanding the meaning of \\"help\\" and \\"self\\".<br /><br />I'm already using this knowledge to my advantage. I'm on day 20 of a 21-day spiritual practice challenge that involves 2 hrs a day in prayer, contemplation and journaling, and for the very first time in my life, I am getting 8 hrs of sleep every night. Staying up unhealthily late my whole life since I was 9 years old (blanket and flashlight) was just a habit. Who knew? I've tried these endeavors many times and it is what I'm reading in this book that has allowed me to stick to it. Don't miss this book; it will be one of the most important ones you'll ever read if you bring the proper mindset to it which is to take what you read seriously and apply it to your life. Have a blast!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Since the beginning of the series I have been spellbound in its pages; entangled in its plots-  a must read!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Truly a zombie movie of such scope, that we've never seen the likes of it before! \\"28 Days Later\\" & \\"28 Weeks Later\\" hinted at it, with great success! But here is a film that is so vast, so all encompassing, that it captured the essence of a world apocalyptic movie, besieged by zombies, in all it's awesome fearsome, dread, panic, & mayhem! Not to mention, plenty of suspense! No, this is not your average traditional zombie fodder, with zombies all over the place looking like they should be arrested for public intoxication. You wouldn't believe a bunch of drunks could take over the world, would you? No. Neither would I believe zombies that couldn't pass the straight line walking test, let alone take five minutes to finish it, could ever be a threat to the living, but these zombies, & this zombie film, are realistic! A different breed apart!<br /><br />When I say realistic. This is a Zombie film, so lets keep it in context. \\"28 Days Later,\\" \\"28 Weeks Later,\\" & the remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" are the only films that I could swallow the human race falling extinct to. The new breed of the zombie genre film. Though these are not the first zombie films to use super fast zombies. On the opposite end, traditional Zombies. There is no traditional Zombie film in existence, that could make me believe that Zombies who move as slow & are as physically handicapped as a person who just drank a fifth in two hours of 80 proof whiskey, could take over the world. On the other hand, these \\"World War Z\\" zombies were very believable as antagonists challenging the world. They were fast, feral, & hungry! They had practically the whole world population infected in a very short time. The scenes of them climbing over each other, like ants crossing water over their own drowned, to attack the living, was just spellbinding! As was the scene with the nuclear bomb going off. Miraculously potent scenes that are a direct allegory to world terrorism, but this film had scenes of personal tragedy, sacrifice, & heroism too. The lab scene was a tense personal portrait of brave martyrs, as dozens of zombies are ready to scamper over each other like rats ready to chew on our protagonist's body parts with the slightest sound. While the rest of the lab scientists & technicians looked on through video cameras with horror & hope, that they make it back. The start of the movie, where the family is running & fighting for their lives. Heart pounding intensity of human survival at it most basic instinct, protect your loved ones & yourself!<br /><br />When I say realistic. I mean there was no dumb moves in this film by Pitt or any of the main characters. Not like the multitude of dumb moves in films like the original \\"Dawn of The Dead.\\" Not even to mention the ridiculous, it's so bad, it's good, (no, I take that back, it was not good. It was really bad!) \\"Day Of The Dead.\\" This is not a film where everyone knows they shouldn't stick their hand in a zombie's mouth, less be bitten, but do it anyway. It was not filled with idiotic, lets get killed to build a body count, horror clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />When I say realistic. I mean the way Pitt & scientist found to get around the zombies, & how they figured it out. I won't go into detail & spoil the movie.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" in my opinion, is the best zombie movie ever made. Why? The acting, the direction, the editing, the plot, top flight! The combining of horror, action, & war movie genres, blending perfectly together, in an awe inspiring demonstration of movie magic! A film perfectly complimenting it's theme, the end of the world as we know it. Maybe most impressive is this. At the theater, not a single person hardly made a noise. They were totally absorbed in the spectacle of this film. No cheap jump tactics, to make them gasp, for this film needed none. No gallons of blood & buckets of gore, for this film needed none. Only the suspense & dread of what was going to happen next. Yes, youknow it's a great horror film when the audience is silent. This is a thinking persons zombie film, just when you thought the zombies ran out of brains to eat!it's a great horror film when the audience is silent. This is a thinking persons zombie film, just when you thought the zombies ran out of brains to eat!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I'm wondering if it is possible to un-see a movie...JUST JOKING!<br /><br />First of all, Anyone who claims that this movie did not scare them...is LYING! I will call them a liar to their faces because it is indeed scary. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone pregnant (my sister is almost 9 months and I told her not to go), or anyone who has a heart condition. Secondly, this movie is not for children unless you want them sleeping in your bed for the rest of their lives. I realize some people may think that I am exaggerating, but when I went to go see it, this movie had 300lb grown men leaving \\"going to the bathroom.\\" I lie to you not people, this movie is a complete nightmare. Forget about every scary movie that you've seen in the 21st century because they won't even come close to this. Saw was gory (not scary) and Insidious moves really slow, and it doesn't pick up to me until about 45 minutes into the movie, but when it did I liked it even though a lot of people didn't. The Paranormal Activity Movies were creepy, but not scary, and frankly they moved really slowly too in my opinion.<br /><br />Third, this movie doesn't play around; it jumps right into the scares from the very beginning, so you will not be bored or disappointed I promise you. I expected a regular horror movie, nothing really special, and I felt like the trailers were just snippets of the best parts of the movie, but the movie itself was probably going to be mediocre at best. I was WRONG! Those screams are real. When I left the theater, I felt like I needed to recite the LORD'S PRAYER and SEVERAL HAIL MARY'S! I do not scare easily, but this movie not only scared the crap out of me, and I swear I started having heart palpitations right there in the theater. This movie is not about a regular haunted house, possession, or any of the other vastly overused plots they use now days. There is something for everyone, and it plays on your worst fears.<br /><br />1. Scared of the dark...check!<br />2. Scared of enclosed spaces...check!<br />3. Scared of ghosts, spirits, and demons...check!<br />4. Scared of the things that go bump in the night...check!<br />5. Scared of any harm coming to your children...check!<br />6. Scared of being trapped with nowhere else to go...check!<br />7. Scared of creepy dolls and cursed objects...check!<br />8. Scared of things jumping out at you; right in your face...check!<br />9. Scared of old haunted houses...check!<br />10. Scared of Satan worship, human sacrifice, and witches...check!<br />11. Scared of demonic possession or becoming a prisoner in your own body...check!<br />12. Scared of the basement...check!<br /><br />I really can't say what parts of this movie are true, and what parts were embellished in order to make a great movie, but whatever the case I have a newfound respect for Ed and Lorraine Warren. I was already familiar with some of their work because I used to watch the T.V. show \\"A Haunting\\" faithfully, and they were on quite a bit of those episodes, and I knew they also investigated the Amityville Horror. With that said, this was the worst, and I can see why they kept it hidden all these years. That family was lucky to have them. I really don't want to weigh my review down with a whole lot of the plot which ruins the entire experience, so all I have left to say is....watch at your own risk!<br /><br />Lastly, I really have to add this because I read where some people thought certain scenes were \\"cheesy\\" but it was those so-called \\"cheesy\\" moments that made the movie even better to me. It's no secret that the demons want to destroy a strong family by using the divide and conquer method to tear apart their unity. Once the vessel that the entity seeks to inhabit becomes so isolated, and broken down, it makes the possession that much easier. There are few mothers and fathers who won't fight practically anything or anybody for their children, and they had 5, so they had to be 5 times as strong to face that evil. The same thingwith the Warrens, a husband and wife unit is a powerful thing. They both needed to be there to support one another, and if it's so easy for one partner to abandon the other in their darkest hours. What does that say about their faith, strength, and unity as a couple? Lorraine did the right thing by standing at her husband's side no matter what. I realize those concepts may seem foreign and outdated to some, but those types of relationships still exist in the world. This demon was relentless, and had even started stalking the Warrens' daughter for that matter. They had to finish what they started, or should I say got themselves involved in. Allowing the characters to remember those cherished moments it's what ultimately saves all of them in the end. I thought those parts were lovely.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|First I want to say that I bought this book for a flight home from Boston Logan to San Francisco. I did not receive this book free from a publisher. That being said, I cannot write enough good things about this book. It is a well written book that tells the true story about the hardships that Adam Brown faced his whole life and how he overcame each one. Adam Brown was a true American patriot and hero. His inner strength, devotion to his wife and children, and courage can only be admired. This book moved me more than any other book that I read in a long time. It is the first book that I have ever read that made me cry.

B000088E6D|5.0|I love the old classic crooners and the old classic songs and Michael Buble has a unique voice that I enjoy.  His voice is distinct.  He puts his own spin on these classics but still leaves them recognizable.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie is well-worth seeing, as it depicts someone who has completely (on the surface) \\"bought into\\" a particular way of life, finding herself in a strange world in which she (as what our culture regards) as a \\"supreme success\\" finds herself as a misfit.  This is Siddhartha, leaving the confines of the surface of life wrapped in the happy illusions of a prince, going out into the world to confront the illusions of her culture, and, surprisingly, even in this tawdry surface world, she is able to discover some of the depth of suffering of humanity.  The movie plays up the silliness and contrasts of these surface worlds, but in the end, through her trials, I think we all glimpse something deeper, the wheel of samsara, turning beneath everyone.  This unexpected depth, I think, gives this movie a bit of pathos (especially with the superb acting of the main character), that can wake us up and shake us a little.

I have many Joe Friel books, but this is the one I recommend time and time again regardless of the distance your training. It is complex, but I get a great deal of excitement from creating my own plans. This is a guide to do that. If your're looking for a book to tell you what to do then this is not for you. This is for people interested in creating plans designed to be unquie to an individual. HAVE FUN!!

B0060MYM7O|3.0|Thumbs down on the \\"digital copy\\". You don't get a digital copy. I was expecting a separate disc with compressed versions of the episodes I could copy to my movie NAS. Nope. You get streaming from obscure cloud services that want to install adware on your devices and opt-out-only spam after making you jump through hoops to even get to the point where they let you down. This cloud access will of course disappear relatively soon with no apology and no recourse. This DRM garbage is the reason piracy exists. I recently found a Bluray ripper so I can make my own digital copy now anyway.<br /><br />The movies on disk are great. The HD and CGI are very well done. The lighting and contrast are clean. The box is sturdy and the disks are safe.<br /><br />A+ for the show itself. I'll defer to the more verbose reviewers.

B00CDT41RY|3.0|Unlike many film fans here, I'm not one of the Tarantino \\"herd.\\" In my view, \\"Django Unchained\\" is a typical QT movie: some great scenes and acting interspersed with excessive gore and repellent exploitation of violence, slavery, and use of the \\"N\\" word.<br /><br />While it is true that the word was used as a regular part of the American vocabulary in the era around the American Civil War, Django hardly qualifies as historical in many respects. An example of this is when Django and his partner Dr. King Shultz (brilliantly played by Cristoph Waltz) ride into Greenville, Mississippi like conquering heroes. Mississippi was the heart of the racist, slave-owning South prior to (and well after) the Civil War. No way would a black man be able to get away with that during the era depicted.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie has to be one of the most despicable film characters in recent memory. From an acting perspective, he does a fine job, but the dialogue Tarantino gives him seems to revel in hatred and racism. Instead of sending a message and leaving it at that, Tarantino rubs it in the face of the audience. I cringed at the \\"Mandingo\\" fight scene, and I'm not easily affected by movie violence.<br /><br />As is Tarantino's trademark, the film is way too long. Most of the filler is the many disturbing scenes I mentioned, as well as the long, long, buildups to the violent confrontations we know are coming. My feeling is this would be a 5-star film if Tarantino could have managed to restrain his over-the-top instincts just this once. But this is QT, and going overboard is what he does. Meanwhile, I'll do what I do, and give his movies middle-of-the road reviews.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I've read pretty much all of Sophie Kinsella's books, and this is one of her best!

I'd definitely recommend this one.

The typing is no longer buggy, the zoom in and out works great. Everything works just like I hoped it would. I created a large button/print theme for my computer with a shortcut on my desktop, so when I access through the Kindle, it's simple to change. I would recommend this app.<br /><br />I haven't signed up for the extension pack (I'm sorry, I can't remember the official name of it) but hope to in the future. I think it will be ver handy to help my mother with her computer who lives in another state.

I can't speak to the lack of a light that tells you whether it's charging since this is the first car charger I've owned.  Guess I'll find out over time whether I feel like that a pro or a con.

B008C20TDG|5.0|I was hesitant about reading and actually starting The Whole30. However, I saw such dramatic change and improvement in my boss's health. He started The Whole 30 because he had elevated cholesterol levels, and after changing his eating habits and detoxing from doing The Whole 30, he is healthier than he has ever been and as a result has also lost over 50lbs. I started reading the book and food made so much more sense to me. Input the good and reap the benefits...eat bad and duh, feel bad! Before doing The Whole 30, I was constantly tired and suffered from back pain. The first 2 weeks of the Whole 30 were hard but it's normal because your body is detoxing, but after the initial 2 weeks, I immediately felt so much better and had so much more energy (which I so needed with 3 small children!) It all Starts with Food really teaches you to change your relationship with food and eating. I have referred this book to a number of my friends and they have all had amazing results. A friend of mine with diabetes has also had tremendous results because of The Whole30.

1451627297|5.0|Except for a few sections where I got impatient with all the details describing the convoluted rabbit hole in time and the evolving and mysterious gatekeeper, I was totally captivated by the story and the characters. I especially loved the bittersweet ending. King's prose sparkles, rarely calls attention to itself and never gets in the way of the story. The thousand pages of this book flew by. I highly recommend it.

034580709X|3.0|While The Bat is the first book written by Jo Nesbø chronicling the cases of Norwegian police detective Harry Hole (pronounced HOO-leh), it is the seventh to be published in the United States. At an author event a couple years back Nesbø explained that the decision to release the books out of order was made by the publisher who thought it best to release the books in the order that they thought would most appeal to American readers.<br /><br />I never agreed with this logic.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />Jo Nesbø is one of my favorite authors. I've been hooked on his books ever since reading The Devil's Star, one of his earlier U.S. releases.  His raw and edgy writing is as compelling as it I disquieting. His plotting, while requiring some suspension of disbelief, is original in his later books.<br /><br />Sadly, this cannot be said about The Bat. The plot is not unlike a typical television mystery show where the police bounce from suspect to suspect, making foolish mistakes that cost people their lives before finally figuring out who the killer is. In the real world, such blunders by a policeman would be career-ending at best. In The Bat, Harry is in Sydney, Australia, helping the police there find the killer of a minor Norwegian celebrity. The fact that she is a celebrity appears to serve no purpose other than to explain why the Norwegians sent one of their officers half way around the world. When he arrives in Sydney Harry is told in no uncertain terms that his role would be as an observer but from that point on his behavior is more lead detective than observer.<br /><br />The setting is another problem. The story reads like a book an author would write after returning from an Australian vacation. It includes a lot of information about Australia and its people that, while interesting, belongs more in a travel guide than in a police procedural. I can understand that Norwegian readers would find a Norwegian detective's impressions of Australia interesting. As an American, though, I am more interested in a Norwegian detective's impressions of Norwegians. I suspect that this was part of the reasoning behind publisher's decision to release the books out of order. After Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, Scandinavian crime fiction was a hot item and Nesbø was an established and award winning author. While The Bat does feature a Scandinavian policeman, its Australian setting isn't exactly what the publishers were looking for. They therefore chose as their first offering to their American readers a Nesbø book where Harry Hole sticks closer to home.<br /><br />On a positive note, Nesbø's skill at developing characters was well developed even in his first book. We learn much about Harry's back-story and his struggle with alcoholism.  Nesbø just as ably fleshes out the other characters so that the reader is likely to overlook weaknesses in the plot and keep reading to find out what happens to the characters.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Jo Nesbø is a very talented author but that he had a bit of a learning curve to go through before hitting his stride. If The Bat were the first of his books that I read, I probably would not have read any others.  Fortunately, though, my first introduction to Jo Nesbø came in a later book. I strongly recommend Jo Nesbø's books but The Bat is not the best place to start if you want to get a good appreciation of his talent.<br /><br />* The review copy of this book was obtained from the publisher via the Amazon Vine Program.an American, though, I am more interested in a Norwegian detective's impressions of Norwegians.

0062255657|3.0|Like most people into speculative fiction, I f--ing love Neil Gaiman. I was raised on his books and will pass them onto my kids when the time is right. American Gods and Neverwhere are always going to be on my top 20 list because I've comfort-read them since I was in middle school.<br /><br />Many respected reviewers fawned over Ocean and gave it incredible compliments. So insightful! So moving! Taps into your inner child! Such an important commentary on memory!  I was expecting this original work of mind-blowing genius that would hit me like an arrow to the heart (you know, in a good way). Plus, it's been so many years since Gaiman wrote a novel--oh yeah, I was gunning for this. When I saw my dad reading pre-ordered copy, I had to restrain myself from ripping it out of his hands.<br /><br />Well, it fell a little short. As many have noted, it's shockingly slim. It's a short story, ffs. A good one. An entertaining one. But it is not something to eagerly await and then pay $24.99 for. I still f--ing love Neil Gaiman, but come on. After I finished it (in about 4 hours), I felt like I had been taken advantage of by someone I really admire.<br /><br />Gaiman suggested that Oceans began short story for his wife. (Actually, I recommend reading his thoughts about the origin of Oceans because it helped mediate some of my disappointment.) As he wrote, the story got longer and was eventually over 50K words, so he had to call it a novel. I disagree. A novel is more than just a large number of words. When he hit the 50K mark, it just became an awkwardly long short story. A novel, at least one for people over 13, needs at least one secondary plot. I think this is why people have argued that it's really YA fiction. It's much too simple and lacks the layered plot of an adult novel.<br /><br />And no, there is nothing in it too twisted for young adults. People need to give kids a little credit for being able to respond to scary, disturbing stuff as -fiction- without mistaking it for reality. In fact, compared to other YA stuff I've read recently, the subject matter is pretty tame, and none of it will be new to kids. (Unless you -really- believe that they don't realize that grown ups can be cruel or unfaithful or lose control.) I suspect that most of the readers whose undies were in a knot because it's too mature haven't read much YA lately.<br /><br />As usual, Gaiman nails the monsters and supernatural parts. I marveled at his imagination and savored each description. Oceans really is a strong story, and in spite of my complaining, it is absolutely worth reading. Just be aware that it may not live up to your very high expectations.r reality.

B00CZAYOWI|5.0|Electric Peace is a compilation of The Cult's multi-platinum 80s hard rock classic Electric and its original version, Peace.  The band originally went to record the follow-up to Love with the same producer, Steve Brown, resulting in an 11 track album titled Peace.  The band, however, were apparently unhappy with the sound and later re-recorded the entire album with a more straightforward, stripped down aesthetic with producer Rick Rubin, changing up the tracklisting and scrapping several of the original songs along the way.  That new version became the commercially released Electric album.  The original version, Peace, with its intended tracklisting was later made available in the limited and now-out-of-print Rare Cult box set, with this compilation bringing it back into print for the first time since.<br /><br />Note that, according to the label, the masters used are from the 2000 remastered reissue of Electric and the transfer of Peace from the Rare Cult box set, so if you have both of those, there's nothing new here.  The booklet is also from Electric with a couple pages added (the Peace cover art in the album image is a cardboard slipcover).  If you don't have the albums, the masters are great, atmospheric, crisp, and free from the brickwalling that has plagued a lot of modern reissues.<br /><br />The material itself will probably divide fans into two camps.  Personally, Love has long been my favorite Cult album, maybe even on the list of my favorite albums of all time.  While I like Electric and can understand its more up-front, stripped-down-4-piece sound, I've always found it to be sonically sparse and a bit cheesy (particularly the group chanting in \\"Peace Dog\\" and the cover of \\"Born to be Wild\\"), sort of sitting as the weaker link between the much better Love and Sonic Temple albums.  While, perhaps, more representative of the band's one-guitarist lineup, the album's always felt like a band missing a second guitarist to me.<br /><br />Peace certainly remedies that and then some, with reverb-laden drums, more intricate bass, layers of incredible guitar, and more atmospheric vocal performances, creating more of a psychedelic wall of rock akin to a heavier, more intense version of Love's trademark sound.  I half expected the songs to be slower and mellower, but if anything, some of the performances on Peace are more energetic and uptempo than their Electric counterparts.  Not only that, but some of the tracks that didn't make the cut for Electric (sadly being replaced by songs like the aforementioned \\"Born to be Wild\\") are amazing, most notably \\"Conquistador\\" and \\"Love Trooper\\".<br /><br />I suppose your opinion of the two discs will come down to personal preference.  If Electric is your favorite Cult album and you prefer its in-your-face 4-piece rock sound, Peace will probably be more of an interesting document of the album's origins.  If you've always wished Electric sounded more like Love, Peace is the album you've been waiting to hear.  Whichever you prefer, both are here, separated into their respective original discs and sounding great, and this double album is a must-have for fans that don't already have the material in their collections.es that and then some, with reverb-laden drums, more intricate bass, layers of incredible guitar, and more atmospheric vocal performances, creating more of a psychedelic wall of rock akin to a heavier, more intense version of Love's trademark sound.

I found no trace of the beauty and magical realism inherent in Garcia Marquez's works. Even putting that bad comparison aside, the book was predictable, long-winded, and dull. I hate to say that, but really, I finished the book only because I'd already invested the effort. Not sure why so many people enjoyed it.

B00DBSZJRM|3.0|It was mildly entertaining.  Based on the trailer I assumed it was action packed adventure.  While action packed it was lacking on so many levels especially charter development.  The acting was bad but I do not think the actors had much to work with.  The lines were stupid and it seems like they we out of their way to inject profanity into the script - it served no purpose.  What they lacked in script the tried to make up in gore - it did not work.  Do not pay to watch - i would like my money back.

After updating I found the how to play addition to the game. This should help some of those who complained that it lacked such. Overall, very good game and the developer seems to be attentive to feedback. This should lead to a great game.

B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This is one of those movies where reading the book prior to seeing the film might be advantageous. There are a lot of ideas discussed in this film and the book definitely gave me a head start on them. Cloud Atlas tells the stories of two couples, reincarnated through the ages, and how karma impacts everyone. The movie is told differently than the book, staggering the stories, but this works better for Hollywood; it was easier to maintain continuation of all the timelines.<br /><br />The make up and costumes were fantastic. Each actor wore between five and seven different looks!<br /><br />Someone mentioned using subtitles in certain parts: do. It'll be easier than having to rewind, or thinking that you got the idea, but...<br /><br />Don't go into this movie thinking it's a simple watch. You'll have to follow, and think. You'll have to put two and two together and figure out what you end up with. But in the end you'll find it was a wonderful journey!
B008JFUPPI|1.0|There are several signs that a film is destined to fail.  First and foremost, if the film in question doesn't allow for advanced viewing by critics, it's usually a tell-tale sign that the movie studio knows it's bad and doesn't want negative reviews to damage the opening weekend numbers.  Secondly, a massive budget is difficult to overcome, even for an average film with an A-list actor starring in it.  For instance, Green Lantern and Catwoman - two incredibly popular comic book characters - both managed to crash-and-burn at the box office despite the A-list star-power.  Thirdly, if a film looks like a recently released film, potential moviegoers will often balk at seeing the same thing twice.  This is the recent Olympus Has Fallen vs. White House Down predicament.  Finally, if there is other films debuting on the same weekend, odds are the audience will be split amongst the variety of choices, ultimately leading to lower than usual viewers.  Naturally, every one of these factors is weighing heavily on the sure-to-fail comic book-to-film adaptation, Rest in Peace Department (R.I.P.D.).<br /><br />Directed by Robert Schwentke (RED, The Time Traveler's Wife), R.I.P.D. stars Ryan Reynolds as Boston police officer, Nick Walker.  After a drug bust with his partner, Bobby Hayes (Kevin Bacon), the pair decides to keep a handful of valuable gold pieces.  However, Nick feels guilty about his misdeed and prepares to do the right thing by putting the gold into evidence.  However, before he can do so he is unexpectedly betrayed and murdered.  Now a member of the afterlife, he is given a choice to become an afterlife police officer or face his final judgment (as a dirty cop).  Now teamed with a new partner, Roy Pulsipher (Jeff Bridges), the duo must work through their differences to stop an ancient artifact from being constructed, which would allow the dead to return to Earth.  Mary-Louise Parker, Stephanie Szostak, James Hong, and Marisa Miller also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />From the second the first trailer debuted, R.I.P.D. has received an endless amount of criticism for resembling the storyline and characters featured in Men in Black.  While the premise of R.I.P.D. is sound, it does play off Men in Black far too much for comfort to feel like a fresh idea.  Clearly, the story was inspired by a concept of \\"Men in Black meet the Ghostbusters,\\" but in the weak (and brief) defense of R.I.P.D., most of the films being released these days resemble some other film that's been previously released.  It's fairly easy to cope with the fact that this film is an utter knock-off (intended or not) as long as it provides for an interesting story, intriguing characters, and a plot that doesn't seem too \\"off the wall.\\"  Sadly, R.I.P.D. fails in each and every one of these categories, leaving a completely disingenuous and unsettling feeling of being ripped off.  Like the previously mentioned comic film failures, Green Lantern (also starring Ryan Reynolds) and Catwoman, plus the easily comparable Jonah Hex, it's easy to imagine the sound of money being flushed down the toilet about a quarter of the way through this film.  It's just that nostalgically predictable.<br /><br />Easily the brightest spot of this film is the acting of Academy Award winner, Jeff Bridges, who once again adopts the \\"True Grit\\" accent, portraying a western lawman with an overzealous attitude and habit of ignoring the rules.  Like the majority of his roles over the course of his career, he's extremely likeable, full of charisma, and playfully humorous.  He fits into the role of the cranky westerner quite well (much like Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black), adding the majority of the humor to this film in a sarcastic, and occasionally jumbled manner.  On the other hand, his partner (Ryan Reynolds) doesn't fare so well in the role of the \\"sympathetic\\" lead, often coming off as bland and stale.  Truth be told, Ryan Reynolds needs to lay off the comic book films for a while and stick to serious roles.  For a guy that came into the business doing comedy roles, Reynolds is hardly ever funny anymore.  Somewhere along the way he lost his flair for comedy, and is much more suited for roles that resemble his characters in Safe House or Buried.  However, many of us are still holding on to the small shred of hope that a Deadpool movie is still in the works (yes, he should get a hall pass to make that film).<br /><br />Overall, R.I.P.D. will leave a mostly negative impression on the few people that do end up watching it - for a wide variety of reasons, starting with a predicable story, weak villainy, and sub-par CGI.  The film does have its moments of action and comedy, but this sub-genre of sci-fi action, mixed with the premise of new partners bonding while killing aliens needs to be given a rest.  Like the first Men in Black film, R.I.P.D. would have easily been a hit if it was released in 1997 - but that was 16 years ago.  The rookie being partnered with the cranky old man \\"bromance\\" has run its course, and that's never been more evident than after watching this film.  Actually, it was pretty evident after watching Men in Black III, too, but somehow that film still managed to be commercially successful.  In any event, there are better things to do with 90 minutes of your life than to watch this film, and depending on how desperate you are when this film hits home video, it might garner a sympathy rental - but, absolutely nothing more.<br /><br />GRADE: D<br />FNDNreview.comick to serious roles.

B008GOG98Y|5.0|This movie came out in 1979. IMHO, this was the first of the 80's movies that we all love, and it set the trend. Breaking Away is a window into a world of class war, privilege, and teen angst. It is set in Bloomington, Indiana on the campus of Indiana University. The spoiled rotten college kids look down their noses at the townies. They call them &#34;cutters&#34; which comes from the once popular job of working in a stone quarry cutting limestone for use in buildings. Dennis Quad's character (Mike) takes offense at the Preppy college kids coming to their swimming hole. He fights with several of the jocks after they beat up one of the main characters (Cyril) played by Daniel Stern. As a result, the University of Indy decided to allow the &#34;cutters&#34; to enter a team into the &#34;little 500&#34; bicycle race. The other main Character, Dave Stoller, played by Dennis Christopher, is obsessed with racing road bicycles. He is so obsessed, he talks and acts as if he is Italian (very funny!). He is very fast on his bike and races against a tractor trailer. Team Cinzano comes to Indy for a race, and Dave thinks he can impress them with his riding skill. He soon learns differently and his spirits are broken. Ultimately, they race (as the &#34;Cutters&#34;) in the little 500. I won't completely spoil the movie, just watch it, it is a GREAT MOVIE!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I don't buy many movies but had to get a copy of this one.  I can watch this over & over.  A classic.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is my second favorite movie made from a Jane Austen novel.  The BBC Pride and Prejudice being my absolute favority.  This movies has a subtle rhythm and is a joy to watch.
B0062QRTKA|1.0|I downloaded this game when it was the &quot;free app of the day&quot; on Amazon. A few weeks pass by and inow it says that I no longer &quot;own&quot; the app and it quits the game. I am assuming the developers did this. Why would you offer your app for free and then take away permission?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|like khaleds other books - this is a very well written story that takes place in the middle east.  the story spans generations and its easy to fall in love with the characters.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series.  Superb writing and acting.  Even Isis does a great job!!!!!!!  I thought it would be stuffy but is much more human and entertaining.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|this book is great guidance on how to live - follow your path and trust your heart and you will find your treasure.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is just great. it has so much to do that you can not put it down. must get games if you like action and blowing things up.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|Lemonade Mouth is a 2011 Disney Original movie based on a novel by Mark Peter Hughes and stars Brigit Mendler(Good Luck Charlie), Hayley Kiyoko(Scooby-Doo: The Mystery Begins), and Tisha Campbell-Martin(Rags To Riches). Directed by Patrica Riggen, the film involves five high-school students meet up in detention for each of their own offenses in school, bored they decided to form a rock band and named after a old soft drink.

The DVD includes special features like a deleted scene and sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favourites like Brave, Toy Story 3, Spooky Buddies, and Tinker Bell and The Secret of The Wings. Lemonade Mouth is the perfect Disney movie for anyone who believes in going for your dreams!
B003G4W49C|5.0|It had been many years since I had read this book. The sorrow is still there. Card is a genius.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Lisbeth Salander has to be one of the great characters created in literature. Reading her story is both inspiring and painful.  Larsson takes on almost every institution in Sweden, from child services to the highest intelligence levels and skewers them like shish kabob. He is very creative in showing how personalities affect every institution that is supposedly there to protect us. Yet his characters are not cliches, they're fully fleshed out, completely human. Great literature and a great read.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The newer version is a mess.  The prior version was clear and crisp.  This newer update is not user friendly IMO.<br /><br />I travel for business and rely on the weather channel app, but no more.  Will be uninstalling this version and find something else.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Cute little game<br />Could be a little better but over all cute could have more things g you could do. But kids would love it especially if they like horses... it's got hard wish you could give horse bath and interact with the horse more
B00BUT5I84|4.0|I like this album, particularly the first half.  Compared to their earlier music, this is a lot more toned down.  Some people do not appreciate the change; it is definitely softer rock than their previous albums. The only reason I did not love the album is that some of the songs are too &#34;soundtrack&#34; like.  I love Jared Leto's voice, but he is absent in some of the songs on the second half of the album.  Overall a good cd, but not completely amazing.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|ITS REALLY Great  theres lots of penguin the upgrades are really awesome if all of them are maxed then u can go over 1000 miles easy this app is also free and its great for kids
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was an amazing book.  I love it and would recommend it to anybody. Also it was kind of sad.
B0029LHW4A|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums and all the songs on it are catchy and well-written. This is Jet's best album.
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|BECAUSE MY GRANDSON JUST LOVED IT. IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE JUST SCREAMER WHEN HE OPENED THAT  PACKAGE.IT WAS THE PERFECT PRESENT.
B00BXHLM1K|5.0|I like the way Damrau, Beczala and Lucuc interpret those extremely difficult parties. First of all, they play in the very dramatic sense of this word, avoiding as far as possible the usual belcanto approach. The result is shattering.
B000N90JG8|5.0|there's something about jack in all these years of me watching him, i can't put my finger on it.  yes he is amazing.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|With \\"Zealot\\" Reza Aslan tries to convince us that, feeling threatened by an itinerant John Lennon-like figure preaching peace and love, mighty Rome crucified Jesus for subversion. Ask yourself, who was most threatened by the popularity of Jesus : Pontius Pilate or Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin? Follow the money. Where did the thirty pieces of silver given to Judas come from? Caiaphas, thrust Jesus before a reluctant Pontious Pilate, (who, disposed to appease the powerful Sanhedrin, and lacking evidence that Jesus was subversive, washed his hands of the verdict and left the sentence to the mob obedient to Caiaphas). Pilate had no evidence that Jesus claimed to be king of the Jews since when questioned on this point Jesus either remained silent or responded with \\"That is what you say.\\" Doubtlessly Caiaphas, for self-serving reasons persuaded Pilate that Jesus claimed to be \\"King of the Jews,\\" to provide the Romans with grounds to crucify him, reportedly with INRI (Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum) nailed to the top of the cross to mock him, since the Romans had no reason to take the title seriously. Moreover, Jesus' earlier  \\"Render unto Caesar\\" quote demonstrates no challenge to Rome's authority, but rather submission to it, knowing that armed Jewish resistance to the might of Rome was suicidal. More importantly, the core of Christ's message is about love and caring for the poor and the sick, not about armed resistance to Rome.  His admonition to \\"Turn the other cheek,\\" and \\"Love thine enemy,\\" contradicting the earlier \\"eye-for-an-eye\\" of Leviticus -- was obviously intended to urge Jews to avoid potentially catastrophic confrontation with Rome -- a sensible counterweight to the Zealots, whose Leviticus-styled advocacy of guerrilla warfare ignited rebellion two generations later, provoking Rome's attack and dispersal of the Jewish people 38 years after the crucifixion. Aslan's premise that \\"The Prince of Peace\\" advocated armed rebellion against the overwhelming might of Rome is just plain silly - a transparent attempt to sell a book with a sensationalist message impugning an influential historical figure.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|I was a doubter. Yes, I am a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fan, and I was unhappy that the first contemporary MLP film was about \\"Humans in Equestria.\\" (Yes, Hasbro, I'd still like to see an epic MLP:FIM movie. Just a suggestion, if you want my money.)<br /><br />But this film won me over. The personalities of Twilight and Spike were spot on, as were the other characters. Viewed as a side-episode of MLP:FIM, this is pretty good.<br /><br />If I had a complaint about the film, it's that body-types other than tall-and-skinny weren't represented much. I would have liked to see Truffle Shuffle (dark, probably Hispanic and, President, I'm sure, of the Chess Club) in the hallways. And Scootaloo as a \\"differently-abled\\" child (which, I think, fits with Lauren Faust's vision of her) would have been refreshing. (I love Scoots and would dearly love to see her fly; but, maybe, that's not her destiny.)<br /><br />This feature has a good heart and I am glad to embrace it.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|someone suggested this CD and I purchased it without eveyr hearing it and it was definitely worth it - recommend
B000035Z3K|4.0|Soooo much better than all that bare chested and fluttering heaving sighs we see on screen now.  This count is evil and the scenery and props are awesome- the best set of doors ever designed!
B0025UHKNS|2.0|Ok, I consider myself very technical adept and have no problem dealing with gadgets that are more difficult to use. But the bezel on this GPS watch drives me absolutely crazy:<br />- When running, it starts to switch between things as my sleeve touches it<br />- When navigating through menus to change settings, the scroll up/down is very hard to do; and I tried all different ways of doing it, read the manual about this carefully.<br /><br />Luckily I don't have to change settings very often - I dread having to deal with the bezel. I wish they would have just added two more buttons instead to perform scroll up/down.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved it! Magical plot with lyrical whimsical people and prose and an overarching sense of atmosphere and style. Everything fit together perfectly!
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|I like the shoot outs I like how they put the stuff in the shreff to stop him from boozing it up<br />I have no dislikes at all
B004I2K4E8|5.0|After seeing the play twice, once in London, and once at the Boule Theater in Denver, we watched the concert on TV and it was a promotion for the channel.  We could not afford to donate to obtain the DVD,.  Then, we saw it on Amazon.  I purchased it for my husband for Father's Day this year.  He loved it and we were in Texas, visiting our son and his family.  The whole family sat down and watched it and loved it.  Beautifully done and so nice to have our own copy.  I am going to give it as a gift to two people.  It is excellent.
B005R32L66|5.0|Easy set up and install.... Skype is great to keep in touch and being able to hear and see friends and loved ones.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I have used Tasks N Todos for 18 months now. It is easy to use and very friendly.  Change lists by a simple side swipe. No software application problems whatsoever.<br /><br />It is very pricey, seeing there is no competition I doubt it will change much.<br /><br />I would like to see Subtasks added to the software and seeing it is pricey software development shouldn't he stopping.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I LOVE this app! I own 3 pages and admin 2, it lets me, look at my page, make posts, and many other things! The only problem I have with this all, is that I can't add or remove admins from my page, unless it is coming in the next update, I don't know, but otherwise, I would recommend this app to anyone who manages any page on Facebook.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BINGO BLITZ free fun for all age's. There are free rewards lets you level up.Free tournament games also slot games.I. love BB and posy with friends.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show, the HD quality is excellent. I highly recommend this series--Amazon is the only one that currently has Season 3 available.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is just like a real calculator only better. I was looking for one almost identical to my real calculator.
B00821OX98|5.0|Action packed show, I highly recommend the series. The HD quality is excellent and there have been no streaming issues.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game just fine so far. _following the advice of a recent reviewer, I just quit the game for a while then go back later if I need more energy. So if you like to play hours at a stretch, you're going to get frustrated about spending money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging game. Multi steps in each level. Can't wait for more rooms to be come available to play.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I absolutely love the Kendricks' movies...we keep watching them again every few months...I guess we just don't get tired of them. I would probably give them all 10 stars.
B00AQCMK32|3.0|My initial runthrough of GDS was great.  In the beginning, I really liked learning about some of the inner workings of a gaming company, even in its very small scope in this game.  However, I will make the obvious statement that the game became a lot easier later on, and I kept on releasing #1 selling games.  I never won the top award, though.<br /><br />The replay value went down during my second runthrough of the game.  They never had the annual gaming awards or the annual convention in the second runthrough, which confused me.  If this had been fixed, definitely four stars.<br /><br />Graphics and sound are adequate for this type of game.
B00BB22GQM|4.0|I really like this cd.  I do not own their previous CD's, so I cannot compare to their earlier work that others reference.  But I really enjoy this one.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I LOVED the books and was so excited for this movie, which met my expectations and was fun to watch.  Movie interpretations of books pretty much never live up to book's level of detail and this was no exception, but it was still a good movie.  I enjoyed it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|You will regret downloading this app. It's a huge addicting time suck... but it's also a great place to go for inspirational ideas. The app is easy to use, and quick to load which I find impressive considering all the content. I'm a fan. :)
B00BLK6FLQ|4.0|I was really glad to hear the the Nick Drake albums were being re-issued being I was a bit too young to get the LP's when they first came out - I like &#34;Bryter Later&#34; although &#34;Five Leaves Left&#34; would probably be my favorite of the three - still highly recommended and the sound quality of the vinyl re-issue is great!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I enjoy keeping up with friends on Facebook, but the app leaves much to be desired. It's definitely easier to use the full-blown site, but this will do in a pinch.
0880796863|3.0|I wasn't that pleased with the colors in these cards...My older deck which was accidentally ruined was a superior printing process that yielded more accurate and vibrant colors.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Loved the first two books, can't wait to finish the third!!!! I like the way they uncover the truth. Hope it is as good as the first two!!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I didn't think that I would like this game this much. It rocks!!!<br />I love the graphics too!  I get caught up looking at everything that sometimes I miss the diamonds. Great game!!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Sick & Stupid Score: 10/10*<br /><br />This is another sick movie from Hollywood, the source of all moral corruption in our society, after our government, of course.  I dumped this movie within 20 minutes.<br /><br />First a suicide scene, then a beat-me-whip-me slave scene straight out of Frederick Douglas' fraudulent autobiography, and finally two naked sodomites in bed.  That was all I could take.<br /><br />Four bucks down the tubes.  Avoid this movie if you are a normal, clear-thinking, moral person.<br />________________________________<br />* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category.  For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.  A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.
B005NPCUC8|2.0|Breathe is great song which is cut off. Is this lack of quality control from Amazon? Disappointed. This is not first time this has happened but first time I am submitting review.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|This is a pretty good game except it didn't have the best graphics and once you've played it for a little it gets pretty boring. So I guess the games ok.
0307895475|5.0|almost too much information to digest. anything and everything about the game! this tome will supply all the information you will ever need.
1608871819|3.0|I've been spoiled by the behind the scenes books for Star Wars and Grindhouse which are exhaustive in their coverage from script to screen. This is a thick, very well made book but lacking in substance. For such a huge character and reboot I was expecting a lot more. You get brief character bios and some filming stories but I'd say at least 75% of this book is just film art which is cool but not why I wanted this book. Seriously, when you first open this and see the books impressive cover you think you're in for a treat. Would recommend for the hardcore Superman fans. It is nice but just not very deep.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! I like how you have to use the very few things in the room to figure out the multiple steps to get to the next level! Makes me feel like a super sleuth!
0345803450|5.0|Ian McEwan has a way with words and has constructed a believable story about a woman (from her point of view) who joins the British spy organization, She falls in love with a writer who is supposed to unwittingly discredit communists. But he discovers her and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.
B00006LFGD|4.0|A lot of cuts for the money on this album.  Liked most of them a lot. Always buy Streisand albums to share with my sister in law who is an adamant fan of Barbra's.
0307949508|5.0|if you liked the girl with the dragon tattoo, you will love the girl who played with fire. she is one and the same! very interesting character and fantastic plot.
B008220D7S|5.0|will be put in the cabinet as a fan favorite!<br />almost wet my pants!;<br />explains your 40's exactly!<br />GREAT MOVIE!
B004G6009K|5.0|I like 3D effect of this movie just like in the 3D theater. Blue-ray is in such high resolution and the picture is very crystal clear.
1423140591|5.0|I loves this book.<br /><br />The quality was also excellant.<br /><br />I hope to order books in the future of the same quality.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this tool is great if you are a pocket knife whore like I am and you just need to sharpen it up every once and a while.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Love it! I'm glad I finally have this CD to add to my concert collection. I remember watching this Concert on TV in amazement as Diana belted out song after song. When the storm came she didn't flinch, and continued singing throughout the lightening, and thunder. It could have been tragic, but it became one of her most successful concerts.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I've enjoyed this challenging game.  Not extremely easy but not too hard either.  I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys puzzle solving.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Another great book from LE Carre, but what else is new? This one has an tricky ending which I liked. As usual, great characters, great plot, and wonderful insights into human nature.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have the other Quell game and thoroughly enjoyed it. I got this one when I saw it listed and am glad I did. It's just as much fun, or more than the other game. If you like Quell, you'll like this. It's challenging with some new twists and turns. great game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|They're so cute it's addicting!!! I love the game.. and I love minions!! I definitely recommend it, you'll be hooked!
B00D8RYV52|4.0|This is a good tool to entertain your kids. It lets them decide how they want to the vehicle to look even adds wacky feet!!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Delightful Family film about a bad guy who turns out to be not so bad after all when he adopts 3 little girls for his evil scheme against a rival bad guy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A lot like Temple Run only much better.  The character seems to interact with you when you let him run face first into a rocket. He looks at you with a dazed look.  The object is to chase bananas and avoid all kinds of objects. A portion of the game uses the gyro feature on the Kindle Fire.  It's addictive!  :)
B0030B0S2Q|5.0|Great film! would highly recommend to anyone, especially anyone who cringes at the idea of watching another Science Fiction movie as this film takes some different twists on the normal run of the mill si-fi movie.
B000W94FE6|2.0|I get it, it's not a self help book but some sort of condensed book based off years of research. That's the thing, it reads like someone's academic journal with more concern on facts and findings then the readers. I didn't enjoy it though. I don't think the author took enough time to restructure it. It could have been shorter but hold infinitely more impact that way.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|I bought this case because I wanted a case that will fully cover my iPhone5 and will not add too much bulk to it and it has to look good.  This case fits the bill. Also, the fitment is perfect and it is not too hard to take off the case or put it on. I have bought Spigen cases before for my other Android phones and they seem to make good cases for phones in general.  I haven't had a case from them that I wasn't happy.
B007FEZQF8|2.0|Watch the show love it, decided to read one of these, did not care for it. Adult comic written for kids.  Dialogue is really lacking.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Large variety of puzzles to choose from for free! Although you can buy more, for a couple of dollars! Thanks for the whole thing!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book. Good story. Couldn't put it down. Suspenseful and we'll written. Would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good thriller.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|ordered this for a friend of mine and he loves it, was worried it wouldn't be the same as on tv but it was, so great find at a good dea!
B001V5CIFI|5.0|I've seen this movie multiple times and love the comedy and the message and the magic.  Recently rented it to show to my grandchildren.  They were charmed and played &#34;Nanny McPhee&#34; games afterward.
B00936A0RU|5.0|knew I wanted this movie and didn't want to pay $20.00 for it at wal-mart, ordered movies in the past and knew i would get a good deal!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|ok someone who goes highend on all my gear, I love this blueray unit, hd all the way, perfect separation on srs, perfect sound all thru each movie, will buy this one for my friends, just love the clarity.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|5 GB is so worth It! Storage is always a plus on my kindlefire. I enjoy being able to use the cloud drive for back up. Thank you!
0399157565|4.0|Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta is having one heck of a day...she starts out receiving an email from a deranged person she assumes a killer that shows a picture of a severed ear...then she gets a call about a body in the bay and when she gets there an endangered turtle is in harms way b/c he is connected to the dead body....by the time she gets back to the office she is late for court on a major court case she is testifying in and the judge is ticked! She is fined then testifies and another body is found and another....by the end of the day it just keeps getting worse.  I don't want to give to much away or spoil anything but it is pretty lively.  It had a few slow parts but for a 462 pg book I think it could have been done in 400 and that would have removed the extras.  But overall it was very good, this was my first Patricia Cornwell book and it wont be my last, my mom said her earlier Kay Scarpetta novels are even better as this is #20.  If you like forensic science try it out.  I gave it a healthy 4* Stars.
B000W967UQ|5.0|I enjoy Terry Pratchett's work and this is one of my favorites. This book centers on Death and his new apprentice, Mort, and is seriously funny. My only problem with this book is that it is too short
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Have loved this book since I was a child,never get sick of reading it . Has a very powerful message.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was a great book! The ending was a perfect cliff hanger, and i can't wait for the next book to hit the store.
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|After playing 10 games to get a decent feel for the game, I doubt I will play it again.<br /><br />Graphics are adequate for the task.<br /><br />The AI only presents a challenge due to its blatant cheating, but that is a fairly common problem - though one that shouldn't exist in a game this simple.<br /><br />Absence of any sort of in-game help beyond the severely lacking Tutorial mode is a big negative.<br /><br />None of the negatives are thing that couldn't potentially be fixed in an update though.<br /><br />As a Free AP, I am content with it. Had I payed the regular price I would be disappointed.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was great, it was interesting with the new twist Riordan put in this one, but all around a fantastic book. BUY IT!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This app can be a pain to install, however, don't let that stop you from trying it out. I have kindle fire hd 7&quot; i have it working perfectly atm. Ihave not been able to get it go install correctly on my Electrify M yet but haven't tried but like twice. I have this game on Xbox and it is exactly the same. They did a grear job with the graphics and touch controls.<br />Please don't let install issues keep you from playing this...the best card game on any platform.<br /><br />Problems:<br />It can DL and tell you there isn't enough space. When you try to delete it, it does not free up any memory. If that happens, use a file explorer app and select your device. you can find the file manually (it was easy to find since it was like 1.2gb) and delete it. You are using a smart phone or something with the amazon app, open the &quot;app data&quot; on the amazon app and hit &quot;clear data&quot;(you will notice it says like 1.2gb or more)Then try to DL the game again. It took me 3 tries before it DL<br />correctly. That seems to be the worst issue. The game itself is flawless.<br />  You are able to pay the regular campaign only on the free version. It is worth buying for$10 imo because of the sealed deck feature. Also you can bluetooth with friends.
0385742886|3.0|I enjoyed the subject matter very much.  I love these types of stories.  However, I did not enjoy this book very much. See, I am well past my teens and 20's. But I still love to read. And I love this type of subject matter.  This book was written for the \\"Youth Market\\".  Based on the writing and prose style, this book was written for 14 and 15 year olds.  And there is nothing wrong with that. I encourage young people to read. I just wish they composed these types of subject matter for adults.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|I listen to this while working and while doing homework. Nothing beats feeling like I'm on a grand adventure defending the human race while I'm plowing through my math homework. Thank you Two Steps From Hell for producing this great work of art!
B008JFUR10|5.0|For the kid inside who grew up watching Power Rangers, old Godzilla films, and mashing Megazord and Transformers action figures together for hours on end Pacific Rim is a dream come true.<br /><br />The back-story of the film is covered in the first few minutes of the film.  It can be summarized as: A dimensional rift has opened at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and giant monsters known as Kaiju have begun pouring out, attacking coastal cities (the \\"Pacific Rim\\") with the sole purpose of eradicating human life.  When our conventional weapons failed all the world's governments came together to create the Jaegers, giant robots controlled by two pilots who are neurologically linked to their  Jaeger and each other, working in unison to fight the threat.<br /><br />From here we get the set up for one of the most spectacular action movies of the last ten years.<br /><br />Pacific Rim is refreshingly light, not carrying any pretension to bog down its subject matter.  If you hadn't guessed, the story is fairly typical, and the characters are archetypes, but I feel the way they are handled in this film is to its own benefit.  It works in the same way your favorite cartoons growing up worked.  Sometimes it seems people forget that archtypes have survived so long for a good reason, and in the case of Pacific Rim it helps us understand each and every character without ever going to deep into their personal back stories.  It is clearly designed as being an introduction to this genre.<br /><br />Mixing humor with spectacular action Guillermo del Toro has nailed everything this genre has needed on the big screen.  The action is perfect, the concept is treated with reverence.  All of it is familiar yet new at the same time. Every time one of the Jaegers enters the screen it is treated with respect that makes you the viewer feel as if you'd grown up with these characters.  I lost count of how many times my jaw dropped during this movie.  It really was a childhood dream brought to life.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro has been personal favorite director of mine for years.  At the age of 13 I saw Hellboy on HBO and became so infatuated with the characters, and the director's visual style that I'd watch it every time it was on before ultimately getting the DVD (theatrical and Director's Cut) and spending hours going over the special features.  Hellboy, simply put, was fun.  And that was del Toro with a budget of $66 million ($82 mil if you want to factor in inflation).  Now with a budget pushing $200 million Pacific Rim allows Guillermo del Toro to deliver one of the grandest, most visually captivating movies of the last five years.<br /><br />Now, I'm sure some people are going to compare Pacific Rim to Michael Bay's Transformers movies.  Don't.  To compare the two is to insult the hard work of Guillermo del Toro.  Pacific Rim respects its subject matter, it respects that its audience members are people who grew up with these kinds of stories, or are children who may wind up looking up to the film for years to come.  This is a great director cutting loose and wanting to not only make a fun movie, but one that appeals to the inner child of countless individuals.  It is not a shameless cash grab made by cynical Hollywood executives.  In short: This is what the Transformers movies should have been.<br /><br />If you are a parent and have children around the age of 10 or older you need to take them to this movie.  If you are an adult who still remembers the wonder of Saturday morning cartoons and action figures you owe yourself a ticket to Pacific Rim.  You won't regret it.ife.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro has been personal favorite director of mine for years.

B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is unlike any of Daft Punk's previous albums. Whereas their previous stuff was techno, I would classify this album as electro-funk. My favorite part is the pronounced guitar parts featured in many of their tracks. Daft Punk has proven themselves not only to be top-of-the-line electronic artists, but also amazing musical producers. Bravo.
B00D6MJOAQ|3.0|Downbeat and moody just like BOC fans like it. Not as distinctive as Music as a Right to Children but that's expected. A good antidote on your headphones for overly cheerful electronic tunes.
1177985772|3.0|I bought this book thinking it would be in French, because the \\"look inside\\" is in French, but no! is in English (sadly)... but is ok, the book is amazing :), but is not in French.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was A very intense book, very well written.  It was intriguing as he explained the brain and how it works and while telling of his experience in the afterlife as he lay in a coma.
0345803493|5.0|I was very happy with my book. I received it a day after I order it which was amazing. The book was as good as the first one.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I would start to download some thing then a message would come back to me saying that it had crashed.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|I expected more from Tom Cruise - but about halfway through I realized - it was Tom Cruise Production - and I think he wanted to keep the cost down -  I always like Duvall, he was the only good actor in my opinion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great for all ages. Great graphics, and keeps u busy. I like how u can win things from the minigame so u don't haveto buy extras

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Any animal lover would just love this. Get, it's free and fun. Buy horses, train them enter them in  competitions,take pictures of them, groom them,etc. There's so much to do and see. Get!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|What is apart of our imaginations and what is reality? Do the two ever mingle? The world through the eyes of a child is extraordinary. This book questions what we see in our day to day lives and asks the question, did I dream this or be this? Great novel!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's think it's the best app that has been in the appstore games and the electric company has also been in the best of all the electric company has
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is an amazing puzzle game. Addictive and truly requires attention and thinking. Reminds me of the game Myst. Highly eager to see the next room!
8866137480|4.0|its nice and stands out. i didnt get the one pictured, hence the four stars. : (<br />I received \\"The world is filled with mondays.\\" planner with charlie and lucy.<br />the texture is nice and with my clammy hands i was able to get a good grip.<br />will be using this for fall term. i like how one side is dedicated to the week and the other is for notes.
1451695195|5.0|I choose 5 Stars! because this<br />book has proven to be a real<br />inspiratin to me during a hard<br />time.. the veil between life and<br />death is a thin one and this<br />proves this.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I laughed, cried, learned and inhaled this book like a great adventure novel. There are many times in your life when the choices you make define who you are and will become. Stepping stones that are sometimes smooth and often razor sharp. We all make mistakes and many haunt us for a long time, until we realize the impact of cause and effect. Some stay with us for a long time. This book is the bible of entrepreneurship, expressed by a writer who believes in the magic inside all of us to find heath and happiness by making shifts in the way we think and act. And he is kind enough to share a roadmap, which starts to work pretty quickly. When the ideas start popping, the fog lifts and behind that unhappy smile is belief in yourself to succeed on your own terms. James' honesty is connective tissue for anyone who has lost and failed and needs a gentle push back to a brighter perspective. Will recommend this book to everyone I care about.
B009R659L8|5.0|I have truly enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it to others.  I believe this is one of Mary Higgins Clark's best books.
B003Y059EK|2.0|I'll keep my opinion short! This film is not cute for youngsters. TOTAL 180 degrees from the actual WOZ w/ Judy Garland. I would show my grandkids the actual WOZ & stop. This film might have been better for me if I was on some kind of drug or heavily drinking alcohol. Rent...if you must.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I just started this game, but so far I really like it. You can purchase upgrades, but it seems like you can still do a lot with having to spend money. It has great graphical is an easy game to understand.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Book is good, not great. Again in person she is a riot ! Wildly talented.  The book did have some great moments, says the ex Gov. of Alaska....
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I waited for my local store so I can buy this album, and what do you know?????  they didn't have it.  Amazon to the rescue.  I was able to get the album in both digital and hard copy.  Awesome.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Good to see quickly how much battery is left before I have to run the Kindle to a charger.  Very helpful.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Saw the movie first. Purchased the trilogy. No-one saw me for days! Glad I finally finished it, I was running out of quiet places to hide so I could read!
140006922X|2.0|I will finish the book, most likely, because it's interesting. it's not approvable as a dissertation. I haven't read a lot but am distracted by mistakes like Aslan's assertion that the Zealots arose around the the Temple resistance in the latter half of the 1st century. He also claims that Jerusalem was called Aeolia Capitolina after Vespasian's triumph (it was 60 years later under Hadrian). He says that Jesus \\"the Christ\\" began with John Mark in 70CE (Pauline epistles use the term extensively and they were written in the 50s).<br /><br />His preface says that this is the fruit of 20 years of research which is something I cannot buy.<br /><br />For anyone who knows little about the 1st century, just be prepared for some exciting fiction a la The Davinci Code, which I also enjoyed, once I could overcome the offensiveness of the fantasy.<br /><br />It's remarkable that still today a scholar is incredulous over nonviolent resistance. I attribute this to ignorance of history and purchase of dominant narratives.<br /><br />And now we find that Aslan promotes the book by misrepresenting his credentials. How does that give any credibility to his \\"research?\\"<br />[...]
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Kept my attention throughout all the seasons.  Wish there were more!!  I loved admiring all the costumes.  Have gotten many ideas to making my next Victorian costume.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely! It was very entertaining watching the &#34;old guys & gal&#34; do the impossible! The performances were impressive! Great Fun! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to escape and enjoy themselves for a little while without reality interfering.
B00B04NJI0|3.0|Do not watch if easily offended. No holds barred stories. Indie arthouse film making. All subjects involve death. 26 segments from various directors. Plenty of sex, violence, nudity and swearing. Cert 18. I do like the girls in story L and Q. Story F was funny and bizarre. You might also like Movie 43. There is another anthology with 5 min films. You'll need to google to find it. Also see horror V/H/S out on dvd.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|This is exactly what I hoped it would be, Phil going absolutely crazy!  It's pretty extreme and reminds me Today is the Day for some reason.  A+
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I was looking for a new game to play and saw this one.  I played it and became addicted to it right away.  For being free, it's not too bad.  Graphics are elementary and would make the game a little more exciting if they were improved.  But I love it and enjoy playing it.  Definitely worth trying.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I am a huge fan of the Shopaholic series and the other Kinsella books.  They always make me laugh.  This one falls short of the mark.  It made me uncomfortable as the characters went too far,  and the end was totally predictable.  I was disappointed nd not really entertained.  I also bought &#34;I've Got Your Number&#34;. I hope that one is better.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|J. Lawrence is great. good story and well acted all around. I feel this movie deserved the awards it received.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|keeps you thinking.  loved the different combinations of numbers, symbols, and colors for solving the clues.  can't wait for new rooms to be added.
B0031GUR44|1.0|As others have commented, the blade does not fit the mounting point, and it's not even the right size for my '11 GTI. Even Bosch's own website lists this as the part number for it, incorrectly. I'm very happy with the replacement front AeroTwins, but this has to be returned and I will be heading down to the dealer for the rear blade.
B0094K1K8I|1.0|Hard to believe this home-video recording of \\"scary\\" stuff is still popular.  Most of this one shows video of children sleep walking.  Pop-ups and loud noises make for most of the fright.
B00BE97ONM|1.0|This is not my kind of book. I love mysteries, thrillers, and the like. But I personally did not think this one was tastefully written. I couldn't even get through the first few pages without hating it. I read maybe three of four pages about a stripper, and some drunk guy peeing before deciding this was not the kind of book for me. I mean, if you're cool with reading that stuff, have at it. But I'm not one for reading stuff like that, so that's why I'm giving it such a low rating
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this game every day. I think you should get it to,you get updates all the time spent it's like the computer version or pc minecraft. Now there's online mutiplayer and buckets + cake and even they save your stuff when you disconnect! I REALLY<br />THINK YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Absolutely love this product.  It came in just a few days.  Reasonably priced. Will consider ordering this type of product again in the future.  Very pleased.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I have played alot of g5games probably three quaters of them so far and this one was okay . They have better games alot better. This game was just alot of hidden object and not enough puzzles included which makes these games fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like to play with horses and if you like horses you should get this awesome game. You can change your name or keep it as Beauty. It is really fun!!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I really like David Baldacci. I'm really getting into mystery/crime stories these days. The Camel Club series is very good. I like all the characters and always like the author's way of keeping the story moving along with little surprises. Camel Club characters are believable, and interesting. They aren't all young athletic gorgeous types. They are people I can relate to. I guess because I'm not young and athletic. I am gorgeous though :-)
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It was fun and cool but after a while it wouldn't play any more which sucks cause I liked it
B0053ZOQMK|4.0|I liked the story line of this movie, as it would actually work with my hero unit for school.  There were moments that I felt were more adult than kid, jokes that might be a little inappropriate for the young, but other than that, a pretty enjoyable film.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Awesome session of the book makes me feel smart and educate and reading this words will help me in 7th grade
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Anybody that uses google search on their computer can use this app.  I use it on my Kindle Fire<br /> for ease of use on the web.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very addicting and absorbing. Looks and sounds great. Challenging but not frustratingly so. The hints don't give too much away either.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Never played magic before, even in high school in the nineties when everyone at lunch was. Something about this free trial made me want to give it a shot. Totally worth my time!
B0013KTGAG|3.0|I watched \\"Sunshine\\" with high hopes, as it has been compared often to \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" which certainly is an acquired taste, but once that taste is acquired, that movie becomes meditative and even transformative--it uses speculative science as a means by which to explore philosophy and the meaning of life.  And somehow it pulls it off.  \\"Sunshine\\" does not.<br /><br />But most movies don't, so what's the problem?  Well, \\"Sunshine\\" was directed in such a way that it looks like a cinematic cousin to \\"2001,\\" and in the beginning, its premise suggests that the astronauts aboard the sun-bound space ship are as much on personal spiritual journeys as they are literally hoping to hurtle close enough to the sun to launch a nuclear device into it.  I don't have a problem with suspending scientific sense if there is an authentic philosophical payoff--but once the journey is sent off course to investigate a ship that disappeared years earlier, the story doesn't only fall apart, but it becomes shreds of different stories that the writer and director never find a way to piece together.  I won't go into the specifics, but in the end, the movie becomes a laughable, groanable mess.  I had to remind myself to enjoy the stunning visual effects (They really deserve to envelop a better movie.) toward the end, but I was able to do so because they are so well conceived.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of people would argue that comparing this to another iconic space movie is pointless and bound to be fruitless, but it's impossible for this viewer not to do so; the director obviously (and overtly) borrows a great deal of direction from Stanley Kubrick, perhaps as an homage, and the premise seems comparable enough to warrant comparisons.  But where the mysteries of space and human beings' place in it drives 2001, and that mystery is solved, in a way, by Kubrick forcing his viewer to go on a hard-won visual journey, Sunshine starts off exploring the final frontier, drops in Freddy Kreuger halfway through, and then just throws the whole thing into the incinerator.halfway through, and then just throws the whole thing into the incinerator.
0385342071|4.0|This was a fun, light-hearted book for the beach. I thought it was slow in parts and would have preferred more romance between the two, but enjoyed the book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a really fun game. I was never really a fan of horses until I started playing this game. 5 stars for me woot woot!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its like so awesome its kind of like subway surfers only better people should really get it cause its soooo fun
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Truly the best rock documentary I have ever seen! It is very well done and offers so much cool rock history! Dave grohl is amazing!

B004A5EWZK|5.0|This arrived just when said it would and I loved the movie.<br />A must see for everyone that loves history.
B000002MZ9|4.0|I picked up Mirror Ball when this first came out and listened to it for the first time in a few years today. Interestingly, this album has aged well and still sounds fresh when comparing it to today's harder rocking bands. Pearl Jam may not have the sloppy brilliance of Crazy Horse but their sound complements Neil very well on this album. No classics here but several strong tracks as the driving \\"Act of Love\\" and \\"Big Green Country\\" kick all sorts of tail while the slower \\"Truth Be Known\\" and \\"Peace of Love\\" have those slow melodic lead guitar lines that have become a Neil Young trademark. The closest Neil or Pearl Jam come to their best stuff is on the grinding \\"Scenery\\" which has the long jamming ala Crazy Horse and an organ trying to emerge from the mix. Other solid tracks include the opener \\"Song X\\" and \\"Throw Your Hatred Down\\". \\"Downtown\\" was the single and is the album's only misstep, sounding like a second rate rewrite of the glorious \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown\\" from Tonight's The Night. All told, Mirror Ball is a very solid album as well as a successful collaboration.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|The app will not let me see pictures posted! It gets really irritating but other then that it seems to work fine.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Finally a game that is fun to play and not costly.<br />Beautiful graphics and just all around a great game. Would recommend to anyone.
B005HSL626|5.0|We pay on Kinect. Great exercise, plus at ths end if every session we get some fruit facts. Good game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing game...very addictive. My 6 year old can play it almost better than me its that easy but challenging enough to be fun without becoming boring
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game. It's never blurry and you get to take care of as many horses as you want
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This Anker was recommended to me by several friends and I have to agree with their satisfaction of it. I have only played with this a bit, but I love the versatility and portability of it. I purchased this to help with playing Ingress and it's been perfect. It charges my Note 2 very quickly and I get about 3 additional charges out of it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love this show it has everything hot men and strong women. It also has an exciting plot as well, always loved Nathan and he is amazing as castle. I do recommend this show and the DVD is great I now own every season and waiting for season 5 DVD and excited for season 6 to start in September yay !!!!
B004Y6MIXS|5.0|The signal quality on this device is good even when the reception bars are at one or two. Meaning top speeds even with low signal strength. Both good things if you live in a city with lots of noise from other networks or in the wilderness with lots of trees absorbing all that signal quality.<br /><br />The AR9271 chip has a lot of support available in Linux and drivers for it are constantly being developed. In most Linux distros its plug and play. Even for the more advanced security analysis tools it works right out of the box in Ubuntu, Kali Linux (Debian based), Backbox (Ubuntu based) and Linux Mint. In Windows use the ALFA driver from their website. Not the one on the CD because it doesn't work nearly as well. Do not use any other driver then the one on the ALFA website and expect it to work well. I'm guessing 90% of the bad reviews are because of using the wrong drivers.<br /><br />Technical aspects;<br />You can run this adapter up to 630mw with some work in Linux and a Y USB cable or Powered USB hub without a Y USB cable but it doesn't make much difference in signal strength for this chipset. You're much better off buying a 14dBi+ antenna if you're looking to pull in some really long range signals but it is a safe bet with even a 7dBi Panel Antenna you will pull in excellent signal strength with a little directional effort. The newer revision of this device runs on the AR9271L-AL3A chip vs AR9271-AL1A. See here for even more technical jargon about this change [...] The TXpower is handled by the SE2576L chip so the change to a lower power draw chip version has no effect essentially other then a cooler, quieter AR9271 chip that doesn't require as much power to do the same job.<br /><br />The device got a little warm so I bought some tiny 20pcs Heatsinks for it. Stuck them on the two hot chips; SE2576L and the AR9271 chip. However it is entirely unnecessary to do this. I just like to keep my devices cool as possible and EM shielded as possible.<br /><br />All andall I am very pleased with this device. Reliable connection with low ping and lots of bandwidth to spare.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love looking through the different rooms to find the hidden clues needed to open the door to escape to the next room.  Enjoy the decorum of each room.
0345529057|5.0|I BOUGHT THESE BOOKS BECAUSE OF THE SHOW ON HBO AND I HAVE TO SAY THEY ARE AMAZING AND HAVE MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THE FAMILIES AND GO INTO MORE ACTION THEN THE SHOW WILL ALLOW. 100% SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE.

159463176X|4.0|I found it difficult to keep track of all the people involved, it was a good story and the ending was interesting.<br />I wish people could be kinder to each other. I enjoyed reading all of Khaled Hosseini's books
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Some complain that that the story is not &#34;true&#34; to the book in every respect. Well it's film - what do you expect? Unless they made this a 4 DVD collection for this movie and added Hobbit dinner smell-a-vision what do you expect? I bought the 3D version after seeing it in the theater. Great movie and good home 3D movie fun.
B007YJS7G4|5.0|This movie was completely and totally riveting. I could not pull myself away from it for one minute.<br />The actors were superb, the directing marvelous, and the plot, and storyline, compelling, and remarkable.<br />I truly can not understand why it was not considered for an Oscar. That is just a real shame, however, this movie will<br />give generations to come, a real view of what really happened in our nations' history. Bravo!
B003VANOFY|2.0|Overall sound quality and battery life are great with these headphones. The only reason i returned them was the wireless connectivity was wonky and made the microphone break up while playing games. I was somewhat prepared for this because i had read reviews explaining this issue so i returned them for the chorded G35 model.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I found this movie to be a very good one indeed. Not only did I learn a bit about the numbers in baseball, but, I was also made<br />aware, that you can even use mathematics in putting together a strategy for a winning formula in the big leagues.
140053271X|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE NEW NOOK.  GREAT LONG BATTERY LIFE AND EASIER TO USE .  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.

0670026603|5.0|I couldn't put this sweet and unusual love story down, and it stayed with me for days after I finished it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book is nothing like the movie. Very different and thought provoking. No explicit violence, blood or horror.  A good read!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is fun, even though I got stuck on a level or two and had to take a break and come back after a bit.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I've been waiting so long for this album and I'm so happy that it's finally here. It's a great show of Hanson's abilities. Every album has a unique sound but is still great in every way. What a talented trio!
0307352153|5.0|This is an incredible book; totally validating for those of us who are introverts. Cain's research is exhaustive and illustrated that this wasn't some psychobabble by a new theorist.<br /><br />Cain takes the historical approach to `how America turned into the land of the Extrovert.' In fact, business and industry have turned it into the ideal.<br /><br />After explaining the differences between the introvert and the extrovert in the light of the latest psychological and neuroscience research, Cain shows what the introvert brings to the table. Everyone in business doesn't have to be an extrovert - and Cain proves it through real-life examples.<br /><br />I feel the strongest part of the book is the light she places on introverted children and how to help them accept their differences, help them strategize their difficulties (classrooms are mostly set up for group activities; this constant togetherness is hard on introverted children) and become successful people.<br /><br />Cain also spends time with parents, helping them understand how they can help their introverted children to shine. She gives examples of extroverted parents with introverted children and extroverted children with introverted parents. I only wish this book were around when I was a kid; my aunt constantly took my book away and made me \\"go out and have fun.\\"<br /><br />I feel that Cain's message is uplifting: Even though Americans are mostly extroverts, introverts can make their mark by accepting their unique gifts and giving themselves the quiet time they need to think.
B00B4804KS|5.0|This looked utterly amazing.  The 3D didn't make me sick, and I usually always get sick during 3D movies!  I recommend watching it using passive 3D, akin to LG's system...so fantastic.  There wasn't a single point in the film that was done poorly with 3D!  It even looked like it was originally shot in 3D!

B002JWD6AS|5.0|Years ago wolves dragged young Grace off her tire swing into the woods, nearly killing her until one yellow-eyed wolf put a stop to it. The yellow-eyed wolf has watched from the woods behind her house ever since. Years later an animal attack incites a hunting party. Terrified for her wolf, Grace tries to stop it and nearly fails. But a nude boy with yellow eyes and a gunshot wound appears on her porch.<br /><br />This story featured clean, often lyrical writing. The main characters were identifiable. And the author put a unique twist on werewolf lore. I found myself crying at the end of this sweet love story. I rarely give out five stars but this one earned it--even with a male lead described as \\"fragile\\". That said, I'm hesitant to pick up the other books in the trilogy because this one ended so perfectly.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Just finizhed level 10, if there are no more levels I am going to be very  disappointed in the game.  Otherwise I enjoyed it.
1932907009|1.0|Pauline Kael published her film reviews in collections that she titled with words or phrases that suggested seduction: \\"When the Lights Go Down,\\" \\"I Lost It at the Movies, \\"Reeling,\\" etc.  Why?  Because an original story seduces; it slowly pulls you in and never lets go.  Something familiar cannot seduce; it only hammers you over the head or smirks at you.  Movies made in cookie-cutter fashion can be entertaining.  But they also can be instantly forgettable.  \\"Save the Cat\\" is aimed -- cynically -- at producers and studio execs who lack the instinct to spot a story that is original and commercial.  When these people embrace such a how-to book, they are admitting that they need their ass saved, not enlightened.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its a great app. it helps kill time in a very brain storming way. i just love it. so addicted to this game. i cant give anything less than 5 stars. everyone should try playing this.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Quartet is Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut. It's a gentle tale, beautifully made, of life at a home for retired musicians. The problems and challenges of growing old are not glossed over but throughout you see the dignity in arthritic fingers and voices that are not what they used to be.<br /><br />Throughout it all is the music, because the home is getting ready for their annual fund-raising gala. So music rings from beginning to end as you see the residents practicing and auditioning.<br /><br />Into this closed and charming world comes Jean, an operatic soprano who has come upon hard times. She was married once to one of the residents, Reg, and famously sang in Rigoletto with him and two of the other residents (the Quartet of the title). Maggie Smith plays Jean and it's a wonderful performance. You expect Jean to be diva-like in every aspect of her life. Certainly the first scenes with her lead you to this impression. But Smith plays her with depth and gentleness and humility that makes her a wonderful center for the film.<br /><br />It's a quiet comedy of manners, full of music and wonderful performances.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It gives you enough challenge where its gets your mind working but also doesn't piss you off BC you can't fight it out. I can not wait till they make more levels. LOVE IT

B00CMQX84A|5.0|My grandchildren and I watched this movie tonite on the Disney Channel.  We all loved it.<br /><br />It is reminiscent of the Grease Movie with all the wonderful dancing and singing, and 50's clothing.  But it is cleaner, and more family oriented.<br /><br />We love Ross Lynch, and think he is a role model. We love seeing him on Austin and Ally and watch every week. I love watching his brothers and sister and him play and sing music, great talents and seem to have a wonderful family life.  It is nice to see kids that are real role models and not ones that are made to seem that way by press agents but in reality have real issues.<br /><br /> We enjoyed seeing Maia Mitchell in this movie and thought she was charming.  She made the movie a lot of fun and did a great job as a actress. She brought a element to the movie that really endeared her to the audience.  Hope to see her in other movies.<br /><br />This is just a fun movie, especially for girls, and I think it will be a classic.  Long time since I saw a good beach movie, and my remembrances are Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon and all the stars from those times, this movie reminds  me a lot of those movies.  Just lighthearted fun and light romance.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, recommend it, and think it will be fun, especially for young elementary school girls and preteens.<br /><br />Not often we see clean, family oriented movies that contain a bit of adventure, a smidgen of romance, and lots of great songs and dance moves.<br /><br />We want to watch it again and again, so we are ordering it tonight.
B002J32IQK|2.0|So i read the massive 1200 page IT. I think I need to go back to it again a little later because I just didnt relate it. I dont see how this is one of King's best? So much backstory, I couldnt wait to get to the end of the chapter so I can take a break because most of this book felt like a chore to read. The first 50 pages or so are great and I was pumped for this book....then it fell flat. The problem was I went into thinking this was going to be a real scary monster story and I didnt feel it. Pennywise seemed to be a minor character where I thought he would play a bigger role in this book. I at times felt this was a children's fable and I was just to adult for monsters thats weakness is sneeze powder and turtles. I also have to mentioned the 11 year olds having an orgy....totally not needed and a major turn off. I'm a liberal person and dont mind sex scenes but not with children. That part was uncomfortable to read. Like I said I'm going to give it one more shot down the line, but, I just cant recommend this book to anyone. Its long, boring and childish in the fact that IT is not scary.
B00BHU2A7I|1.0|This is a lousy movie. I would not recommend it to anyone. The acting is terrible and Anthony Hopkins is terrible as Hitchcock and the movie is very boring. I'm glad I didn't get it new or pay full price!

One adult was moved by<br />the scene with the little girl grabbing the man's leg and asking why she was going back to the orphanage.  She had been a Foster<br />Parent and that had happen to her. The case worker had come and taken the kids with out a reason. I want about 10 minions to help around the house. You fall in love with the characters in the film and look forward to the next film.

038542471X|4.0|The Client is one of the best examples of the 'legal thriller' novels that made the author John Grisham a household name.  Not only was The Client a compelling novel, but the book was quickly made into a [[ASIN:B001AIW3FG major motion picture]] starring Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />I discovered Grisham late in his career and found his legal thrillers such good stories that I wanted to read them all.  However, the Brooklyn Public Library did not have any copies of this book in its system.  To get a copy of the book to read, I had to request an inter-library loan.  The version of the book that I just read was the first edition hardcover that was issued when Grisham first released the book in 1993.  Alternately, you can buy a cheap mass-market paperback version of the book from Amazon.  People don't buy Grisham's novels to keep, but for the convenience of reading them.<br /><br />Many of the scenes in the book were familiar because they were tricks that Grisham has used in his other novels.  The following scenes from The Client are what I consider Grisham trademarks: he pokes fun at lawyers whose first name is an initial (such as F. Lee Bailey), he believes `ambulance chasers' are phonies and makes wry remarks about them (such as Gill Teal - he's for real), he has an eye for the nameless ladies who improve the scenery (such as the court stenographer with the short skirt) and he does not trust the FBI to keep secrets or protect their witnesses.<br /><br />Even if you saw the movie a long time ago, you might still recognize other scenes from The Client.  Who can forget the opening scene in the woods where Michael keeps flipping off the cover of the exhaust-pipe of Romey's car?  Reggie's bust of the FBI agents for improper questioning of Michael Sway was as theatrical to read as it was to watch.  The pizza-ordering gag for Detective Meathead, a nickname that probably had its roots in Archie Bunker, has also made the rounds.<br /><br />While Grisham makesheroes out of some lawyers, he actually pokes fun at more lawyers than he lionizes.  The star-crossed lawyer Reggie Love is one of the heroes of the story.  Some remarks are made about her having a man's name, but Reggie is a common nickname for Regina, as is Sam for Samantha, Jackie for Jacqueline, or Andy for Andrea. This novel has the underlying theme of gender bias that tend to occur in predominantly-masculine professions such as the law, or science, or investment banking.<br /><br />The reader will know after reading the first ten pages of the book whether the 11-year old Mark Sway found out from Jerome Clifford where Barry the Blade hid the body of Senator Boyd Boyette.  This mystery drives the story - the police think Mark knows, the FBI thinks Mark knows, and the mafia thinks Mark knows where the body is buried.  This story is a new angle on the age-old riddle, `If a tree falls in the forest when there is no one else around, does it make a noise?'<br /><br />Grisham loyalists will remember F. Denton Voyles, the top Fibbie, from The Pelican Brief and [[ASIN:0440245923 The Firm]].  The action of the novel primarily occurs in Memphis, but there are significant scenes in New Orleans.  Some refer to these locations as the 'Southern Comfort Zone' of John Grisham.  Grisham's best novels were located in Southern towns such as Memphis, New Orleans, Jacksonville, or the fictional town of Clanton, MS.<br /><br />Grisham can write an eight-page chapter that you can read in ten minutes.  Nevertheless, Grisham could even improve his readability by making better use of pronouns.  He will occasionally use pronouns with indefinite antecedents or unclear antecedents, which might cause the reader to read a sentence several times to figure out its meaning.<br /><br />On page 379, Grisham wrote `Leo kicked at the rocks beneath his feet. If Barry had told them about the gravel floor, he didn't remember it.'  He probably refers to Leo, but maybe he is Barry or even someone else mentioned in a previous sentence.  'It' also lacks clarity for reasons that will be elaborated upon in the next two examples.  On page 381, Grisham wrote `This is a wonderful place to get mugged, she thought to herself, but didn't mention it.'  `It' is an unclear and unmentioned antecedent probably referring to her thought that this is a wonderful place to get mugged.  When pronouns replace phrases, particularly phrases that are never actually written, they lose their effectiveness.  Grisham used a similarly-structured sentence on p398, `He said something smart about the hour of day, but thought better of it.'  It probably refers to saying something smart about the time of day.<br /><br />Everyone makes mistakes with unclear pronouns because we tend to write as we speak.  Indefinite pronouns are less of an issue in dialogue, because we can ask the speaker to clarify the ambiguity.  Such assumptions are harder to make with the written word and impossible to clarify.  All three sentences that I mentioned were sentences that I had to read twice or three times.  I am sure that there were other readers who stumbled over at least one of those three aforementioned sentences with ambiguous pronouns.<br /><br />Other authors serve as better examples for the craft of telling a story - using proper grammar, good style and clarity.  Grisham offers great examples of the art of telling a story. If you thumb through the reviews of Grisham's novels, many readers will tell you that they could not put the book down. Any writer who can command the kind of attention that readers afford Grisham has considerable and enviable gifts of storytelling.that readers afford Grisham has considerable and enviable gifts of storytelling.

B008JFUR10|3.0|For those raving about Pacific Rim, due to better CGI and overall technology, it is definitely the best monster movie this summer. However, the acting wasn't that good and the overall story was lacking. They even had a few awkward moments that made me almost want to look away. Rinko Kikuchi's character had quite a few awkward moments and the little girl portraying the young version of her character, even though she only had a really short scene, the whole way through was filled with overacting and bad directing. The ending battle was rather weak, especially compared to the one in the middle of the movie (the one shown throughout all of the different movie trailers). On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this movie around a 7 or 7.5. Anybody that says this movie is a 10 is a blind fanboy. Beyond awesome monster battles, mediocre story and mediocre to poor acting. I don't understand why they even bother introducing the other bots in the movie, waste of time since there's only one bot that did 80%+ of the battle or so...

B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is my third Michael Connelly book, and the first that I have read (listened to, actually) that starred defense lawyer Mickey Haller. The narrator did a fantastic job reading the book, and I loved how he gave the characters the type of gritty voices that were oftentimes required (such as for biker Cisco and his bruising associates). For my money, these characters were layered with much depth and interesting personalities, and I particularly enjoyed how Mickey struggles with the ethics of his profession (walking clients who are potentially guilty of murder), no matter how indifferent he may project his appearance to be to others.<br /><br />The courtroom drama itself is really fast paced and interesting, making a couple of my days at work fly right by. There are plenty of twists and turns, and Connelly once more proves himself to be superbly adept at the art of misdirection. A fun, fast read- I give it five stars!

B0060YIBLK|3.0|This book serves as a good review of how not to be manipulated by someone looking to gain information or a favor. If you start hearing the techniques presented in this book from a stranger, your defense mechanisms should be on high alert. I like friendly conversation to a point, but thinking there isn't an agenda associated with a person taking that much interest in you is more than likely a mistake. The phrase &#34;con artist&#34; comes to mind. Having a friendly conversation is one thing. Starting a conversation with the intent to gain information from someone without him or her knowing hinges on unethical. Managing expectations is correct. Don't let someone's feigned interest in you cause you to lower your guard. Always be cautious when approached by a stranger interested in &#34;talking&#34; with you at length.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best Book Ever! I have read it twice now and I still felt the same emotions for when I read it the first time.<br />If you having read it yet find a book and read read read.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game so so so so much it keeps me up all night instead of going to sleep!!!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book really recommend if you love drama action and romance. Read it you won't be sorry at all :)!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love this game SO much and wish I could let it last longer! But to do that I have to buy the whole game and it costs 3$ so that is kind of the end.I think the whole game should be free.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is nice and cool stuff ,I have some more games like this and there awesome just like this that is why I am rating this.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game it is fun and funny you should also try pou my friends love it and I do to
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I find my self playing this game till all hours in the night, especially when I don't get the 3 stars, I keep saying one more time.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|No matter how many Tosca recordings you own, you will want to add this to your collection! Superb production both vocally and dramatically.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love Mahjong.  This is an easy and fun product that I love taking with me every where.  If you like Mahjong here's another on that's on the go with you.  No more being tied to my computer.
B0039NK0LE|2.0|Someone eats dog crap. Yes, that's where this film had to go after Stiffler drank piss in American Pie 2 and Jim had sex with a pie in the original.<br /><br />The real shame in this one is that Stiffler is turned into a complete and utter child. In the others, he's almost believable as an immature high school kid, but in this one...he's intolerable.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is as you'd imagine it, minus some of the major players (Oz is the most glaringly absent).<br /><br />This is by far the worst entry into the series (not counting the direct to video entries, which I refuse to watch) - do yourself a favor, skip this one and go straight to American Reunion.
B00BAYLQI0|2.0|I'm not sure exactly why this movie has struck a chord with so many people. It tells the rather straightforward story of a Spanish family caught by a tsunami wave while vacationing in Thailand in 2004. The mother was seriously injured - her husband and 3 kids were not. Within a brief period of time, the mother was taken to a hospital and the rest of the family was reunited in fairly short order. Yes, there was an element of coincidence at play, but overall the outcome was not really in doubt - at least for cinematic purposes anyway. More distressing however, was the fascination the movie-makers had with showing graphic wounds - especially the mother's. I get it - she was hurt - no need to keep rubbing my face in it. For me that was a huge and unnecessary distraction. A little more attention should have been focused on writing a compelling script.
B008JFUR10|4.0|This movie is the epitome of the big, dumb, loud, entertaining as heck summer blockbuster.  The characters are cookie cutter, the dialogue is corny, but the actors seem to be having fun, and the robot on monster action (which, let's be honest, is why we wanted to watch Pacific Rim in the first place) is top notch.  The special effects in this movie are some of the best that I've ever seen on screen, and the 3D is actually decent.<br /><br />This is a fun (albeit forgettable) movie that you won't regret seeing, especially on the big screen.
B007SRLEFS|5.0|...true to him or herself. That's exactly who Glen is. This is one of my favorite (lps)! An example of what a great artist is, true to hisself in his words, music, @ life!!! No more needs to be said.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Personally to me, its the best mix between temple run and subway surfers. If your a fan of the movie, you'll love this game!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|With one update, they destroyed the one app that I used religiously on a daily basis. I agree with the others, not User friendly anymore. Switched to weather bug.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The previous app was more in my ball park  the update version  uh not so informative  at least in the map category. If I want videos  I will watch youtube
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Absolutely a great movie! Full of action with that usual Bruce Willis humor complimented with a few twists in the action to keep us all on our toes wondering what will happen next. A few unexpected twists along with Bruce Willis is whgat made tis an excellent movie. Definately work the money! I loved it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Doesn't require total focus so it's a good way to take a  break.  Time to complete doesn't  hook you into to playing too long unless you buy coins
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I am a huge Doctor Who fan. If you are a fan of Science Fiction with a penchant towards the quirky, Doctor Who is for you!

B009R659L8|5.0|Love the book.  The ending came too soon!!!  Wanted more of what happened to some of the family members, especially the murderer.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This set comes with all eight movies in [Blu-ray] format which is great! Glad that they also came with special features!!
B00E00OGE2|3.0|Even an old fart like me can appreciate animated films aimed at kids, so when my grown son and his wife decided it was time to take my 2 year old grandson to his first movie, I got to come along.  The youngster is fascinated with cars, speed, color and reckless behavior.  In other words a typical 2 year old boy.<br /><br />In this DreamWorks production, Turbo (Ryan Reynolds) is a snail fascinated by the Indianapolis 500.  His goal is to break the world record by covering a meter in a day or something.  His brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) tries to tell him he's not going to ever be fast, but Turbo isn't convinced and often rebels at his regular job of harvesting tomatoes.  In a freakish accident Turbo is ingested into the engine of a street drag racer and while circulating among the pistons, inhales a goodly amount of Nitro methane injected into the fuel line.  Magically, rather than by being killed, the poor mollusk takes on super snail speed.  Enough speed that he can keep up with Indy cars.<br /><br />With help from a Van Nuys taco bender named Tito (Michael Pena) and some obviously more hip snails he meets (Samuel L. Jackson, Snoop Dogg, Maya Rudolph, Michelle Rodriguez, and Mike Bell) off they go to register for the 500.  Once there he has to confront his hero and great French driver Guy Gagne (Bill Hader).  As you would expect they have a mighty duel for 500 miles and an unsurprising finish.<br /><br />\\"Turbo\\" is a bit light on adult humor but the kids are going to love it.  As for my grandson, he and I were pretty much on the same page.  When there was a lot of talking (human morals and expectations transferred to garden creatures) we were a bit antsy.  When the action is going on and the sound is everywhere, we were paying attention.  Seen with kids, the movie can be fun.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Love this series...great combo of comedy and drama...good special effects...great actors and character interaction/chemistry...sci fi vs science good mix...watch and love
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game. but you need to release the update soon. it is extremely hard to level up and beat levels.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Got to level 10 &amp; I couldn't finish.  Disappointed, wanted to keep playing.  If you can tell me how to finish it I would keep going &amp; keep the game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it!! great for all ages....I'm 25 and addicted to it!! And it's free....suggest you download it now! It's so fluffy!!
1580176941|3.0|The book arrived scuffed up. Was not as detailed as I thought, not too many guided pictures. Complete photo guid to cookie decorating is much better.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|Excellent teacher movie with a solid message of of the true meaning of discipline.<br />Recommended highly to teachers, students and athletes.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Thanks Justin and co. For a dynamic eclectic journey. Love Strawberry Bubblegum. Love that each and every sing is long and does not adhere to the rules. Collabs all terrific. Robin who?
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I use it in my bicycle shed, which has no electric hook up.  The light comes on at night when I open the shed doors and stays on while I am in the shed.  The light goes off when I leave and shut the doors.  The light is bright but could be brighter for my needs.
B00C061I3K|5.0|What a different gorgeous journey this cd takes you on. Faves include Within, both Pharell tunes, instant crush. This cd is very modern while throwing back to sounds and styles of the 80's.
1609611543|5.0|The book was well written and covered all of the affected systems in the body.  Evidence of findings was well documented.  I have  changed my diet though not completely - it's hard.
B00C8985DU|4.0|The packaging was good I liked all the extra books , but the CD's could've been packaged in a better way. (Easier to access)
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I am sure the geeks who created this are very good at software, but I am not. If they want a larger market they need to cater for my ignorance and design software that is idiot proof.
B009NPK1IO|3.0|Season 6 wasn't my favorite. I hate when series have to make the ending super perfect and I feel like that's the way the series ended. It was okay and I'd recommend watching it for hardcore GG fans out there, but I felt a bit cheated by S6.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This bookkeeper my attention from day one with the lively dialogue of the black slaves. The characters were very believable and I found myself growing attached to the characters. I also liked the way that the author told the story from the Pont of vie of
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game. Great fun and easy to use. Train journeys will never be the same again, just got to keep it away from my kids!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Loved this movie.  I'm a fan of anything that relates to the bible.  Made me tearful.  Loved the acting.  Perfect.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great. Replaced other alarm clock app with this one. I have had no problems with this app. It has been very reliable. :-)
B001TODCII|5.0|I have even bought Taken 2; great action movie.  Just love the action and the actors make it come alive.  Saw it in the movie theater and had to have it.<br /><br />All of my family and I have seen it over and over again.
B00APUQKJK|1.0|I actually went and re-watched the Theatrical Trailer because the movie is so different than the trailer! The movie is slooooooow and unappealing. I love avant guarde projects and I love films where nothing makes sense until the end of the movie, but the pace of this film combined with the bland expository make this about the worst movie I've ever sat through. The speed the vodka pours from a bottle into the glasses is the highlight of this movie.<br /><br />Had the sex scenes been X rated instead of the same bland PG monotone pace as all the scenes before and after... I might have given the movie 3 stars!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Great game! No need to spend the money if you're willing to grind it out. A great way to kill some time.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|This is a great product for preserving those old slides your parents (or grandparents) took years ago.  I like that slides can be put in and out of it very quickly and you can adjust the brightness as well as flip it or mirror it once you put the slide in.  I have not used it for negative strips yet, only for color negative slides and it did great for those.  I would like it better if the viewing screen was larger so I could better tell if I had slides with writing in them in backwards.  That would make it a 5.  Very good product for the price.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg is simply amazing. Her book opened up my eyes to how women are treated in the work place and in leadership positions overall.
B00AXVIHBU|4.0|I Loved this show especially Mary and Matthew! I hated the ending and will not watch next year! Hopefully Matthew will come back from the dead.
0060763280|5.0|I recently started reading this book and was blown away by it. it really opened my eyes about my own views on money and where they came from. Great book for people who want results!!
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Somehow, in all my SciFi reading I'd missed Kurt until just recently.  This is a really unusual book, not sure quite how to describe it however it's an entertaining and very thought provoking read, I can understand why it's considered a classic.
1400052181|5.0|I first learned of this story on NPR but didn't realize how fascinating it was before reading the book. It's captivating and well written. I highly recommend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|you will love it! worth the price to see the ending before october's release of season four. Just go aheasd and order the whole season you wont be able to stop watching
B000P407K4|4.0|A classic, the quintessential parody of the cold-war mania the was so pervasive  in the 1960 and arguably Peter Sellers' best work.

086719720X|3.0|\\"Fushigi Circus\\" by Mark Ryden, 2nd Printing 2009 (Porterhouse) Last Gasp Publ. San Francisco. ISBN-978-0-86719-720-4. HC. 128 Pgs. in 9 1/8\\" x 6 1/8\\" (small) format.  But, book format is less than awkward, reflecting perhaps the original back to front Japanese compilation with conventional introductory information on back pages, plus a bizarre pagination style with standard even-numbered pagination at bottom left, but strangely on what would correspond to a tabulation page 124, the numeration switches to triple-digit style, but weirdly omitting pages 076, 078 (and thereby also omitting pages 077 and 079)!  I suppose we must wonder which Ryden's images we are missing?  Paper quality, binding, color reproductions, and presentations are nicely arranged and cropped, especially so for small format.<br /><br />Ryden's \\"Fushigi Circus\\" has a lot to offer to aficionados of Ryden's style paintings, beginning with the surrealistic Steam Punk front cover, and the numerous 50-60 full-color reproductions of his (in my opinion) magnificent paintings. I was curious about his reversal of the pianoforte but not the clock dial in painting entitled \\"The Ecstasy of Cecelia\\".<br /><br />Without question, Ryden created unique specific niches for his novel neo-contemporary style that is being mimicked by contemporaries (though they would make a similar challenge). I find the concealed eroticism; diverse symbolic surrealistic metaphors admixed with comedic, metaphysical, and whimsical themes entrancing. Ryden's innovatively differing recipes defies easy explanation, hence its mystique.<br />  Finis
B005S9EJ14|4.0|since I am a Judi Dench fan, I like this DVD very much.  It was very different - India_ , noisy but unexpected.  I have loaned it often and will recomment it.
B001C3EI7U|5.0|The previous review mentioned the track listing on this page was wrong, which is true. The tracks listed are from the album \\"Getz Meets Mulligan in Hi-Fi\\" [[ASIN:B0000047CI Getz Meets Mulligan Hi Fi]]<br /><br />The true tracklist for this CD from FSR is as follows:<br />[...]<br /><br />Blues In Time<br /><br />Gerry Mulligan & Paul Desmond Quartet<br />Featuring: Gerry Mulligan (bars), Paul Desmond (as), Joe Benjamin (b), Dave Bailey (d)<br /><br />REFERENCE: FSRCD 519<br />BAR CODE: 8427328605199<br /><br /> Gerry Mulligan and Paul Desmond were two of the most mischievous men in<br /> jazz, kindred spirits united in their wit, sense of humour and approach to music.<br /><br /> There was a genuine fellow feeling between them, an affinity that extended beyond playing in time or fitting lines together. However, as might be expected of any group that featured Gerry with a piano-less rhythm section, this unit took on the informal personality of a Mulligan quartet; there were a couple of planned unison lines, but arrangement was kept to a minimum. And, as befits such a spectacularly happy union, it produced spontaneous creative combustion of the first order, full of excitement and felicitous surprises.<br /><br /> Track listing:<br /><br /> 01. Blues In Time<br /> 02. Body And Soul<br /> 03. Stand Still<br /> 04. Line For Lyons<br /> 05. Wintersong<br /> 06. Battle Hymn Of The Republican<br /> 07. Fall Out<br /> 08. Lover<br /> 09. Tea For Two<br /><br /> Tracks #1,2,5,8 & 9 recorded at Capiol Studios, Hollywood, August 2, 1957<br /> Tracks #3,4,6 & 7 recorded at Fine Studio, New York, August 27, 1957<br /><br />The preferred version of this recording is the following, which has the most tracks (11) as well as the lowest price:<br />[[ASIN:B0000046RP Quartet Mulligan]]
055358202X|3.0|I have not even finished the whole book yet, but did 'browse' the chapters ahead as I felt so bored half way through the book, I wanted to see what was going to happen in the next chapters. Something I certainly did not do with the first 3 books.<br /><br />Doesn't seem like much is going to happen either, but still hoping I am wrong. I was surprised about the many 4 and 5 star reviews, then realized quite a few came out at the same day so am a bit suspicious about that.<br /><br />I still give this 3 stars, as it is still entertaining to see some of the characters develop. Would this have been a standalone book, had I not read the previous three, I would rate it a one star only.<br /><br />Update: I did manage to finish this book and it was as boring as I feared. I did not hurry to buy the next one in the series. Forgettable book.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie played flawlessly until 3/4 of the way through then it froze every couple of minutes until the end.<br />Glad I didnt pay anything for this movie because it was a pain to keep hitting play.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love playing Mahjong. This app has so many variations you just can't get bored with it. Price is right (mine was free but it still is cheap at twice the regular price). The value is terrific. Enjoy the fun.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Overall, this blu-ray was an excellent adaption of the books. However, some characters were changed in ways that were neither realistic, nor served advancing the story plot.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun app. Minion version of temple run. Pretty fun but it's the little extras that make the game. Only complaint is it's a bit choppy in the play due to graphics. Otherwise a great app :)
B007IJDXFK|5.0|Stunning album, beautifully crafted and absolutely worth every penny.....talented and skilled musicians and wonderfully produced. Lyrics while simple say all that is necessary to tell this emotional tale. Each track flows into the next and this is not an album to just play one song...it is an album to be savored and enjoyed...put it on and let it wash over you and take you on the journey.  Untouchable Pt 1 and 2 are brilliant, as are Lightning Song, Storm Before the Calm and Internal Landscape....there is not really a bad track on here...so do yourself a favor, buy it and enjoy.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|So much better than book 2. Can't wait for book 4. I hope the love story continues with more questions about Gideons past being answered
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Was surprised by how badly this movie was made.  i like the previous Hobbit movies directed by Peter Jackson.  Turned this off after about 40 minutes.  This is a poorly done movie.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Great special effects!<br />Story line changed from the book but in good taste. Looking forward to sequel, A Warrior of Mars perhaps.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|One wonderful show and great to have it in my home to watch whenever I wish!<br />Service was fantastic as always!
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|Game appear nice at first but with few instructions you're always at a disadvantage.<br />Even on easy I couldn't figure out how to win. The AI could do things I couldn't.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a great game for the whole family. Love watching the kids play<br />Littlest concentrates and her tongue sticks out of her mouth lol.
B0034G4P94|4.0|Really entertaining family drama. Watched it twice already. The fight scenes at the end was intense. I would recommend because of its mix of action and the human spirit.
B00DP8XSQ2|1.0|Upon running this software immediately after download, my anti-virus software (ESET Mobile Security) reported it contained a virus and un-installed the application.  Amazon, how do I remove this from my App Store so I don't accidentally infect my android device in the future?  Why do you have virus laden software on your App Store for purchase?  I suppose it could be because your and ESET have a different definition of a virus, but I accept ESET's definition.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|What a treat.  I had adored The Graveyard Book (which was the last novel I'd read by NG) as well as enjoying the other 3 novels I'd read of his previously.  But, after reading Coraline (which I thought was dreadfully marketed for children--talk about nightmares) and then his book of short stories, Fragile Things, (which I couldn't even finish, it was so odd and disappointing) I had sort of discounted him for a while.  This book has revitalized my adoration of NG.  He's bottomlessly creative and creepy.  He knows how to give you the chills.  And he can draw you in to an entirely unbelievable, magical place and make it seem entirely feasible and real.  And his characters are engaging.  I didn't know what to expect with this story and it was fun to read.  My only disappointment is regarding the question posed near the end of the book: \\"Was it worth it?\\" (and I cannot tell you what \\"it\\" is without spoiling the book). I don't believe we saw any evidence that it was worth it.  I'd like to have seen something special about the main character to prove that \\"it\\" was worth it.  Otherwise, it was a wonderfully told tale.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|The original from 1942. Complements Mel Brooks' later version and fun to see the scene and similar dialogue throughout. The Brooks' version is a musical, this original is not and some of the plot devices and names have been re-aligned or re-assigned. Very enjoyable and to this point rare to find. New Criterion version, albeit somewhat expensive, will make this gem more available. Jack Benny is excellent as are all the characters.
B0084I2PEO|4.0|The story's characters grabbed me and made me keep reading which is always the sign of a good book. It was very difficult to read sometimes but I feel it's a story that needed to be told. It was eye-opening and educational for me. I also liked the resolutions in the end and way the author criss-crossed the paths of the characters in a realistic way. Nothing seemed forced or too much of a coincidence or too contrived which I appreciate. Hosseini's writing is clear and effective.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Enjoyed the all of the episodes. Purchased this season since I had watched Seasons 1-5. I have enjoyed all of the seasons.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This series is a fun read - easy to zip through with lots of action, mysteries and emotions we can all identify with.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I chose this rating because I really enjoyed the episodes in this set.  I have watched and enjoyed all of the seasons to date and look forward to the next season.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Well written from so many different angles.  I was surprised that I really did get &#34;into&#34; this series.  well done
B00004Y6OA|3.0|I had originally bought this record, when the songs \\"And The Cradle Will Rock\\" AND \\"Everybody Wants Some!!\\" were going very strong, in May of 1980, on the radio. Just recently, I had bought the 2000 remastered CD version, from Amazon. I want to take some time to review & offer my opinions, of each song, as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"And The Cradle Will Rock\\"...THIS song, along w/ SONG #2 have the SPRING of 1980...WRITTEN ALL OVER THEM... in MY memory. They were BOTH running neck & neck, on the radio. I love this cut, very much & this is the very BEST cut on this ENTIRE album. In my opinion, this cut is just plain EXCELLENT & I wish it was a little LONGER, in it's length.<br /><br />2.  \\"Everybody Wants Some!!\\"...I have always loved the jungle-tribal drum beat that this song has. This song along w/ \\"And The Cradle Will Rock\\" bring back many happy memories of May 1980, for me. This song is also EXCELLENT & it has a great rocking beat to it.<br /><br />3.  \\"Fools\\"...Also in 1980, this song rec'd some moderate radio airplay.  I like it & it's pretty good.<br /><br />4.  \\"Romeo Delight\\"...I could NEVER rave about this song, as much.  It's definitely my LEAST favorite.<br /><br />5.  \\"Tora! Tora!\\"...This is the SHORTEST song, that's NOT even ONE minute long. I always loved this song, because it was also SO weird.<br /><br />6.  \\"Loss Of Control\\"...This song was never anything spectacular, either.<br /><br />7.  \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\"...Besides me owning this record & remembering this song, I also believe that it DID receive SOME radio airplay. This song is funny, but it's good.<br /><br />8.  \\"Could This Be Magic?\\"...This song has a comical feel & country twang, to it. And this song also contains THIS album's TITLE, in IT'S lyrics. Even though, this song is entirely DIFFERENT, from the rest, I still enjoy listening to this.<br /><br />9.  \\"In A Simple Rhyme\\"...This is ANOTHER of my TOP favorite songs, on THIS album. I esp. LOVE the guitar on the BEGINNING of this, as it kinda reminds me of John Denver's folk guitar work, somewhat. This is another EXCELLENT song, in my opinion.<br /><br />Even though, I only gave this album a 3 STAR rating, it is STILL recommended.inda reminds me of John Denver's folk guitar work, somewhat.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|Of course, the  book is better than the movie - so if you liked the movie - this book is a must read. So much more than they put on film.
B002QGSYRC|5.0|Excellent written account.  It embraced both the political and battlefield accounts of that war.  Our leaders continue to make the same mistakes.
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown is fabulous as mixing facts from real history seamlessly with fiction - it is hard to know what is coming next. Loved it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this because I had heard great things and wanted to try it. I didn't really like it, but when I babysat a couple of kids they absolutely loved it. They even got mad at me because my Kindle fire died after a few hours. It has been a life saver when dealing with kids who don't listen or are  bored. Just whip this game out and they will love you forever!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My family loves Despicable Me and loves this game.  Everyone has fun with this game, from 4 and up.  Good graphics and solid performance.
B001N1DPDE|1.0|I'm urging you to read the thoughtful, helpful reviews from those who have used the knife and found it unsatisfactory BEFORE you buy if you plan to do more than look at this knife.
B00506NRBS|5.0|This little book made me smile in a big way.  It really shows the joy and rewards that come from following a passion and putting others first regardless of dollar signs.  I loved it.
B00CL8D83U|2.0|It sounds like an EP in their \\"Disco\\" series.  The only track I found tolerable was \\"Fluorescent\\", which could have fit in as a mediocre track on any of their last 3 albums.  The rest of the tunes were even more boring.  I admit, the sounds and beats were momentarily enjoyable, but not loop after loop.  The music, although mixed superbly as usual, lacks hooks and lyrics.  Hearing the same word over and over is just lazy.  I wondered to myself as I listened for the first two times, \\"did they have writer's block?... did they just need to put something out to satisfy the label or pay the bills?... did they just lose interest and give up writing lyrics for what could have been a decent production?\\"  This will be one of those albums I'll listen to once per year (at best), or play in the background, low volume, while I'm doing something more enjoyable and interesting... like cleaning my house.
B000L53D4O|4.0|Good toy for younger infants. It is a very basic toy and no electronics. Infant walkers might like this a little more.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because the book is that awesome ... this is my 4th time reading it since middle school and it is still hard to put down.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|This book was entertaining and had quite a few lol moments. Sedaris knows how to make his readers identify with even his most irreverent characters. This book is the way zany should be.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This novel was reminiscent of the older Scarpetta novels. A great read and I highly recommend to any Scarpetta fan
B00C7JFIRC|4.0|Personally I find the artistic accomplishments of the film wonderful and worth the price of admission. Where it seems to be weak is quite frankly, in the casting. James Franco has charm but their having failed to book their first choice Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Oz leaves the film a weaker one . Downey would have surely brought so much more to the character and simple charm is not enough to lift this work to being a laudable one. It's a nice blu-ray of an extremely rich artistic vision but not so fulfilling on the story or casting end of things. Still, I'd recommend it and the Blu-Ray really is the way to go on this film given the rich visuals.
B000W74EQC|2.0|I played the disc and it quit on me.  I tried to clean it and try again, but the same thing happened.
B00AGKH6D8|4.0|I saw this band play at Iridium Jazz Club in early 2013 and this material, while good on the CD, really comes alive when the band plays it live.<br />Joe Bonamassa was not center stage, he was in the left corner of the stage, this wasn't the Joe Bonamassa Show. All the players had plenty of space<br />to show off their impressive chops and that they did. I like the CD and I recommend it to anyone that likes funky instrumentals played by seasoned<br />veterans. Go for it!
B0041KVZ1S|5.0|What can I say... it's the Beatles!  Bought this for my son and it's a big hit! .... But then again... it's the Beatles !!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Overall, this is a great movie. Tarantino is really a wonderful directer with his own sense of style and humor. The violence is prevalent but it is a western so it is appropriate. It is mostly so over-the-top though that it's not that bothersome for those of us who are sensitive to it. The acting is superb and the characters interesting and entertaining.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My daughter and I really enjoyed this movie!!  She had seen it before and I had not ever seen it.  We were planning on going to see the next movie at the theater and I wanted to have a good idea of what's going on.<br />Too funny, too cute, too good!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A really good stress free game to pass the time. I would continue to play this game thank you very much
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Most people have been complaining that the rubber wears out? I have yet to have that problem, and if it does, I'll just flip it upside down. Absolutely perfect for my MacBook Pro in a desktop setup. A bit pricey for what it is, but it's durable and it does its job.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This second in the series of historical fiction moves rather quickly despite it's length.  Well written and worth the effort
B004GHNIRK|4.0|It's very long, but so interesting. There's s a lot of history and I love the psychological profiles of the main and not so important characters.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I'm very frustrated with this game.  The directions are vague and I'm not understanding how to move forward with the game........I'm glad it was a free game because if I can't find better instructions I'm going to delete it.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I really bought the DVD because I really like the song &#34;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&#34; with Nash and Crosby and it was no longer accessible on You Tube.  I've been playing it over and over.  Maybe one day I'll get to the rest of the DVD.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|takes way to long to load and constantly freezes or hangs requiring a hard restart of my kindle.  its a nice game but you will spend more time frustrated at loading screens than playing.
0316067601|5.0|The book was an excellent read! A true story of heroism, selflessness, and valor. Men as these are not ordinary citizens, they are true Americans and are willing to do whatever it takes to preserve life and liberty for us.
0525478817|4.0|Beautiful book, very heartwarming.  Actually tells a story.  Very well written and thought out.  Great job John Greene.  Gonna check out more of your books( :
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|The wire is comes with is LOOONNNNNGGGGGGG!<br /><br />Some might find this long cable useful, some will really hate it!<br /><br />It has a useful clip to attach the mic to your shirt but the sound from the mic is a little thin. It improves slightly the audio capability as compared to on board mic on the laptops or cameras.
1416549447|3.0|I couldn't make it the whole way through because half the time the writer talked about all his accolades and not what I needed, which was help with pain free running. Very disappointed.
1401235425|5.0|batman makes me have to change my undies...please read this. it's a must for any batman fan. marry me batman!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Missed this episode on DVR and was pleased to see that amazon had it! Perfect quality and fast upload. Thanks
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is a replacement from the original and so far is working great, a great improvement from the one cable that came with the kindle.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is my hero. The book is laugh out loud funny and I like that she still kept some things to herself. She is awesome!
B004M9ZI0M|3.0|I liked this movie, but everyone talked in rhyme and lyric. It was kind of annoying after a little while.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I wasted very little time in turning this movie off and returning it to the local library where we rented it from.  I did not make it past the first 2 minutes of vulgar language and nudity.  It will be hard to pick a Denzel Washington movie to watch next time.  Greatly disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is awesome!Creaters probably put a lot of time into making this game.Its tough to find out where everything is and goes.
B005HS00P0|5.0|Shipped quickly and arrived in good quality. The record has only skipped a few times but that could very well be due to my ok-quality record player.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|From the start I knew it was a page turner. I Absolutly loved the ending. Can't wait to start my next Michael Connelly book.
B00BJS7104|5.0|I had heard a lot about the movie, some good, some not so good and it was not what I expected, I loved it. Each characters role was well performed which kept me looking for more and getting it. Jamie Foxx is one of my favorite actors.
B00DGMVC4C|5.0|I had just down loaded this game unto my laptop,and played it there a few minutes, the lap top was getting heavy on my lap ,so I went to play on my Kindle(which I now play on more than laptop) was searching for games and there it was. so bought it right away. at first though price maybe to high. buy so happy I did. moves a long quickly,and lots of items to collect,love how the music reminds me of jaws if you are getting to close to losing.it builds up then bam your done. of course you always have replay.. glad I bought it.
B007N31YH0|1.0|This was a movie that I enjoyed when it first ran and wanted to watch it again.  It is a great movie.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|This movie was good and a lot of laughs through out the movie. I would recomend this movie to anyone.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I had heard that this was a great book. It so is!! I loved every second reading this. Everyone knows a couple like this, so freaking intense, you don't know whether they love or hate each other. The name of the book is so appropriate, Beautiful Disaster. The writing is superb. The story line draws you and and doesn't want to let you up for air. I started this book  approx 6 hours ago, in that time I had to stop to make dinner and eat. And every second that I wasn't cooking, I picked the book back up for as long as I could. Then when I was done I had to take a break from everything and just walk around outside. This book makes you think about priorities, life, love, loyalty, family, true friendship, and true love. The sheer intensity of the feelings that Abby and Travis have are amazing and if you have anything close to it, be grateful. That's true love. I don't know how Ms. Mcguire managed to capture the rawness of the feelings and get them on paper, but damn! I commend her on doing a fantastic job of getting those hard to word emotions out there and connecting to readers. That's what it's all about. Amazing... I can't wait to read anything else she's written.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|He gets away with it by calling it an oral history, therefore he doesn't have to flesh out characters or mess with scenes, climax or plot.  Boring and lazy is what I would dub it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book. Can't wait to read the next two books in the series.<br />I'm hoping they are as good as the first!
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Storyline was creative in concept, but no one seemed to care about making this a good movie.<br /><br />Good: Bruce Willis is himself, although he kind of phones in the role; Lots of cars crushed by larger cars; Cool guns and helicopters; Moderately interesting plot twist.<br /><br />Bad: John McClane's son, one of the heroes, is horribly unlikable, coming off as a whiny ingrate; None of the characters is ever really developed in any way, so you won't care what happens to them; Willis' character sets off to Russia to save his son from the Russian authorities, but spends the whole movie quipping \\"I was supposed to be on vacation.\\"  No you weren't!  You were at best supposed to be there plotting strategy with lawyers and sitting through trial proceedings.  At worst you were going to watch him go to prison.  There was no expectation of vacation.  It's a stupid line!  Dialogue is canned and boring; one-liners could have been pulled from other movies, or maybe made up by the crew's kids.<br /><br />Skip this movie and re-watch Die Hard I or II instead.
0977326403|5.0|I used this book for a class I was teaching and really enjoyed how he presented the materials and the issues he addressed regarding complacency within the Non-Profit world.  My students also said they valued having this book in their professional library.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game!  Gets pretty tricky but be determined and don't give up!  Once you start playing, you won't want to stop playing.
B00CQR6E3M|5.0|heartbreaking story of a young idealists ultimate encounter with appalling realities, brilliant. writing of the highest calibre by an outstanding author.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|First pull the 128 million or so hits Youtube of Susan Boyle and watch the stage manager at 2:46.  Wow.<br /><br />Then start this DVD and try to keep up with the Wow moments.  They keep coming, and building -- just when you think you have seen everything, they do the Encores.  Alfie Boe's key change in the first is one of the real highlights of all musical theater, and Michael Ball/Ramin Karimloo in the second are flat awesome.
B000FBJF78|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much I could not put it down . M call  has a wonderful understanding of human nature. His characters are incredible. I plan to read all the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency novels.
B002VWNID6|1.0|This review is for the dvd.  the 1 star is for the dvd formatting not the movie.  At first I thought this was defective.  No, you must flip the DVD in the middle of he movie???...... Makes no sense.  The format of the movie is poor and my bluray can usually get near bluray quality from most DVDs but nog from this one. Lots of fumbling with picture size and a fuzzy viewing experience.<br /><br />Great movie, very very bad DVD.  I would not buy this and I want my money back- I feel cheated.  You should note that I'm usually a 5 star reviewer, if I don like it I usually don't review it and give everyone the benefit of the doubt.  It takes a significantly bad product for me to write a 1 star....here it is.  There is zero reason for the single layer DVD and the bad quality video.  Get a different format than this DVD.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Ready for the next room!! Hard to put down as I was intrigued with each new twist.  Would definitely recommend this game!
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|The developer seems more concerned with graphics and sound than with actual game play.  There are much better games in this genre.  Needs more play testing, and more work.... I'm glad I got it for free
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have had many hours of fun playing this version of Angry Birds.  It has many levels and a lot of challenges
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is awesome! You can use your own music, customize everything, and a ton of other great features. I'll never need another alarm again. Best of all, IT'S FREE!
B00A8307BG|5.0|Great buy thanks so much  I love the cd I really do thanks again tired of writing more thanks again
B0007SQLKI|1.0|The seller knows that I am from California but the two DVD tapes says, \\"Region Error\\".  However, the region code on the box says it works in North America so it is too conflicting. I requested for a refund including the mailing cost for return ($19) and I expect him or her to do that because it is so unfair on my part.  I am so upset.
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|Great buy thanks so much  I love the cd I really do thanks again tired of writing more thanks again
B0012X6FR6|5.0|The Album contains some doubles (different takes), but each one has its own character. Evans' playing is unrivaled in his inversions, timing, and fills/solos. The trio covers jazz standards like Blue in Green, and Autumn Leaves. GET THIS CD.
B000NA2348|5.0|I originally owned this back in the 1970's - vinyl.  Even back then, the sound was not cool.  It was tepid and without depth.  I could tell some great musical bones were there, but the recording execution left so much to be desired that even when it came out on it's original CD debut, i could only cling to one song. \\"Somebody up there likes me\\".  I just thought that song told a great story with timeless front and backing vocals.  The other tracks were so noisy and hissy, it was like being on acid....as in, if you were on acid or drugs, you' wouldn't notice the dreadful noise out side the song<br /><br />I was debating on getting the Ryco version, since they started the remaster process.  But in the end i just coughed up the cash and said lets go for all the marbles.  Im SO glad I did.  The audio quality of these tracks is stunning and so rich, it sounds like this album was made for  this decade - not 40 years ago.  Where as I had discarded songs like Win,  Fascination, and Right due to the poor audio.  NOW these songs  are like hearing a new artist.  I was starting from begininning to end expecting something to dissappoint.  Instead I was blown away from beg. to end.<br /><br />I am now a firm convert to certain remastered Discs.  Th engineer deserves some kind of award. - Seriously.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead is one of my favorite bands. Their dissonant and sometimes intense music is great, and their singer is fantastic. The song Knives out, which I heard Chris Thile and Brad Mehldau play, is possibly my favorite Radiohead song, which is why I bought the album. However, a lot of the other songs in the album are incongruous, random, and not very fun to listen to. OK Computer is a much better album.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I bought this to replace a broken tape I had of this movie.  A classic... you will watch it over and over.
B0091QS88K|4.0|My son is 4 years old and he enjoys playing this app. He loves to help mommy cook. He cooks while I cook to.
0783229321|5.0|I bought this to replace a broken tape I had of this movie.  A classic... you will watch it over and over.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|enjoyed this movie from the credits to the end. the plot was good and there were no so parts. the dialogue kept my interest thruout. would recommend this movie especilly to those who love baseball.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I like this game as it makes you think, and use some grey matter to solve.it is simple but effective
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Great for little kids and bronies I've already have had this for seven months and never deleted it  this was my second app I got on my kindle fire but prices are high
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I have downloaded and played many of the games available. This by far is my favorite. Something new to find. Great challenges to meet and so many different objectives that I am never bored.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app.  Love to check it everyday.  It is accurate and helpful in planning.  The kids and I love the interesting videos and I appreciate the weather maps.
B00DU74U74|5.0|The film did a nice job of keeping it clear which personality/identity was speaking, Wanda or Melanie.  Nice character development, too.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is very addictive game.  The level challenging and it lets you know if you can nit find matches. Once you have completed levels, you can challenge yourself to do better than previously. And best yet it is free!
B008VO3PA4|2.0|I'll probably get bashed for saying that I as just expecting s lot more from this book-!! That's really ALL I can say about it other than now I wish I'd not spent so much for it & saved my money for something better. YES, the pictures were beautiful, sweet and some were funny but I really must have been half asleep when I read the reviews of it because I HONESTLY WAS expecting a lot more from the book-!!
B005LAII62|5.0|Enjoyed this movie with my grandson who in turn asked if he had any gifts like Norman.<br />Great way to have an interesting and most fantastic discussion
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Love this one also, I could listen to his CDS day and night and sometimes I do.  Wish I had all of them.  His songs are great for relaxing and reflecting.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|This was the most wonderful enjoyable movie. I loved Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough, they had great on screen rapore.
0307949486|5.0|It takes a bit to &#34;get into&#34; this book, but it is so well worth it.  You REALLY need to read the trilogy, so order all 3 upfront.  You're not going to want to put it down.  Very intense action and character representation.  This is a series you will read quickly, then re-read (and re-read again!) and discover all the little things you missed the first time.  Crisp, clear, and extremely well-written.  A definite keeper!
B00AZMFO9U|4.0|A very amusing story. a demonstration of musicians' true love of their craft. An enjoyable movie with a superb cast make this an enjoyable movie. Be sure to watch the credits.
0385347774|2.0|This novel had great promise, and a huge twist at about the halfway point that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I liked the style and format in which it was written, and eagerly awaited the next chapter.  Unfortunately the ending didn't live up to the excitement and thrill of the tone that the author carried up until those last 10 or so pages.  It was an extreme disappointment and reminiscent of the schlock Stephen King writes -- he can start and write a good novel but can't end it.  How this book ever ended up on the New York Times best seller list is beyond me.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the next book! Just loved reading it,couldn't put it down. But what else can you really say..it's awesome!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very entertaining game. wish it were longer but looking forward to new levels!  Finished entire game on a rainy afternoon-good game that makes you think
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was cool. We will see if they come up with new rooms, but overall, it was pretty cool. My four stars.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|My HTC One doesn't make it very easy to see how much life is left on my battery, or how much longer when it's charging. I installed this app when it was the free app of the day, and put the widget on my desktop, which is very handy. The timing seems kind of strange though. I think it estimates how long your battery would last at your current energy use, because it changes frequently depending on what I'm doing. Also, when it's plugged in, it changes to how much longer until it's full, but without telling you. That seems to be very much a guesstimate as well. Overall, it's handy, but I don't know if I'd pay for it.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I've seen quite a few Star Trek movies and the original series. Star Trek 11 was good,too. That is where I first met Chris Pine. He plays Kirk very well. I think that he even caught on to some of his mannerisms. I was not expecting Star Trek Into Darkness to be better than that one. I absolutely love it. What I liked best about it is that Kirk learns to grow up, and becomes responsible.<br /><br /> All in all, it was great. Science fiction is one of my favorite genres.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game but it's hard to get energy points but otherwise it's a good game. I also like that it is free
B008133MDK|5.0|if you are a fan of doyle's work then there's little doubt the  new series on pbs is utmost promising.it moves at a good pace and is up to date with today's obsession of the smartphone....can't wait to see what's next
0060531053|5.0|If you have even a passing interest in homebrewing or are considering taking it up as a hobby, get this book to see what it's all about. It's well-written and easy to read and will certainly provide you with a great amount of insight into the craft.
B002BIULQ2|4.0|Great story behind it, never forget who you really are.... would recomend for anyone to view...good movie....I would recomend.....thanks again
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|What a great game Simple and fun, played with my 4 year old nephew not sure who enjoyed it most.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use and rely on this every day. I set alarms with different songs for each day. After a couple of weeks I know the day by the song. Really helps get me going.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Prefer the books, but the show is good. I bet it'll continue to get bettet in later seasons. Quality of streaming from Amazon is great.
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|I saw this movie opening night on July 19th 2013 - - and for the most part, I thought it was pretty good actually.  \\"Horror movies\\", in general, have always seemed to have been the toughest flicks to make - - and really good horror movies are so few and far that it's not even funny !<br /><br />So are movies that are made that involve children, and child acting - - those can also be very challenging to make as well. But overall, I think the children in this movie do a great job with in their roles.<br /><br />THE POSITIVES:  This movie had tenseness throughtout, and the fright moments seemed to build slowly but steadily.  The movie had many great \\"things that go bump\\" sounds and moments (I especially liked the hand clap game)throughout the movie that amounted to great lead-in's for the climax of the bizarre exorcism (Linda Blair would have puked and chucked green vomit with a devilish smile seeing this, and would have been proud of this scene - as a nice job was done here !)  Nice \\"creeky old house\\" with classic squeeky doors throughout.  And every creepy haunted house needs the youngest daughter and the creepy paranormal entity to have a wonderful working \\"new best friends\\" relationship with one another. And this one worked well.  The guy who played the cop was neurotically good - - playing a classic country bumpkin and comedic \\"Billy-Bob lawdog\\" !<br /><br />THE NEGATIVES:  I found both leading women (Vera Farmiga and Lily Taylor) a bit \\"over-the-top\\" in their roles - Vera with her paranormal husband, and Lily with her husband and family.  Both women seemed to have more than a few \\"wide-eyed and euphorically-crazed\\" smile moments  - - for a couple of these moments, I was waiting for little blue robins to start flying and circling their heads while dousing even more love, tenderness and bliss onto them ! Seriously, a few scenes got so stupid that I was expecting to see Lassie come running out with his heart-warming theme song playing during some of these overly dramatic scenes ! But no doubt the worst cheese moment was the 15-minute \\"group hug\\" by the family at the end of the movie....just really cornball !<br /><br />What is clear here, however, is the movie itself was GOOD - - it just makes me cringe that it could have been BETTER....and I mean, so MUCH better !!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app so much. it makes pintrest so easy to use an to control. And of corset I love pintrest.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is the best puzzle game I have yet to find.  The pictures are beautiful I just wish there were more.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I just tried too open the game  and it said  I would have too login to my Amazon account to play .<br />What's up?
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Chimpact is a really fun game,but theres not enough content, but if your only picking it up when you have just a couple minutes to play you will find yourself enchanted with this game
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game soooooooooooooo much. This game is realated to other games that I have. They are prom salon,fairy salon, and wedding salon. All of them are awsome
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely love this game, my friend likes my little pony so I thought  I'd get the game and its awesome and I never thought I'd like my little pony again!!!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app is to complicated for my 7 year old and I wouldn't recommend this to my twelve year old because it doesn't seem age appropriate! I think that it has a good idea just make it less complicated
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So addicting, way more fun than subway surfers, has more variety and so fun!!!!! Has so many colors, great game to have in every device you can. Extremely entertaining and even more for those despicable me fans!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game play it just about everyday either on my Kindle or phone most of my friends and family play it as well
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app is broken and needs to be fixed. Every time I try to watch a video it force closes. PLEASE FIX!!!
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|The movie was entertaining, and I certainly enjoyed watching Maggie Smith & her co-stars.<br />It was okay in that respect, but I think the movie could have had a little more going for it<br />as far as plot.  Also, I was not too happy with the letterbox format; but this is only my<br />opinion.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|A very good story line throughout the whole movie and action at every corner. A movie to watch again and again.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I love Baldacci's writing style and Will Robie is my favorite character.  I'm also reading One Summer which is a very different story line for David and it's excellent.  The innocent is a captivating story and keep my interest throughout.  A good read that I highly recommend.
B00AEFYGJW|5.0|Non stop inelegant action that puts you in another place so the pressures of the day are set aside. It does not hurt that the hero is one great looking lady.
B00CFA222M|3.0|All the thematic elements were there: good vs. evil, the guy gets the girl, etc. But still there was something missing. I like that the movie was mostly clean and mostly suitable for children but....
0307472590|5.0|Part gothic novel, part love story, part murder mystery, part by-grows-into-man story. I loved this book, even though I thought it would have more references to Barcelona.  I was quickly drawn into the inner lives of the characters and raced to follow each surprising plot twist wherever it would lead.  Incredible images, particularly in the spooky parts, still haunt my imagination weeks after finishing.  Can't wait to read his next book, also set in Barcelona.  [Read in Spanish]
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|Really Albert King and Booker T and the MG's as the rhythm section need we actually say more. Kick Ass
0307455378|5.0|I read this book in Spanish; the author's use of language is beautiful and is what I love most about his books (can't speak to how well this translates over into the English version).  Characters are fully realized and I felt very enmeshed in their lives.  The city of Barcelona is even a \\"character\\" of sorts.  In fact, this book had many more references to places in the city that I recognized than did \\"The Shadow of the Wind.\\"  There are some wonderful expository sections in which Big Themes are examined, but never overdone.  The dark, gothic atmosphere of the story is frequently lightened by characters who react with humor and authenticity to situations that are straight out of an Edgar Allen Poe story.  Thoroughly mesmerizing; I couldn't put it down.
B00377V6J2|5.0|With both these greats passed one great to watch as well as listen great deal for both cd an dvd
B009NQZVKG|2.0|Sorry. This one did not hold my interest like all the other stories. Confusing plot and confusing theories . Very disappointed.

B00AFPTSI0|5.0|It has important insights about how to be successful givers. The book provides good examples of why people succeed or fail by being givers, and what to do to avoid getting burned by takers.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Love the music in this movie and all the color.  Bought this movie for my grandkids, they love it. Thank you
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I've never written a review for any app before but the changes made to The Weather Channel app are so awful that I wanted to do something that might save someone else the time they would waste downloading it. Change it back PLEASE !
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is the app that I usually play.you can post, chat, share, look or play apps/games I love it. So far I have had no problems with Facebook but just me I guess Facebook is working fine
B00AYM6JFO|2.0|I would not recommend this.......I was very disappointed. Would not listen to it again. His older music is much better.
B00DFFI7K2|1.0|THIS MOVIE (NOT BLOCKBUSTER) COMPARED TO: THE RISE OF COBRA (BLOCKBUSTER.)<br />IT'S LIKE COMPARING LINCOLN ZOMBIE (NOT BLOCKBUSTER)<br /> TO LINCOLN VAMPIRE (BLOCKBUSTER.)<br />IT'S ONLY AN 1/8TH OF A BLOCKBUSTER.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I first played this on my sisters ipad and then I knew I had to get it on my kindle.BEST GAME EVER!!
8866134627|5.0|This is the right size to carry around between meetings, the multiple options for organizing to dos, action items, highlights etc. are a big help and well designed.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I previously used google reader and heard that this tool was a good alternative. I actually prefer it. Particularly being able to categorize the feeds.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|After having this app sit unused for a long time I used it for some ambient lighting one night and now I use it all the time. I even used it the other night when my car (73 VW) broke down.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I like to download Kindle books from my local library, but many needed a direct USB connection. Since my Kindle didn't come with one, I started shopping. This was very reasonably priced, with fast shopping and great customer service. Thanks!
B00DM0XXCM|1.0|Cliche and with charcters painfully nerdy.  Looking at things upside down got old fast.  This movie is made for teenagers who may be more open to believing the message that LOVE is the solution.
B000005Z0G|3.0|I'm a Tupac fan so i might be a little biased about this one could be better but hey, its just my opinion.
B00846REIS|3.0|Sylvia Day does a great job of writing the story line.  Am a little disappointed that there isn't another book to follow the story line.<br />Why are these books always about the rich and their sexual drives?  Is it because they are the only ones that have the money to get out the situations that they get into or do people think that normal people have no desires?
B000JJ4PDK|4.0|This was good, I received the white case, would've loved the black one though, everyday struggle is my favorite song, R.I.P. Notorious BIG God bless the dead.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Greatest game ever for a five year old! A LOVES IT.TOO PLL way to go fabulous totally hello kitty pink and sparkly
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The ads are stupid, but other than that it is a pretty cool game, wish more scratch offs happened more often to.
B00C27LB20|5.0|This Kid is amazing.  It's not fair to compare him to Dylan, because his song writing, singing is so genuine and real to him.  (That is not a knock to the great one).  Its amazing that a young person could have such depth and coolness, considering the vapid shallow &#34;stars&#34; of the music now.  Rock died because the Apple killed the angst and everyone must confirm into everyone elses tattooed selfie instagram photo.  I would compare this kid to Hank Williams.  (this is not a know to Tricephus).  This kid is the real deal, all he needs is a Triumph Tiger 500 with high pipes
0440246318|3.0|Standard beginning with Reacher thumbing a ride from A to B. Finally picked up but the company is strange and Reacher has a busted nose, with duct tape on it? Did I miss where and why he got it? Is it relative to the story other than it just IS? Lots of car talk which moves the plot along, personalities of the characters expanded. I am a big Lee Child fan but this story seems to go in spurts and then gets stuck in the mud a while then more spurts and action. Finally, near the end, all the facts come together with the big shootout, Reacher and Delfuenso against 24 bad guys. Outcome? 24 dead bad guys, small cut on Reacher's hand. Reacher did have real guns with more than 6 inexhaustible bullets, like the old cowboy shootouts, but the parallel is a little hard to ignore.<br /><br />With all the above said, I still look forward to the next Lee Child book with more of Jack Reacher's adventures.<br />Walter.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I know I'm about ten years behind in reading Moneyball but it is truly an outstanding look at inside the game by an \\"outsider\\". One thing that struck me, of many many things, is how i now hear game announcers. They still talk the old game of the old school in spite of Beane and other's successes.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read several of Stephen King's books, and can honestly say that this has been my favorite so far. The characters are so likable and the story line is beautiful and easy to follow. It was nearly impossible to put down.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Funny with catchy songs and great cast. I would recommend. Rebel Wilson steals the show. It's nice to see Brittany snow again.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Without a doubt, the best book I've ever read.  Can't believe I waited so long to read Oscar Wilde... now crave his entire works.
B000SUKPKM|5.0|It's hard to choose all of the best goo goo songs because there are so many options, but this disc does possess most of the best. Very happy with it!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I get heaps of adds when I look at BBC News on my PC. This version doesn't seem to suffer from the same effect. It also categorises the stories well, so you can quickly see which ones interest you.<br /><br />My rating is probably 70% based on the awesome content you get with BBC World, but I've not been the least bit irritated by the app, so it must be good as well!
B00BEXB18M|2.0|At best, there are a few really good songs which may match Endgame. But it's a mediocre record, especially from one of the giants of metal. In no way is it as bad as anything Metallica has released since after ... And Justice For All (and yes, that includes The Black Album), but this is no Peace Sells, Endgame, or Rust in Peace (the band's masterpiece). A real disappointment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I received an email confirming my purchase fromAmazon stating what to do next to download.<br />Completely as described very clear instructions to download to my device.<br />and all is very well with no problems..<br />Big Thank you Amazon.<br /><br />highly recommended app. and very addictive game.<br />100% happy customer
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|We have this game on my 6yr olds tablet and she LOVES IT but her friends code button isn't working. Which limits parts of her game. And now the game I have on my cell opens does the add then freezes and then shuts down. I haven't been able to get it to work at all for 2 days!  When this is working it is a really cute and easy game that makes challenges that are reasonable for a child's app. And in a funny way can help teach kids to save up their money to buy the items they really want rather than spending it just to move forward faster. If it ever starts to work again I would love to give it 5 stars!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game is a challenge and highly recommend for anyone that like games to find things. Can't wait for more levels.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|New version is terrible. Have deleted it from kindle and gone back to Calling local weather. Version on phone is much better.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|This book was so fun to read! Great characters with original personalities...a myriad of mythologies and theologies bound together...and a kick ass druid in the middle of it all! I started this book on a whim an  now I'm hooked! I can't wait  to start book two an  read more o  the adventures of atticus and oberon!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE MINECRAFT!!!!! I PLAY ON PC. PC IS BETTER. BUT THIS IS STILL IN DEVLOPMENT. I LOVE IT ANYWAY. MINECRAFT!!!!!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Thin, lightweight design, protects my Kindle well, stands great, everything I want in a case! Couldn't be happier! Good work!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is really fun to raise dragons and evolve them. Some Dragons when there evolved look really cool and awesome!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this. game is rell stuff and I play it all day for the rest of my kid daze to play these
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Ends up as a good travel reference for Florence Italy!  Recommended it to all our travel companions for our trip.
0446533122|5.0|Any and all questions explained concerning both primaries in the series. Well written, of course, but I would strongly suggest you read &#34;Split Second&#34; first because this is where their partnership starts.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|The new Pet Shop Boys CD \\"Electric\\" is so addictive!  I cannot stop playing it.  There are so many great songs on this album that I cannot choose which one is my favorite.  It is incredible that a band that has been together for over 30 yrs. can still<br />feel inspired and make me as excited about their music as they have throughout their career.  Thanks to Stuart Price for helping \\"Electric\\"  sound rich and rewarding.  Every time time I listen to \\"Electric\\" I hear new things I didn't hear before.  I hope they continue to work with Stuart Price on future projects.  With music like this they will forever be my favorite group of all time!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I received these wonderful dvds at a great price.  They were in terrific condition and my friends and family loved watching this fabulous show. Can't wait to order season 2.
B008J34466|3.0|I liked this CD, as I have all the Pink albums that have come out.  This one wasn't my favorite.  I'll still listen to it but maybe not as often as her earlier work.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Martin is an amazing writer with an imagination that took me to wonderful and scary places. A book well worth the time to read it.
B003204MQS|3.0|This is on par with Blair Witch. If you lose yourself in the movie then its a decent use of an hour and a half. Some cool parts throughout, but a lot of just sitting there waiting for something to happen. So like I said, its worth watching the first time. Past that, cant say much for it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I luv this book. It's so exiting and fun! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and excitement.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Disney should definitely be applauded for trying to break the mould and make a movie centered around a girl. Unfortunately, it quickly degenerates into a moral story of how parents and children should behave with each other and what happens when the latter don't!<br /><br />The movie starts promisingly, with the protagonist, depicted to be a free spirit. Unfortunately, within no time, she behaves like an idiot (surprising considering she is shown behaving very adult-like a few minutes ago) and ends up turning her mother into a bear.<br /><br />From this point onwards, the movie degenerates into a mother-daughter bonding tale and the mother gets more focus than the daughter.<br /><br />While watching this movie, I continued to sense that something was missing...towards the end, I realized that inspite of its title, the movie lacked real bravery of any sort...
B00CF34B2I|1.0|The app is so huge I waited a few hours to download only to find out I cant play/fit it onto my kindle. Soon after download finished and game was not installed; my internal storage was completely full!?!  Thanks for nothing.
B000065K6N|5.0|This is one of the best movies as far as depicting the perennial tension between man and his environment is concerned! The story is fantastical and yet, grounded in reality. The animation acts as a backdrop to the story and is not the focus of the film. All characters have their own, human, failings, and Miyazaki avoids making villains out of people.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app I  free but I like it the only this that I don  like is it turns wen u mean to jump just stuff like that but I like it it's not a bad app
B005LAIH4A|3.0|This movie goes all ballistic in its message to save trees. Unfortunately, it tries too hard without really being sincere and loses its appeal in the process.<br /><br />The reason for my above observation is because I had ordered Princess Mononoke along with this movie and found that Hayao Miyazaki tackled the issue (man vs. nature) in a far more sensible manner than the makers of The Lorax.<br /><br />Now, it can be argued that the target audience of these two movies are different with The Lorax focussed more on the small children. This is not an entirely invalid argument, considering that the movie is based on the story by Dr. Seuss. However, today's children are far more aware of the issue than what the film-makers would like to believe.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|I received my Kindle Fire as a gift and could not be happier.  I have had it now for 4 month and it performs flawlessly as both a &#34;reader&#34; and internet / e-mail access devise.  I purchased a Marware Revolve Genuine Leather Rotating, Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; for both protection and as a reading & display stand.  It works fine as a stand in both the vertical and horizontal position.  It offers the level of protection that I bought it for and has excellent appearance (no flaws, no pulled stitching, no signs of poor workmanship).  The only reason I don't offer a 5 stars rating, is that the product, when new, had a strong &#34;plastic&#34; smell that persisted for weeks before dissipating and was most pronounced when using it for extended time (reading).  This would not bother some people, yet strong plastic or chemical smells bother me and many people with sensitive dispositions.  My suggestion is the manufacturer should allow &#34;Airing out&#34; time before packaging and shipping.  Otherwise, and for people not sensitive to smells, it's a great buy.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Picked this up as a free app, boy am I glad I downloaded it. Initially I thought it would be fun for my grandson, but I find that I am playing it just so my grandson could have more stages and vehicles to play.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I love all the songs on the album. Most are classics, particularly 'Reasons'. Can't get enough of that song. I play it repeatedly. Wonder why they've stopped releasing music.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game so far. There's a couple loading issues, but nothing major. I have a kindle, so maybe that's part of the issue.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Great game! I went in with an open mind, and found it to be a fast paced, heart racing shooter. I would like to give it 4 1/2 stars, because of a lack of weapon switching capability. My platform is a Kindle Fire HD 7\\". [[ASIN:B008GFREAU Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers]][[ASIN:B0083PWAPW Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers]]
B00AK77WPE|5.0|I was in this concert, and went I hear that songs again I can feel the same sensation. I feel so excited!!
B0089OBLDO|4.0|this device works fine as far as i am concerned... I bought a previous converter that doesnt respond as fast as this model. This is a cool purchase
1577314808|5.0|Was so excited reading this book, well written and its changed my perceptive to life. Defiantly will come back to it again and again.
1442359919|4.0|I loved this book. I read the book first and looked forward to the audio. However I did not much like the reader of this. He wasn't nearly as good as the man who read Duma Key. Hard to understand in some places too.
B007SGM084|5.0|I give it a 5 star, amazing n makes u want to be in love. I can't wait to see the movie.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Going into buying this app, I didn't expect much. After testing it out with an album, I was pleasantly surprised by the app's ability to deliver superb sound quality. When this app is activated, the sound quality is clearer and the bass is deeper. At this point, I have not tried all the presets, but I am happy with the ones that I have used thus far. In the app description, it states that these presets are best heard when headphones are used. I had satisfactory results playing my Kindle from my stereo system as well.<br /><br />A couple of recommendations I would make, and these are minor, are:<br /><br />1)Enable the ability to move the equalizer interface around on the screen.<br />2)Provide a visualization screen for when music is playing. This feature seems to be hard to find nowadays from back in the day.<br /><br />Paid version = AD FREE! This is always a plus in my book and I wish Amazon offered more apps with the pay option to opt out of unwanted advertising.<br /><br />****Update: Also works in music apps such as Rhapsody and SiriusXM.<br /><br />Anyone looking for a decent visualizer, I would recommend projectM Music Visualizer. Pair these two together and you are in for a good time!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read.I'm a little late on the series but I read the lost hero I thought it was extremely good.So when I saw this book it had to get it I already have the mark of Athena man rick if your reading this review you know how to make plot twist and I'm only 11 so it took me 2 weeks to finish.I was extremely addicted to the book so one to read the mark of Athena then next up the house of hades. So hurry up with that.=D
B008IJT0CE|5.0|If you need noise or music to sleep, have a baby or are curious if this could help you sleep better, this is for you! Smooth, infinitely customizable, and easy to use. Love this!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was really fun and I enjoyed a lot can't wait for new levels!! It was Evan fun for mm in his late thirties to a twelve year old girl
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I thought it was great. I read it quickly and was half disappointed that it didn't end as a conclusion, but at the same time half excited that there will be more to come. Cant wait to see what will happen to Eva and Gideon when the rest of the world find out they are already married! Well done Sylvia, I will definitely be getting the next one!
1451648537|4.0|It is nicely wrapped, good condition. It reached in about 2 weeks, which is a bit too long, maybe due to distance.
B000I0QLZU|4.0|I am a longtime fan for the Tombraider video game series. That is the reason that I bought this movie!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|watch it every night, I want to watch more series like Lark<br />Rise to Candleford.  I wish amazon would put more series on prime.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|This game I was playing at school and univercity. It's like I went back to that time. I didn't expect that they are still issuing this disc. Quality good. Received productreally fast. thank you. I enjoing it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|One  of Baldacci's better stories. I have enjoyed a number of his books, this is a very good one .I would pass it on to friends
B00DU74U74|1.0|Such a poorly made movie from such a good book. Bad acting, bad dialogue & bad direction. Wanderer talking to Melanie and vice versa so ridiculously done. Don't waste your money.
B00CL8D83U|2.0|Am I supposed to like this because it's a faster version of Elysium?  Two halves of the same coin, frankly.  (I actually filed my digital copy of this album along with Elysium as parts 1 and 2.  BTW I hated Elysium).<br />I know I'm a creature of the 80's so I'm supposed to like music from that era, right? So why does this retro 80's thing from Stuart Price sound so tired anymore?  No more cowbells, please!  Only decent track for me is \\"Vocal\\" and possibly their Bruce Springsteen cover.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It doesn't crash. You can play as the hero or the zombies. It has some strategy and a lot of slashing
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is going to sound a little crazy, but it is actually easier to sharpen my box cutter with this tool than to change the blade. I last used it to open some quikrete concrete sacks when mixing, and that got it kind of dull when I was breaking down boxes for recycling. I whipped this tool out (keep it on my keychain with my keys and pocket knife) and it was slicing through the cardboard like butter again.<br /><br />Actually, I often use my pocket knife to cut boxes as well, but the thick back of the blade doesn't slice into the boxes quite as easily.
0374533555|3.0|This book's bright spot and value is that it provides an introduction and overview to behavioral economics as it has progressed over the past 40 years or so. It does this primarily by discussing the psychological biases humans have. This is done, primarily, in terms of statistical and mathematical terms as opposed to non-quantitative terms such as, say, visual or audio biases. Coming from a Nobel Prize winning economist this is not exactly a surprise. It should be noted that this discussion is not very in-depth. The book is geared more to those with little or new knowledge of behavioral biases and behavioral economics as opposed to those who have such knowledge. Even a student who has taken only one class in behavioral economics would have been exposed to nearly everything in this book.<br /><br />One of the main weaknesses of the book, if not the main weakness of the book, is ironically the fact that the book does not have much of a discussion of the nexus between these behavioral biases, on the one hand, and economics, on the other. Related to this there is little discussion, with the exception of a little in the conclusion, on the impact of the contents of the book on the prevailing macro or micro economic theories, in particular rational expectations.<br /><br />In addition, and again ironically, the book has little if any discussion of possible causes of these biases. This is despite the fact that many seem to be caused by a subconscious need to reduce effort and the expenditure of energy on the part of decision makers. Could the root of these biases, possibly, have an evolutionary biological explanation especially in regard to helping humanity reduce its energy consumption (i.e., in much the same reason that cats nap a lot)? Unfortunately the author does not address this very important question.<br /><br />In short a decent introduction for novices to the field of biases in decision making and behavioral economics but not for those more knowledgeable.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|George Benson recreates the smooth sound of the King (no, not Elvis) and brings to life again these wonderful songs.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|So much great information in this book. It is very easy to follow, and Mike makes the science easy to understand. This book has everything you need to achieve the body that you want, you just have to put in the work (especially in the kitchen)! I highly recommend this book to anyone from beginner to expert.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and even though it's like Tempe le run or subway surfer, this is new and unique in it's own way. Make more minion games! Also, I hope Taengoo plays this game :)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have to say that I'm so happy I read the book.<br />I saw the movie and really love it, but after reading the book I have to say they miss so many great parts.<br />I have to say it really touch my heart.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was developed wonderfully!!! The graphics were amazing &amp; really made the game. I did have to use hints sometimes but I loved how they didn't just give you the answers, you still had to think just to get the hint.  Did I say the graphics were great?
B004VMUS9G|4.0|After losing my old fashioned alarm clock, this was about my only choice. Works well! I like that it starts a lower tone and gradually gets loud... and it has the sleek design of my Kindle!
B0053FANPY|5.0|It is great to see Vin D. and all the others so young an tough.  This is a great ride.  Enjoy
B0060MYM3S|4.0|as good as the first season - I think the story moved too quickly; a lot left out which was driven by the length of the books. Lots of things happening.  Given how well the first season was done I can't imagine why it was chopped up and parts that were rewritten weren't nearly as good as what happened in the book(s).  Didn't writers/producers think it was going to be a popular series? It could have had more episodes or TV seasons.  I suppose there is another season #4 coming but that won't make up for all the plots and subplots swept aside by season 2.  Haven't watched season 3 yet -- don't feel pressed to buy it or watch it.  Too bad.
0786180412|5.0|Told in a voice that makes it more real to the listener. The grandsons love it. They all listen before bedtime.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I had purchased the set of books but never read them.  Decided to buy the DVD - watched an episode or two and decided I'd better read some of the book to get a better feel for the characters...names, places, etc.  That helped.  I have enjoyed the first season immensely.  Be forewarned the violence and sex is quite graphic.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It's a game with stuff. And you can do stuff. With other stuff. Pretty fun. Lots of punching and flying and pew pew pow
1574216988|5.0|I have been line weaving for awhile and was familiar with a lot of the tangles but was glad to see how to shade some of the designs to get the 3d look. Small book but a lot of info.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is fun to play with your friends. You will always try to beat there score or stay in first place. Enjoy and have fun...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|so glad this game came out keeps the kids occupied as well as me love how we move from country to continent
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I love this game. Sure you have to pay for the stuff, but it is still the best doctor game I ever downloaded in my life
B0055SWM08|5.0|Everything that needs to be said about this game has been said, so I'll keep this short. The soundtrack is beautiful and relaxing. The gameplay is simple and easy to understand. The puzzles themselves have a nice difficulty curve, and each has a system for continuing further if you can't figure it out while also limiting how much you are allowed to use it. The graphics are gorgeous. I don't like to give five because nothing is perfect, but this gets close to it, and for that, it deserves five stars
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is my favorite app it's really funny when you run into other minions and all the costumes you can buy! It's addicting almost like temple run only with different places to run to villains to battle and fun obstacles and weapons to use! But the best part is riding fluffy unicorn through rainbows in the sky collecting points!!!!! I &lt;3 unicorns! lol<br />classic minion humor ;P
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I believed in the characters from the very beginning & hoped for a positive outcome, which is what happened. A very good insight into what people with emotional disorders deal with every day.
B000AP04OM|5.0|this movie was wanted at an elderly living facility where my father visits  his friend.  no one knew how to get a copy, so I looked on here. the movie was delivered quickly and was in perfect condition.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I loved the comparison of the different characters; a very thought-provoking book. His style of writing is very captivating & kept my interest until the very last page.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was great! Hunger Games movie was awesome so I can't wait for the movie to come out for this one as well.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|Clearly there was that cartoon element in the minds of the producer.<br />No kidding, there were times in this movie where it could be mistaken for a comedy, if it weren't for the carnage.  The events were that ludicrous.<br />I was half expecting Warren Beatty to step out from behind a curtain wearing a bright yellow suit.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hunger Games the movie was awesome too. I can't wait for this one to come out at the movies as well. I'm just sad that we'll have to see in in two parts.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|it socks it is the west game eves ot socks u will hats it I do and u will to
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The only thing I can think of is that it was a few hours of fun, then I started losing interest. My grandchildren love it so it will be enjoyed by them. Great game as far as the graphics are. No problems so far.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|My mom has it on her phone and i love playing it so i wanted to get it on my kindle fire i cant get it from facebook because i dont have a facebook. I want the game!!!
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|The worst Pendergast book I have read ....  Couldn't finish.  Writing was choppy and WAY to far fetched .....<br /><br />Not good!  Think I won't be reading Preston/Child in the future.  Too bad, the older books were so good!
B001LF347E|5.0|I bought this to go back to the beginning of the series - I was watching Season 3 at the time.  Going back to the beginning gave me the insight I was looking for to understand the nuances of the story, the plot and where the story was going.  I love this series.  The actors work so well together and it's a totally different take on the Arthurian Legend than the legends I read in my College English classes!  I love the camaraderie between Prince Arthur and Merlin and the comic twists thrown in the story too.  I have continued to purchase the ongoing series as they became available and it only gets better.  This is most definitely worth the money to get!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Good app but annoying sometimes. Alot of notifications when downloaded on a kindle fire. If say get the app if you have nothing else to do. Only because its addictive...
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Using this app on Kindle Fire and share feature stalls frequently. Must restart often. I hope an update is coming soon.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|This is just another knock off of the original, nothing really new other than the constant ads.<br />I do not recommend.
0307878899|5.0|Good read and good insight into the future. You get a lot out of his insights. Nicely done on the part of the author.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|My boy likes this game on my phone, it's one of the only ones he goes back to over and over again.  He directs the shark to swim all around and eat up fish and cute girls :)<br />I recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|You can't stop playing it's so cute and FUN I've seen the movie too,<br />But I give it 3 stars because when you first go in... (You may think that this is a lazy remark) but the loading takes FOR-EVER!!!! But I love it so I recommend it to you but beware of the &quot;LONG loading.&quot;
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|My 6 yr old loved it on my moms kindle. We both got it on the free app day. I have been trying to download it to my phone and finally got it on today. Then I could not get it to open, would crash before it started. Uninstalled several times and still the same thing. Also It would be great if we could move it to the sd card, this file size is HUGE! Bigger than facebook. I have multiple games with a simplar concept and they are 10  times smaller.  It doesnt specify in the desc. That this is a kindle verson only either...<br /><br />Once its able to stay open, be moved to the sd card or I buy a tablet which ever comes first, we will totally play this game!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I downloaded the app and it worked great. But once the kindle turned off i could not access the app unless i went back through the app store and found it. It would not properly download on my kindle or my cloud...
0007448058|5.0|Could not put these books down, read through these then bought the rest, now I am waiting for the last books to be written as my wife reads these.
B005FPT51K|3.0|Its a wonderful product, but Every now and then we have to restart it for it to log into the internet
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|After releasing numerous animals and breeding the guardians  the game had to be re installed! I lost everything and had to start over!
B001BZRUR4|3.0|Interesting concept but a little brutal. Like that it ended happily ever after. We all can be better than we think!
B000I9VOO4|4.0|Ordered and started watching in 5 min.  Good quality image & sound.  Easy to access.  Old school drama, unfortunately still relevant.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was very fun and challenging.  I am looking forward to the development of more levels. The game uses your logic to figure out what goes with what to solve it.
B00005JPD0|4.0|Mixed in with great action, there's the element of science fiction as well. If I say any more about it, it might spoil all the surprises of this movie, which is excellent from beginning to end. Not a single dull moment in the entire movie, even if one has to suspend belief in some parts. It's what movies should be.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I must admit, I love this game. It is so fun and challenging! I was immediately pulled in and swept away. This is no ordinary guessing game. This game sends you on a hunt to find clues on how to escape the room. All the clues tie in together so you have to find them all, and this game will sure have your brain working in overdrive. The only bad thing was there were no more floors to play. However it states more floors to come ( after floor 10) so I hope they come soon. I am very eager to play more.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used the Weather Channel app, with mixed results. A friend had told me about this one, and I decided to try it. I must say that this app is much more accurate and extremely easy to customize to your own personal preferences. I now use it exclusively.
B0089LOG02|5.0|It was better than I thought it would be at first. Great story!  I loved Vivian. Strong girl to have gone through all that and remained true to who she was.
B001TOD92C|5.0|an off the wall movie. yet for all of its nonconventional methodology the plot and characters work to make the a decent little movie.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Forget that the film didn't follow the book, that it deleted key scenes AND characters and was unable to portray the driving force between Lena and Ethan's relationship. The acting by the main character of Ethan was sub par, his southern accent felt like a caricature of the South. Every minute I spent watching this film made me glad I decided to read the books first because I had not made this decision I never would have picked up the books based on this film that lacked any clear reason for the choices characters made.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I thought the new format was ok.  but now I just get a black screen when I try to open the app.  It takes at least a minute to close the app.  I can still get to TWC on my browser.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like the upgrades for the game and going to different cities. I like the different characters and boards as well. Great game!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Another great app from Big Fish games. Hidden object games with intriguing story lines...what could be better? More of them!<br />Keep them coming!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|So addicting and challenging. Keeps me intrigued. Best puzzle game out there at the moment. Definitely one to try. Love the cute pudding too.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I passed this book by several times.  Something about the description and reviews made me reluctant.  So glad I broke down and read it.  You might think that the premise of the book would make for a limiting experience, but the author does a good job of describing what one might do if faced with this situation.  I particularly enjoyed the perspectives of both mother and child.  Give this book a try if you are curious.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a good challenge.  Not a walk in the park, but not a breeze either.  A good work out  for the brain, but not a mind strain. &quot;More please&quot;!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Only Gillian Flynn can transport the reader both back in time and drama to a really, really dark place.  Wow.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have a kindle fire and when the 0.7.2 update came out i was sooooo happy but as usual, 3 weeks later still no update for kindle fire. I wish Amazon would get its act together if they want to keep me as a customer. I mean really i am still waiting for the update. And watching everyone else have sooooo much fun on minecraft is sooooo hard! And my rating will stay at 1 star until they get there act to together. So who ever has a kindal fire and you are thinking about getting minecraft just save your money until they fix this problem! Thanks for reading. I hope it helped you.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|I like the sound of the album.  It sounds more like the Sabbath that I grew up listening to as opposed to the more recent albums.  Takes a couple of listens to really appreciate the material.  Just one listen isn't enough to get a real good feel for everything.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved it.  Just challenging enough but not so herd you want ti throw your tablet!  Please make more levels soon.
B002TXZRNQ|4.0|Life's beauty is in the simple things. So often we find ourselves searching for happiness in the wrong places. This book is filled with valuable lessons taught through Morrie's life experiences. What a wonderful man.
1490313370|5.0|This guy delivers.  He sets aside the BS and just writes what's on his mind.<br /><br />He's very human - he documents his failures in gut-wrenching detail, only to point out that these failures are opportunities for growth, and that in every failure you have a choice to either grow or wither.<br /><br />I wouldn't want to fight this guy.  Even if he couldn't fight - he wouldn't give up.  If there's one thing I've learned from this book, it's that you need to put the oxygen mask on your face before helping the people around you.  Or, put another way, not to allow people to take advantage of your skills and time.  Choose yourself first, because that's all you can really control anyway.
B0012TWRAO|4.0|This thing holds great on my Ducati.  The paint is easily rubbed off so be careful with the wrench when you are installing it.  Maybe use a piece of paper to protect the base.
B003WKOU0G|4.0|Provides the latest thinking about babies etc. easy reading and engaging. If there is going to be a baby in your life as a parent or grandparent it is a great book
B00DHNJCKQ|1.0|I sat and watched all 1 hour 58 minutes of this movie and I can never get that time back. The plot had too many holes in it. I can go wit unbelievable, just make an effort to tie things together. Colin is a great actor. It is the only reason I watched the whole thing.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Loved this game and played for hours to earn a great white and was half way to a Megalodon. Then on the most recent update the game got stuck and I had to re-load the game. It recognized my name from the apple Game Center but all my progress was lost. Keep this in mind, fun while it lasts but the game is very twitchy, and it will lose your progress, just a matter of time. Play at your own risk.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Short but captivating! Great read. Would recommend to anyone wanting to learn about a great man  and get a push to start living and succeeding. Our lost generation needs it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was fun also challenging I hope the the next level comes it soon<br />I played it 20 times it was that good.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|This awesome music has the right beat and rhythm, with accent, meter and just the right tempo to keep you going.
B00AVFO41K|3.0|I downloaded this app a few days ago when it was the free app of the day.  I have mixed feelings on it.  The game play is enjoyable and addicting, but there are some serious flaws that stop me from giving it a high rating.<br /><br />First of all, as other reviewers have pointed out, there are no in game instructions.  I enjoyed figuring out the rules on my own.  But, there were some things that were not immediately obvious.  For example, it was several games before I accidentally discovered that diagonal rows of 5 count too.<br /><br />Another draw back is that there are no in-game volume controls.  It's possible to turn off the sound by turning off the sound on your device.  But, if you want to listen to music while playing without hearing the game's sound effects, you're out of luck.  The sound effects themselves aren't bad, but they can be distracting if you want to listen to something else.<br /><br />But, the biggest problem with the game is that the game itself seems to be buggy.  Since there are no written rules, I sometimes find myself wondering if the game is really buggy or if I'm just running into rules I don't know about.  But, I think I've played enough to say that it's buggy.  One issue is that rows containing wilds do not always clear.  Something like WGWWW (where W is wild and G is green) won't always clear.  Another issue is that sometimes a stone will not move to a space that it looks like it should be able to reach.  The first time this happened, I wondered if I was just missing some obstruction, but clicking the spot next to the one I wanted worked fine.  It can be really frustrating when you plan to move a stone to a certain spot and then can't.<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewers who say the game is too hard.  The point of the game seems to be to play as long as possible and to beat your high score, so it's like you're playing against yourself.  It seems unreasonable to think that you should be able to completely clear the board at some point, and if it was possible to play forever, that would be boring.  That said, I would like to see some sort of reward for getting a good score or for beating a previous high score, maybe and animation or just the words \\"Good Job\\" on the screen.  As it is, you just get \\"Game Over,\\" which does make it seem like you never win.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is pretty fun and a little bit challenging!  Great for lunch break at work!  And to play with the kids!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great app. It keeps my brain thinking in a fun way. I can't wait for them to come out with some new levels!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|The Jungle Book is probably one of the most well known Disney animated films. The film is from 1967, and it is based on the book by Rudyard Kipling. This is a fun movie with lovable characters, and several hilarious moments. Baloo is awesome, Bagheera is smart and cute, and Mowgli is really sweet. The film also has a mean, but likable villain. This is a great Disney classic.
B000007MVD|3.0|It is a great window into the early days of the group<br />the songs themselves are probably not as iconic as the total look into the group's early days....
B0089LOG02|5.0|The characters are very engaging right from the beginning.  A very interesting story, with a subject that I did not know enacting about before reading this book (the orphan trains)
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I read Always Know What to Say for work. I am working with a shy person hoping to help them break out of their shell. Unfortunately, this isn't the book to do that.<br /><br />The chapter on best questions to keep a conversation going was the most interesting one. The subjects given would actually help someone who has nothing to say.<br /><br />The rest of the chapters can be summed up in one sentence: In order to carry on a good conversation you can't be a quiet person.<br /><br />The author talks about being positive, watching body language and showing people that you like them. None of that tells the reader what to always say. The read was a quick one, luckily.<br /><br />This is one book I will not push on to anyone else. There has to be better resources to help the `quiet person' break through.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I like this book a lot. Lois Lowry is truly a gifted author. And a good author.  By the way I am eleven years old and<br /> in 6th grade. I like this book better than number the stars which I read in fifth grade.  Four stars! Not five
B0098460O4|5.0|I first heard Jonathan and Charlotte on an &#34;infomercial&#34; and decided to order it.  The CD was delightful and I enjoyed every song on it.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes this type of music.
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|Super fun figure. Durable and solid. My daughter loves him! We're all fans of the Funko line of figures here.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|We all know that Android is far superior to Apple. Why then do developers continue to release inferior versions to their Android customers?<br /><br />In the apple version of Osmos you can play a multi-player game against other people over a wifi connection. Its a lot of fun!<br /><br />I refuse to rate a developer high when they releas a half-assed version to a superior platform. Especially when they have proven they can do better.<br /><br />I will change my rating to 5 stars when they release the full version to Android.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Amazing movie loved every bit of it. This review is for the idiots posting before me about it coming with 2d formats or ultraviolets. Who cares don't lower the star rating over trivial things just comment. BEST MOVIE EVER FOR AN AMERICAN HERO
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I am not a great game person but this game is enjoyable.  The price is right and I am getting better.
0307408833|2.0|Like many of the other reviews, I found that Erin McKenna's \\"amazing gluten-free recipes\\" were either not entirely gluten free or weren't here recipes at all. I don't usually write bad reviews. I try to give the recipe the benefit of the doubt. However, after multiple attempts and a lot of money spent, I finally succumbed to the fact that the recipes just weren't going to work and never would.<br /><br />If you still feel the need to purchase this book, the only palatable recipe I enjoyed was for blueberry muffins - and even still I ended up switching out some of the ingredients.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I'm not saying these are bad but I am a little disappointed in the lack of good bass and a little more disappointed with the max volume level.<br /> The surround and other features are up to snuff and I'm getting used to them more each day. Changing from speakers and sub woofer to headphones is a huge change for me to adjust too. I may be expecting things from a headset that they just can't accomplish.<br />I don't like the fact that the max volume level is so low though. I would think that they would be able to get loud enough to not have to run them at the maximum setting.<br />Oh , one other thing is that the power cord plug is so tight that every time I unplug it I'm afraid I'm going to break something. Out of the hundreds of items I have used with plugs, this is by far the most difficult to unplug by a factor of 3x-4x.<br />They fit and feel good on both my head and around my ears on the plus side. The large cup area allows my ears to fit inside without touching any of the padding. I'm able to wear them for over 2 hours at a time without any discomfort at all.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I hope to use it daily, but right now I am just happy that it is there for reference and support.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I've always enjoyed Hans Zimmer music. When I saw Man of Steel I loved the music! I listen to this soundtrack every day. The music is beautiful, Hans Zimmer is a genius! The music goes perfectly with the movie and while listening to the soundtrack I can remember some great parts of the film.
0385349947|5.0|I REALLY LOVE IT AND THE AUTHOR.<br />SAW HER TED LECTURE ON THE INTERNET, LOVED HER AT THE FIRST SIGHT.
B000SSV8HI|5.0|Good collection of the Rolling Stones' world-wide concerts. I'm glad to have it in my video collection. I like the way the menus are set up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is way better than temple run its more fun and bbm it gives u easier bbm opportunities to save to save yourself it's<br />worth paying money 4
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|The bad: Other reviewers have mentioned that the switching perspectives can get confusing, and I admit, there were a few times where I had to go back to a chapter's beginning to double check who was telling a portion of the story. There were times where I had to google some of the words in Farsi, since my kindle dictionary didn't know them, but that's more of a minor inconvenience. However, in all honesty, the book is pretty straightforward and follows a pretty clear timeline.<br /><br />The good: Overall, this is a great story dealing with characters who are complex and multi-faceted. Without spoiling anything, every character has both dark and redeeming qualities, which I appreciate. Despite the occasional use of Farsi (which in most cases you can figure out based on the context) the book is an easy read. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Can't wait to read the last book in the trilogy. This book leaves you hanging on the edge wanting more.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging puzzles that keep your interest. If you get stuck the help button will keep the game moving along. I recommend this game for the 2 dollar price.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|The game should have atleast more time like 20 mins or increase the time beacause<br />I want to explore and do more
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love it!!! its challenging but doable. makes you think but not to the point of frustration. you want to give up but wants to keep playing at the same time because there's hope that you will figure it out. cant wait for more rooms. room 10 was tricky but i figured it out. yay!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well written a very good story line dealing with a not talked about subject. The minds ability to like different things for no reason or explanation.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|This was a terrible film. The original was 10 times better. This was a joke. This film was bad from start to finish.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Ths app is amazing and very helpful I cannot think of a time I don't use this app I love using it too try new effects I wanna become a photographer so this app lets me explore new effects with photos I love this app.
B000005RQT|5.0|One of the most memorable and iconic opening tracks in rock history - Speed King.  A must have for any heavy metal and Deep Purple fan.  What an amazing and virtuosic line up.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|its aswome  it lets u text and meet new friends it let's u communicate with our family and stuff like that
B00915G6WQ|4.0|I found this season of Dexter to be all over the place.  They had too many story lines going on at once.  I think it would have been better if the writers focused on one or two things, instead of spreading themselves thin on multiple plot lines.  I love the series and own the entire run on DVD, but this was not the best season.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|So awesome  I love it my friend named allison saw it and she was like get it GET IT I said no am sorry friend am so sorry:) for give me
B004J4WLB4|5.0|one of the most compelling books I have read in a long while.  Victoria is so unlike anyone I have ever known but her persona is so intriguing.  She comes from such despair and needs so much love. She finds it in Elizabeth and Grant.  I couldn't put it down. I needed to know what happened. What did she do to lose Elizabeth?  What did Catherine do to cause Elizabeth to leave?  How would it all resolve?  Did not disappoint.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Pretty fun to kill time with. I like all the stuff you can build. Really can't think of anything else, but it is fun.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Mr Crouch is a brilliantly gifted writer.  This is the second book I've read by him and he keeps you interested from start to finish.  I look forward to reading more of his works.

B002RKSZKI|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Pride and Prejudice Is my favorite of Jane Austen, but this was an amusing and enjoyable read.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|I have a plethora of cassette tapes I was missing so much.  This device enabled me to make them onto cd's.  It is time consuming, as you have to start and stop it track by track (song by song).  Otherwise there are no breaks on the cd.  It's been great to listen to the good old songs from the 80's.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Awesome book!  Sad, funny, romantic, on the edge of my seat at times.  Would recommend this book to any romantic.  Go Nicolas Sparks!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|ERRR MA GERRRD! It was, well, AMAZING! All the new characters were just plain confusing yet amazing and so was this book! Finnick for ever &#60;3
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It is a nice way to kill some time and end up with a really nice aquarium. would reccomend it for a nice change of pace from the killing games.

B00BTV62KG|5.0|A fun album - full of great grooves , and funky tunes ! Get up , get down , and have a blast !!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love the new look of the app. I find it easier to follow the weather reports the design is also more pleasing to the eye.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is the best game ever!!! Is now my favorite game,it's just like a console game. You need to get this right now!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|a really fun game to play with your friends....it can become an addiction ....so be careful and enjoy..diamond dash is a game for all ages
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Okay so when I first watched this movie, I really liked johnny depp' s acting, but not so much of the movie. Then I read the ronald Dahl book, and I must say this is an almost spot on representation of it. The original with gene wilder was way off from the book. They changed Alot, with this movie not so much. Which is why I highly recommend this movie, it is a must see!
B0006GAOCW|4.0|Cute movie! Not a movie worthy of any sort of reward other than it's cute to watch and good enough for the whole family.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I don't enjoy a lot of games ....but this game I find quite enjoyable.  Each floor is more challenging than the one before.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|LOVE this show!! Can not get enough of this show!!! Can't wait for the new season to start and get season three on DVD.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is an epic tycoon in which you level up with xp like any other game. Each time you level up you unlock new things. At first you level up quickly, but when you get to a higher level, you level up slower.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app does what it is suppose to do, and does it very well. It reports the weather in most any location. Solid app, I recommend it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I loved this movie. I know that many people are upset with the changing of the Star Trek mythology, but I say this is a welcome refresh.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Stick with the regular Google play version. The stupid version, which can't remember my login information, requires you to login first so if you only have a few seconds to catch a song then you are out of luck. Missed a few songs I really wanted to ID. Would give 0 stars but you can't.
B002ZG97RE|1.0|British director Paul Greengrass produced this film in 2010 as a political statement very thinly disguised as a thriller. It is a confusing film, rich in conspiracy cliches, and both poorly filmed and acted. It is not surprising that it turned out to be a box office flop. The blatant political statement accuses the United States of falsely claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction as an excuse for the Americans invading Iraq in 2003 and seizing its oil riches. After World War I, modern Iraq was cobbled together from ethnic populations of Kurds, Sunnis, and Shi'ites who hate each other. It can be argued that the Americans made a grave mistake in totally disbanding the Iraqi army because it then required foreign soldiers to control the violence that was released between the three major ethnic groups in Iraq. It was already clear by 2010 that, despite the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the United States had no intention of seizing control of the oil wealth of the can of worms that is modern Iraq and was intent upon getting out of Iraq as quickly as possible. Clear evidence that the Americans did not intend to seize control of Iraq's oil was not going to stop Paul Greengrass making this political statement.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Everything works as advertised.<br /><br />The only quibbles I have are with the storage case that ships with this and the packaging.<br /><br />The plastic case is designed with a living hinge that looks very flimsy and is sure to soon give out, leaving users without a form fitting case.<br /><br />Also, the packaging is overkill, I think, and could be scaled down for eco purpoes.
0670014893|5.0|Menace is the magic ingredient that spices le Carre's charismatic prose. He does it so well - peerless, in my opinion. And the menace grips throughout A Delicate Truth. I had read some negative comments before starting the book and therefore was apprehensive, but I can reassure other le Carre fans that this equals his best.<br />Dialogue, structure, pace and voice are also superb as usual, and the characters memorable. There's an underlying message, too, in a plot set mostly in Britain. This comment from one of the players has a disconcerting grain of fact: \\"The whole country's crying out for a new elite. Begging for one. For people like you - real men - the real men of England, unspoiled - all right, dreamers too - but with their feet on the ground.\\"<br />This is England in the Arab Spring and a world of shady liaison between entrepreneurs and government ministers.<br />My most dramatic chill came mid-book at a Welsh country fair. Sir Christopher, lord of the manor, recognises a face from his secret past . . . but let's not spoil the ongoing menace.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|Seems to be fine.  I do however wish it had a strap to keep it shut. Not a huge deal though.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I'm not a big country fan but I do like this CD. It's got good songs and I like the stories he tells. Of course who doesn't like Blake Shelton!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My daughter love's this game. It's like an she's dressing real dolls but without the mess. The only problem is that this game will cut off without warning. And there's no choice of brown eyeliner.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|I just don't want to spend the time to learn the ins and outs of it but it works just fine.
0385523912|5.0|This is a great book--highly recommended.  The stories flow like a fiction novel, but sadly the harsh reality sinks in.  The books amazing detail of each character's life shines through each page.  I couldn't put it down--especially at the half way point.  EVERYONE should read this book!  The human will to survive is absolutely amazing, this book shows that in great detail.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Good game.  It takes some getting used to.  Energy runs out to easy.  Having a good time playing while the baby sleeps.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app can start a virus on your mobile device because when I was playing on my kindle fire it froze and I couldn't get out of it so I turned it off then when I tried to turn it on it wouldn't turn on but you could still hear the music playing but it wasn't showing on the screen but my grandma fixed it.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Love the Daniel Craig version of James Bond.<br />A great movie. I also have the other two in the series, this makes a nice trio.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Up to the standard of Khaled Hosseini's previous works.  Good family fictional book.  The setting appeared to be truthful.  I would recommend reading it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You know those books that are heartwrenching and that change your life forever? Well Hopeless is one of those. Seriously it is so wonderful and amazing and one of my favorite favorite favorite books ever.<br /><br />Sky lead a pretty sheltered life before she met Dean Holder. Dangerously sexy and passionate, Holder turns Sky's life upside down in every way. The deeper she gets with Holder, the more questions arise about Sky's past that she has no clue how to figure out.<br /><br />Sky is such a strong girl. God, everything she had to deal with and conquer is just amazing. She has been through hell and back, literally and taken it all as best as she could. I probably would have curled up into a little ball and wither away slowly but Sky? Sky is impressively resilient when faced with everything against her.<br /><br />Dean Holder is a beautiful man. As much as Sky has been through, he's been through equally as much. After the tragedy that occurred in his family, he went through a really rough patch but then he met Sky. Now he had someone else to protect. He's insanely swoony and basically the sweetest guy ever. He's passionate about everything in his life, good and bad, and it translates him into him loving Sky more than anything in the world.<br /><br />Karen, Sky's guardian, has been through a lot though as well. She made her choices and she did the best she could. I really admired her so much. Breckin, Sky's bestest friend, is adorable and is there for Sky when no one else was.<br /><br />The plot is one of the best I've ever read about. Everything connects in such a way that I would have never seen coming and the unpredictability of it amazed me. Holder and Sky need each other more than anything. They're connected in ways they didn't even imagine when the first met. Their sexual tension is off the wall and they have the bestest first non-kiss in the history of non-kisses.<br /><br />Seriously guys, I live this book so much. You will too. Losing Hope, Hopeless in Holder's POV was, in my opinion, even better than Hopeless. It is a definite must read. I can't wait to start Slammed, Colleen's other series which I has heard is equally as perfect and amazing. Have you guys read it? How do you like it?!<br /><br />Favorite Swoon-worthy Quote: He kisses the edges of my mouth several times, trailing close to my lips and down my chin and across my neck. The faster he breathes, the faster I breathe. The faster I breathe, the faster he plants kisses all over my neck. The faster he plants kisses all over my neck, the faster we move together - creating a tantalizing rhythm between us that, according to my pulse, isn't going to last much longer.<br /><br />Review: 5/5 Tar Heels!

B00866JLEG|5.0|Did not see this when it first came out ... I had been disappointed with the last one I saw.  But, after watching at a friends house, I discovered this was a great story & a great film ... one I wanted for my collection!!
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This is a key player for my tethered shooting. It is a little longer than I needed but i would have paid more for a shorter one. Works as described.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this as  a young girl and I have now read it as an eighty-some woman to relive memories. I had forgotten a lot of the story, only that I knew it ended happily! I was not disappointed. I love this book and highly recommend it to young and old. It makes one feel happy with the world!
