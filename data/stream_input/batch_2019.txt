B005651RDS|4.0|This was a strange story set in strange circumstances, but managed to convey understanding of how people act in those circumstances.  It was set in a real political context in New Guinea, and the fictional characters had veracity. Well worth reading.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun I highly recommend it. the graphics is really cool and high quality. If you don't have it get it totally worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Guys don't buy those other fake Minecraft games. If you think about it all of the other crap adds up to be like 20 bucks. While you can get caught more for 6
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a writer like Caitlin Moran in a very long time.<br /><br />There is so much passion in what she writes and how she expresses herself.  I was easily swept into each topic and story, that I felt a range of emotions from righteous indignation to laugh out loud hysterics and everything in between.<br /><br />Whether you agree with her views or not, her writing is exciting and dynamic.  You will probably find yourself being transported by her words and imagining yourself or someone else in many of the situations she describes.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it Down!!!!!!!I can't wait to read mockingjay<br />This is the best book in the world...it's like the words are coming to life before my eyes
B006TJXZ30|1.0|I have had to google instructions for  quite a few things because the app doesn't work like I think it should.  For example, importing contacts.  I tried to do it the way Hotmail instructs, but the app gave me two options for importing &#34;from&#34; and neither worked.  Then it said to make a file of my old contacts and import that.  Didn't work.  I ended up searching for a third party importer.  I don't like that I can't click on quite  few addresses at once to make my groups, but have to do it one by one in another app.  I stopped using the Hotmail Live App Tile that came on the new Win 8 laptop.  I signed in on a regular internet explorer page, right clicked and pinned it to start, to create my own tile.  It is not live.  It cannot get any mail from my old POP server, or even Yahoo, so I have had to create 3 email tiles for myself.  All in all, quite the bust.  Hopefully they will get their act together and make all of these things work, since I have changed my personal email for the first time in over a decade and don't want to change it again.  I am giving it a few months, then bagging it if things don't improve.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is a fascinating story that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the book.  The world and system of magic are presented very naturally - no long-winded explanations or out-of-story descriptions like in so many other fantasy stories.  When I purchased this book I didn't realize that the author, Brandon Sanderson, was the same many finishing The Wheel of Time series.  I had read the first five books of that series years ago, but lost interest when Jordan seemed unwilling to end the series.  Now that I know that Sanderson has finished the last few books I fully intend to finsih that series.<br /><br />I can not wait to read more books by this author.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|This book seemed like a heavy dose of common sense and checklists.  Neither is a bad thing, at all, yet this work didn't really resonate with me, nor my reason for reading it.
0765325950|5.0|Excluding books 7 through 10, a Wheel of Time has been a great series.  A Memory of Light is among the best of the 14 books and ties up almost all of the loose ends.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|This overly long film was a test to see how long we could keep watching.  The story line was pretty much incomprehensible, dark, gloomy, and made the experience feel like a chore.  We stuck it out and then wished we hadn't spent the $4.99 to rent it.  I had heard some good things about it, which made it all the more frustrating.  Give me the first &#34;Batman&#34; series any day.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very fun game. I would LOVE a sequel. I found it very addicting with just the right level of difficulty. I've played a lot of the hidden object/mystery adventure games and I prefer the ones that are a mix of both with a full story line as well. I wish there were more like this one available. Especially since I've already completed most of the others. Please make more like this one. Thank you.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I love how this app will auto download ur pictures! There isnt another app out there that will do that!
B0053B347M|5.0|I admit it. I'm a sucker for all kinds of Lighting. To me, lighting is everything. So when I saw this &#34;Halo&#34; for my PC Monitor and saw that it was only like $7.00, I thought &#34;Why not!?&#34;. What a COOL light this is! Its just a Strip of super Bright LED lights that Sticks to the back of your Monitor & then plugs into any USB port. It has an On/Off switch and is just plain neat! Your Monitor comes to life with the Halo. If you like lighting like I do, this is a must have!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|this was the first time I didn't like John Grisham's main character.  He was a whiner.  No whining!  The story was structured differently from some of his other too.  But I found that interesting.  It's been a while and three books back so I'm sorry I can't be more specific here.  the book okay.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I am far from being a child. The message is to never give up on your dream, regardless of what others say, who/what you are, or the circumstances into which you were born. Powerful!

0765325950|3.0|100% Spoiler free review.  I'm writing this review to help other people enjoy this book as much as possible.<br /><br />This is not a 5 star book, and it never could be.  There's no way that something this monumental could have ever been wrapped up flawlessly.  It wasn't going to make everybody happy, nor should it have.<br /><br />I've read everything by both Jordan and Sanderson, and enjoyed all of it.  I feel like Sanderson writes amazingly creative, detailed worlds with great backstories, rules, and plots.  But I have yet to see him write a single character that was more than surface-deep.  Yes, his characters \\"develop,\\" but only as the plot requires.  I enjoy reading Sanderson when I want to read a cool, plot-driven story.<br /><br />One thing I absolutely loved about Jordan was his ability to put two characters that were on the same \\"side\\" in the same room, have them hate each other, not talk out their differences, and to behave in a way that felt natural and character-driven.  This is actually what most people seem to complain about when discussing Jordan, that things \\"progress too slowly.\\"<br /><br />And I'm not hating on Sanderson, just pointing out what I feel like are the major differences in the two writers.  Yes, they both write about fantasy worlds, but in my mind they're completely different.  Tractors and cars both (generally) have four wheels, but you wouldn't use a car to plow a field any more than you'd use a tractor for a road trip, and that's how awkward I felt reading Sanderson's take on WoT.<br /><br />I feel a bit like after watching Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers, Michael Bay stepped in to direct major parts of Return of the King.<br /><br />Yes, the 15-year old in me thinks more explosions would be awesome, but that same 15 year old couldn't put down Eye of the World, and re-read it every time a new book came out.  I remember excitedly going back through earlier books to find a chapter, paragraph, or single line of dialogue that Jordan had planted years earlier.  And he'd reveal with no fanfare, it would be the kind of thing you would only catch on your 2nd or 3rd read-through, making it all the more profound.  Compare that to Sanderson once literally having a main character drop out of the sky and chopping a nemesis in half.  I have no problem with that, but I enjoy both styles for completely different reasons.<br /><br />So to enjoy this book, as well 3 of Sanderson's WoTs, you will just have to be forgiving of his dialogue, occasional out-of-character actions, and every once in a while dropping in some of his hollywood pop-film style writing and \\"witty\\" banter/humor.  It's not bad, it's just different.<br /><br />Sanderson is not a bad author, he's just very different and the transition is awkward.  Kudos to him for doing as well as I think anyone alive today could have.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book picks up where the first one left off.  I was facinated getting the different families perspectives on how World War II unfolded.  I really look forward to the final book of the trilogy.

0545265355|5.0|Of course I had my doubts about The Hunger Games Trilogy Books considering the &#34;hype&#34; of the movie. Once I started reading the first book I couldn't put it down & had to keep reading until I finished the last book.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I bought this for my little sister, but I actually enjoy watching it.<br />Ohana means family, and family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Im a middle aged man so not the demographic, but I totally see the appeal by its cliched formula. Insecure girl tries to change a handsome and powerful man through the use of his love for her. Throw in a bunch of alpha male induced orgasms and you have the ultimate female fantasy.

B009NQKXYK|3.0|Not sure how I'm supposed to rate this as it's 2 parts really, the streaming service and the movie. I've used Amazon's streaming service in the past with frequent issues but this movie worked great. The image quality was excellent and it never froze on me even with frequent pauses and rewinds.<br /><br />The movie itself had excellent visuals and the story line was interesting. Without giving spoilers the most I can say I was disappointed it was so heavy handed with the Christian message. I wanted a sci fi flick, not church.
0316228532|2.0|This book presents a fictional small town full of petty, miserable people who practice petty politics, are frustrated in love and are devoid of altruism - except for the character who died and is mourned as the would-be savior now gone. The dead saviour had made an attempt to help some of the public-housing kids living amongst drug-users, etc.<br />Rowling writes well and vividly. I kept hoping something good would happen, so I read the entire book. Part of the way through, without knowing of Rowling's work for a disadvantaged children's charity,I felt it sounded like a pamphlet advertising for a charity.<br />This book contrasts sharply with the HP series (that I loved), which speaks of love, loyalty, bravery in a world threatened by evil. \\"HP\\" was drawn vividly, with hope and energy. \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is dreary and negative.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Typical fare from Seth Macfarlane, a mix of 80s humor, stereotype jokes, and occasional shock humor. The movie had several funny moments but really is no different from the TV show. The fact that Ted sounds exactly like Peter Griffin and Mila Kunis is in it as well did not help disguise the fact. If you like Family Guy you will probably enjoy it, but if you no longer find Family Guy edgy then this will be a long movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Has a good story line and the actors portray a team/family togetherness to get the job completed while good overcomes evil. We watch one of the shows on a regular basis. Wish it was still a current program.
B007V65R54|3.0|No doubt written by a brilliant individual; while the book offers some important insights/lessons which we can consider the signal there is much noise about how clever the author is. If that point wasn't already recognized by the public the book wouldn't exist. To paraphrase the saying, an adequate story teller gets to the point, a good one makes it interesting, and a great one leaves you wanting more. In this case I'd say it was adequate.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If we were out in space living, this team of people doing the best they can are the ones I would like to be with.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|It's good. --Not great. My wife and I definitely enjoyed it. It's a solid evening's entertainment thanks to the characters portrayed by the strong cast.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|On recommendation from a friend, I bought the dvd.  Wow, I love, love, love this series.  Well written and just so inspiring about a time when civility was practiced in all of society.  Enjoy all the characters interactions, especially between the Americans and Brits.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Cute movie. I don't know how Pixar keeps coming up with these stories. But another job well done I must say.
0307454568|5.0|I choose this book because I had read the other books in the series and wanted to read the rest.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Once again Kid Rock has done an amazing job.  I love every song on this cd and can't wait to get in the truck to listen to it.
0316228532|1.0|Self-mutilation, drug and acohol abuse, child neglect, child abuse, child sexual abuse, abject poverty, crimes of various sorts, various stages and kinds of infidelity and betrayal, several personality disorders, violent family conflict, even gross obesity and virulent acne -- what on earth has Ms. Rowling missed?  And all in a small English village with a not very credible veneer of propriety.<br /><br />In truth, Ms. Rowling misses quite bit.  It's not that anything here shocked or surprised me -- I have worked as a pychotherapist and (concurrently) in child welfare and child protection for better than 30 years, and you may trust me that Ms. Rowling has not begun to scratch the surface of the terrible things that can and do happen in the world.  They simply do not happen in the way Ms. Rowling has presented them.<br /><br />The characters range from psychopathic (albeit the accepted word for psychopathy these days is \\"anti-social personality disorder\\") to silly and venal.  The situations they find themselves in and/or create for themselves range from truly tragic to, once again, silly and venal (and well-deserved).  Ms. Rowling does not seem to know the difference, or if she does, not how to convey it.  A small child's drowning weighs the same as a bored wife's drunken come-on with a teenager.  Really?<br /><br />There are some genuine insights and accurate moments of characterization, but the piling on of the seven deadly sins spread across an entire municipality erases them.  It's as if poor little Pagford had Aids, schizophrenia, virulent eczema, cancer, polio, dementia, pneumonia, chlamydia, lupus, Parkinson's Disease, and killer bad breath all at the same time.<br /><br />Ms. Rowling takes us slumming in this novel, and never quite lets go of her  disdain for her own characters.  I think we're supposed to be shocked, but the presentation is on the level of Peyton Place -- for those readers old enough to remember that outmoded, outdated expose of middle classrespectability.<br /><br />Worst of all, and in defiance of other reviews on this site, there is not a shred of humor, irony, or true wit in this long, drawn-out, and ultimately flat narrative ( a criticism in itelf).<br /><br />It's been done -- and still is being done -- far, far better.  \\"Sex in the City,\\" \\"Desperate Housewives,\\" etc., etc.  Has Ms. Rowling seen them?  Besides, Miss Marple knew it all along.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Although reminiscent of my days in the 70s' it was a poor movie. The dancing was good but the story line and acting leaves a lot to be desired.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game. It has a point and goal to achieve so its better than drop a coin and wait.  It is frustrating waiting for coins to generate but only because its so addictive. Fun for all ages
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show ever made.  Despite the creative differences behind the scenes, the story stands on its own.  Can't wait for February 10th!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This was one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen! I'm so sorry I wasted my time and my money!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. Not only is it a hidden objects game, it has an exciting story line, mini puzzles, beautiful scenery and lots of other exciting things to do....
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have purchased many headphones over the years, but this is definitely the best! I didn't even realize how bad the one I had been using was until I plugged in this one. Both the sound quality and volume immediately increased. You can't go wrong for the price. In fact, I am ordering a second one.
0345529057|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy series ever written, and this version of the set is great because they are small, portable, and easy to read.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I thought this was funny however the language was awful.  I did not realize I rented it unrated...I would not do so again due to the vulgar language.
B00025ETIW|1.0|I bought this album back when it first came out after hearing whatever the first single was that was released. After listening to this album multiple times trying to get anything out of it i finally retired it to the bottom of my cd rack. Out of sight out of mind. This album goes absolutely nowhere. As a huge music enthusiast this is one peice of garbage i regret ever buying.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|I would not rent it again because it was not a very good movie.  If you want people to review movies and books you should not require so many words or people will not do so.
030758836X|4.0|It's an amazing story written with each person, husband and wife writing the events as they impacted them. I found it a good read, written well. But, I must say, disturbing.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Love this movie.  Always a classic with our family.  Alan Rickman especially does an outstanding job.  A must see movie!
B009R5GR1K|5.0|This is the only dictionary that I use. Well worth the money. I had the free version and thought I would try this and it hasn't let me down yet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. I could not put it down!!!! So good. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to read!
0765325950|5.0|Being a refugee from the Dark Tower camp, I am admittedly jaded and cynical when it comes to how a series Ive spent almost 2 decades of my life reading will end. I didnt really believe that this series would be able to stay true to the immediate love I had for The Eye of The World in its closing. If I had to name the one book that most made me into the huge fan of the genre I am today, that would be it. The world that Jordan created had an infinite horizon, when anything could happen and there was always more unknowns waiting to be discovered. Reading the next books as they came out over the years became bittersweet, as I loved every minute I spend in Jordans world but hated how quickly that time flew by and the wait for the next one. As the series progressed, the much-lamented bloat of the story became more obvious, to the point where it seemed each new book was only a set-up for the next without actually moving the story any further. Still, I powered through them because I knew I would be that much closer to the end (if it ever came). Yet when I finally saw that the end was here, I stalled. I didnt want the series I loved so much despite its flaws to end badly, but because of the time Ive spent and the scope of the books I just couldnt see Sanderson bringing everything together in a way that lived up to the 1st books promise. I couldnt be happier with the masterpiece that Sanderson created, not just in the books he wrote, but in saving the world Jordan created and in many ways making it better. The people who rated it less than 4 stars are entitled to their opinion, but if you're a WOT fan, you owe it to yourself to make this (and any other review) merely academic. That being said, this last book is one of the only (if not THE only) books I've ever actually cheered for (Lan and Egwene are two absolute badasses). I couldnt recommend it more as worth the extra money to buy now as opposed to waiting for the e-release. Im actually not sad at all that a 20 year adventure is over, because I know that when I pick up that first book for the umpteenth time to start it all over, the end thats waiting for me exceeds that promise after all.<br /><br />P.S. To the geniuses that are rating this book a star because its not out on E-book, you sound like a bunch of entitled, spoiled children who are incapable of grasping what exactly the point of the ratings system is. So to help you, let me explain: The rating system is what we use to give our overall opinion of the book. By book, I mean the content and meaning the words on the page convey, not the condition of the book itself (as I saw on one mental giants review). It is a way of critiquing the efforts of an author to tell a story, not a choice made by an authors publisher regarding the medium by which a book is conveyed. Nor is it a method of expressing your displeasure at the time your preferred medium will be available. By rating this book 1 star because you cant read it the way you want, you take away from the effort of 20 years and the well deserved praise of an author who carried a genre giants legacy to fruition. Like or dislike the book, but leave anything else somewhere else. That way, you will sound like an intelligent adult with something to contribute as opposed to a petulant child who needs to grow up.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing this game! Its so addicting. It has different levels of difficulty and even my 3 year old loves to play the easy and medium levels.
B009Y6V7XK|3.0|I rarely bad-mouth a Cradle cd.  Even when I hear a stinker, it eventually grows on  me.  This one started off with a bang.  However, there is too much noise in between the better-crafted tracks.<br />The Abhorrent is excellent.  It reminds me of Lilith Immaculate.  Song three five and six are equally as good.  The rest is hit and miss.  The pace is very similar to Darkly, Darkly, Venus …  though the guitar playing is a bit more intense.<br />I would like it to grow on me, but after a month or so, I'm still waiting.
B006LSZECO|5.0|OMG. AMAZING. this book was so captivating and filled with twists and turns. I liked both Dark Places and Sharp Objects. But I looooovvvvvvveeeeeee Gone Girl. The twisted minds of the two main characters Amy and Nick are just, indescribable!!!!!!!  Never a dull moment in this book. From the beginning to the crazy surprise end!!!!!!!!!!
B009VB7QQA|4.0|As far as being able to rent movies in HD through my  tv to watch it ON my HD TV, simply awesome. If you want a review of the movie, you can find many on rotten tomatoes.
144174097X|5.0|This is a true favorite of mine. The book was and is amazing the audio cd are just as great. You will be disappointed. Love IT!!
B008C0C1Y8|3.0|The quality of the bluray movie itself is great. It even comes with a featurette of the making of the movie. Little extra hit of nostalgia. The movie itself, well, if you bought this movie, you know what your getting.
0525951652|5.0|Excellent read would encourage everyone to read.<br />Starting Winter of the World now.  Looking forward to the 3rd book when released.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|There hasn't been a tv show in a long time that I have enjoyed as much as Elementary. It's different and I'm glad I started watching it..
B004MYF4SS|4.0|If you like Scottish fiction you will likely enjoy this book. I was a little uncomfortable with the author's selection of the crime that was central to the story [and I will not give it away here], but I guess that is just the nature of 21st century life and literature. The author handles character and story development very well. And when you finish this you are ready to move on to the 2nd work in the series. I am, but am foiled by the fact that The Lewis Man is not available in soft copy yet.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I liked the comparison of Big Ag to the natural farmers; you're guaranteed to be disgusted by much of what goes on.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love this game, it is well worth the purchase price, the mini games are challenging but not impossible. if you like hidden object games that actually have a storyline, this is a great one to get
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is hands down the BEST book I have read to date thus far. The only one coming close to it was Beautiful Disaster by Jaime McGuire. The story line was incredible. Great job on this one Colleen! Looking forward to reading more from you.
B0091ICDHU|4.0|I enjoyed this story, after reading Hopeless I just had to check it out<br /><br />It's a very sweet story. Made me go 'awe' a ton of times (:
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It is a great show many storylines and it has you completely captivated and on the edge. Love this show.
B009K72G8I|5.0|I enjoy this series and would recommend it. This season has a few twists and brings back an old enemy.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love the characters, the plot, and the story line.  It keeps you hanging by the edge of your seat.
0142410373|5.0|This book is really wonderful. Even if you do not have children of your own, it is a nice, &#34;light&#34; read for when you are bored and need a good story.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Great quality, useful, best.  Buy it.  I'm a normal dude that doesn't go crazy with reviews. I would buy it again.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Love the story. Characters are well thought out and likable. The plot had some classic storytelling yet new and adventurous styles as well
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great quality, useful, best.  Buy it.  I'm a normal dude that doesn't go crazy with reviews. I would buy it again.
B005LAII80|4.0|I own a PS3, a Sony BDP-S590, and my HP desktop PC has a built-in blu-ray drive. The disc will simply not play in any of these devices. I would understand if I owned an obscure brand or hadn't updated my player's firmware, but that is not the case. There is an issue with the disc. I have tried exchanging it, and got the same result with the second copy. Hold off until whatever the issue is with the disc production is fixed.<br /><br />Update: I returned my Dredd blu-ray and got another copy. The second copy worked. There was a batch of bad Dredd blu-ray discs out there, so if you get a bad one, return it for another right away. I would buy it new just to avoid the possibility of getting someone's bad disc they're trying to get rid of, but that's just me.<br /><br />The movie itself and the PQ/AQ are top-notch. I cannot give it 5 stars because there are always going to be bad discs of this movie floating around out there, and there is always a risk that you'll get one.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|Loved this movie!!! Husband rented it and I thought for sure it would be so stupid, honestly after watching it I went out and bought 2 copies the next day as I had to buy it for myself and my brother!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a horse lover and so far I love the game.  The only draw back is it is not totally accurate with the appearance of the track and clothing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very fun and I love the graphics! The features are great! I also like how you can e as energy free gems through other apps. I like the training and competitions. It's very interactive.

B0099114WO|3.0|Okay- so we have two great movie stars playing a long married couple.<br /><br />They have marriage problems, only Tommy Lee Jone's character doesn't think so.<br /><br /> Or at least doesn't admit to it.<br /><br />He looks at Meryl Streep like she has 3 heads when she suggests this * get away* for the two of them.<br /><br />I mean why would you want to get away with your wife? And much less to a place that is supposed to * help* your marriage?<br /><br />As far as he is concerned- there is nothing wrong and he resents her suggestion.<br /><br /> It does not take long for arm-twisting to work on him- via a sense of guilt and worry.<br /><br />He caves in, thanks to guilt, not an outward recognition of marriage problems.<br /><br /> Tommy Lee Jones makes no bones about how much he hates going- then hates being there, and what a big waste of time and money the whole idea is.<br /><br />Basically ,he is a wet blanket, while Meryl tries to remain cheery and keeps plodding ahead with the game plan for the two of them.<br /><br />She wants her marriage to be like it use to be- or - if possible, even better than it use to be, when she was happy.<br /><br />Tommy Lee remains totally oblivious to her unhappiness or to the fragile state of their marriage.<br /><br />Meryl Streep as the silent, long suffering wife, who should have spoken up many years ago, can only sit and wring her hands over his antics and foul attitude during their *get -away*.<br /><br />He embarrasses her- he is curt and hurtful.<br /><br />I was actually wondering why her character even wanted to stay married to him!<br /><br />His portrayal as such a cantankerous, cold husband was convincing.<br /><br />What was not convincing is Meryl's desire to want this man to remain as her husband so badly, that she sets up this trip as an intervention.<br /><br />The movie would have been great if there had been more substance to the plot.<br /><br />I mean, it was not like Meryl and Tommy Lee did not play their parts well- it is just that you got a glossing over regarding each of their characters.<br /><br />I would have liked to have  known them better- especially the past versions of themselves,instead of who they were at the time the movie takes place.<br /><br />  So yes, I feel the movie suffered from lack of character development or any revealing insights about the characters lives over the years.<br /><br /> Flashbacks to their first meeting and early days of marriage would have been nice, too.<br /><br />  Just when did this marriage begin to grow stagnant?<br /><br />And why would anyone let it remain that way for so long?<br /><br /> These are questions I had and I realize this movie did depict real life and how marriages can suffer from neglect; I was just waiting and hoping those answers would come as I watched patiently.<br /><br />(Instead, I was rewarded with a movie that just sort of dragged along; keeping enough momentum to make you want to know how it was going to end, while still watching the clock to see how much time was left to wrap this whole thing up.)<br /><br /> Soon, I found myself becoming annoyed at the whiny couple- when initially I had been sympathetic toward Meryl's character.<br /><br /> 1 hour or so into the movie,  I found myself annoyed as I realized it just was not going to get any better.<br /><br />I am glad I rented this one and did not see it in theaters.<br /><br /> Both stars are enjoyable to watch, but  in far better movies they have made over the years.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is worth skipping. You won't be missing much.<br /><br /> For those with nothing to do, or who are into watching a movie about a couple in conflict, be my guest and draw your own conclusions.parts well- it is just that you got a glossing over regarding each of their characters.<br /><br />I would have liked to have  known them better- especially the past versions of themselves,instead of who they were at the time the movie takes place.<br /><br />  So yes, I feel the movie suffered from lack of character development or any revealing insights about the characters lives over the years.<br /><br /> Flashbacks to their first meeting and early days of marriage would have been nice, too.<br /><br />  Just when did this marriage begin to grow stagnant?<br /><br />And why would anyone let it remain that way for so long?<br /><br /> These are questions I had and I realize this movie did depict real life and how marriages can suffer from neglect; I was just waiting and hoping those answers would come as I watched patiently.<br /><br />(Instead, I was rewarded with a movie that just sort of dragged along; keeping enough momentum to make you want to know how it was going to end, while still watching the clock to see how much time was left to wrap this whole thing up.)<br /><br /> Soon, I found myself becoming annoyed at the whiny couple- when initially I had been sympathetic toward Meryl's character.<br /><br /> 1 hour or so into the movie,  I found myself annoyed as I realized it just was not going to get any better.<br /><br />I am glad I rented this one and did not see it in theaters.<br /><br /> Both stars are enjoyable to watch, but  in far better movies they have made over the years.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is worth skipping.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this book because of all the great reviews. I am so glad I did. I love love love this book!! It is quite possibly the best book I have ever read and I have a read a ton.  I loved fifty, bared and all the others, but this book is definately at the top of my list.  I couldnt put the book down. Love the entire thing!! It made me laugh, cry and even embarrased for the main character Sky.  Not sure if there will be a second, but I hope there will be.
1451675046|5.0|Dawkins is a skilled writer, and he covers a lot of bases in explaining the beauty of the natural world. At times, he can come off somewhat arrogant, but I feel this is more of a product of his writing style. I plan to pass this book on to the rest of my family, because it's a great beginner's guide to some of the basics of science. I found in some places, the book was light on specific details regarding certain topics (I found his chapter on the sun to be quite interesting, as Astronomy is one of my personal interests), but I believe that's primarily by design. Dawkins gives you enough to whet your curiosity, then lets you go, free to explore to your heart's content. In short: good book, good writer, worthwhile read!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis need to be the number one rap duo in the game! I don't care for any other rapper right now except them and they have renewed my faith in rap. Not since Digital Underground and a Tribe Called Quest have I felt this way about rap. AMAZING album and I am praying to the music gods that people recognize their talent and that they don't become a one hit wonder with Thrift Shop being their only success. Macklemore is NOT Eminem, he is his own talent. Please go beyond even this album and look up his older work as well like Irish Celebration and Love Song. You will be blown away and so far from disappointed that you gave these guys a chance. Macklemore has a voice and style to be heard and Ryan Lewis comes up with beats as inspiring as the back in the day Timbaland. Please buy this album not just for listening enjoyment but to support a talent that needs to continue being heard on radio.

B005R9HK8O|3.0|This books was just o.k. I like Ram Dass, as a person and an author. You can definitely tell this was an early book of his. It was disjointed and confusing at times. I wasn't always sure I was reading the same book. It's as if you are on a journey with someone on an LSD trip. Not to say that can't be fun. &#34;Cookbook for a Sacred Life,&#34; has some tasty knowledge nuggets and overall the book is good enough to buy to get at these little morsels. Buy it.... read it, because it is an Iconic book, and then go get something form Eknath Easwaren or Joseph Campbell. I still love you Ram Dass.
B004HAEGP4|1.0|I used to think you couldn't mess up a zombie movie.  I was sooo wrong.  This movie was actually hard to watch.  Thank God it's over.  The acting was so bad that at times I thought it was some sort of satire or parody.  The story line was so ridiculous that I found myself spontaneously shouting, \\"Oh, come on!\\" frequently throughout the movie.  I took me two days to watch.  At the halfway point I had to rest as my senses were violated to the point of nausea.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|Freemium App at its best... if you're not willing to drop oodles of money then prepare to be patient!<br /><br />This game was cute - very similar to Ice Age (which you'll get ads for every time you log on).<br /><br />Too advanced for kids - although if the pirates talked instead of used bubble balloons then maybe it'd be better.<br />Deleted from my Kindle Fire after about a week of sporadic play, when the game lost my progress...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can't remember the last time I read A book let alone three !! It's been a journey ans thrashing what a good book (s)  should do.  Take the reader on a journey. I really enjoyed it.  It has put me back in touch touch with the reader in me. Thank you.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|No interactive features for quick research. Can't type in look-up words. Makes you run to your hard copies. Not helpful.Can't delete book from kindle as yet. Delete prompt won't appear as with other books. Hmmm.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! In my opinion,it was even better than the first! Can't wait to read the last one!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a good start. Slow at updates but further along then the classic version on pc. Never had problems. I had it for my iphone and its even better on the kindle. Great buy.

0802473156|5.0|As a divorce attorney, I have reviewed numerous books and programs on marriage repair.  (I generally encourage clients who I believe can work things out not to divorce.)  This book I believe is one of the best, if not the best.  It is different from the other programs in that it doesn't dig up a lot of hurt and blame and instead it focuses on the future.  It boils the relationship down very simply, which is so important at a time when everything seems so confusing and overwhelming.  It really helps the couple get back to basics and helps them understand each other and understand themselves.  If you feel loved, the stress and tension lifts, the trust returns, and you can begin to put it all back together again.  Other programs and books I believe shake things up too much.  They force you to dig up years of pain which leads to blame and more fighting.  I think that sometimes they cause more harm than good.  Sometimes you just need to get back to basics and get to a place where you can once again feel like your partner loves you.  This book in a very easy, simple way, helps you do that.  If one or both of you can say you still love the other person (you just can't stand them and can't figure out how to get along!), this book will be a huge help to you.  Even if you remember a time when you were once in love, and you would like to get back to that place, this is the book for you.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Purchase this if you (like me) did not watch it on TV b/c you did not have the channel. Honestly, I love purchasing whole seasons so I can hole up in my house and watch this from start to finish with no interruptions.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|This was ordered with seasons 3 and 4.  Both of those purchases arrived before this one.  We are not all the way through watching season 2, but have had no issues so far.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Great deal and props to Amazon! Love the harry potter series. I had a great time watching this movie, the dvd came unopened and brand new.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This is the most preposterous movie I have ever watched. I did not stick with it for over 40 minutes. Terrible.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Good book! Story is excellent! Delivery was good. No issues. Highly recommend. Good read. Good read. Good read. Good read.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|And I do mean \\"gag me\\"!  Better yet, why not check out an author named Philip Rock who died in 2004.  He wrote a trilogy like \\"Howden Hall\\" as I like to call \\"Downton Abbey\\".  The trilogy is brilliantly written and original and interestingly much like Lord Wellington-Fellowes creation.  The trilogy is far better in my opinion than this sappy soap opera that I continue to be dismayed that so many Americans like.  Thank the gods that the New Yorker Magazine finally, finally, satirized this awful series just last week in a hilarious sendup.  Enough people!  This series is not great drama.  It is not the best the British have to offer America.  It is not even accurate in it's portrayal of the people of this time period.  You want an idea what they and their world was like?  Juliet Nicolson, a real aristocrat, wrote two brilliant non-fiction books about these topics.  I recommend them so viewers of \\"Howden Hall\\" will understand this long ago world and it's people better and so that they will also learn how much this writer/producer is cheating them.  JW-F wrote a brilliant screenplay called \\"Gosford Park\\".  It was brilliant.  This soap opera, for it is no drama, is awful.  Simply awful.  But how would modern television viewers know this.  The majority of modern commercial programming is also simply awful.  90% mundane and awkward reality programming, 10% pseudo news.  So perhaps I should not be so surprised that \\"Howden Hall\\" is such a great success.  If the consumer has grown up on fast food and junk food, why would they be able to appreciate a dinner made by Alice Waters?  So if today's deplorable television programming is all most people have, and Ovation is now unavailable in many areas of the U.S., why wouldn't these viewers believe this series is so good?  All I can say is anyone who believes this series is good is cheating themselves.  Depriving themselves of far better programs, British made, in the 30 years that prove my point that \\"Howden Hall\\" is trash.  Glittering Vegas style superficial trash.ering Vegas style superficial trash.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It started very slow and really did not pick the pace until well into the storey. It was a good tale of warped characters
0812974611|4.0|I am going to visit Pompeii and I wanted a description of the eruption.The plot was all right and didn't get in the way of the excellent description of the human disaster.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have never written a review on a book that I have read. This book is the exception. I fell in love with this story and its characters, it simple grabbed my heart with its beauty and never let go. I laughed and I cried. I fell in love, had my heart broken and then had it put back together. The chemistry between Sky and Holder is something we hope happens to us and believe it can happen. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever been deeply in love and to anyone who thinks it can't happen to them. Life is not always beautiful, it can break you if you let it but when your true mate opens up your heart and soul you discover that deep love and acceptance can heal and mend the heartache.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a great disney movie and definitely bound for the classics. Great plot with unique characterss and fantastic humor for kids and adults. 5 stars every time.
0446580848|2.0|I have loved Nelson DeMille's books, period.  This book just seems really weak.  It is liked the whole book is stretched out so that we have a last chapter.  The whole book just isn't suspenseful, you know it is going to go down how it goes down and it is painful getting there.<br /><br />I will look forward to the next book.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Good,  enjoyable. Still don't have 20 more words, just to fill space. Probably wont's fill many more of these reviews.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|A very quirky sort of film with a consistent eclectic style all its own. Edward Norton as the OCD Boy Scout Instructor is fun to watch as are the two young leads in the film who share a &#34;young love&#34; story quite unlike anything we've seen onscreen in the past. Visually the film is as unique as its direction and story-line. The film is peppered with nerds, bullies and other interesting youngsters and Bill Murray is particularly amusing in his role as Frances McDormand's wife and co-counsel, as they are both knowledgeable, yet &#34;not quite right&#34; lawyers. As I said, this film has plenty of style and a lot of warmth, too. It's exceedingly watchable and a good family movie for a rainy Saturday afternoon. Totally a Wes Anderson film from start to finish!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|What an inspiring book. It completely changed my perspective on life. Never give up without a fight! Stop reading reviews and start reading
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Purchased this movie based on reviews for a good 3-D movie to watch.  3-D was pretty good.  As for the movie, it's decent, fun, geared towards children/family.  It is a bit corny, which you'd probably expect.
B00004WNHC|5.0|Clássico da musica do mundo, da Jamaica, dos povos!!!<br />Isso é vida.<br />Todos precisam ouvir pelo menos uma vez!!<br />Perfeito.
1454901276|3.0|I suppose that Peter May had to call his novel \\"The Black House\\" because \\"Bleak House\\" was already taken. May has truly outdone even the Scandinavians in creating a story with a sense of foreboding on almost every page, set in an unremittingly desolate locale, featuring a Job-like protagonist who has suffered through pretty much everything horrible that one man can be forced to endure.<br /><br />I found this book to be a fairly slow read. What kept me going was that I was so fascinated by the book's setting, a place truly unlike any other I've experienced in a novel. Occasionally I would stop reading and look something up online to learn more about it -- the guga hunt, Lew Castle, the Lewis Chessmen. There are some video clips from a BBC Scotland documentary called \\"The Guga Hunters of Ness\\" online in case you would like to see what the island of Sula Sgeir (the inspiration for the book's An Sgeir) really looks like, and vicariously experience a journey like the one Fin takes through the rough seas of the North Atlantic. Warning: if you don't want to see birds being dismembered, there are a couple of gruesome scenes.<br /><br />In the author bio on the flap, it states that May has over a thousand TV credits, and that doesn't surprise me -- \\"The Black House\\" packs in enough twists, turns and long-hidden secrets to fuel an entire season or two of a dramatic series. I also noted that it's the first part of a trilogy about Fin. I don't know if I could bring myself to read the other two books, simply because this one was so dark. However, I'm certainly not sorry I read it, because of the strong sense of place. The Isle of Lewis and An Sgeir are truly the most compelling \\"characters\\" in this book.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I wish there were more like it. I think its the best one I have found.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|I finally got this uploaded using Internet Explorer but could not get it to stream to my television at all. Of course, my new LG television was not compatible with Amazon, nor was my LG Blue-Ray player. Very frustrating. I finally got it to work on my PC using IE. Great movie, just very frustrating trying to get it to run.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game the problem solving puzzles are fun and not too hard to do. I always like H O games and this one is one of the best. Way to go G5 another hit game!!!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|AWESOME! I was mesmerized, couldn't stop til it was over! Now the rest of my family is watching, everyone is hooked.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|This box set is much more than just Citizen Kane...its two additonal pieces, one The Battle over Citizen Kane, and a Movie<br />based on that documentary. Truly a must for movie buffs. The best movie, (in my mind) got a bit better.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|recomendate by many. ending is good for discussion. great for a book group. lots to think about told  many to read
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I used this mike to enhance the sound on my camcorder. I want to make YouTube clips and, without the Audio-Technica, the sound is echoy and a little hard to understand if you turn away. Problem solved .... great sound on my videos at all times!!! What a great inexpensive way to get professional sound!! You want your videos to sound amatuerish, then don't buy this; you want to sound like a pro for just a little dough, the Audio-Technica is for you!!!
B005VZQ95O|5.0|all my favorite Pink floyd songs in one album... a must have! and the price is right too (1$ less than i-tune)
B007EDYN36|5.0|It is so cool to know what was going on behind the scenes of my favorite band back in the late 70's. I knew there was friction between the band and Peter goes into detail to how it all took place.<br />Such an amazing book. Peter wrote this from the heart and it shows.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but where are the updates I hear there awesome<br /><br />but for guys that are out there I think this is a perfect app
B007V2UGPE|4.0|nice and fun game keeps getting tougher. too bad its a typical glu game that gets impossible without buying credits.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing book!!! I'm not really a reader...it takes me so long to read a book and I finished this book within four days.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|You have to see and own this movie, the cast is phenomenal and the story takes you in and keeps you wondering about what should be and what could be. A must own for adventure seekers, magical enthusist, and hopeless romantics alike.<br /><br />Fall in love with and invest in the characters! It'll be worth it!
B000KE1PDC|5.0|My wife & I both have read &#34;David Copperfiled&#34; for the first time recently.  The movie gave faces to the interesting characters described by Dickens & summarized the story in an interesting way.  I will be reading more of Charles Dickens in the future.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I fell in love this film when I saw it in theaters & I loved this movie even more when I watched it recently. I appreciated everything this movie had to offer. The music and the people, made me want to be Canadian (or atleast apply for dual citizenship). I wanted to be one of the Boys! I wanted to be apart of that social/music scene, to be in that world or a close second version of it. The artwork was very cool and had I known about this particular graphic novel I would have been a fan much much sooner. I even purchased the soundtrack to be even more connected to the film, the characters, and their stories just as the artist felt growing up. It was a real journey seeing all the characters come together for the sake of making the main character look so cool, it was a real treat.<br /><br />The DVD is a steal and if you won't pay for the bluray/dvd combo at this price then you're just plain cheap. This movie is packed full of special features that are longer if not twice as long as the movie. I really enjoyed the still galleries, it made the movie seem more real, and it really showed how cool it was to make this film over the course of two years (gosh two years). I liked the book to movie story boards near identical to the graphic novels, however I have yet to take part in the commentary. Like I said a ton of features, even a Scott Pilgrim trivia tracks that follows you through the film. There are so much special features that it's gonna take days before I can get through all of them, and this is just on the DVD disc by itself, I haven't even started on the Blu-ray disc yet.<br /><br />I think anyone who's into comics, superheroes, awesome music, indie comedies, well written characters, interesting filmaking techniques, and stuff should buy this treasure of a movie. It is very relatable film and the humor and performances are just to good to pass up. For your collection I highly recommend that you, Get This Movie!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|Love this game.  Seriously addictive.  Always trying to beat my highest score.  And it's absolutely free!  No try it out for a few days or reach a certain level and you have to pay for it.
1451627289|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  A great, thoughtful, and entertaining read.  I'm normally not a King fan, but this one pulled me in.  I didn't want it to end, but I eagerly anticipated each page.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|A good follow up! I waited for her next book following &#34;Barred To You,&#34; and I was not disappointed! Waiting on the next one!
B003FSTN52|5.0|we are enjoying viewing The good wife shows on our own time schedule. the added clips on the dvd's are fun to see.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Ellen tends to ramble.  It's funny during her stand-up but it bombed in this book.  Chapter topics were superficial, dull and boring.  Stick to the stand-up and your T.V. show, Ellen.  Don't write another book.
B003L77G10|5.0|we are looking forward to viewing this second season of the good wife. we are never able to catch the show when it is normally broadcast.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The movie, in my opinion, left something to be desired. The book is much better. It's easy to read and hard to put down. I'm curious how it caught on so much with females given how violent it is. I suppose marketing and the main character are responsible, however I enjoyed it regardless of the intended audience.
B0053O89YM|5.0|was told it would arrive mid january, instead arrived dec 26. we are looking forward to watching this season shows.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I don't really like Bourdain as I often think he's conceited and arrogant.  He comes off that way in the book but acknowledges it and makes no apologies.  Interesting read and informative as well -- a good peek into the behind-the-scenes life of being an upper-level chef.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nick did good. I really loved the plot in this story. It is inspiring and leads the reader into a wonderful love story of hope. I loved the twist at the end too, a total surprise.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Beautiful album art, 30 dark/mellow/deep songs, lyrics that most people can relate to. This will definitely be a classic. (
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved this book. It wouold interest the everyday gamer, a teenager, and an 80's teenager. I loved the concept of the future, the 80's references and the plot. I would recommend this book as a high school required reading, it has great literary reflection.
B000TCEU4Q|4.0|I like it, but the left thrust leveler do not stay at the right position on idle. It slips below zero. The throttle works well, but has this little problem. Shipping it back to the manufacturer is too expensive. It might be simpler to repair by my self.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is one of the most fun free games available. Down it and you will<br /> have a ball. It is very addictive.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|If you like ELO this is the must have album.  If you dont then forget about it.  I understand Jeff Lynne worked on this album for just a few week which is an unheard of time for anything let alone a double album.  This is fantastic to sa the least.  my fist copy just got worned down and had to get another.  But dont take my word for it.  Just listen to it yourself and it has truely stood the test of time.  i would mention atrack but that would detract from anotheran they are all great.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this at just the right time. Newtown had just become one of the most well known small towns in our country and everyone was talking about mental illness and the safety of our children. For days after putting the book down, I was still haunted by the decisions made by the parents in this story. I struggled with the question-- what would I have done? Any book that causes me to think about its story for days or weeks after finishing it is worth recommending to others.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was enjoyable.  The main characters were good.  I wanted to shake him at times and I wanted her to speak up more for herself.  I love how the relationship got started and how is effortlessly stands up/defends her.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Well written and acted and a light, funny, meaningful story, The setting is beautiful. all of the actors are perfectly chosen, Betty White is really great! another great one for Sandra
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It was much different than other Stephen King books I have read. However, the ending was not my favorite.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Worst one to get. I try to get to one word and you have to go to a location instead of a word which is ridiculous. Like 77000865.
0547995660|5.0|As with \\"The Hunger Game Series,\\" my thirteen year old grandson, Jonathan, had read \\"The Giver\\" and recommended I read it. My daughter also read the book, and Jonathan told me his mother and he could not agree on the ending.  This piqued my interest so I bought \\"The Giver\\" to read. I enjoyed reading it, but can see why Jonathan and his mother disagreed about the ending. The village where Jonas, the main character, grows up is in the future. The people in it are highly controlled and it is a vanilla world where psychologically expressions of strong emotions have been eliminated. There is no love, hate, anger, or depression, and hunger and disease have been eradicated.  It is a asexual world where birth mothers are chosen to have babies. Each family unit is allowed two children, a boy and a girl. Husband and wives are assigned to each other based upon personality and intelligence as well as your life's occupation. A ruling body of twelve elders sets the rules and controls the population. There are surrounding villages, but the people have little contact with them. Older people and new babies (if multiple births such as twins) are released. Only one family is different in the community, and that is the Receiver-Giver family who are identified by their light (blue) eyes. They are the family from which  the current Receiver is chosen. This individual is the most important person in the village since he remembers what the world was like when their ancestors experienced war, famine, disease, and crises.  Jonas is chosen by the retiring Receiver who is now old. I would recommend buying this book to learn what Jonas does once he receives the memories and what action he takes. Lowry does not explain everything, thus what has occurred and what is going to occur remains a mystery.  The reader is left to develop his own scenario(s).
0783225547|5.0|Excellent story, awesome acting, not another cheesy SY-FY volcano flick, good plot, with a romantic twist, surprising at every turn, you don't expect Pierce Brosnan's character to be so protective of someone else's kids, as the story starts off he is a very brisk, just the facts kind of guy. However, without ruining the ending, I will say he ends up having a change of heart which causes him to risk everything, including his own life becoming threatened to save a mother and her children.

B00AJMQSP0|5.0|WOW! this album has got almost everything! From hard and speedy to slow and beautiful:) this album is very fast overall (courtesy of Dani's insane drumming <3), it has many catchy chorus's, and there is a broader range of sound then from their previous album 7 sinners(which was great, but it kind of sounded the same throughout). All in all, this is a solid album from Helloween, previous fans will love it and im sure new people will find this album kickass!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I have ready all of Nicholas Sparks books.  This one was good, I enjoyed it, but I thought it was too predictible.  I would still recommend it to other people though.

0307394549|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Martha Stewart but when I wanted a cookbook on cookies, I purchased this based on the many positive recipes. I was prepared to just like the book but I love it. I love how the recipes are organized as light and delicate, soft and chewy, crispy and crunchy etc. The list of recipes in the first few pages is really neat, including not just the name of the cookie and page number but also a small photograph of the cookie. There are enough recipes, about 175 of them, to suit every taste with beautiful photographs that entice you to try them.<br /><br />This book was put to good use over the holidays when I purchased it. I have tried well over 25 recipes since I purchased the book last month even modifying some of them. Turned out great each time.<br /><br />Nice tips at the end with a very typical Martha type write up on how to package cookie as gifts. Very neat!
0765325950|5.0|Friends, you'll notice that the vast majority of people that did not give this book five stars did so either because they do not like Amazon's shipping or they are upset that the book only came out in hardcover. It is truly a shame that people feel the need to tarnish the legacy of books off standards the author has no control over, but alas. People are not so bright sometimes.<br /><br />However, the fact that nearly every 'one star' review is about those two things should tell you all that this is not a bad book by any means. The ending of this book was written by Robert Jordan- completely and almost without any edits whatsoever- and is indeed the ending we were promised so many years ago. The vast majority of characters both minor and major had their stories wrapped up to the point where there are very few questions left. Yet some things about the future are left unsaid- most things, actually. This has disappointed some, but older readers will likely note that this is the theme of the series. There is no end to the turning of the Wheel of Time, and you are left to assume and fantasize about the futures of some characters. Yet the futures are not unexplored- you can make educated guesses based on clues or outright declarations of intentions. Still, this was the biggest gripe about the series.<br /><br />As for the ending itself, it was masterful. Unlike, say, Dune, this ending was absolutely called for and worked towards for half of the book. It was surprising and tearful, though why I cannot say for fear of ruining it.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this book. Despite the threads left in certain spots, Brian did a magnificent job taking over the series, and you can tell he truly cares about it. The characters were all well developed and some bloom in unexpected ways at this end. This is the conclusion some of us have been waiting for for 23 years, and I assure any potential buyers that it is most certainly one worth reading.

B00A9C3RB8|2.0|This movie was slow and predictable I thought it would be hilarious because of Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep but much to my disappointment it had an occasional funny.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|DIDN'T ORDER AM I BEING RIPPED OFF THERE ARE A LOT OF THES WHERE ARE THEY BEING SENT??? i HOPE I HEAR BACK FROM YOU
0988262592|5.0|Can Amazon add a sixth star for this book? In my 17 year career I've had opportunities to work in dev, operations, and security. I read the book in one sitting. I found myself laughing out loud, cackling, and grimacing as the story evoked so many memories. Fortunately I've also been part of successful transformations. Work can really be as bad as the story indicates. It can also be as rewarding.<br />Creating or working in a high performing organization is definitely a choice and the Phoenix Project provides a great road map. Don't expect a checklist but the book includes enough pointers so you can research specific areas of need.<br />The Phoenix Project is a warning, a guide, and an inspiration.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Good action and a continuation of the series.  There are a few unreal scenes, but which action movie doesn't?  :-) Highly recommend it.

B005NGKLX2|2.0|I/m giving this western a low rating, It was slow, boring ,and very little action,sam sherpard is a good actor, this just didn/t cut it for him,his best we all know was the right stuff,as chuck yeager,I own a lot of westerns, sad to say, the last really good western,to me was tombstone, silverado,and pale rider in the 80/s.90/s unforgiving,quick and dead. before  that, it gets even better. Is it hard to make a good western today ,someone please tell me,rent it.
141659521X|5.0|It has been my pleasure to read all of Vince Flynn's novels, including his latest one, The Last Man. Flynn writes of the exploits of Mitch Rapp, the most clandestine of the agents of the CIA's Clandestine Service. He is the guy the President and the CIA Director, Irene Kennedy, call on when it is necessary to take the war on terrorism in the most direct way possible to the baddest of the bad guys. As Flynn's readers know, the really bad guys are not necessarily running around the desert and blowing up stuff. Nonetheless, the one thing no bad guy wants to hear is that Mitch Rapp is on his trail. When that happens, the bad guys \\"need to put their affairs in order.\\" In The Last Man, one of the CIA's most knowledgeable agents is kidnapped in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. So, before the agent, Joe \\"Rick\\" Rickman, can be induced to give up the secrets he harbors, Mitch and his support crew have to locate and rescue him. The search takes Mitch in and out of a number of garden spots in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he discovers, wonder of wonders, that not all of our so-called allies in the region are really looking out for the best interests of the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave. The plotline takes the reader through the political terrain I envisioned existed in Pakistan when I contemplated how Osama Bin Laden managed to evade capture for a decade past 9/11. This is a really interesting novel that gives us a chance to reacquaint ourselves with the ever-stalwart Irene Kennedy, who is a fictional breath of fresh air after watching one real-life CIA director recently go down in flames. Vince Flynn is right up there among the best of our thriller writers and I heartily recommend The Last Man to readers who enjoy the genre. If any reader hasn't sampled Flynn's wares to date, I suggest you go to the beginning and check out Term Limits, the only one of the author's novel that does not star tough-guy Mitch Rapp.

B009E3EY38|5.0|I gave this as a Christmas gift and was fortunate enough to have been able to watch it in its entirety. Led Zep, as old as they are, are still 200x better than anything out there today. Its a remarkable CD/DVD/Blue Ray set that perfectly delivered the experience.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Once I saw this item on Amazon, and found out I had the money to buy it I nearly leaped out of my chair with joy. Once I got it, I admit, I squealed like a school girl. The box sets comes with the three great movies we've come to know and love and on the High Definition Blu-Ray discs, five discs in total, three for the movies and one for each the Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises for bonus features. I was excited to watch the movies all of them thats for sure. The only dissappointment I had was I was expecting there to be more bonus features availble on the blu-ray discs themselves. Oh well, it is no big matter. I am pleased none the less and look forward to the Man of Steel film coming soon.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Got this for my son. I was a little worried about getting an e-book, first time. My son found it so convenient to read on his tablet. The quality of the pages is excellent and it was fantastic haivng it downloaded immediately! Will certainly look at more ebooks!

0547564651|5.0|The book is very interesting because it offers elements from the medical, economic, academic and political economy point of view,  to understand the whole process of the education system, considering issues since birth until the child reaches college.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It has a lot if words but I managed to get thorough it........I fell a sleep while I was in the I section
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first book, I had to read the second as quickly as possible. At the time, I was living abroad and had no access to a physical bookstore, so Amazon was my main choice. I was pleasantly surprised to find a kindle version available for immediate download at a great price.<br /><br />In a basic review of the book, I loved it. I thought it delivered an exciting continuation of the first book that developed its own story. I have read the actual Battle Royale book and manga, the manga done by the original author with a slightly different ending than the book, and agree with many who say that The Hunger Games can be a rip off of it. I believe that the above belief is a little harsh, as there is much there that differs from Battle Royale, both in content and storyline, but the main essence is the same. As I said before, I thought it gave a great continuing story that was enjoyable to read and would recommend it to everyone.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|Very enjoyable view of a young woman coming into her power.  To the place where, her no means no and her yes means yes, to where she decides, this is mine and I will decide what happens here.  I love Mr Pratchetts work and the character of Tiffany Aching in particular, she is a young witch after my own heart.  She sees what needs to be done and does it, she takes responsibility for what is hers even if it kills her.  I liked it very much and recommend the whole series to my own daughter.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow...this book is wonderfully heartwarming! I laughed, I cried, but the ending is just incredibly strong written. Nicholas Sparks has done it again.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|Friends gave me some NS books, and I've tried a few in Kindle; I still come away thinking they are nothing but slightly classier/more topical----Harlequin romances. Sometimes, I do like these quickie reads, and this one was better than all the previous NS books. It may be interesting to see where this will take him. The writing feels still, cheesy somehow---like NS doesn't have an ear for conversation---like he's only read about things and hasn't actually done them. I just don't think people interact with the language Sparks uses.<br /><br />Every book so far, feels formulaic. Character development feels light weight and he uses too many clichéd- scenarios for my taste. But....damsels in distress sell books. They make great chic-flicks, ok--- I will agree to that.<br /><br />NS has a huge following & much praise, but I really get a sense that this is a case of The Emperor's New Clothes; that no one dare say they feel the writing is somewhat hackneyed & fraught with high-test estrogen, lest they irk the king. Yet, I DO believe in love and boy meets girl- girl gets silly, they live happily but with quirks & skeletons, ever after. So I'll keep reading every so often, even if these are just quickie beach books. No matter what my opinion is, NS is taking all his angst ridden, chic lit royalties to the bank. Some people can't get enough; hopefully, Sparks will mature his prose to echo more modern interactions.
0545425115|4.0|\\"The Hunger Games,\\" a science fiction story by Suzanne Collins, is about Katniss, a girl who is forced to participate in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The Hunger Games take place in the future. After the fall of North America the country called Panem took its place. Panem is split into twelve districts; each district is responsible for supplying resources to Panem. The districts are controlled by the Capitol, which is overseen by the malicious and cruel president. At one time the districts tried to rebel against the Capitol; the rebellion failed however, and the Treaty of Treason was made in response. The treaty gave new laws and as a reminder of the people of Panem to never rebel against the Capitol, the Hunger Games was created. Each year each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in an outdoor arena over a period of several weeks, the competitors fight to the death, and the last tribute alive wins. The story follows Katniss as she is forced to participate in the Hunger Games.<br /><br /> The story fits the genre of Sci-fi because of the new political systems, which are enforced by the Capitol. \\"The Treaty of Treason gave us new laws to guarantee peace, as a yearly reminder that the dark days must never be repeated it gave us the Hunger Games.\\" The Dark Days refers to when the twelve districts (which the Capitol oversees) tried to rebel; they failed and as a result the Treaty of Treason was made. This demonstrates the element because it gives us a background on the new political systems enforced by the Capitol. One Sci-fi element that is missing is time - travel. I would recommend this book to Sci-fi fans because it is a suspenseful and gripping story with very well developed characters.<br /><br />TJHS 12th grade student 2013

B00AYB1RGG|3.0|The action was of course a lot of fun, but overall not too much to it. So if you feel like pure action, let 'er rip.

B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I usually don't like short novels. It seems to just get into a character and the story is over. This one got me caught up right away and drew a picture of five characters that had plenty of depth. The story did not need to be any longer. It reads a bit like a very good young adult novel.<br /><br />You will like this story of you like fantasy with magic or maybe even if you don't.
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|Really intricate book with a ton of side story lines that don't get elaborated on very well.  Main story is fantastic and character development is excellent.

B0050KEVO6|5.0|Make sure you don't have any plans for a few hours.  It's hard to stop playing this game.  I can't put it down.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I think this is a great app and it is really helpful, because the new kindle fire hd doesn't actually give you a video recording option for its camera. And this allows us to use the camera for videos and I can always take a video on here now whenever I want. That's a lot for just 1.99 considering you'll have it forever. And other apps similar to this have faults and catches. For example one app fairly similar to this one, clearly states not to use the 1018 (or something like that number), video format because it is unstable, and says you may use it but at YOUR OWN RISK. Now I think it's clear that you won't be getting the best results possible if you use that app. But this app is perfect. It does exactly what it says it does. There are no buts or ifs about this apps credibility and efficiency. I took the time to make this comment because I think people should know that they don't have to settle for an app that has loose ends and can harm your device, when there is an app that is exactly the same but better out there.

I wish that every child/person who has been through difficulty as a child could read this and experience the catharsis our heroine does. The friends who are so loyal are wonderful characters as well as the \\"mother\\". I didn't have a difficult childhood and wouldn't have known how it can scar without reading this book. I am incapable of describing how beautiful this book is or how much I recommend it. Sorry! I am not an author with the gifts of Colleen Hoover, but I sincerely thank her for writing this lovely book.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I love to play solitaire, and the screen presentation is OK.  However, I am frustrated with the touch screen.  Sometimes it works perfectly and other times it gets &#34;stuck&#34; and does not respond.  This is particularly frustrating when a game is over, and I am trying to start a new game, and the screen will not move.  Not sure if this is a game problem or a Kindle Fire problem.  I also hate having the commercials come up with every new hand.  I thought I paid for &#34;no commercials.&#34;

1401232590|5.0|Great noir style art. Good story arcs which bring in all of Batman's rouge gallery. If you are intrigued as to how Harvey Dent became Two-Face, then give this a read. Deals a lot plays out like a crime drama, with Gordon and the Police Force working with Harvey and Batman to take down the mobs running Gotham.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Works exactly as advertised, and does exactly what we want it to do.  As I said, does what we wanted and easy to install.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|If you aren't absolutely pulled in by DDL's performance, then I can see why you don't like this movie. If you love everything he's doing as Daniel Plainview, then it becomes mesmerizing. Loved the soundtrack by Johnny Greenwood. Some of my favorite scenes and dialogue of all time.
B001FBIPF0|4.0|I would say that this is Fall Out Boy's second most solid set and their most exciting album to date. \\"Folie\\" is pop rock bliss when it's really good. The album is very enticing. If its sound were a color it'd be various ones. The guitar riffs are great on just about every track. I would say this is their most upbeat album too. I felt energized, engaged and fulfilled when I listened to this. Recommended especially for dedicated fans.<br /><br />4.3 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. Very realistic. My wife and I both play. She apparently knows much more about horses than I do. Lol.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I am blown away by this book.  The story, the characters, the writing - brilliant!<br /><br />Layken and Will are definitely thrown some wicked and cruel curve balks in life; but the way the both handle those changes is beyond amazing!!<br /><br />It's amazing to want someone so bad and have them so close to you, yet you can't touch them or interact with that person in anyway that shows your true feelings.  This is what Lake goes through with Will.  But that's not the worst part - she has to deal with yet another earth shattering challenge in her life.  How can one person be dealt such bad cards in life and still go on?<br /><br />Will understands Lake and what she's going through.  However, he isn't able to be there for her like he should be.  He throws all sorts if mixed messages her way at certain times, which just adds to Lake's frustration.  It's not that he doesn't want her, it's that ge can't have her.<br /><br />I love Eddie - she has the best outlook in life even though her life is a far cry from perfect and normal.  She's the perfect best friend.  She's the light always shining through the dark clouds.<br /><br />Colleen does an amazing job with this book.  Her writing style and her words tell the story beautifully.  The book just flowed and before I knew it, I was done.
0525953728|5.0|The book provided great insights on those who protect us. I read it it two days<br />and passed it on.  My copy's been read three times since in about three weeks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it<br />? if you like horses and have always dreamed of owning one this is a game for you
B0070XFNDE|3.0|ok, nothing more. the book was similar to a kiosk novel. ending very disappointing, graphically very good, but you need more action.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Yes it is a chic flick, but I'd put it in the same boat as Sleepless in Seattle or When Harry Met Sally, meaning most dudes will enjoy it (or at least be able to tolerate it) also. I enjoy movies that have several story lines that come together. Very Quentin Tarantino'ish, without all the violence.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its great and has nice picture. very easy to use just wish everything wasnt so expensive...not a lot of people can afford to spend money on games
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have had this for two years now. I love everything about it. Because it is cheap, I don't stress about it, but it also looks great. I get compliments about it all the time. The motion is not too loud like some quartz watches, and it rarely gets off time. I'm going to have these for the rest of my life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I personally don't think anyone would hate it because you can train and feed the horse.<br /> I love it so much I love it more than horse life the game
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I thought the story was much better this time around. An Arnold cameo would've been awesome. Kate B was one sexy bitch! Jessica Biel is also a good upgrade as well.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Ive played several of the hidden object games. I don't like timers which many of these games have. With this one you can go to options and shut the timer off. To me this is relaxing instead of rushed. Its a very nice game.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Good story except for Robin. Robin = very lame, and forced, ala Jar Jar Binks. Dug Peter Weller as Batman. Will definitely watch part 2.
B002DD67XG|5.0|James Taylor greatest hits,takes me back to the good &#34;ole&#34; days-very enjoyable. He writes from his heart about topics we can all relate too
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Excellent soundtrack. Full of amazing vocals with a lot of passion. Definitely worth the money to buy it! Five stars!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is a great great book but has a few twists and turns. I recommend this book to young readers.
1401232590|1.0|This was pretty well the best looking and worst story I have read.<br />I can't emphasize enough how truly awful the the story is.  Too bad is screwed up such a nice looking comic.<br /><br />Dark Knight Returns = my favorite<br />Year One = almost my favorite<br />Long Halloween = makes me sad the some people actually thought this story was even ok never mind great.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Just bought this book and can't put it down. I love the characters and I can't wait for the movie to come out!
B006LSZECO|3.0|It keeps your interest for the most part but it really becomes cliche after a while and I'm sorry but the manipulation gets a bit out of touch since no one is really that good at fooling everyone all the time...<br />I read it in about one sitting so it's an easy read and if you get it on sale probably worth it if you've got a flight and just want to be entertained.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|just started reading this book but I love it!  My husband is working on the TV show \\"Orange is the New Black\\" and I wanted to read the book before the show came out!  Think it may be a good show!<br />Finished the book...good book was maybe looking for a little more ending!!
B0018AM1YY|5.0|I have always loved Neil Young's music. Takes me back, but still the music is as great today as it was in my youth.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|well my six year old loves this game we play together so I can help him read what to do next. such a fun game love it.
B0078XGEK2|4.0|This book took a little time to get though as it did not captivate me.  It was a good read and the principles within the book were solid.  Overall, I'd recommend.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Enjoyable reading.  Not as good as some of the other Nicholas Sparks books I have read.  Slow start to it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved reading this trilogy and if I had to find fault with anything about this series than my only complaint would be that it ended.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is amazing!  Can hardly wait for the 3rd book!  Rock on Sylvia Day!  Hope there is more than 3 books in the series.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Just like most other reviews on this book.  I completely enjoyed reading it and found it both entertaining and insightful.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Although I gave this book 4 stars, the material was distrubing indeed. A lot like you would find on a Criminal Minds or Law and Order SUV TV show.
1452101248|5.0|I gave this book as a gift but fell in love with it myself and plan to borrow it. The recipes are great and learning about the author Yotam makes this a very interesting cookbook. I highly recommend it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I am starting to like this character and series better in the second installment. I think Jack Reacher is starting to grow on me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Just enough difficulty and frustration to keep me coming back to keep coming back again & again. I recommend highly.
0765325950|2.0|Sanderson gets credit for attempting to decipher the web woven by Robert Jordan. It is a tremendous endeavor to attempt finishing someone else's work. That said, Sanderson seems to have forgotten a few things as far as continuity is concerned. Character behavior, plot lines, and numbers were skewed to give a more dramatic effect which left me very disappointed. An entire book that is almost all battle is slow going and wasteful. I suppose the best I can say of the book is it is AN ending.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|One of the best albums I have heard. Great music between these two & and it shows I'm album. Well worth the money.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Prometheus(2012) is Ridley Scott's prequel to Alien(1979). It \\"tells us\\" about the Space Jockey. The film has some superb special effects, superb art direction, good camera work, some good acting, and some suspenseful, nail-biting moments. Then again, it suffers from plot holes and unanswered questions. H.R. Giger \\"reverse engineered\\" the Xenomorph Alien he designed for Alien. Giger's ghastly, surreal, nightmarish artwork helped create the look of the \\"alien\\". Species(1995) used a similar creature. In the future, the Weyland Corporation and some scientists travel to an Earth-like moon to meet the creators of man. A deadly secret on the surface could destroy life on Earth! Swedish actress Noomi Rapace is good as Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, the film's heroine. Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, Guy Pearce and Michael Fassbender co-star. The film is visually stunning and epic. \\"Prometheus\\" is the name of the company ship, by the way. This film is a decent movie, but critics and Alien fans considered it a disappointment. The film left a door open for a sequel. Prometheus is a decent prequel/reboot to the Alien saga.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This as game is so creepy  I got to the 7th note when I got so curious i looked back I almost pooped my pants it is so scary a skinny man in a black suit with like 4 arms<br />without a face NOTE TO PLAYERS Don't look back you'll die and go in the broken building make sure to where a diaper before you play and remember curiosity killed the cat.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Pudding Monsters is a really fun game.  You basically combine little blobs and make bigger blobs! Ive played a few games like this but this one doesn't get boring. I love this game.
0810995212|5.0|For illustrators and artists of all types, this book will please, showcasing as it does the impressive breadth and depth of Leyendecker's exceptional talent and skill. I bought the book for a different reason, however. I am always searching for images of well-dressed men to serve as a balance and antidote to the current era's preference for ugly,undignified, ill-fitting and guttersnipe \\"anti-syle\\". Leyendecker's wondrous images of beautiful men and women dressed in gorgeous perfectly-tailored clothes did the trick for me!! Nothing better.<br />MOstly color photo's. Some B/W.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This is the suckiest game ever. You don't even do anything. How do you even eat or get energy? This is a silly game you have a house you can't get into, a spouse who gives you letters rather than just talking.<br />Signed an angery customer.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Good plot with twist and turns that keep you guessing. And a naked wench through in every now and then.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. Simple enough for my young son and offers challenges to keep ne interested. So far so good!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I love this book. I didn't want to read it at first but ran out of options and I'm so glad I did.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|I purchased this some time ago, the album is great and was at a excellent price compared to having to purchase it from a local store. I have ordered other albums and all of them download quickly and sound great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have not read a book that I could not put down in a long time.  It had me on the edge of the page the whole time.  Wow.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Listening to the Four Tops right now, after a Monday at a new job.  Sounds great!!  Hope it lasts a  long time
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This book was great, love the characters especially the dog. This story is similar to the Harry Dresden book. Can't wait to read more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this an amazing game and even if u don't have a horse it is a great game. I have a pony of my own and I am still learning a lot ~:D
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|its good but you will have to pay for it! so that sucks hate that! need more words to stop this review
B0055SWM08|5.0|Super relaxing and worth the purchase price! This was the first, and thus far only, game I've put on my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|The only down side is on the touch screen the birds sometimes leave to early or in the wrong direction.
8866130915|4.0|I ordered this without paying close attention to the dimensions.  It was a bit smaller than I wanted, but overall is a nice notebook.<br /><br />If you like moleskine and you're looking for a pocket weekly planner, I recommend it.  Has individual days of the week on the left with lined page on the right.  Can definitely fit into a pocket, a little larger than an iPhone.  Has all the usual Moleskine bells and whistles (read: excess that you'll never use).  But I do know if I need to convert something I can flip open my planner.<br /><br />Good quality paper, nice cover, elastic band that you find on most moleskines is excellent.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game since it first came out and finally finished it. On a touch screen, sometimes the birds go when they want and the direction that they want.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Installed this game for my daughter and now adware for adult content is pushed to my notifications bar on the phone. The only way to stop them is to force close the game after each use. This is completely unacceptable. I understand the free versions use ads to sponsor, but that is supposed to be done in the game not after you move on to something else. As far as the game play its a good game.
B006OOHYIC|1.0|request me to log into amazon each time to use...  not a practical app<br />not worth the trouble to use
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this app multiple times a day. I have it on every android device I own. I would recommend this to on the go readers this way you already pack your cell phone or tablet, so no need to pack a book.
B004YF6MHW|1.0|this app made me log into Amazon every time I tried to use it.. it was a slow process opening the app .  by the time the camera was ready to take the picture .. the pic op was gone.<br /><br />the app worked well at first.  I had to delete the app to save my droid!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The game is a good escape or down time filler. there are tons of side missions which keep it interesting. It is also avail on PS3.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Movie arrived quickly in brand new condition.  I bought this movie to watch it again. Some of the movie was hard to understand the words and I wanted my own copy to replay the parts that I had difficulty understanding.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|besides the feel and smell of an honored text, the ease and tools used help keep you on track. If you need some spiritual guidence in your life, there are plans of scriptural reading to focus on what he said about that issue.<br /><br />disclaimer: this is the only Bible app I have and have no desire to find another.
0062073567|5.0|One of Christie's best mysteries. Great book, arrived promptly. Excellent buy and enjoyable reading for the beach or at airport or on a long trip.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so well written. Complete unputdownable!! ;) (Somewhat disappointed with the ending but still awesome!) This was the first book I've read of Flynn's and now I just finished Dark Places! Great author!!
B000SVZIDA|4.0|My mother loved this.  It was very entertaining and she loves the actors.  IT was a litle different than she is use to but enjoyed.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|As a parent, I watch every movie that I can with my child because I want to know what she's watching as well as what she likes and what she doesn't. When my daughter said she wanted this movie I thought to myself &#34;Oh great, another Tinkerbell movie...bleh&#34; but I decided to get it for her anyway as Disney and Pixar are usually on par with quality animated movies. I am very delighted to say that I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />In this installment, Tinker Bell's endless curiosity (I'm sure that's part of the Tinkerer in her) decides that she wants to explore the winter woods after an interesting situation goes down with her wings glowing at the warm/cold line while she's helping her animal fairy friend escort some animals to the winter side of things. Unfortunately, with Tinker Bell being from a warmer climate, her wings are far too delicate to travel in the cold without them breaking and her never being able to fly again. Sadly, there is no cure to fix them if they break. To combat that tiny problem, Tinker Bell builds a winter outfit and wraps herself, as well as her wings, in it to prevent damage/breakage and sets off on her journey to discover...why did the cold weather make my wings glow, sparkle, and twinkle?<br /><br />During the course of her winter woods exploration, Tinker Bell discovers that she has a twin sister (Periwinkle) that lives in the winter woods as a frost fairy and that they have identical wings. When they get close to each other their wings glow, sparkle, and twinkle. Is it magic? You bet. Do they know why? Not a clue. Regardless, the two spend lots of time together in the winter woods letting Tinker Bell enjoy all the winter activities before they hatch a plan to take Periwinkle to the summer area partake of all the things the warmer climate has to offer. After-all, if Tinkerbell can survive in the winter woods, why can't they figure out a way to keep Periwinkle alive long enough to smell the flowers?<br /><br />Tinker Bell enlists the help of her 2 tinker fairy friends and they build a contraption to grate ice into snow that Periwinkle can fly around in and stay nice and cold. The only problem is, they didn't get a big enough block of ice and Periwinkle almost loses her wings. This of course gets Lord Milori, the Ruler of the Winter Woods, and Queen Clarion, warm area ruler, involved and you find out exactly how everyone knows that there's no fix for broken wings. Tinker Bell and Periwinkle are told that they can't see each other anymore, which as you can imagine upsets them both a lot. During the course of all of this the ice grater that made the snow for Periwinkle gets pushed into the stream that is the definitive line of the warm/cold areas and starts a freeze epidemic of massive proportions that begins to overtake the warm area and threatens to kill the magical pixie dust tree in Pixie Hollow. Did I mention that if the Pixie Dust tree dies then no fairy will ever fly ever again? Yeah, heavy stuff.<br /><br />This was, to me, the most definitive moment in the movie as far as Tinker Bell's character is concerned and it makes her totally worthy of the fact that my daughter wants to grow up and be her (I wanted to be a ninja, I try not to hate on dreams). Tinker Bell decides that regardless of the fact that it will ruin her wings and probably totally limit her life, she is going to fly to the winter woods and enlist their help to stop the deep freeze from killing everything. Huge sacrifice for the greater good of all fairy-dom. Because Periwinkle is a frost fairy, she and the rest of her frost fairy friends can cover the tree in a layer of frost that will preserve the tree from being destroyed by the ice. Go team go.<br /><br />When it's all said and done Tinker Bell and Periwinkle save the day, Pixie Hollow, AND even find a way to let warm fairies spend time in the winter woods. Oh, they also figure out how to mend Tinker Bell's broken wing.  It's a win - win situation.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good movie, it has some good moral values and fiber in there and it's actually entertaining enough to keep this 28 year old mom's interest. I recommend this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book held my attention through every page! And it is an easy read. The first flash back confused me but then I realized what the author was talking about! A must read!!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|These are worth every penny.  The sound quality is unbelievable.  I require a good quality of sound when gaming, watching movies, and these far surpass my expectations.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|It was amazing and it should be longer than this is it a l so should be like the show
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is such a fun game. Calming exciting couldn't wait to beat the next level. Challenging but yet not so difficult that I wanted to give up in fact made me concentrate even harder. I give this game 100% 5 stars!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was awesome..the plot thickens..lol.. i already bought the last one.gonna start reading it right now!!!! I couldn't put it down.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Less campy, but storyline isn't that great. Karl Urban is much better than Sly. OK to rent, not buy. Meh
B004Y042N8|4.0|I hate puzzles but this one is awesome it is bright and fun its for all ages it has challenge but is also fun I find it fun to play with a group of people taking turns or playing solo hope this helps :)!
0547884591|5.0|Timmy is one of my Top 10 authors, and I'm a tough critic.  I love writers who don't waste my time...who give me fresh new information...who offer me the truly high-payoff actions I need to focus on.  One of these days I've gotta sit down with him and just talk--I've devoured every one of his books and, for sure, I'll be first in line to buy the next one.<br /><br />Price Pritchett, Ph.D.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Love the show...very entertaining but of course a bit on the graphic side so not for everyone. I'm only half way through the third season so I am not sure if I will keep watching beyond that. It depends on whether or not the writers keep the story somewhat believable. I know that may be odd considering the topic of the show:)
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A great read for the cold months or even on the beach. One can pick it up anytime and continue the saga. Sometimes a bit trite but captivating.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|A piercing film about a ten-year relationship. The score gets you before anything else, and you are in for a slow, painful, and yet so humane journey of two people who are making the best they can for themselves and each other given the poor tool-kit they have. Lies pile up, but it's those lies and their consequences that so often make up New York lives and resolutions. Like in the real world, things take the amount of time they need to take. That's what this movie is all about: we keep dissembling till we can, finally, maybe, keep the lights on.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I've enjoyed every one of Nicholas Sparks books, this one being no exception.  I would have loved for it to have ended differently, but nevertheless, an excellent book.  Here's an author who could create a great story, bringing out lots of heartfelt emotions, without the use of any foul language or explcit sexual scenarios, which I personally find refreshing.<br /><br /> My two favorite Nicholas Sparks books are A Walk To Remember and The Choice.  The Choice would make an excellent movie and I'm hoping that will happen in the near future. I've read it quite a while ago and haven't forgotten it yet. I believe that The Best of Me would also make a great movie.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Relax Melodies is a great app, I use it to help me sleep. I like the variety of sounds....give it a try.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I would reccomend it to everyone who likes dragons. I would pay ten dollors if I had to. I love it!
B005R32L66|4.0|Fast, easy to use, versitle.  Works on my PC and Android.  Video was better than expected, quite steady, no jumping around
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I def recommend this book. Keeps you going from the first chapter till the end. A lil spooky, a lil romantic, a lil adventure too! Its not gonna go down as one of the best books of this decade or anything, but very entertaining!
B002N44XSG|4.0|I love percy Jackson series with humor and  fighting this is a good book. I only wish it was<br /><br />longer.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|i absolutely loved this movie. i got with little expectations and it far exceeded them. the music was awesome and anna kendrick really can do anything. the dynamic with the girls was spot on and another movie is stolen by you know who! lady l
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I've never played the real game. This is soooo slow. There needs to be more instruction available. it take so long to figure out a strategy you can lose interest quickly. I read the other reviews how they never run out of coins.....what's the strategy? I can tell it could be fun.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I really rely on this app.  It gives you all the information you could want including weather alerts and is visually very pleasing.
071815780X|5.0|Arrived at recipient's address within specified time.  Good service even considering additional Christmas mail.<br />As this was a present hope the recipient is enjoying preparing new and varied recipes.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I ordered this complete series from Amazon.  This set consisted of new DVD's, not used.  I was concerned because of several reviews that said there were problems with the disks.  However, I had none of those problems.  They were new, were not scratched, and none of them were mislabeled.  One DVD had a slight chip on the edge, but it did not effect the viewing.  I watched the complete series and it is a magnificient saga with beautiful sets and costumes.  If this period of history fascinates you, it is a worthwhile purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game soooooooooooooo much fun Amazing how more realistic can it get I love it so so so so so so so so much
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Very incredible, high resolution and exelent touch system make easy to work with a GoPro cammera, improve fast operations and configurations, best quality images tôo.
B00884GR0W|1.0|Did not like this app - deleted it off of my Kindle within 20 minutes.  No clear directions on how to play the game.  This type of game should have a tutorial.  Fortunately, it was the free app of the day so I didn't waste any money on it.
B008H5J510|4.0|Great 3D effect it was really great! My family and I enjoyed it very much! You and your family will enjoy it too
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|A very scary, sexy show.  I hate to miss a single episode.  Also loved Season 1.  AHS is unlike any other horror show I've seen.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|We need more interactive point and click games on the app store. Very nostalgic and fun. You have to rely on common sense in order to solve the puzzles. You have a hint option but the game is designed well enough for you to not have to rely on it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The movie started off with a Glee-type feel to it, which is great for some but not my kind of show. It quickly turned into a great inspirational story that got me laughing hysterically. Two thumbs and Big toes up for Pitch Perfect.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show is just the right combination of serious and funny with a supernatural twist.  I love the lol moments.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|so you have to be into sci fi and compter stuff to really like this movie. The movie has a killerr music with awesome fight scenes.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a Thrill ride for the mind. I had a hard time putting the book down. Thought I had it figured out several times but the action never stopped!
B003Y5H556|4.0|the movie was not bad but the actors and actress were hot . The reasson why i got the movie. the story line not to bad , keep you interested and guessing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The suspense kept me on the edge of my seat...I gotta go read book 2!!!! It's a great book, that will keep your attention.
B0085RZGYU|5.0|This book had me spellbound from the first page!  I have read many of David Baldacci's books and this one tops the list for suspense, action and compassion.  It was so full twists and turns that I really had to stay focus.  This could easily happen in the<br />United States now.  People who like political fiction will love it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The buttons don't line up with the 4s.<br />Called life proof and they said the serial number on the case is a fake number for a knock off.  This should be illegal.
B004LUS390|4.0|great for the fun little sketch...I have looking for a while for the app that has it all...this comes close...it takes a bit to get used to but all in all it is quite fun.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|nice game that doesn't take a lot of time. It can be a nice challenge so download it and have fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A very good book.  You won't want or be able to put it down.  You will always be hungry for more.
0765367351|5.0|I find it really captured the aspects of the game and the time period, I am planning on using it for my seminar.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a wonderful book, I really enjoyed reading it.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I am 9 years old .I love reading ,some of my friends read this series so I thought I'd read it.loved it this book is kinda thick but is so  easy to read u will almost read it in a week.so read it bye Amanda;)
B000SW16NU|5.0|I've liked this movie for a while. I had it on DVD but I couldn't find it so I bought the digital copy too!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I finally bought the first in series after all the hype died down.  Had some friends that said yes read it - others well:(  I would like this authors style even without all the sex.  But I like to read my erotica so - on to the next book:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best games ever.It is so fun and interesting.I play it every time I get a chance to on my Kindle Fire.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|The hype you heard was true - this show is that good.  Lots of twists and turns and heightened drama from this well-produced, well-written show.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|Good value.  My nephew for whom this was a Christmas gift was thrilled.  I, too, was impressed by the product.
B000000I0K|4.0|I've been a Mike Oldfield fan for years - my LP (yes LP!) wore out, and the cassette version (yes cassette!) died as well. I despaired of getting a decent CD version until I recently came across a gently used version from the 90's. For a while, I delayed....who wanted to spend $75 for a lost recording? I had the good luck to find my recent copy for under $20, and it was worth the wait and the cost. When Mike decides to re-release it with enhanced sound, I'll be in line to buy it again, but for now, I enjoy what I first heard so many years ago. It's one of his master works, and since it is one of the earlier attempts, one hears harbingers of many of the mixes and techniques that would be refined to make the best of his best in later albums. If you've ever heard an album of his, you'll want to add this to your collection. (Not a 5 star because the existing CD needs the magic of remixing to be really enjoyed on modern equipment.)
1846573785|3.0|We were going on a long road trip and I wanted something to listen too while on the road to while away the miles. It was good listening, and little wild and some exaggeration, but it served the purpose. Defintely not something you would listen to with the kids in the car. It was interesting. I would not give it 5 stars.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I could send hours playing with this app. even my deaf child loves this app she gets the biggest kick out of it.
B005Q4CM0Q|5.0|I enjoy action movies. At first I didn't enjoy the ending until I saw it connected to the avengers. I enjoyed the idea of a hero with a good honest heart and a little person with a dream to just help his nation and by some miracle he became able to by an unlikely source. I also liked the family connection. I thought the love interest was a little odd because she was British(not that it couldn't be, but it just seemed odd in the position she played with the accent; however, she was good in the role otherwise. I'd recommend this to anyone who has an interest in action book comic figure type stories. Superhero type tales.
B009GZKO2O|5.0|Normally I do not like operas &#34;modernized&#34; (this one to 2012), but this version works.  There are some problems in this updating -- for instance, in the subtitles.  The great Russian soprano Anna Netrebko does not have &#34;blue eyes&#34; and Nino Machaidze, who plays Musetta, does not have &#34;dark eyes&#34;.  Why not switch these colors so they match the actual eye colors?  Plenty of other changes have been made, both in the subtitles and in the staging of the opera.  Nitpicks aside, this is a wonderful treat;  Netrebko and Polish tenor Piotr Beczala are excellent, the rest of the cast very good, the second act is very colorful, and the ending when Mimi dies is heart-rending.  I have three other versions of this opera, including the outstanding cinematic production of 2008 starring Netrebko and Villazon.  This one is a worthy addition.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I Really enjoy this CD. Every song is wonderful and that is rare in an CD these days. I had bought it for ONE song and ended up liking the entire CD. I enjoy the words and the music and the way its blended and different caliber of tones. I have listened to this many times. Its relaxing too at spots. I don't know if ONE Republic could do this good again. I'd recommend this CD to those who like what I described above in a CD.
B00004TA41|4.0|This is one of the first jazz albums I ever owned, and I have to say that was probably a mistake.  Coltrane's final masterpiece was quite the challenge for me to appreciate although as most challenging works of music are, they are worth the effort.  My guess is that if you are already a fan of free-jazz and avant garde, there probably won't be much of a challenge. For me, I started with jazz trying to explore an album from all its various styles, and this was my attempt in its class.<br /><br />By now, you probably know the album is full of duets between Coltrane and Ali. I think that initially turned me off, but as I've grown to like the album, I've realized that the duet format showcases the artist and the style. The duet format has let be discover that the apparent disorder is in fact orderly.  The apparent disorder really just shows the genius of Coltrane and lets him play as freely as he wanted to.  Any further instruments would only have inhibited the album.  Ultimately, I've discovered that this album makes a fitting exclamation point on the life and career of a great saxophonist. Few will consider it Coltrane's best album, but if you are fortunate to find the order behind the disorder, you may in fact think of it as one of his best performances.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Love the game but definitely have some flaws.  I have experienced my game freezes, I have  lost prizes in scarts game because it froze up and when my game finally resumed it went back to my village with no change in coins acorns etc.  I feel that the progressive price of purchasing land is pretty extreme it goes from 900k for 1 block to10 million how is that for inflation.  I also feel that the adding 1 friend every 5 levels is not fair.  Maybe 1  friend per level and then so many bonus friends at specific level achievements.  And what is up with the blue crab and jumping pirhana just off the ice.  You should be able to tap them for a bonus.
B009E3EY38|4.0|Led Zeppelin did something I had only dreamed of when they played this concert and released it for the public.  They reunited as best they could, the only caveat being the obvious replacement of their original drummer with his son.  It is a show I think all Led Zeppelin fans will cherish.<br /><br />As a band, the performance was better than I could have ever hoped for.  It isn't perfect, but how could it be given their age.  Amazingly, these guys still outdo what most modern bands are doing full time.<br /><br />The audio of the show is excellent.  I like having the CD's and listen to them non-stop.  The Blu-Ray is fantastic as well.  It isn't a release full of all sorts of gimmicks.  None are needed.  You get Led Zepp in high definition, what else do you need?  I know comments bemoan the editing, and while they may be valid, I found it hardly the irritation others did.  Perhaps it would be nice to see more of each musician rather than the quick pans, but it wasn't enough to impede my enjoyment in just seeing these four guys together.<br /><br />The only knock I have on the whole package is that Robert Plant doesn't look to be enjoying himself quite like Page, Jones, and Bonham are.  While his vocals were about as good as we could expect (if not better), I wish he showed the emotion that the others showed.  Bonham was like a kid in a candy store as he should have been.  Page and Jones were having a blast and reveling in the \\"resurrection\\" of their old band-mate.  Most people appreciate the quality of each of the band members, but this performance made me realize just how good Jones was as sometimes the most overlooked member of the band.<br /><br />For any Led Zeppelin Fan, this should be an album and video to purchase and cherish.  We're not likely to ever see these guys on stage again, and I applaud the practice and effort they did for the fans.  I applaud the one show and video approach to a limited tour.<br /><br />So if I love it so much, why not 5 stars.  Just a matter of this not being the \\"perfect\\" album or performance.  4 is not a bad thing, and if I could I'd probably give it 4-1/2.  As I said previously all Zep fans should get this.  If you happen to be new to Led Zeppelin, this is not a bad item to own, but you really should look for earlier studio and live releases first.  Get the full Zeppelin experience when everyone was on the top of their game.t a matter of this not being the \\"perfect\\" album or performance.  4 is not a bad thing, and if I could I'd probably give it 4-1/2.

B005IQZB14|5.0|This is a wonderful story of a woman trying to find herself through a long and challenging hiking journey. It will make you want to pack your backpack, lace up your hiking books and hit the trails. Loved it! Definitely worth a read.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I had read the book first and I was hesitant to see the movie, but when I found out the author wrote the screenplay I became excited. At first I wasn't sure about the actor choices but when I saw the film I realized even though there were some slight differences they WERE Sam/Charlie/Patrick/etc. I'm fortunate enough to have an arts cinema nearby so I went to see the movie twice(the only keep movies for a short time there, but I would have gone more!). The first time I saw the movie I started crying at the first party Charlie goes to with Sam and Patrick and it basically didn't stop the whole time through. But it was a cry that was worth it, it felt cleansing almost. If the book made you feel happy and sad and gave you an overall \\"wow this is a great book\\" feeling, the movie will make you feel the same. Stephen added things and deleted things in a way that it worked and it almost gave you more information on the characters and you know it's accurate because the author was the one who added these things. I digress however, this movie is so worth buying. I suggest reading the book first though, it's always better that way. I hope this was helpful. Amazon is always completely reliable with shipping and it always comes in a very efficient fast manner.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book is wonderful for a short read. I would recommend it to all. I was hoping Mia would stay but you don't know if she will or not until the end.

B007TNS6JI|3.0|Its a decent game for free, but it can get really laggy on kindle but it's fun when it doesn't.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I was expecting a more compelling novel.  I respect Mr. King's storytelling ability, but this book was<br />strangely tedious and unsatisfying.  It was a bargain on the Kindle, so I don't feel that it was<br />overpriced, but I was glad when I read the last sentence.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Excellent movie wrapping up an excellent series that was canceled prematurely.  For Sci-Philes, the &#34;Firefly&#34; series is a must see, and Serenity offers a poignant and satisfying ending to the narratives.
B007HXL1V0|4.0|This is an interesting an honest look at the family dynamics and how parents sometimes &#34;poison&#34; sibling relationships. What are the biggest pitfalls to avoid, etc.
0380730405|5.0|This is a classic book everyone should read. What a beautifully written and engaging piece of writing!  This is likely one of my top five most loved books ever. Read it and you'll see what I mean!  I do wish it was available as an e-book.
B00633W614|2.0|What started out as a solid family drama has dvelved into a very implausible and rushed romance story. A letdown.
B0090SI4HO|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger may be getting a little long in the tooth, but he's back in an action movie and it's not bad.  \\"The Last Stand\\" has a cartel boss (Edward Noriega) staging a spectularly good escape from federal custody in Las Vegas and high-tailing it for the Mexican border in a hot car with an FBI agent as hostage.  Schwarzenegger is the sheriff of the small Arizona town on the border where the cartel boss plans to cross into Mexico, with a few of his thugs clearing the way.  The premise is a nice setup for lots of car chases, gunfights, one-liners, and some redemptive behavior for the good guys in the small town.<br /><br />Sommerton Junction happens to be half-empty, with the mayor, the football team, and most of the citizen out of town for a big game.  Sheriff Ray Own, former LAPD police officer, is in charge and expecting a quiet weekend.  Not so much; first a gang of gun-toting mercenaries murder a farmer, then they shoot up a police car.  Owens soon learns what the FBI already knows, that the cartel boss is headed for Sommerton Junction, and help will not get there in time.  Owen rallies his deputes and the remaining townspeople for a last stand.<br /><br />The plot is pretty flimsy, but the action keeps the movie moving fast enough to make it all work.  Luis Guzman and Jaimie Alexander are good as Owen's plucky deputies, and Forest Whitaker almost steals the movie as a frustrated FBI agent.  There's a good car chase through a cornfield, and a great mano-a-mano confrontation on a bridge.  The movie doesn't take itself entirely seriously and neither should the viewer; recommended for Arnold fans.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|A follow-up of the Fall of Giants, this book is set in the lead-up to WWII and follows the families of the same characters from the first book. A highly enjoyable read.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|A movie that has a goofy premise but a decent story. Worth the cost of rental, but can't say that I would personally buy it.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|I LOVE Norah Jones and this album did not disappoint.  I think that her first album will always be my favorite, though!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|What can I say - it's the Beatles! It has all of the albums. The sound quality is great. It comes in a nice storage box. My teenage daughter loves it, we listen to them all the time.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|I loved Last of A Dyin Breed from the first second I played it. Skynrd is back and they are rocking harder than ever. If you loved Skynrd in the past you will love this one! It is amazing they are still recording and writing new material. Great Songs, Great Musicianship are the highlights of the this one. I love it and hope they keep the new music coming! It is great to have some new material to sink your teeth into! I highly recommend this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game all though. it does freeze your device I love that you can take care of your horse just like in real life I very much reccomend this game to amazon users
B0094BB4TW|5.0|My husband and I love staying in touch with my friends and family! This seems to be the best app for Facebook.
0446572764|5.0|I found it difficult to put this book down, which is rarely the case for me. Child 44 was both suspenseful and enlightening. It provided great insight into the Stalinist era life in the USSR. I am certainly no expert on this period but feel as though I gained a sense of how horrible it must have been. I appreciated the tact of the author in his ability to convey the horrible crimes of the killer without going overboard in the descriptions. I ordered the next book in the trilogy but can't imagine how it could be better thatn Child 44.
B000FBJF7I|4.0|Simple and enjoyable book . Great description of Botswana. Not super thrilling or complex, but still a satisfying read. Leaves you curious for more tales.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very well written. I couldn't put it down.  It needs a little editing to clean up some misspellings and a few awkward sentences but overall an excellent read. Well done!!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What can i say? Great value. Lovely to now have all of them. So far, they are safely on a shelf, but I can feel a muggles festival coming on.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game ( though its not as fun as a real horse) because its is both fun and realistic.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My son loves it plus it was free! So we're both happyand that is all thet counts. love love love
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A wonderful look at slavery from the slave's point of view.  It was enlightening from a historical point of view, and  the story was one I couldn't put down.  The characterization was so real I felt I was living among these people and suffering their joys and heartaches along with them.

B00AREIAI8|1.0|After playing this game for 3 days and getting to level 16 I am now being bombarded with game ads, the game is lagging and doesn't load well on my kindle fire anymore, so because of these reason I have re-rated this game to 1 star.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game was so much fun and kept my attention the whole time and thats saying alot. Definately Loved it!
B00AH69MS8|5.0|Bought it primarily for Orion (12 out of 10 stars), but all of the songs ROCK (10 out of 10 stars)!
B0015DROBO|4.0|Still a great read!  I appreciate some details I missed before and how this set up the trilogy.  Now on to the next book.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like this challenge of this game more than regular solitaire. Increasing the difficulty is as easy as adding another suit.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Oh how my heart was breaking for Mia through the whole journey. She finds strength through love and that is such a wonderful thing.
B009JZWO3I|3.0|If you want to catch up with the show you can download some episodes on your kindle fire.  The only downside is they don't have the updated season available
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a devastatingly beautiful piece of work. I enjoyed the complexity of the relationship of the two main characters and the supporting roles of friends and cousins. Such a wonderful job of putting in the intensity that it required to make it work.<br /><br />YA Recommended
B005OP7162|1.0|I could not even rate this show appropriately since it did not download.  I just wasted my money for nothing.
B00846REIS|4.0|Yes, definitely if you loved the 50 Shades series, then this would be the next to read. It sort of retells the story with new characters and new twists. It is an edge of your seat, twisted sexual histories on both sides. Tons of emotional baggage and therapeutic tendencies. Great story to read if you love your erotica.
0099579928|5.0|My son really enjoyed the books he was very glad to receive them. They were in great shape. Thanks so much!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is my favorite shows on tv and I was hooked from the first scene. I have already re watched it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Now, it's not game of thrones, I equate it more to pride and prejudice the tv show. It is funny, and the characters are acted well enough that you actually root for them, or in some cases hope something terrible happens to them.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|What can I say.?Just when you think they can't surprise you  anymore, they do it anyway. Have been watching season 3 and I'm ready to preorder that too.
B007NU54H4|5.0|I bought this movie for my 6 year old granddaughter and we both loved it. We watched it 3 times in 2 days, she just couldn't get enough. And of course i had also given her the new fairy Peri Winkle too.  I recommend this movie for all little girls and their grandmothers!
0316017930|5.0|...and insightful. Highly recommended.  Outliers brings many new theories to the table and is an excellently woven tale about the roots of success and circumstance.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All the movies in one small box!  We have already watched them all again and love them.  We haven't viewed the extra stuff yet, but maybe some rainy day.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great Show!!  I love the drama.  It really defines the struggles of life during that era and allows reflection of the changes that have occurred and the consequences of the changes.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Grabbed me from the start and didn't let me go until the end! My dad read it and he cried.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game wasn't what I expected. I was hoping it was like my birds on a wire that I have on my desktop pc.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Read it. I promise it's worth it. These are some more words required by Jeff Bezos. You don't have to read them.
B008M721MS|1.0|So many problems. First, the user screen sometimes disappears behind the larger screen and theres no way to bring it back. The small screen also Freezes and glitches occasionally. And lastly, when someone calls and i open my kindle to answer, skype errors and shuts down EVERYTIME.

B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read all of Michael Connelly's books and he always comes up with new ideas and never bores you with anything.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|A tight story about an astronaut that gets left behind on Mars and the challenges he faces.  Andy Weir is someone I'll be keeping an eye out for;  The Martian was smart, exciting, and best of all, believably written.  The story kept me engaged and wondering what next might befall the accidental protagonist.  A bit like a Heinlein juvenile but with its own style and pace.  If you like hard, fast sci-fi this one’s for you.
193413712X|2.0|A biting (pun) critique of family life as lived in the households of long-suffering sour women.<br /><br />Or the book could be about the progress of insanity in the male line of heredity from loony grandfather to dippy father to normal son.<br /><br />Lying in what will within the next week become his deathbed, eighty year old George Washington Crosby hallucinates as he reminisces over his life, the latter years of which were spent on his hobby become highly profitable source of undeclared income, tinkering with clocks.<br /><br />The theme of hallucination expands as the narration morphs into the life story of the true protagonist, George's father Howard Aaron Crosby, a former itinerant pedlar and tinker turned retail manager but always a cracker-barrel corncob homespun philosopher much given to rambling thought and painful enumeration of descriptive detail.<br /><br />Howard is an epileptic, suffering regularly from grand mal seizures. He saw his father, a Methodist minister, committed to a mental hospital and fears that his wife Kathleen plans to have him institutionalized on the grounds of his epilepsy.<br /><br />To top it all, Howard's son and George's brother Joe is mentally insufficient. Readers who are themselves, or who are related to an epileptic, will be offended by the implicit equation of epilepsy with insanity and retardation.<br /><br />This is a going nowhere slowly kind of book for people who like to take time to smell the roses. The careful reader will rejoice in Paul Harding's considerable wordsmithing and creative skills.<br /><br />But I'm not a lace and ribbons type of person and I found the ornamentation excessive. It took me two years and several false starts to finish the book. Nevertheless I will probably come back to it, for the reward of exploring the richly nuanced text.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|Every time I see a Clint Eastwood movie, I am impressed with how well he can take a vehicle that usually has no steamy sex scenes and no gratuitous violence and make a hit from it in Hollywood. This is just another example.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers who said that Freeman delivers a flat Mandela, but I think that is overshadowed by the story. It's a fascinating tale of how a man that led the resistance to apartheid used rugby to help unite whites and blacks as South Africans. Yes, Mandela was more than that, but this is a window into his suffering and how his mind worked. If all you see is rugby, you miss the point. If what you see is how a man used his prison time to know himself, heal himself and use that knowledge to bring the same to others, you will enjoy this movie. It's a fabulous example to all of us how we can do the same in our own lives.
B0037NB6QE|4.0|Debbie is an excellent author.  I love the way she intertwined the life stories of the women in the Friday knitting class.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I purchased to complete by Dark Knight Blu-ray series.  I loved it in the the movies and will watch many times over.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I have played many games over the years, and I think this game is great. The puzzles are not really difficult, and the graphics are beautifully rendered. I don't appreciate it when reviewers give away aspects of a game so I am NOT going to do that here, but I will mention that my only peeve about the game is that it is too short. I literally finished it in 2 hours. Also, I was a little disappointed with the ending, but after playing a few of these games you understand that it's really not about the ending, but rather about the puzzles, so do not expect a huge climax. Otherwise great game and I think more should be made. The phone that I played this game on was a galaxy s 2. The reason that I am mention this is because it is easy to makes a mistake and hit the back button from the phone thinking it was the back button in the game. This of course backs you out of the game and thus you have to restart the game. Luckily the game picks up from where you left off so it's just an annoyance on the user part, but still something to look out for.

B005CRQ4GU|2.0|I think he is selfish and to be a little thankful once in a while but over that the author did a great job writes this
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I could not get this to open on my kindle HD. I let it sit open for a while like others suggested but it just never opened. Sad too because it seems like it would be fun.
B006WQLH7G|1.0|Bad product! After they took my money, a month later I caught a virus and lost everything. Had one year guarantee, it's been 5 months and still no refund as promised by avast. After filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau Avast said 1-2 days for refund. It's been 2 weeks.  I should have checked with BBB first.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I will watch any movie starring Johnny Depp.  My children and grandchildren also love to watch his movies.  However, for me, it was too dark literally and often hard to understand what was said.  It was the movie maker and not the actors I have a small problem with.  Chock it up to age I guess.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Fast paced, action filled - what early Clancy used to produce regularly.  Well worth the time - very enjoyable experience.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock app has many fun features and it works perfectly, no glitches whatsoever. It has its own alarm sounds or you could choose your own custom sound from any app. You can customize the look and how you want it to go off and how you want to dismiss or snooze the alarm.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is an awesome way to kill any free time that pops up between my classes. Total blast to play.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Great music and great video---was completely satified with both parts of this purchase! Came in time for Christmas, so everyone was happy!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This episode doesn`t contribute to the storyline but its funny, worked well on logitech review. Startrek comiccon car theft more words
B008LSVLZG|5.0|It's Steve Wilson at his best.  The players are all amazing and the sound is phenomenal.  Seeing this live is much better than just listening to the studio version.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|This movie was definitely worth the time. It was suspenseful and it has a surprising ending. Check it out ;now.
0765325950|4.0|My boyfriend hasn't finished this book yet, but he's excited that the series is finally coming to an end!  We love the super cheesy cover art work too!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game because I am able to make and be in charge of my own city and bisnesses in it.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Mile 81 was a great quick read. It was King doing what he does best! I love the ending of this book!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House is a book you can't put down. It has so many layers of life, mystery, intrigue. I did not want it to end there.
0789324563|2.0|When I read &#34;Featuring Production Art and Full Shooting Script&#34; I was expecting an art book with the script at the very end. But the format the script in a way that it fills more then half the book. I'm wasn't interested in the script, I was interested in the concept art.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|This movie is just as epic as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy!  I was enraptured from the first scene to the last.  My only disapointment is that I have to wait so long to see the other two movies. Oh Peter, the angst of having to wait, again!  But I have to say I am in love with this movie and cannot wait for the DVD so that I can see all of the extra scenes, and the extra behind-the-scene magic that make these movies so awesome!
B0042H9YMC|1.0|The movie was categorized as NEW when we purchased the item. My son wanted to buy me a Christmas gift and since I love this movie, he thought it would be perfect. He was shocked to discover that the movie was a burned disc that did not work with a paper cover!! What a dispicable thing to do! The seller did refund the purchase but I will never but anything there again!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Best alarm clock app for kindle fire hd. I love it. Plus the cool sound feature in the bottom left corner is awesome
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An amazing ,touching story about a man who overcame insurmountable odds.  A loving son, brother, husband and father truly dedicated to his convictions.  A man who was not ashamed of his faith in Christ Jesus.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|These bulbs have been great so far. We are using them in our light fixtures on the ceiling. The first order we placed was for daylight white, and they are very bright. Be aware when ordering that the daylight white is probably not the best for in your home. Go with the warm white for home use.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|A good mystery yarn with unexpected twists and turns, a bit like the A9. Rebus, still smoking and getting information in pubs, getting up the noses of his younger superiors' noses and working his contacts from both sides of the fence turns up trumps in spite of many obstacles. Like his well worn car, Rebus should be replaced, but with what? A gripping story that leaves the reader waiting for the next Rebus episode.
B000W01GK6|2.0|I have followed the Eagles from Day 1 of their first album release. I loved their perseverance throughout these four recent decades, even with the deletion of Bernie and Randy as band members many years ago. However, because of one deep, dark and pathetic reason only known to their inner circle, they elected to dismiss their master guitarist Don Felder. That decision of theirs was \\"the day the music died\\" as far as I am concerned. Without Felder's contribution and input toward this release, this record is nothing but \\"over 55-year old male\\" attempts at career-salvaging validation. Save your money, my long-time Eagles fan brothers and sisters !....And to Don Henley: I absolutely love your voice, passion and songwriting and I will buy your next release; however, you have \\" a lot of 'splaining to do\\" when it comes to firing Don Felder. I mean no disrespect to you, Don. I am just extremely disappointed !
0345529057|5.0|I am just halfway through the 2nd book, A Clash of Kings and am finding it every bit as compelling as the 1st book.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I completely enjoyed this book.  The lessons learned are so true then and today.  A kind, gentle, generous heart is needed all the year round to leave a good lasting legacy in our world.<br />God bless us everyone.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Okay, so I know I'm probably going to be bashed to high-heaven for this review, and I know the storyline isn't exactly what is supposed to make you want to watch this movie, but seriously? It was so bad that at times the lack of a storyline and the complete and utter terribleness of the storyline overshadowed the dance routines. I gave this two stars (as opposed to one) because anything with a shirtless Channing Tatum is good... to an extent. Rent for fun with your girlfriends, but don't go into this expecting to be entertained in between the dance routines.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As the parent of a young man who succumbed to cancer, I can say this book told it like it is.  Parts of the book are gritty and hard to read.  Parts of it are beautiful.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is currently battling cancer, it may be too intense.  I would recommend it for anyone who has ever loved a young cancer patient.  It provides a view of what it is like to be young and have cancer.  A compelling read.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|As an avid Charlaine Harris reader, I was excited to get started watching True Blood. The first few episodes are a little cheesy, but once you get past them, the episodes are great and really suck you in--I just wish they had more than 13 episodes a season! I also like that the show loosely follows the books--it keeps an avid Sookie Stackhouse reader interested! Overall, love the show!
0425252868|5.0|loved the fact this was a true story - lots of history that shouldn't be forgotten.  Wonderfully written.I would love to read more by Makos.  We have shared this with many and all love it..
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my father who LOVES Indiana Jones! He really loved the movies and the set was well-packaged. It made a really nice gift.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a really fun app i love it it will hook you and the best part it is free
B00190OHD6|5.0|I have loved this movie for a long time and decided I wanted to watch it, when... low and behold, my DVD collection didn't include this movie! AHHH! I immediately went to Amazon and purchased the blu-ray. If you're on the fence about buying this movie, take the plunge. It's lighthearted and sentimental all at the same time--you'll laugh through the tears! LOVE IT!
B000FCKPHG|2.0|This book has an enlightening message that can be valuable when kept in mind However the author takes way too many liberties in explaining her development and reasoning.  With so many management and leadership books out there, I wouldnt suggest taking time for this one.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This is probably the best of the books these two wrote together.  Really enjoyed finding out the answers to all sorts of questions from past books.  Would definitely recommend it to people who have followed the other books.  I totally enjoyed it.  Though it doesn't happen very much any more after a lifetime of reading, I did find it hard to put my Kindle down.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this novel in less than four hours- I was so intrigued by the characters and their plight. A story that's devastating and disturbing as much as it is charming.  To understand the perspectives of the characters families as they struggle together thru such horrible situations, is frightening. What a beautiful love story in an ugly setting. I recommend this book, however I would also recommend you have your tissues ready as you will experience a range of emotions.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|One of the funniest movies I have ever seen ! Make sure your children tho are not present when  this is playing it is not a child's movie !<br /><br />So good we watched it twice !
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Set in the closing days of World War 2 in England and France, this story of love and heroism in impossible circumstances is a Follett classic.As always, this is a very well researched story told in Follett's own unique style. This might rank up there as one of his best.
B001S2PT3M|5.0|Season 1 was so great and season 2 built on this awesome cast of characters beautifully. I've got a lot of catching up to do, but I'm told the ride just gets more thrilling and the suspense never ceases.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This picks up the story of families struggling to deal with the tragic events of 20th century history as it unfolds. The tales of survivors struggling to make sense of the cruel and unlikely course of events in Europe and North America is compelling and the book is hard to put down at the end of the day. Possiblly the best Follett narrative to date.
B0083IU84Y|5.0|I love this cd. This item has more songs than the US edition. More song to love. Jake Bugg is an amazing mix of folk and rock. I could not be happier with my purchase.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This app is totally amazingly amazing but there is one problem&hellip; it doesn't have all the things! I also like STEVE!!!!!!
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Dexter is totally different from anything else I've seen on TV. It is dark, but still finds time to be funny. The characters are well written and the show has an excellent group of actors. If you can handle some seriously gruesome scenes and think the overall premise of the show is for you then I would give this show a shot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW!!!!! That was steamy..... I can't wait to read the next one well this was one serious good book I Love THE AUTHOR.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Never played anything like it but it's enjoyable. This is a cool late night game for me so I give it a thumbs up.
0694524441|5.0|I loved it, everybody should read or listen to this story. I learned a lot and Iam happy for this.
B004SBULWE|4.0|This product does exactly what it says it will do.  Turns off the apps you are no longer using to save your battery life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My coworker showed me this game on Fri Jan. 18th...I have not stopped playing it since! Lovin it! Too much fun!
B006UV8DJS|1.0|This app does not work well, not user friendly.  I do not see any instructions on how to operate it.

B006VJMZXY|4.0|I found it easy to read, very enjoyable and if you enjoy stories about historical events I would recommend it to you.  The book is The Kingmaker's Daughter, by Philippa Gregory
1401937268|5.0|I love these cards. They are really pretty and have beautiful messages. No matter what the message is, it's always positive and encouraging.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|This collection is amuse see as there are stories I had not seen. I found the early stories explained about the books in more detail
B007XWFZSA|5.0|This book teaches you how to think and act like a consultant. It is mainly for those foraying into consulting. Experienced consultants can also gain a thing or two.
B0063M22QO|1.0|I thought this would be better than it is.  Too few tiles and no challenge. I have only played it a couple of times. The other Mahjong I have has many more tiles and patterns.  Maybe I'm missing something on this one. Takes about a minute to play. Not much fun. :-(
B008EQIEWS|4.0|The visual in this movie is great, but the story is a little lacking.  Would watch it again.  I like greek mythology though.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is exactly what I hoped it would be. Lots of different formats and lots of fun. I get addicted to it, so I have to limit my playing time.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I thought it would be funnier than it was.  I would not prevent someone from watching it, but I don't need to watch it again.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Better that expected considering how remakes can be disappointing.  Great cast of characters and special effects.  Loved the slow mo.
B008B68IUY|5.0|Mattel has produced another finely detailed and fun Monster High toy to add to the Monster High line. The whole Scaris collection is creative and fun. My daughter loves these toys.
0375851569|5.0|My daughter-in-law started reading these books to my granddaughter.  By reading stories, playing music, or even just talking to your baby, he can experience a simple form of learning in the uterus, according to a number of studies.     [...]    My granddaughter is now 18 months and will select a book before a toy and then go sit and look at the pictures and talk about them.    Sure beats TV or video games.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This movie was inspiring for my daughter since she also sees her dad shoot a bow. She thought the little brothers were the most fun, and she was a little scared of the big bear in one scene, but she won't admit to that when asked.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|Love is blind, as said I believe by William Shakespeare.  Here are two men who meet for a sexual hook up, and end up a couple on and off for 10 years.  Roger Ebert said it best by saying these two should never have been a couple.  And it is true.  The main character Eric is a documentary film maker hopeless romantic, and Paul, a conservative, 9-5 worker with a crack addiction.  Why are they together?  Eric gets emotionally abused and sexually frustrated, while Paul is selfish and cannot kick his crack habit.  This is one of the most realistic movies to date about two gay men in a relationship.  The acting is superb (especially Thure Lindhardt playing Eric,) the story is pitch perfect, and a movie every gay man needs to watch.
B008B68J2G|5.0|Mattel has produced another finely detailed and fun Monster High toy to add to the Monster High line. The whole Scaris collection is creative and fun but the detail on the cafe set is the most fun with all the little pieces that go with it. My daughter loves these toys.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|It's just a cool show to watch. That kind of job I would Like to have, but it takes self-confidence.
B009X01D9U|4.0|I love my marware case for my kindle fire hd (8.9,) it is sleek and doesn't interrupt the design of the kindle and it is easy to manipulate the different functions of tue case. I haven't dropped my kindle and I hope I never do, but the case seems to be strong enough to protect it. I don't think the outside is quite as hard as my old marware case for my first gen. kindle fire, but it is still very sturdy and possibly more comfortable to hold since it has a slightly more padded feel.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|If you read  the book, you probably would not agree with the movie. It's a modern and undated movie. If you seen the extended edition of &#34;The Bourne Identity&#34;,you would know that Robert Ludlum wanted that way.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Such a great Bible reading and devotional  app that can be used both on and offline, including several different versions,  some even with audio capability.
B0081HLM2E|4.0|Hodejegerne (Headhunters) (Morten Tyldum, 2011)<br /><br />Fun little thriller, based on the Jo Nesbo novel of the same name, about a corporate headhunter, Roger Brown (Cold Lunch's Aksel Hennie), who dabbles in grand theft in order to finance his wife's lavish lifestyle. At an art opening, he meets the almost-too-good-to-be-true Clas Greve (Mama's Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), not only a perfect fit for a job he's got open, but the owner of an original Rubens that seems to be just sitting around collecting dust. The problem is, Clas Greve is also ex-Special Forces, and he doesn't like people taking his stuff...and if I tell you how the cat-and-mouse game between these two guys even begins, we'll be getting into spoiler territory. Let's just say that the heist goes horribly, hilariously (if you have as warped a sense of humor as I do) wrong, and things only get worse from there. You won't believe how much worse.<br /><br />It's a fine, fine little movie, tight and funny and very well-acted by the principals. It doesn't do any envelope-pushing, but who cares? Sometimes all you need is a good, well-paced thriller. After all, look at how much money the Bourne movies made, and Headhunters is better than any of them. Unfortunately, Hollywood, smelling blood in the water, is planning a remake for 2014 (as I write this, Mark Wahlberg is rumored to star). I guess people just don't want to read subtitles, huh? *** ½
B00280LYIC|4.0|Good plot. Not a lot of side story. This book was written for children. Overall very enjoyable spin on mythology.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|A lil tacky at times, but the movie has a great plot and even better action scenes. Sets up the sequel and Avengers perfectly.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The graphics are awesome and it's a great quality game. I couldn't stop playing until I figured everything out. Try it!
B009A87ZQU|5.0|One of the best bond movies every made and comes with both Bluray and DVD, makes for a great deal. Highly recommended !
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I purchased this for my 3 1/2 - 4 month old nephew this past Christmas, and I have to say that he absolutely loves it. I'm not to sure what it is about it but it grabs his attention and puts a smile on his precious little face.  I will forever remember the look on his face as his eyes opened with excitement as he kicked, waved with a big smile as we handed him the gift. Great purchase.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Holds true to the classic Sherlock Holmes story while given a fresh look from Madonna's former hubby. One Great movie!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I do not have television and have started a collection of criminal minds to entertain my need to watch a season of criminal minds. I found this season to be a bit more dramatic, but it is the sixth season and the writers have to keep up with competition. Still enjoyed!!!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Simply one of the greatest movies ever made. Maybe Morgan F. should narrate every movie, look at the success of March of the Penguins.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Norah Jones is one of my musical go to-s. I love her voice. She has a sultry jazzy, folk sound. I have collected all of her albums that I am aware of.
B0027HOBM2|4.0|This season is starting to pick up but I think it sets up the next one even more. Looking forward to getting there next.
1451673442|4.0|I have enjoyed what I have read thus far. It takes you through steps of accepting and acknowledging your attitude of life. This includes relationships with yourself and others.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Not a &#34;typical&#34; movie, but great nevertheless. Soundtrack is also amazing and the ended fits the movie's story line perfectly.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a series that explores the different regions of the earth and shares the beauty of the planet with the observer!
B001230JXC|4.0|A typical sounded Depeche Mode album, but that's a good thing! Almost all the songs are great and makes for an excellent music session.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This started out to be a movie I watched with my nephews for something to entertain us as a family. It is so hilarious that I find myself watching it frequently and still laughing!!!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Although some may say there's no need to include the third one, it IS a trilogy and deserves some respect even if it's the least liked.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|This is a story about a man who has a dream and accomplishes what he sets out to do and films it. Based on a true story.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|I watched this video with my French class and fell in love with the singing, the storyline and the actors. I would really like to buy this and show it to my family. However, they do not speak French. Does this video have English subtitles? And/or French subtitles? If someone could help me out, it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
B004SIP9RO|4.0|I love this movie!!!! It nicely written and I love John Cusack! Great cast and great script. Sometimes love finds you after all
B0063GORYU|4.0|good on the kindle or other tablets, taking away a star for the phone app-way too small for useful play.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I liked this movie a lot.  It really was fantastic to watch (the slow-motion shots were very cool).  My only issue was the script--a bit childish and lame at times.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed the game. It was a little to short. It only took me a couple of hours before I had to pay for the full version. Nice story just to short.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|This game starts out easy and progresses in degrees of difficulty as you move through the levels. Nothing to buy to advance is a nice feature of the game
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's fun on the go and to play with friends but the two other versions (Xbox and PC) are simply better. The Xbox version you have more materials to play with and split-screen. The PC version was a vast community to play and more materials than both versions!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|I have read all the reviews and decided to get it, I haven't played it yet, it is still downloading, but o will post another review.when ot is done. thanks guys.
0525478817|5.0|I was very courious about this book, and I thought this book was about something else. BUT It wasn't disappointing!! I really loved it, It was a great love story and self discovery of ones self and living the best life you can with the cards you are delt.Families with children that have cancer. It is a hard life. Very touching and lovely story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this story!!  I loved the characters, the plot and the twist & turns.  Every time I tried to put this book down so I could get stuff done I found myself picking it right back up.  One of my favorite stories so far - LOVED IT!!!
034580404X|5.0|The books are amazing and they were shipped with no problems and faster than expected. Extremely happy with the product.
B004QK5N5W|1.0|Was hoping that this cable would work with an AT&T I-phone. It would not. It does work with I-phone 4S
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love that Amazon posted this for free to kindle users, thank you Amazon. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum (Illustrated by W. W. Denslow, best illustrations ever), stands out clearly in my mind to this day as one of my most treasured childhood memories. This book, as well as the series, was a huge part of what made my childhood what it was.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This book is great and so inspiring! He may be writing about his personal experience, but it is so relatable!
B004132HZS|4.0|I may sound crazy to some, but Jonny Lee Miller on Elementary does Sherlock better than Benedict Cumberbatch (in my opinion). I was also a little irritated I had to pay to see this version when I subscribe to every cable channnel there is because I missed it on PBS and it has not aired since its' initial run to my knowledge. That being said, beware...the entire season is only 3 episodes. Also an irritiating factor when you've settled in to watch 2 seasons on a rainy day and you're done by noon. I started early :-) It was entertaining, however.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Toca hair salon is a great game. It even has a straightener, a curler, and another kind of curler! Me and my friend play this game all the time, and we both can't believe how awesome the graphics are, and how addicting it is! If Toca Boca&trade; is reading this review, the only downside, is that this game is a little pricey. Maybe can you cut the price to 99&cent;? That would make this game even better! Please consider this option, and I hope that everyone enjoys this game!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Exceptional accounts on the raid of UBL. I'm a huge supporter of our military forces and now I have an even greater appreciation for all their hard work and dedication. Very well written, by far the best book I have ever read. Thank you for sharing the real story!

B0055SWM08|4.0|It's a decent way to pass time in a waiting room. It's logic, so you use your brain, while retaining the feel of a mindless activity.
0307341550|3.0|I'll admit that this book is a great debut for any author. I really think it introduces Flynn's distinctive writing style and sharp prose well, and it also reveals exactly the characters that she loves to write about.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Ms. Flynn's work since I've read Gone Girl and proceeded to read her other works. However, despite the strong effort, I do feel that this is her weakest book for many reasons.<br /><br />1. The mystery isn't as great in this book. With her other books, my head constantly was in a cloud of confusion to figure out what was happening. Here, though, I could mainly guess what was happening. Even when I didn't get the plot twist at the end, I felt that it wasn't a big shock. Overall, I felt a little cheated.<br /><br />2. Camille is just so unlikeable. Now Flynn always, always, always has unlikeable characters, but Miss Preaker was especially bad. I just found her so pathetic and annoying, and when it came to personal matters, weak.<br /><br />3. Out of the three, it's the darkest. You'd think the one about the Satanic killings would win that one, but nope. This book is so dark and twisted, that the only word that is perfect for it is \\"nasty.\\" Now, I like nasty, but it was a little too much. I felt so uncomfortable with 13 year olds doing inappropriate things and going into detail about it. The cutting made my skin hurt. The book void of love made me yearn for something nice to happen. Eventually, it only succeeded in making me depressed.<br /><br />Fortunately, it's an easy read, so I would recommend it. If she didn't have other novels to compare it to, Sharp Objects would be fine. However, Flynn does have other books, and ultimately, this one falls short.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat! I can't wait to read the next two books! :)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|one word describes this season:  shocking!!!!!!  It is irresistible I cant wait to see what the next season is going to hold.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|ok so I snagged it when it was free. And going through the setup I skipped facebook and right away it saw my xbox and BAM it was up and rolling with a bunch of apps. Works great on my first gen kindle fire with great load times. Glad I grabbed it for free app of the day.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Loved this book, Kathy Reichs is a fantastic writer, and as always she came up with a fresh case and it was very thought provoking, can't wait until the next one in the series!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Read this a about 1 hour.  Very good but predictable, you figured out the balance of the book early on in the story, but for Stephen King fans it is a good book.
B0098460O4|5.0|I saw them on Britain's Got Talent audition, semi-final and the final. They are truly an amazing duo. Great CD!

B0086700CM|5.0|This app is amazing. I was looking for an awesome game and I found it. It is so addictive and is good with my hand/eye coordination. This is my  fav. game and I definitely recommend it. Get this app!
B004J64QR4|5.0|this is the best performance of les mis I have seen, Alfie Boe and Norm Lewis are awesome! They really put a lot of feeling into their singing!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I didn't think there could be a game like this for the kindle. Really fun game! :D There should be more people playing for the online matches and more maps but I give it 5 starts for a fun passing time game!
B009POCG5Y|5.0|This was very entertaining; nice story. Clint, as always, did a great job! I don't remember ever seeing Amy Adams. She was so natural acting. Some BD's are keepers; this is certainly one of them.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Excellent.  A  page tuner with non-stop action and dialogue which keeps the reader satisfied. I can not wait until John Corey is once again on the case.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|This book was super boring for about half the book before it finally took off and had something g worth reading. But now I am excited for the next book. : )
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you are a walking dead fan, you will not be disappointed with this new season.  It has so many changes that were completely unexpected!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love this series!! I had just finished season 2 when my husband wanted to get into it. I picked up more things watching them over again. I cannot wait to start watching season three!!!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|You gotta love Family Guy to like this movies.  It's pretty much just Peter Griffith in a teddy bear body with an extra 100 or so points of IQ.  It was entertaining if a bit creepy.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Found it very entertaining. Great story line and flowed very well. Graphics were very good. Could have been longer, for the price.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|MIB was fun and fresh, 2 was a bit labored but still worked, and this latest version has some of the fun twists you can get with time travel movies and Josh Brolin does an impressive job impersonating stonefaced Tommy Lee Jones.  Will Smith does his usual competent job as the overconfident hipster MIB agent.  The storyline might get a bit too convoluted for the younger crowd but they won't have to be exposed to some of the more adult aspects of MIB like Ballchinians.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I have read dozens of &#34;self help&#34; books. This is the only one I have ever read that gave me results.  For some reason I was able (with a great deal of focus and effort) follow his recommendations and it has changed the quality of my relationship with myself and everyone I come in contact with. I bought this e-version so that I can reread the book with a few years of practice under my belt. It isn't for everyone, but it may be the answer to what you are seeking.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|I'm not sure why, but these Amazon episodes of Season 3 are missing about five minutes per episode.  When I compared episode 3 on Amazon to the PBS-broadcast version, I found most of the missing material to be important for viewers to understand what is happening in the series.  Amazon advertises this as \\"original UK version\\" but in seasons 1 and 2, the UK versions have more running time and the USA PBS version are the shortened edited versions.  Very confusing.  If you want the most for your money, wait a few weeks for the DVD's and make sure these episodes run the full 53 minutes instead of the edited 48 minute versions.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Intense!!!  One of my new favorite books.  Amazingly written and special.  Not &#34;just&#34; a romance...so much more.  Recommend to all ages!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Anyone who loves NCIS would love this episode and the previous one. Tear Jerker.<br />I even watch the old shows on weekends - I am adicted to NCIS
1455508969|4.0|If you are looking for an escape with a well written book, this is it.  BUT don't expect any surprises.  The plot follows the pattern of every romance ever written.  Even so, I enjoyed the book.
B009FXIICK|5.0|...and I love it for my Android device. The girlfriend also absolutely adores this game. I'm glad it was ported.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|Has the mass and feel of something you write with. Feels great when using it with drawing apps on the iPad.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|Easy for me to set up ...it searched my drives and works well.<br />paired easily .the price was right ...I'm happy
B007JWKLMO|5.0|It arrived today in brand new packaging and will add it to my collection.  Thanks.  I am waiting for the time I can take and watch this in its entirety.  It's definitely a keeper.
B001OGWY1W|2.0|Lots of action that isn't motivated.  Lots of scenes that aren't plotted.  Granted, The Joker is the best part of the movie.  Batman, eh, becomes quite uninteresting after 80 minutes of action scene after action scene - salt and peppered with character building actor scenes -  that seemingly have nothing to do with plot.  This is a great example of a movie people like because mass media told them to like it.  The first Batman is far superior.
0307341577|5.0|I actually thought I was ordering a different Gillian Flynn novel, but I am reading this one now, and it is quite the thriller.  Thanks for the great service.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Probably too dark for a young child, but touching and wonderful for anyone who has ever lost a beloved pet.  Many funny and genuine moments.
030758836X|5.0|I received this book and immediately started reading it, at the suggestion of a friend.  I have finished it already and will pass it along to my other avid reader friends.  Thanks again.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|We purchased an EPSON wireless printer. Followed all the instructions for setting this free app up with our Kindle Fiire.The app just couldn't find the printer. Guess you have to have a HP printer in order for this app to work.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Exciting and suspenseful. The author has a way of making the reader feel like you are right there with the characters.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So far I think it has fought kids about how toxtake really good care of animals and what it feels like to have your own really
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|good funny movie. The end was kinda boring, it could of been funnier, i give it 3 stars for me.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Christin and Connor are two sides of the same coin. It was like a repeat of a book but im sure I would say that if I read them in the reverse order
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Had to pay another 2.99 to finish. It really spoiled the rest of the game because I felt totally ripped off.
B00000ILDF|5.0|Sigourney Weaver good as ever.  Actually, Alien and Alien 2 were the best of the 4.  This has good color, no glitches.  Good product.  But Alien and Aliens were the BEST.  Not this third nor the 4th!<br />Cecy Ivie
B00947N6D8|5.0|We took our family to see this when it was in the theater and I have not been able to stop talking about it since.  We felt it was so well written, beautiful to watch, and intelligent.  I cannot understand why this movie wasn't a bigger hit.  There was no aspect of it that left me wishing it had been done differently.  I loved it!!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Working makes for missing this when first broadcast. Although have a DVR, still as with all things man-made, erros crop up and miss episdoes! Being able to just sit and watch each episode one after another is such a treat! The acting is SOOOO good. The production value is so right there in every scene. LOVE this series!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read several books on NDE. This one is unique having been written by a neurosurgeon. I was engrossed by his explanation and perspective. Thank you so much for sharing your personal voyage.<br />Diann
B000BZISTE|3.0|It wasn't as funny as i expected it be like the television series. I guess i just to watch the tv reruns.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Mail was too small to read on my iphone. I couldn't check it away from home. It's much better on my Kindle.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like Bingo and this one is pretty cool because you get to play with people all over. I haven't won yet but it's still fun nonetheless.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I started out thinking I knew a fair amount about Steve Job's life.  In retrospect having now read the book I knew very little.  I liked the mix of story telling ,technology ,and product focus, well balanced<br />Towards the end I felt moved to tears for an iconic inventor that will be missed, I didn't have appreciation until reading the book. Moreover I like the way the book encompasses all the relationships and product innovation well worth the read
B007WFTFG6|5.0|I downloaded this coloring app for my niece and it kept her busy while she was able to color just like coloring in a coloring book. There's different animal pictures to color and different colors to use.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not what you expect at all! It will keep you wanting more page after page! I'm actually sad that it's over,I want more!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun and relaxing game challenging but not hard.  entertaining and love horses.  one of my favorite games because I can go at my own pace
B00866JL96|5.0|I received this right on time and in perfect order. Have watched several times. It was an odd character for zach to play and he was ODD. The over all movie is good if you like romance.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Always enjoy Harry Bosch novels from Connelly, one of the best mystery writers to come along in a long time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was recommended by a friend. Never did I think I would enjoy a series about Zombies, but this TV series hooks you from the first episode in Season One.  It is full of action and weaves the characters stories into the end of the world scenario to keep you routing for humanitiy to succeed.  It makes you think about what you would do if everyone who died wanted to eat you. Where would you go to escape? Or would you give up and become a zombie?
0718177517|1.0|This is a very simply presented, easy-to-read, light treatment of a very complex operation.  Don't expect to get any sense tension or suspense, of the characters involved, or appreciation of the complexities involved in the research, planning and approvals for this mission. The language used and the writing style is so simple and sanitized that it is suitable for middle-schoolers. The only position the author takes is a mildly expressed dislike for the President.  I was disappointed.
0307730697|5.0|I wish that every American and EVERY high school student were required to read this.  you can make mistakes BUT you can over come them. His non stop attitude is an example of \\"I can do\\". And so can anyone.  No excuses.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Although a bit slow at times, I did enjoy this film enough to stay with it until the end. I am glad I did, as it improved. I would think this one would be a good rainy day watch when you have time to let it play out at its own pace. I would speed parts of it up, and maybe do away with a couple of side stories, but still not a bad effort.<br />I enjoy period pieces, and the 50's were great years to look back on. Of course there is the downside of women being second class still. Julia Robert's character was a bit progressive in comparison to the other faculty. I like that, and I like that she wanted more than the usual droll curriculum set before her. She dared to go beyond what the students had already memorized, and challenge them to offer other viewpoints. Whenever that is done, we learn. I didn't give it five stars as it was a bit slow, but I like it enough to give it second best. Not for everyone, but if you like the description, chances are you will like the film.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|If you are looking for a storyline and good acting, this isn't it.  But the guys look good and the dancing is decent (or indecent I guess).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can identify with this book on many levels.  From quotes from \\"The Jerk\\" to abuse I can see myself in Sky.  It makes a reader so much closer to the characters in a book when they can find bits of themselves there as well.  While I wasn't surprised by the twists in this book (except for one!), I will say that it was excellent storytelling.  Sky was believable.  Holder took a bit more imagination on my part because I don't know of any 18 year old boy that is that eloquent or passionate, but for fiction's sake he was an ideal partner!  I don't know Colleen Hoover's past, but in my opinion, she nailed the thoughts of people who have been abused.  Thank you for an enjoyable read, albeit quick because I couldn't put it down!  And thank you for giving a voice to those of us who don't necessarily know how to put our feelings into words after being abused.
B008N1LL42|5.0|I didn't have high hopes for this movie, but I actually really liked it.  Interesting storyline and the acting was good. Lots of action and some humor.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Merlin. This is a  Wonderful tv series.  I want all of them.  Colin Morgan and everybody in this are great actors.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Would be a 5 star if I could purchase it or opt out of the pesky ads! Good graphics and function
1442413611|5.0|My 12 year old really enjoys this series. I have had the hardest time finding books he really enjoys. He devours these books!! He reads them in a week or two. No more fighting over his reading homework!!  As soon as he finished the first he wanted the next. He loves the story line and characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing! I never saw that twist coming. I loved it so much, Colleen Hoover is a huge talent!
B006LSZECO|2.0|So many people loved this book so I read it. I found it to be predictable, boring and hugely unrealistic.  I don't mind unrealistic fiction as long at it is classified as fantasy or sci fi.  I love that!  All these years of being a sociopath and no one caught on?  The parents never suspected?  The police never punched one hole in any story?  The main character is surrounded by gullible people who never stand up.  It felt as if the author had pulled a few news stories and rewrote them by changing the names and the locations.  Maybe I expected too much going in, it just wasn't for me
B007REV4T8|1.0|this is one waste of time.i've seen all the bonds in the movies when they were released.this a very poor bond.i've watched it three times and the film just gets lost!!!!!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|You can never get enough of De Niro in this authentic mob movie. To top it off, Joe Pesci plays his terrifyingly but likable character. The great thing about this movie is how accurately the portray this dark but ever so interesting time in history. You won't want to miss this classic movie!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Lee Child has a hero on his hands. Well written & very descriptive scenes. I will continue to read the series.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Love, love, love this cd & Susan Boyle  Such a varied selection & love the duets especially with Donny Osmond. His talent compliment Susan's. Great match-up
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|The 3d is excellent and my kids love it. Only issue is that you can only copy the digital file to one computer and one portable device
B009A9BEHU|5.0|No other word, but AMAZING!  I was fortunate enough to attend 2 concerts on the MyLo Xyloto tour at the Hollywood Bowl.  This video lets me relive those awesome nights back in May.  Great video for someone who didnt get a chance to attend one of their shows.  A must have for any Coldplay fan!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Yeah, you can DVR the 2nd season that starts in February. . but, if like me, you had friends tell you that SMASH was amazing and fun . . but you didn't listen to them . . . then you gotta buy the first season on Amazon Prime and catch it from the beginning! Debra Messing kicks the stops out of her performance. GLEE is a real wannabe next to this bright, thought-provoking show.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow... this book... I don't know where to begin. I will say, it is an intense story, with strong subject matter. I found myself having to put it down often, and just take a break, because I just needed to think about what I just read. I finished reading this yesterday and I was just left stunned. This is such an amazing story. I hate that Sky had to go through what she did, but that's reality. Stuff like that happens all the time, and if it's not in front of us, we ignore it. This is a story that really makes you THINK and Colleen Hoover did an amazing job telling it.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I love it but I can't purchase it because of my parents (they're cheap) so I beg over and over again until they'll get no luck yet:-(
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Just saw the movie and enjoyed that to unbelievable that this was written so long ago and wasa fantastic story.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|this book is fabulous read it in a day loved it tears and laughter wonderfully written, a great easy read.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Having read the first volume, out of curiosity, I am quite convinced that this book is certainly not for me.<br />Not because of any prudish objection to sex in literature, but because of the puerile plot, cardboard characters and very poor style. It is quite the worst piece of writing I have read in recent times.<br />The character who writes in the first person is supposed to be a graduate in - God forbid- English Literature! My final year high school students of English Literature, have created more interesting characters and devised more interesting plotlines . They certainly write with greater sensitivity and credibility than EL James.<br /><br />I was repelled too by the cold, almost clinical descriptions of this couple's bizarre sexual activities- ( it is made very clear in words of one syllable that these characters do not make love- they just have sex! ) in which the young woman is expected to be a glorified sex slave for the gratification of an arrogant, self indulgent, rich man, who insists he must control every aspect of her life. And she must submit to his every wish- without question. A risible proposition in this day and age.<br />Her meek protestations that \\"I want more\\"-count for nothing when she keeps returning for more of the same.<br /><br />PS- And why on earth does she say \\"I flushed\\"-( as though she were using the toilet )  when she means \\"I blushed\\" ?
B00B47MTZC|4.0|Liam Neeson has finally given up on his daughter, handing over the reigns to Kevin Bacon.  But this time, the European actor trying to kill Maggie Grace is much more charming and methodical.  You might even say we were all a little \\"Taken\\" by James Purefoy.<br /><br />OK, OK  enough with the jokes.  The Following premiered last night on the Fox Network and was pretty darn solid for a network pilot.  I'd also almost say it's surprising that the show gets away with the amount of gore and scares that it does, but then I remember the schlock out there like Law and Order: SVU and Criminal Minds that do this every week, bereft of compelling plots.  Kevin Bacon stars as Ryan Hardy, a semi-retired/on medical leave FBI agent brought back into the fold when the serial killer he put death row escapes weeks before his scheduled execution.<br /><br />James Purefoy was the highlight of the premiere, taking some of the thunder away from Kevin Bacon.  I find that to be a positive in the show's favor because we're all meant to believe that Joe Carroll (a rather bland serial killer name) is an absolute charmer and charismatic cult (but don't call it that) leader.  Without that, there is no way to ground the show in some believable reality.<br /><br />The Following drops us in just as the action begins with Carroll's escape from prison and it doesn't let up from there.  It's a bit reminiscent of a middle of the season episode of 24﻿, where we'd have a convergence of events culminating in big shoot outs and brawls.  All of the action sacrifices some back story though, at least in the pilot.  We do get flash backs to brief moments in Hardy's investigation into Carroll but all we learn really is that Hardy gets lucky in breaking the case, although not so lucky with his health.<br />The one issue that I think I might have going forward is that the show has the potential to stay very dark, which could create an atmosphere absent of fun. That's not to say the show should be funny and optimistic, but the show can't focus only on murder and terror.  There needs to be some heroics as well. Again I will compare this to 24.  In nearly every season, 24 went to some very dark corners of humanity and that defined the show, for better or for worse.  But Jack Bauer would always come through and remind us of the hero he is (even at the cost of his own well being).  Our hope as an audience is that Ryan Hardy racks up some wins and makes you feel like he's making progress in taking down Carroll's followers.<br /><br />Although I can't say I'll be in the mood for such a dark show week to week (thank goodness for DVR), I'll definitely follow The Following through to season's end and hopefully beyond.  I hope they can prolong the same fast pace through the remaining 14 episodes.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5!  Just one warning: if you love dogs, be ready to fast forward about 20 minutes into the pilot.  There are some things you just don't want to see.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|Amazon showed that it would work with the Nabi 2, but as others reported here, it does not. wish I could get my money back
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's rare to find a TV series these days that is not running on stupidity, crudeness or shock factor or with any originality. When most new series are scripted fake reality shows with over dramatic people, this series has in every episodes, class, laughs, plotting characters against other characters, love, family drama, family support and there is a way about things that everyone just knows, and yet there are those who challenge it and those who show the silver linings in the very things challenged. It's got the English way of things, but yet is understandable for us Americans and it is a wonderful look at a simpler way of life and gives great insights into what the first use of modern things must have been like. Though it was in the earlier seasons, seeing the staff use the phone when it is installed for the first time and talk about electricity being installed and the cars and yet a buggy alongside them. I do suggest watching it in HD, and if you watch it on PBS they put the large logos on the screen the entire time of which is a bit annoying and cheesy, but it seems far more real in the HD not just because of the clarity, but I think the film ratio must be for wide screen TVs in HD as the non HD PBS channel skewed the view. The PBS HD channel and the HD streaming has the right film ratio for wide screen TVs.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Great book and series. Kiddos have it in hardback but wanted to read it on the *new* kindle.<br />: )
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|The cord died in July. Six months of use. Pfft. Totally disappointed!!!!!! Left it at 2 stars because it did work for a while, and quite well, but now? Dead as a doornail and I can't use my Kindle Fire again until the new one comes in! Bummer.<br /><br />I had a lot of trouble with my old cord because I read so much, my battery runs down and I need to plug in to continue reading. My power plug is quite a ways off. This cord lets me sit in my chair, plug in, and still read comfortably. It is plugged in and charging now, and I am very happy.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This show is wickedly funny and deliciously evil. I'm looking forward to the next show and next season. Kudos to all who make this show!
B008RZ96RS|3.0|Unless you have to have everything by The Velvets this is really too much.  You've heard the songs before, the Nico album is okay, the live stuff is poorly recorded (on a par with the Quine tapes), the outtakes are of marginal interest and the notes add nothing that you don't already know.  \\"Peel Slowly And See\\" is all you really need.  Save your money.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|Dickens set the fiction standard for his times. His writings are still relevant in modern times. It is good to recall how our fore-bearers lived. His works brought about improvements in the standard of living of the poor.

B0017SWPXY|3.0|I enjoyed this read, although a bit slow at times. I enjoyed how the differences were portrayed in the dog's relationships with the three main characters; the strong bond with his male, the protective yet not as fierce relationship with the child, and the subtle caring and respect shown to the female.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have to say that I actually like this story more than the 50 shades books. I have pre-ordered the 3rd book 'Entwined'. I can not wait to see how it finishes out! Sylvia Day is a great writer!!

B0012GTZC0|5.0|I like Ken Follett and this was a very good book, very suspenseful and not too complicated.  I'm reading his &#34;Dangerous Fortune&#34; now and there just seems to be too many people to keep up with, but my memory isn't what it used to be.  You'll enjoy Eye of the Needle.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Although I'd been warned I was not prepared for the tears.  Knowing that this is a &#34;real story&#34; made it all the more meaningful and as a dog lover, it confirmed my belief that dogs truly ae &#34;tuned in&#34; to their &#34;people&#34;.

B005EGXTL2|5.0|Having the ability to be able to get an ebook instantly whenever you want is the best when you have an author that keeps you spellbound with her use of the English language. The first two books I gobbled up within days. No way can you put off waiting for what comes next.
0307888908|5.0|If you are tired of your laziness, complacency and need some guidance in really cultivating your career, GET THIS BOOK!  This book is excellent and it is an easy read.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I'm not a Ron Swanson, but I am a beer drinking, boot wearing, steak eating Die Hard loving guy. In other words, I was pretty much not the target audience for this film. But enough of my lady friends convinced me to give it a shot. I got these girls into Sons of Anarchy and Spartacus: Blood and Sand respectively so I figured I owed it to them to take their word.<br /><br />I loved this film for a variety of reasons. I remember seeing the trailer and rolling my eyes and assuming it was some kind of terrible Glee era product trying to capitalize on the success. And honestly it could have been, but that still didn't detract from my enjoyment.<br /><br />First, so far as I can tell this is an original script/film etc. And whether that's good or bad doesn't detract from my appreciation. So already points for being something new, even if the story is as predictable as you can kind of guess it is. But I've seen Die Hard tons of times. It's about the journey not the destination.<br /><br />And Pitch Perfect's journey is great. You all know the story, Beca (Anna Kendrick) joins a fledgling college Accapella group and they go to finals. But it's charming, sweet, witty, and the music is actually pretty good. Special mention again to Anna Kendrick who is a FANTASTIC singer, I was very blown away. Gorgeous voice.<br /><br />It's a very fun and enjoyable film and I actually wanna see it again. I'm not the target audience but it still hit a home run in my book. Great film that leaves you in a good mood.
B008J34466|5.0|I am really liking this album.  Her voice is fantastic and the songs keep my footing tapping.  Sometimes I get looks from my co-workers when I start moving to the music in my chair!
B008VNIA32|4.0|It was shot 20 years ago on high-def video tape (analogue 1250 lines) so it will never look as good as if they'd used film; but it looks great for what it was. Most of the color/contrast issues can be attributed to the lighting used. I've got 5.1 audio, but I think this is better with the LPCM 2.0 stereo track instead as the DTS 5.1 doesn't sound quite right. I'm not sure what they did, but it sounds like someone messed up. It's probably a technical limitation they tried to get around to give people what they think they want. It really sounds great with a good set of headphones (then you can really hear every subtle note without waking everyone).<br /><br />I loved the whole thing, but am thoroughly confused by the final curtain. I won't describe it for those who haven't seen it, but if anyone has & understands what the symbolism meant, please tell me. Thanks in advance.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the game is so sweet.you know what I say about this game here I will tell you&hellip;sweeeeeeeeeeet!!!!!!
B0040JHLDQ|5.0|My husband runs half marathons and always uses Brooks running shoes. As expected, these shoes are great and he likes running with these shoes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this intense emotional story of Sky and Holder.  A \\"hopeful\\" survival story of two people flawed by their traumatizing experience finding strength and love with each other.  It was a believable love story.  Well written dialogue with wit and sarcasm.  I would have loved to hear the audio narration of this book!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|No this is not a fun read - but it is a great book for working on your stuff to get it ready for electronic publishing.
0316228532|2.0|It was just really awful. I couldn't even finish it. There seemed to be no plot. It was scattered all over the place. Two stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is an unbelievably gripping story. It has even more moral dilemmas than the first book in the series and tugs even more at the heart-strings. I am a male, and I seldom cry, but this book had me balling on more than one occasion. I finished the book in three days, because the story sucked me in so much. If you want a book that will really involve your mind and your emotions, then this is the one for you.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE that this book was available for kindle at an amazing price!!! I was able to read it immediately after purchase and not have to wait like an ordinary package!
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great read.  Could not put it down!<br />Cannot wait to begin the third book. Will be interested in other books by this author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|more adicting than lemonaid it is awesome and I hotly regimend this app also I recommend bloons td and jet pack joy ride good worlds a lot of minerals and an up coming update is going to have sighns and wait for it wait for it.  armor nice crafting system and never crashes it is geting more like the computer version with more stuff coming out it is epic long best on kindle fire<br /><br />but I don't recomend the creative mode its not as fun but it is the best
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am utterly blown away! The fearless Katniss Everdeen is th  true embodiment of perseverance and unwavering self assurance. Wow!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love this game.  It is easy to follow, andthehints make its joy to play.  This 40 year old Aunt has as much fun as her10 year old niece.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|They are awesome got here on time and were well packaged to prevent damage and they are amazing. I Would recommend theses for anyone who owns ps3 or xbox.

B009OWGMYI|5.0|I've been a HUGE fan of HIM for many years now, so finding CDs that they release in the U.S. is always awesome. This CD was packaged well, it arrived on time, with no defects to the jewel case or the CD itself. The new song &#34;Strange World&#34; goes back to the Love Metal sound, which made me fall in love with this band in the first place. I am highly anticipating their new album, which I am hoping will be released in the States not long after it is released in Finland and Europe.
0545265355|4.0|I am so excited to haev this and beable to ready it. Liked how it came and the conditons it is in for the cost.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really enjoyed the introspection that it evokes from a parent reader.<br />What would you do? How far would you go?
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Got hooked not too long ago and absolutely had to watch all of the episodes available. Great show, great story, great actors. Can't wait to see the rest!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really enjoyed the story line- different take on a similar type of novel but done with a fresh approach.<br />Liked hearing from both perspectives on alternating chapters.<br /><br />Would highly recommend!
B0081L391C|2.0|You can't fullscreen the picture, connection was laggy and didn't allow buffering. Just download it on iTunes and start watching while it downloads. Great movie obviously though!
B005CGI4EG|4.0|No frills packaging or &#34;special content&#34;...just the episodes.  I love it!  The only thing that sucks is that the original theme song is not included, but you don't really need it to enjoy these episodes.  If you are a true Bundys fan, you'll hear the original theme song in your head during the opening credits :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I &lt;3 THIS APP!!!!!!!!! This app is very interesting and addictive.If you are skeptical about buying this app,then take my word,IT IS THE BEST APP OUT THERE!!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Interesting characters and having lived in Philadelphia for a while, I felt it captured parts of the city very well.  Definitely recommend.
1419707663|5.0|My nephew loved these books. I loved that they came in a boxed set.<br />I will be buying the rest of the books in this series.
B002CN2NCG|4.0|Have enjoyed since first viewing many years ago. One of the early movies in &#34;surround&#34;. A western fan all my life.
0688014291|5.0|Great principles which can be applied immediately to your personal and professional lives. However, will probably require more than ONE MINUTE to master. (-;
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was disappointed with the lack of character development and the simple story line was made into something less than intricate and more rambling than spellbinding.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Must read a very powerful account that gives you a small glimpse into the life of a Seal. I recommend this to any one.
B0094K1QR8|1.0|Not only is this a fairly simple minded and predictable romance story - I can enjoy that if it's well done - but everything about this film is less than mediocre: acting, directing, everything. Don't waste your time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|...für pferdefan und die, die es noch werden wollen. Tolle Grafik, die sehr realistisch rüberkommt. Kann man nur weiter empfehlen.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I purchased this DVD for a friend, She was very happy with it and said thankyou a couple of times.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|This book sucks no one read it u will want to throw it kindle . Out the . Windows cause this book<br />Gave my kindle a virus
B000F1IQNC|4.0|not as good as the first one but still a great movie for kids of all ages,like i said,it falls only a little short.
0810994739|1.0|If  you have a little brother, like Manny, you should really take into account that Gregory has to put up with the peskiest brother in  the world!!  And Roderick, the peskiest big brother in the world, and some times you are the big brother, or the little brother. But I`m the big brother!
B003L20IJM|5.0|we really liked this movie,it was fun and entertaining,emma thompson does a fantastic job,as always!great family fun,i would recommend it to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun and I totally recommend this to everyone who is like in love with horses but there is this guy who tells you what to do
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|this was a great prequil,one of the best that i have ever seen done,more people in hollywood need to watch this and use it as a floor plan on how to do a prequil,exellent!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This CD always leaves me wanting more.  All the songs are so well written and the music is wonderful.  The duets are my favorite.  I sure hope this is just one of many Music of Nashville releases.  And the show is phenominal!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book ever I absolutely love it!! Great job! I can't wait to read the next book keep up the good work
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I never read Stephen King, but I could not resist.  I'm a bit too young to rember the period, but I loved the story.  The suspense was great!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I like that I can build a strong army even without having to purchase anything.  However, this game crashes often when you attempted to fight another player so I am not giving it higher than 3 stars.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I am having trouble putting this book down. It is very thought provoking and just makes you wonder how terrible some childhoods can really be.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I'm not sure what movie is about since I bought as a gift for grandaughter.  From what I hear, she loves this movie.
B0045EPD90|5.0|Absolutely brilliant! I loved every minute of this book and could not put it down! My only complaint is that it ended!! Next chapter of their lives PLEASE Cecilia!!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Purchased for my Kindle Fire because of a potential virus issue.  Must have fixed it because I haven't had any problems since.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One Xmas movie must every holiday season!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Chevy Chase is funny as hell in this Xmas comedy. Don't forget to watch it next holiday season.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun but I wish it was easier to get gems!:) I love to wash the horse and clean its pen (something I thought id never say XD!!)
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Didn't even see Batman begins but after watching The Dark Knight at least 5 times will be looking forward to watching all of Christian Bale's Batman movie's. Got to see if their better then Batman with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson which was my favorite til I watched The Dark Knight. Other Batman's after the first with M.K and J.N. were no good.
B00322PK2G|4.0|Unfortunately the rubber of the bracelette is too weak, and it was damaged quickly. Next time I wil buy a watch with ametal bracelette
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Being out of college for a year or so now and just now reading this book at the suggestion of a friend. I'm both glad and sad that I waited this long to read this book. Glad because in high school I was someone who would have identified with Charlie, but now that I am older and have gone through the self discoveries that Charlie went through I can appreciate it more. I'd recommend this book to any wallflower teenage or adult who ever identified them self as a wallflower. No matter where you are in the process of life this book will help to shed a little light on your path. Whether it be before you or behind you.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I loved this book, and I recommend it for runners and like-minded alike. Christopher McDougall is a wonderful story teller with a wonderful story to tell.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses so this is like the perfect game I just think it amazing game who ever likes horses then they should buy it
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I was honored to be able to treat my mother and myself to see \\"Les Miserables\\" on opening day---Christmas Day. In all honestly, I needed someone to go with since this is my all time favorite musical and novel. Nonetheless, my mother too loves the music. How good was it? At the end there was an standing ovation in the theater. I've never witnessed that in my life. Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />\\"Les Miserables\\" takes place in 19-Century France that evolves around the story of Jean Valjean (played by Hugh Jackman)---an ex-convict who turns his life around and meets Fantine (played by the amazing Anne Hathaway), an unwed mother. ****Spoiler Alert*** Fantine passes on and must take care of her daughter Cosette. Obviously this is a musical so pretty much all the dialogue is all sung but it is done marvelously. As everyone may have heard it, the actors sang live; no per-recording, no lip syncing. Pure live singing. I'm not going to lie, it makes it even more real and raw. Definitely not a disappointment. For anyone who love \\"Les Mis\\", they will not be disappointed with this adaption. I do believe though that they could have found a better Javert (played by Russell Crowe) but for the sake of being real, Crowe does a decent job as Javert. So don't judge him too harshly. Another fun fact: the original Broadway Valjean plays the Bishop of Digne! That was a great surprise.<br /><br />For those who are fans of the Broadway may be a little confused because some of the orders of songs have been changed, but if you look at it, it works better this way. And it makes a little bit more sense to have it like this. Just a warning, but believe me you won't even care to correct it in your head.<br /><br />The reviews were right, Anne Hathaway shines in this movie! Her version of the famed song \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is so great that there is no words. You'll probably cry, as did my theater at that part, and at the end. I'm not ashamed to admit that I too shed a few tears.<br /><br />\\"Les Miserables\\" is more that just a regular musical, it's a story that somehow everyone can relate to. It's a story of hope, redemption and promise that no matter if you're in the worse times of your life \\"even the darkness night will end and the sun will rise\\".  Something that we all need to hear right now. You'll laugh, but you'll mainly cry and reflect and relate. A heed of warning though: this is a 2 1/2 hour movie so it may not be for everyone as it is also a musical. But give it a shot, it isn't a girly musical with a sappy love story. It's about life.<br /><br />So join the crusade and grab a box of tissues and a friend and watch \\"Les Miserables\\"!iserables\\" is more that just a regular musical, it's a story that somehow everyone can relate to. It's a story of hope, redemption and promise that no matter if you're in the worse times of your life \\"even the darkness night will end and the sun will rise\\".  Something that we all need to hear right now. You'll laugh, but you'll mainly cry and reflect and relate. A heed of warning though: this is a 2 1/2 hour movie so it may not be for everyone as it is also a musical. But give it a shot, it isn't a girly musical with a sappy love story.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun I v played it alot in the past few days I think people should get this gamme
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really liked this one. Kept me turning the pages and wanting to keep going even fighting sleep. Such a twist!!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Love, love, love John Grisham.  'Nuff said.<br />(All right -- I have to add 13 more words so here they are.)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the 360 version and its way better but this has to be the most awesome app for the fire
B00003CXRM|5.0|I bought the movie and the sound track for my husband that just loves this movie, so now he doesn't have to wait to watch the movie.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app is absolutely everything you need to access mail. So easy to get to and easy to use! Awesome!
B00004XQ83|5.0|My husband loves this track and the movie so i had buy both, this and the movie. He loved both.
B000P0J0G0|5.0|Great present very funny, if you enjoy British humor which some don't. We have watched it several times. I love Fry and Laurie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Its a deceptive book that I enjoyed reading, and it really plays with your emotions especially as characters are revealed. I thought the ending left many loose ends but I could not think of a different ending. Would have been too easy to prosecute or kill a character. The lead female character's behavior fluctuates wildly at times (sweet girl suddenly spitting in people's food), and that took a bit getting used to, but maybe there are more of those characters in real life than we realize. I enjoyed the ride even if there was no redemption for anyone including the reader.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Fresh cinematography, cute lead, badass Bruce Willis - a formula for another bubble gum hit.<br /><br />It won't go down in history as a classic action film, but it sure was an entertaining way to spend an evening.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a simple calculator app for your needs. The buttons are large and easy to push with enough space in between them that you don't feel like you are pressing too many buttons at one time. Love the app.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We received this as a Christmas gift and finally made time to watch it.<br /> Even my wife, who said she doesn't like animated movies, really got into it.<br /> If you're thinking about getting this movie and you have a 3D capable TV go the few extra bucks for that package set. I'm getting a 3D version to add to my set.<br /> Another great thing I've seen with any Pixar show is the moral contained within the story. They work as a great teaching tool for families with children if parents want to preview the bonus tracks and get the story developers view of scene creations.<br /> Well worth the money and time.
B001U887OW|5.0|Bought as a gift for my daughter who loves Crocs.<br />Absolutely LOVES them! Crocs are unbeatable in quality.<br />Will purchase more!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed the graphics and story line of this game. It also ran without any problems on my kindle fire hd. I look forward to the sequel.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I bought this specifically for the standing feature. It works great, does not slide or come loose. I love the color, and my kindle feels secure inside of the cover. I also like that closing the cover puts the kindle to sleep :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a very good game for horse lovers so all you horse lovers out there this is the app for you!!
B008MM9630|3.0|It is a nice game but costs too much to get ahead. Unfortunately I don't have the patience to wait to earn jewels, one per level, to get ahead. Hope my husband never finds out how much I have spent. Makes me want to stop playing any of these games.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|what can i say, i love fun..  who doesnt, but the music is terrific,  they will be on the grammys soon!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Awesome movie! Lives up to the tradition of beautiful fairy tales that Disney has put on the screen. Hope this continues. It's so nice to dream.
0425252868|5.0|gave it to my dad for christmas, he read about it in a local newspaper and wanted it, ihe loved it and finished it in two days.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|My 18 year old twin granddauters requested this movie. They are big movie buffs and had gone to see this in Chicago with their mother. Now it is added to their extensive collection.
B0054SMID0|2.0|I guess a lot of people like this kind of thing, but I didn't pick up on anything original or that interesting. The acting was fine, as was the cinematography--some of the legal and courtroom stuff strained credulity for someone who sees a lot of the real thing--but it just failed to capture my interest.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter loves any Disney movie and this is now one of her favorites. We all love Disney and Tinkerbell.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Good game one of my personal favorites good for anybody who enjoys city games I would recommend this game to anybody
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is so much fun, it is challenging as well. I recommend this game to everyone and anyone who likes a challenge and is into puzzles as much as I am. You will have hours of entertainment. You won't go wrong.
B001EC3JME|4.0|I bought this holster 7 months ago and have worn it pretty much every day since. I use it to hold a Maglite XL200 and it fits very comfortably. That light doesn't have a flared head, and so the light would eventually slip through and drop onto the ground. I cut off a section from a badge holder from an old conference--basically a 3/4\\" x 2\\" strip of heavy cloth lanyard--and sewed it across the bottom to keep the light from slipping through. I can still work the endcap with the light in the holster, if necessary. Aside from my required modification, the holster has held up great. There is no frayed stitching, the belt clip is like new, and it doesn't appear worse for wear.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  However, gonna need some kleenex for the ending.  I got this for several of my grandchildren, and they loved it.  No sex, no violence, no profanity.
1439127700|4.0|A short history of the modern Presidency from Hoover to Obama, told entirely in stories about the interactions between presidents, ex-presidents, and future presidents. The stuff you'd expect is here--Ford's pardon of Nixon, former president Carter's rogue diplomacy in North Korea, the disaster relief team of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton--but there's a lot of hidden history, too: Nixon's deliberate interference in the Vietnamese peace talks of 1968, stalling any peace settlement until it could no longer benefit the Democrats; Clinton's late night phone calls to Nixon, getting foreign policy advice; Ford and Carter's strong mutual distaste turning to a grudging appreciation in the course of an overseas trip; Clinton's surprising adoption into the Bush clan as a \\"Brother of Another Mother.\\" As I read all these stories, gathered mostly from memoirs, presidential papers, and interviews with staff who were there, my impressions of all these men widened as they grew more human. If you're interested in the intersection of personality and politics, there's a lot of material here for you.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I always loved Flipboard on my Android phone; I doubly love it on my Kindle Fire.  It reformats my myriad RSS feeds into elegantly legible, swipe-able pages.  Five stars, well-earned.  (I am not a paid spokesman, just a happy user... :) )
1451627289|4.0|While I'm not a fan of most of Stephen King's work, I enjoyed this big novel: it is a suspenseful, well-researched, funny, compassionate, and thoughtful look at the difference between the American cultures of 1960 and 2010, and at how far a reasonable person might be willing to go to alleviate some of the suffering between. The narrator-hero is a Good Guy, not a genius, not hugely imaginative, but with a lot of warmth wrapped around a steely core he didn't know about himself. I felt very comfortable in his presence, and when he finally met Lee Oswald, the interaction between the two was both surreal and convincing.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|Great to have the collection in a boxed set. Excellent to see Leonard's progression of songs through the years and the themes that repeat over time.<br /><br />A quality remastering It's Leonard Cohen what more can one say!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I was hooked on Big Bang with the very first show. My family now reserves Thursday night for Big Bang - no interuptions allowed. This season marks a full return to comedy, without the 'meaness' it had a couple of seasons ago. I never understood why the writers thought that good friends would humiliate each other (i.e. feeding Sheldon false data in the Artic) in the first place - much less that they'd remain friends afterwards. Not really funny at all. And of course, Priya was beautiful, but so incredibly unlikable!<br />I'm so glad the writers are back on track and we love the permanent addition of Amy.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Lots of puzzles, I really enjoy Mahjong and this one gives me lots to play with.  My son is also enjoying it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Having read all the Reacher series except the first one,  I wanted to see how Jack started his singular journey.  It all flowed neatly from beginning to end.  This adventure was exciting, but maybe not as intense as some to come.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is genre I prefer to read and this choice did not disappoint.  It was POLITICALLY current.<br /><br />The story will appeal to a wide range of readers and I will recommend it to my sons who also enjoy action packed thrillers.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Found it interesting.  Never could guess what would happen next.  Definitely one of his best.  Less courtroom and more of the action.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is, undoubtedly, one of the most intriguing and heartfelt series.  I love traveling back in time to another era.  The settings, costuming, and character development are excellent as well as progressive!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I am giving up on the &#34;Kay Scarpetta&#34; series as she has turned into a crank.  Her relationships with all the other regular characters have turned sour leaving the reader scrambling to find the real plot.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Of course, a wonderful classic that fills your heart with the Christmas spirit any time of the year. A warm read.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|I like creepy movies so I enjoyed this.  On a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 6.5 or 7.  It isn't one that I would run to my friends and say &#34;you gotta see this movie&#34; but it was a great way to spend an evening.
B001D09OAI|5.0|Fabulous<br />Fabulous, funny, poignant.  An all around terrific movie.  I can't imagine any baseball lover who wouldn't love every minute of it.
141694737X|5.0|Super cute, easy to lift flaps. Simply story line so my child can retell the story on his own. Great for babies and toddlers. Highly recommend and at a good price.
B009POCG2C|5.0|This is a marvelous, funny, poignant film.  Clint Eastwood just gets better and better.  It's a film for the whole family.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Looks like leather, but at a great price. And you can't go wrong with red! Holds the Kindle securely. Better than expected.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Amazing. I tried to stump the app, by making it identify esoteric dance mixes, but it is almost un-stumpable. Abysmal for country songs, though :(
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I tried to reorder angry birds again, (it said the original)  I didn't know I already had the original.  Basically I ordered what I already had and didn't get a new one, just the same one used.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Bad experience with this purchase.<br />Strangely, I received the product with a higher value invoice.<br />This significantly increased customs duties I had to take.<br />Should pay more attention.
B00968TI64|2.0|I have Dio's first solo album, Holy Diver (24K Gold) and the sound quality is good. But this one, not so good sound quality.
B004V2AWKG|4.0|Everyone knows the basic premise of this story so I won't go into it. It's a great story, a definite page-turner, but way too short. And that's mostly why it's a 4/5. It felt like a long short story rather than a novel. And what I mean by that is that it needed more meat. More detail. This book could have easily been 400-500 pages long without slowing it down too much. Where are the descriptions of the community in general? Flashbacks to when Father was a child? Stories about Father caring for Asher in the Nurturing Center? Stories of Jonas and Asher working together and Asher causing Jonas to not be able to concentrate? Flashbacks of the Giver back when he was the Receiver? It could have been much, much longer. And I really wish it had been. This book took me 3 evenings to read and I'm generally a slow reader.
B004DN3VEM|3.0|The songs are awesome, but the production is not that good. It's an old album so it is good for its age. But very nice album.
0451196716|4.0|The Long Walk is a story about a competetion between 100 boys aged 18 and under who must walk until only one is left standing. You must keep a pace of at least 4 miles per hour or risk getting a \\"ticket\\". A great story. A bit long here and there but not enough to lose interest. It is a \\"long\\" walk afterall. Really though, a very good story and a definite must read. Buy the Bachman Books instead though and get 4 novels.
B0092MIHSY|5.0|Another great album from Jens Lekman. I even got it for free because I ordered a text book off of amazon.com and received a 5$ credit towards mp3s.
0451197968|2.0|Of the Bachman Books, this is by far the worst story. It boggles the mind that this book has a higher rating than Roadwork (which is great, 5 stars, see my review). The Running Man had promise. It's the story of a dreary future world where those who have no other choice due to poverty, illness, etc. are driven to compete on gameshow for the chance to get out of their terrible situation, but where ultimately no one ever wins. And if you don't win, you die. Even though the basic idea has been done many times before it still has the potential to be a great story. But potential is all it has. I had a hard time finishing this book and by the end I really didn't care what happened to anyone. I just wanted it over. Nothing really captured my attention. I felt the story dragged on. I typically love the Bachman Books, but this one was terrible. If you must read this story, buy a copy of the Bachman Books and get 4 novels. Don't buy this one on it's own.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the greatest books I have read! Loved It! Couldn't put it down! I'm now super excited to see the movie!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have the worst time falling asleep and will be up for hours. With this on for just a few minutes I am asleep.
B0015AARJI|4.0|This update from PS2 controller it's great. The same old shape we adore plus wireless. Very smart choice by Sony.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Sometimes you just don't mess with perfection. I bought these along with the Monster iSport Immersion headphones...talk about two different ends of the spectrum. I spent an hour going through all the intricacies of the Monster pair and still needed to do some tweaking.<br /><br />Enter the MDR-W08, these are so easy and comfortable. No tweaking or switching pieces...they just fit like a glove in my ears. Keep in mind that's why I bought two pairs of headphones...none of them ever fit well. I hope they hold up to the moisture when I'm in the gym...I will probably be back to buy another pair.
1118232658|5.0|A wonderful overview by a great author. This is not a how to book but it should be read by businesses and consumers who are trying to understand how social media is changing our world and why we should embrace it as a tool of production and not a time waster of teenagers
B003MXD694|5.0|Fun and quirky,  this is more for adult than child audience. Husband and I loved it, kids enjoyed but didn't get some of the humor
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I play when I can on the Kindle or just for a break from whatever book I'm reading at the time. I enjoy this game and am glad I downloaded it.
B0000A5A0T|5.0|As someone who has a very eclectic music taste (as can be implied by my screen name), I have been able to appreciate just about any sort of music that has a lot of meat on it. That is, if it has a significant amount of what can be called soul, emotion, complexity, with or without vocals, it has my name all over it.<br /><br />This pure masterpiece by the almighty jazz legend John Coltrane really does pack a punch, and every bit as much as any hard rock or heavy metal band that I have ever listened to. Coltrane's sheer prowess with his saxophone NEVER fails to impress the listener, along with the rest of his band. As a drummer myself, I can honestly say that the astronomical technicality of Philly Joe Jones is more than enough to make me go wild with jealousy, LOL. Man oh man, does that guy kick some serious butt behind the drum kit!<br /><br />Overall, this album is a must-have for any fan of jazz music, and of great music in general. Heck, why are albums like this still available for sale today? Because it is THAT GOOD of music, that's why! Right along with classical music, this is true, honest music that has lasted thoughout the ages, and it is infinitely superior to all that god-awful electronic pop-dance garbage that is being slammed through our heads on a regular basis. I should not even have to say that, because that is just common sense.<br /><br />Anyways, if you are looking to get this album, go ahead and buy it already! You will be very glad that you did.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I thought the book was well written.  The only reason I didn't rate it five stars was because I thought there was more gorey stuff that what was needed to explain the deaths of the animals.  Otherwise, the writer kept my attention; There were a few evenings I couldn't put the book down.
B004UOE7VA|4.0|Each track manages to sound fresh and bear each remix artist's signature while still having a Daft Punk feel.  It doesn't fit seamlessly together as the original Tron: Legacy OST does, so I recommend shuffling this album into an electronic playlist.
0385342063|3.0|I wanted to give Sophie Kinsella another chance since it had been awhile since she published a new novel.  I used to enjoy her other books in the past (funny, entertaining) but since she has given birth, it appears that her writing style and storylines have gone downhill. Every book appears to be the same type of storyline (ditsy girl that rides by the seat of her pants and ends up with a successful CEO type of guy that has not idea that she is a hypothetical liar) but the characters have different names.  The storyline was pretty predictible.  It was an ok read but there are more interesting books/storylines from other authors out there to read for your entertainment.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I have just started watching Dexter on DVD. I've seen the first season and I'm hooked! Now I've ordered all the available seasons and I can't wait to get them!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|To be honest, I haven't read it yet. I read a ask me anything on reddit he did and it left me currious, so I bought his book
034580404X|5.0|I received the trilogy as a Christmas present from my best friend.  I wasn't thrilled about the gift thinking that they were just about sex. My best friend told me to give them a try, and I didn't read them right away, event though she was constantly bugging me to read them.  My husband was traveling on Friday, so I decided to begin them then.  I didn't like the bondage stuff, and was bored with it.  Half way through book one, I wasn't even sure that I was going to read all three.  At the end of Book 1, I couldn't wait to read Book 2 and 3 to find out the total story.  I'm so glad that I stuck with it.  I read all three books in 3 days.  I stayed up VERY late to read the past 3 nights and woke early to read some more. I just couldn't put them down.  I must even say that I was sad to see for the third book to end.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I wasn't as involved after I reached the halfway point.  I was reading to finish it.  The introduction of new characters and what I thought was going to happen  not happening when I thought it was, I guess it all happened so fast.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved the light hearted comedy in this movie. My husband even likes it... that says a lot!<br />I highly reccomend this even if you hate Glee like I do.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great easy read. Love the characters. Colleen Hoover is becoming one of my favorite authors. The story line kept me interested and I could not put this book down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been looking for a game like this for many months. It is a game that I want to tell all my friends about. Keep up the good work.
B007HIEBV2|4.0|I love it, so upbeat and fun. At first listen it sounds like the star wars cantina band but they rock it! They are all really good musicians and have some really technical licks but make it flow in way that just sounds fun.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Last episode is a real cliff hanger. Can't wait to see what happens next...I really need to get out more.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|I've downloaded a number of apps from this developer and have yet to be disappointed. I use it on my kindle fire. This application is a staple to my utility library. Of the many features it has, analyzing the SDcard is perhaps my favorite. Keeping track of files and folders is essential to good housekeeping and this app makes it easy... and it's free. The application is stable,  useful, elegant and easy to use. I highly recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|grandson loves it. I don't play it but it keeps him occupied for a while. not a game for me but good for him.
B00A0A6F7C|3.0|I was expecting so much more from ths album.  Every song is beautiful and I especially liked her duets with Donny Osmond.  However there seemed to be a lack of emotion in many of the songs.  The notes were right,. the tone was right, the music was lovely but something was missing.  Normally a singer of Susan Boyles' capacity would stir up feelings in my soul,. ie Bette Midler, Sarah McLaughlan,. Laura Story (to choose a few from different genres)<br />but I pretty much felt nothing after listening to each song.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I never play it but our grandson loves it. it keeps him occupied. I probably would recommend it to others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is the kind of game for horse lover's.It is a very fun game to play but it gets kinds boring after awhile. I love it!!
B00796E7CA|4.0|I bought this after I realized I didn't have anything with The Quest of Erebor - so although there's a lot of material that covers some of the same events as The Silmarillion, there's a lot of other new material, too!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game. noticed no problems at all while playing. I played this on my phone all the time so glad I can download this on my kindle. wish there were more lvls tho.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|What an amazing series.  We couldn't stop watching; all 15 hours in a few days.  Great for winter's cold days and nights.
B009GYSQV6|3.0|Fun album, a bit more electronic than the previous two but really grows on you with subsequesent listens.  Good collection
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing book!could not put it down! I'm also sad its done. I miss it already. You will not be disappointed.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|There's nothing like reading an unabridged classic. Scrooge is uglier than any T.V. rendering but that makes his salvation even more remarkable. The introduction explains how the original story was published and why it has &#34;staves&#34; instead of chapters. Even in the Kindle form, the illustrations are beautifully rendered.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is not only addictive.. But it's also mind stimulating!! I like all the different levels that comes with the app! I have installed this on 3 different devices it's so addictive.. Lol!
0525953728|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my Grandson. He just finished Basic training and I thought he would enjoy it, and he did. This was a moment in history the we are all curious about.
B0053O89YM|5.0|always perfect!! never had a problem. I do not see the reason why I need 18 words. Sorry! This is nuts!
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was great, it started out slow but good , so good I could not put it down. Mr grey sounded so delicious
B001O7JHVG|5.0|What more do you need to know then it's Stallone and Russell? Well who can resist an action film about L.A.s top two cops framed for a crime they didn't commit and have to go the lengths to prove their innocence. It's not a complicated story at all. Is that what anyone who's looking here expecting that anyway? It's just a fun action film packed with a ton of adventure and overflowing testosterone. Stallone and Russell stick right with each other in toughness and good bad jokes. Clearly Kurt Russell is the better actor, but they compliment each other well. If you're looking for a good time with a good plot and a mystery to keep you guessing at a fair rate, you can't go wrong with Tango & Cash.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game great grapics lots of fun. I'm a horse owner and the horses look real!! great for young &amp; old!
B003LSTK8G|4.0|This book did a great job a painting a very dumb down version of the financial crisis.  Trying to wrap your head cdos around and cds is not an easy task
1451627297|5.0|So, I had thought about purchasing 11/22/63 when it had first been released, but was reluctant due to past experience with Stephen King novels and just the fact that I didn't want to spend so much on the book. Time past and I never really thought about it. Just last week, I found it (at a much lower price) through my Nook and decided to give it a shot. For all good books, I always believe that there must come some sort of review. For all bad ones, you really don't need to write much, just say it was horrible. I can tell you, this book was not at all bad, nor was it a waste of time. It was, in fact, the best Stephen King novel I have ever read, and that is years and years of reading most of his material. I have gone through the Dark Tower series, his first books which were all about horror and even some of the newer stuff (Bag of Bones). But nothing has captivated me so much as 11/22/63. So first, we must realize that this book is a love story. Yes, it is about a man who is shown a portal by a good friend, Al, which takes him back to 1958 and can 'reset' itself every time you come back and go back through the portal. The 'resetting' part if very important. But what really makes this book shine is the relationship between the lead character, Jake Epping (or George Amberson for the back in time piece) and Sadie Dunhill (Miz Dunhill). The relationship seems to build up as the book comes along and you can't feel nothing but love and support for these 2. They aren't flashy, they aren't great looking (as based on what King has described) and they aren't the hottest couple around, but what they are is truly wonderful. They are humble and they really do find that simple love between each other. Now, I don't want to go too much into this book, mostly because there are many spoilers that can come out very easily, but give it a shot. The ending will captivate you and leave you wanting more. I actually just finished reading it last night and went to sleep, almost sobbing becauseof it. Jake Epping is said to 'not be a man who cries', but after finishing the book, I wanted to.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Hugh Laurie loves music and seems to have a natural way with instruments and the beat--rhythm is his!!  Some songs are standards, and great, especially with the back-up band. He must have had the top of the line guys in New Orleans!  Still his own sort of scraggly voice fit the genre just fine!  Great tunes!
B005TZFZJC|4.0|great album of rihanna. i love this record in your entirety...<br />i like her music. .. ....... .... ....... .
B001H1SW4M|1.0|This movie had very little plot and definitely was not scary. It was so cheesy, there wasn't even any good laughs. The acting was really, really bad. Skip it.
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|great music a  fun  movie to watch. the soundtrack is  very good and  fun to  listen too. a  good 1950 selection  of  music  i  like
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This book is so real it breaks your heart. It's not your typical love story. I gave this book 2 stars not because it's not good but because some parts of this book were a little too real and sad. My heart breaks for sky and holder!!!!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|It was a well written although fanciful story.  As soon as it got to glowing orbs in Heaven I was lost.  I read no description that was even remotely consistent with the Bible.
B0041D843M|5.0|Everyone who cares about their health and the health of their loved ones needs to read this. The Campbell's have laid it all on the line. The choice is ours.
1601251556|3.0|Just okay. It's made of thick laminated paper folded into quarters. The creases create some problems because it doesn't want to stay flat. If you can deal with the creases I think it would work well for you.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing it is inspirational I love how this book took me on a emotional roller coaster I so recommend this book to all my friends
0786955716|3.0|A decent city set, but it feels like it's missing something. I think they should have added a little bit more indoor tiles and houses.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Overall, I find this season's script not quite as smart or complex as the first five-star season, although the level of actors they've cast are equally astonishing, with some returning from Season One. But Jessica Lange (!!!) is genius whenever, wherever. She's mesmerizing, yet also knows when to cede to other actors. Her scenes with the superbly talented James Cromwell make watching a compulsion.  Evan Peters and Zachary Quinto (from Season 1) are again terrific.  Lily Rabe is delightfully kooky, moving from possessed by Mother Mary to possessed by Satan.  Joseph Fiennes unfortunately has a small part. Regardless:  Jessica Lange, Jessica Lange, Jessica Lange!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Who doesn't like this classic tale by Miyazaki? For those who don't know, this is an animated film that begs to be watched and shared with children and adults alike.
B00000DHTF|3.0|I bought this used at a good price as I wanted to complete my collection of Springsteen songs. Many songs are great and while others are rough drafts that were not ready for release.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I usually LOVE Grisham. This one was OK, but not as great as his earlier books. A Time to Kill is still my favorite of his books.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Darkness on the Edge of Town was the first Sprinsteen album that I purchased and it is great to have new songs from this period, now 35 years later.
B00633W614|5.0|This had me wanting to read the sequel. Beware the story leaves you hanging and needing to know what happens next. I can't wait for the second book in this series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great easy read. Nice surprising twist at the end.<br />If you are a John Gresham reader this one is one of the best
B004LZFWJO|4.0|This game is very easy and a good game to play while unwinding from work.  I play it while sitting in waiting rooms or watching TV.  I find it addictive in a passive sort of way like watching fish in an aquarium.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is simple enough even my 4 year old loves to plat it and there is enough things to do you don't get bored.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a selection for my monthly woman's book club. I had never heard of this book and maybe would have never read it. I am so pleased that I did. This is a true story that needs be be learned by all.

0765325950|1.0|Between the enormity of the plot holes, forced nature of the entire  novel, the redundant battle scenes and the cheap ending it is huge disappointment. It is extraodrinarily frustrating to have devoted so much time to having read 15 novels (some of them multiple times), to come away with such a bad taste in my mouth. I haven't done a re-read since before Towers of Midnight and I now certainly have no desire to.
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|I loved everything about this movie. The technical stuff was absolutely brilliant, but the story was so good, you kind of forgot about it. Which is the way it should be.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Mostly watched it for Ramin Karimloo but found it so much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. Watched it three times now!
B007KOLNXC|5.0|The only problem with watching this to the end is I can't see what happens next... yet.<br />Oh, well. Guess I will start with Season 1 again.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|After playing for a while now, I urge newcomers: DO NOT play this game. I love My Little Pony, and this game is just as pretty and adorable as the show. Which makes sense since they worked with MLP creators and voices. But what seems like a fun, harmless game at first quickly becomes a frustrating waste of time. If you like to beat games you play, be prepared to shell out hundreds....yes Hundreds of dollars to beat this. Unless you're prepared to play every day for 2-3 years to get enough supplies to win. And even then there's no guarantee, since the game is faulty and gems, coins and more will vanish. I've lost over 35 gems that I'm aware of, since I didn't even know this could happen early on. There's no way to get them back either, as game support is aware of the problem and are 'working on it.' Doubtful when it's fixed they'll actually compensate everyone if they aren't now. The game cannot be won without connecting  to other players, another broken part of the game making it more frustrating when it won't connect. Plus, the game punishes you if you don't log in everyday. Greedy game builders who speed to distribution a game that is broken and urge you to spend ridiculous amounts of $ without reasonable alternatives to beat it...they should be ashamed! I have told others not to touch this and urge parent with kids to avoid it. Otherwise your child may accidentally buy tons of stuff, or even worse, you'll have to explain to them that the game can't be beaten. Way to play fair Gameloft, I'll never touch anything of yours again...and the My Little Pony heads should be more cautious when making deals on merchandise contracts. I'd rather pay for an MLP video game. It might cost $50, but it's worth it if everything is included.
B009XY97VC|5.0|I love these albums from &#34;Two Steps From Hell&#34;. Fun to listen to, great for working out - get the blood pumping. You can be the hero of your own life.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. My daughter in law said its a must read and My daughter and I did.<br />I cant even explain how great this book was from beginning to end. Just loved it .<br />The author had a vision with this and it was better than I could imagine. I hate when u figure out the plot and everything before your half way thru. But Colleen took you beyond anything you could imagine. It a MUST read. She did a wonderful job cant wait to read more of her Books.<br />LOVED THIS BOOK I would have gave it more than 5 stars if I could have!!
B009WJ44KC|5.0|I have grown tired of Williams for his &#34;big picture&#34; sound. Great tunes, but there is a certain sameness to it. On his smaller films, like this one and &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; we have a much more interesting and complex sonic world, far more worthy of exploration.
B003B02O0A|3.0|I would have given it four stars had it not been for an exagerated preoccupation with drinking. This slowed down the rythm by spending page upon page on drinking and hangovers that added nothing to the essence of the story.
B003DEIZBQ|5.0|These recordings prove that Beethoven was a rock star. They are fast, intense, have a great beat and incredible energy. This is NOT what you are used to, but it is an important perspective on his works. After listening to these about four or five times, I am having trouble listening to any others - they seem depressingly slow and lifeless. You are warned.
0679805273|5.0|Great graduation gift. Will have teachers sign in it between now and my kids graduations!  (idea stolen from pinterest!)  :-)
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|my bf was addicted now I am. he might steal this from me. I sway totally get this. so worth it.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Bizarre movie, but it was requested for Christmas and went over big!  Definitely a unique film.  True to Tim Burton's style!
B00913DPW2|4.0|Interesting game!  Though I haven't completed it yet, the graphics are good and so far I have enjoyed spending time playing.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Beautifully written, it is the first part of a historical novel about the century many of us were born into, and as such it is really moving.<br />  The old order shattered. Why? All the intertwined stories give us a powerful insight into the reasons that explain the First World War, and laid the foundations for its continuation, the Second World War. I can't wait to lay my hands on Book Two of the Century Trilogy.
B009GJCFL8|4.0|This is a really good concert for the band. I really liked the mix which didn't seem to favor the keys over the guitar. They were well balanced.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Actually I  would rate it 4.5: It gave both his and her perspective. Very interesting out look appears honest and forthright.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Does everything you need it to do.  Great sound quality and easy data transfer.  Very easy to use and handle.
B005LAII12|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a great price and the description on it was exact and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00867GHS8|5.0|If you buy any 3D movies this should be on your short list.  Not only is the movie entertaining the 3D is awesome.  The 3D adds amazing depth to this movie.  The backgrounds almost pull your attention from the man action to just watching the elements of the undersea environment.  The normal blu-ray print looks very good as well.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this app. My friends can't get enough of the action in this game. I highly recommend this game to people looking for fun on a stormy day.
B00ABXA1HI|3.0|Hey, just the fact that I can see my desktop or work computer in HD clarity on my Kindle is enough for 3 stars.  However, using Splashtop to operate the remote desktop is awkward at best.  I had to print out the Help file's list of special &#34;gestures&#34; needed to do routine tasks -- dragging, clicking, scrolling, and everything else is just a drag.  And forget about trying to use the keyboard.<br /><br />I'll keep it installed for emergencies only, but will probably use Mozy for accessing needed files instead.
B0063GORYU|5.0|spider just occupies me for hours.  helps keep your brain active.  good for you at any age.  Love you,mean it:)<br />Amazon is the ONLY place to get what you want at the best price.  Love my kindle too!  Thanks Amazon!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use the Holy BIBLE every day, not only for my bible studies, I also love the Daily Devotions.  It's user friendly, and for me that's a huge plus.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down once I started<br />Loved the voice & relatability, well, up to a point.<br />I definitely recommend
B008A0LSZ8|5.0|I enjoyed this story so much! I am a Stephen King fan and this is now my favorite book. The story hooks you from the beginning and the is &#34;on the edge of your seat&#34; until the end. Stephen has taken a piece of American history and gives us a whole new perspective on the assassination of JFK. And the plot thickens.....
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|My daughter and I found this game boring and did not like it at all.  We both tried it for a couple of hours.
0812415027|5.0|My daughter loved animals and after she read this she was sure she wanted to be a vet.  So that is what she went to college for.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Turns your Kindle into a calculator. Many phones and tablets already come with a calculator app, so this one is a must have for any Kindle owner. And with tax time right around the corner you're gonna need this.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I play this CD in the car all the  time.  My favorite song  is Moves Like Jagger but they are all good.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Good entertainment. Great music.  If you enjoy watching Glee this movie will appeal to you.  Although the life of college a capella performance groups as seen in this movie embraces every possible stereotype it is still funny and sweet and the use of &#34;mashups&#34; in the grand finale are excellent.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The app is awsome. Very fun and challenging just the right amount. Many cool jet packs. YOU SHOULD WANT THIS APP!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is amazing ! Scary and suspenseful and I am always surprised at what's next. Highly recommend can't wait for more episodes
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It was great!! I can't wait for the second book to come out!! I could not put it down!! Buy it
B0000019PA|4.0|The reincarnation of Robert Wyatt, an English musician, and founding member of Soft Machine (1966-1984) a psychedelic-Jazz fusion band and to some extent Green Day. Very imaginative and colorful with interesting twists and shouts in the mix. Very happy to have discovered them even at this late stage in the mix. Now lets see what Jeff Mangum has to offer... Enjoy...
B000SEP2T2|5.0|In a short book the principles of modern mathematics are explained in a clear way. Very inspiring and very stimulating.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing!!!!  I could play it alllllllllll day!! I love my horse and I love horses so this game is perfect for me. It is a little slow but still addicting and fun!!!!
1452101248|5.0|I bought this cookbook after receiving Jerusalem as a gift and loving the recipes and flavors I encountered. My husband and I have been trying to expand our vegetarian repertoire (we are omnivores, but love veggies).  The recipes have almost consistently been great. I do find that it's sometimes a bit more time and effort than I want to spend on a busy weeknight,  but we love the results. Our favorites so far: warm glass noodles and edamame, mushroom ragout with poached duck egg (we used a chicken egg), and the spiced red lentils with cucumber yogurt (we substituted labne for the greek yogurt). Our only disappointment was the mee goreng, which we found to be lackluster and bland. Happy cooking!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|It was a wonderful read and I highly recommend it. I love how Amazon makes the classics free of charge.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is fun and so addicting I have another arcade game but this is better than the other one
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I personally loved this movie,  the story line and visuals were very much enjoyable.  I was enthralled through the whole movie. My son's eyes were wide ipen and he had a smile through the movie. I would watch this movie again and still enjoy it as much as the first time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun you should buy very good graphics for a free game get it! you'll love it if you like horses! please buy it!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|My 11yrs old son and I enjoyed this movie,  we watch movies often. It was visually enjoyable and the story line was fun as well.

B0019IB0II|5.0|What happened to Jill Taylor is a terrible thing, but what she brought back and shared, that is invaluable. Hope she writes more on this topic.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|It was fun for the first few levels. But once you get stuck, you can't really figure out what to do since there are no instructions at all on controlling the game. So I would suggest to add a screen with instructions on how to do more advanced controls, or be more informative with the animated examples which I didn't find intuitive at all. I'm glad I didn't pay for this. It needs more work before it's professional enough to be a paid app. Thanks for the sample!

0307279189|3.0|Allow me a moment, to start off by saying this. I think the story of the Tarahumara and their lifestyle is incredible. I think the idea of a race between the greatest ultrarunner ever known and the people who run sixty miles for fun is awesome. My only wish is that I could pick up this whole story and dump it into the lap of a good writer.<br /><br />The man who tackled this, Christopher McDougall should stick to writing newspaper articles. This book is choppy, obvious as hell and reads like it was written for a teenager. I do not believe he does the Tarahumara justice. I'm at a bit of a crossroads. I'm two thirds of the way through and I really want to finish the book to see how it ends. However, whenever I start reading it I get indigestion at how tacky the writing is and have to put it down.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll grind my way through this book but I am quite confident that I will pass it on to the first unwitting person I can find. As for my future, it holds Saul Bellow and a writing style so eloquent that I want to buy his work and pass it out to the literate world at large.
B002BWP49M|5.0|This was my favorite episode yet!  It really highlighted the evolution of each player's character!  Can't wait for the next episode!

Still, looking forward to the next volume.

0765325950|5.0|An end that wraps up 23 years of work, 11,916 paperback pages, 684 chapters, 420 audio book hours, or four million fifty six thousand words, has to be epic. And it was, drawing in ancient prophecies dating back from the beginning, and completing arcs carried through from book one, all the while having enormous battles and fights take place as the last battle. It was the last of the greatest story of all time. The only bad part, is I am sad to see it go.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|The movie was exactly as described and was shipped and received quickly.  This was my daughter's favorite movie when she was little!  :)

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is a great app. I love it. I play it all the time when I'm board. People think it is boring. I do not think so at all! It is my favorite app on my kindle fire. (and I have a ton of apps that I like.) I would totally reccomend this app to everyone!!  :)
1439127700|3.0|This was purchaed as a gift.  The book came on time which was great, however, I was disappointed with the quality of the paper that was used in the printing.  The paper was very rough and ragged on the exposed edges and was not the high gloss you would expect a bound book from Simon Shuster to be.  It is something I might expect from some cheap reproduction or a book made as a &#34;knock-off&#34;.<br /><br />I have tried to locate the look at retail stores to see just what it looks like there but have not been to very many stores and have not found it as yet.  I thought that I had already sent this informtion to you before, but again, no one has responded to my concern yet.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I loved the characters but I felt like their characters individually and together did not grow at all!! It was a very redundant story that just would not end and I was tired of their relationship by the middle of the book
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This show is riveting! Good premise, sympathetic characters, and well written. Check your pulse if you do not find yourself hooked.
B0094OLFUW|4.0|This album is pretty good. the only thing i didn't like about it was that it was shorter than i expected. The songs flowed nicely together. i think this album was arranged very well.
B002KEDQJQ|4.0|This is probably one of my favorite superhero films. It was faithfully adapted from a great graphic novel, and the visual effects are top-notch. Well-written characters, fleshed out by great actors. Smart, entertaining, and enjoyable.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I've just started to play this game and not sure how to do it yet.  I think I will like to do it more and hopefully I will play it often.
B004FEFS5E|4.0|Starts very strong with excellent examples.  If this level of detail had been maintained throughout the book this would be a solid 5 start rating.  As written, it is excellent for anyone who wants to know about exposure and light.<br /><br />If you are a beginning to intermediate level photographer, and want your photographs to look like art instead of snapshots, this book should be one of the very first in your collection.  The writing style is simple and straight forward.  There are a few exercises which demonstrate the principles, and there are plenty of pictures to show how the principle was applied.<br /><br />One thing the author could have done which would really improve the book is to identify in each picture 1. where he took his meter reading from, and 2. what his focus point(s) were.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more books from this author.<br /><br />One additional point not specific to this particular book.<br />I bought this as an e-book for reading on my Samsung Galaxy 10.2 tablet.  I wasn't sure how I would like this type of book as an e-book.  Long story short... it's great.  Eventually you will be able to zoom into the pictures which will make it even better.
1932735410|5.0|I am getting ready to take my exam on 4/30 and am using this book as a supplament to the boot camp I attended.  Love the fact that there are a lot of excersises and tips to take the test
B0029XFNA8|3.0|I had to return this disc because the description was in error.  I wanted the original b/w version, which it said it was.  But the movie is actually colorized.  It's fine if you want a colorized version.  Of course the movie itself is a classic.  Be aware this blu-ray version does NOT have any of the special features found on the DVD version.  Many of the reviews are for the DVD version.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I have to watch this every Christmas! It is so funny, and wonderful for the family to watch together. Will Ferrell is amazing!
B004FP1WX0|4.0|A strange story that was fascinating to watch. You may think &#34;I'm surprised this doesn't happen to more people&#34; and it does--see the MTV series by the same name for more.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I think I had high expectations when I ordered it. I had intentionally not discussed the books with those who had read it so that I could find surprises. But I think it was far too much for me to handle. Its like a soft porn story.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a fun mystery mixing cutting edge technology, programmers, & contemporary Internet workings with old school publishing, printing, Throw in the secret of immortality & some dungeons & dragon nuances & some quirky endearing characters & you get an engaging mystery that made me laugh out loud & fist pump the air as the main character decodes a long encrypted mystery. Great novel for techies!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The symbols are very similar, but I haven't played mahjong in quite a while, so I am sure that is standard. The music is soothing and helps take away from the stress of finding matching pieces. Nice that you can pause a game and come back later if something comes up.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|very intriguing movie.script keeps you guessing whats going to happen next.action packed highly recomended as usual for denzel caliber and character
B009VB97EY|1.0|The movie was not what I expected. I wish I didn't rent this movie. It wasn't entertaining and it showed a bad side of America. O
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I've watched this several times from a friend's copy and now have my own.  This is a wonderful and sweet movie,  love the Brits and Bollywood actors, and the scenery in Jaipur is fabulous.  The setting in the old buildings is wonderful too. The reunion of one of the actors with an old lover is very moving.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This miniseries...oh, man this miniseries. Brilliant, simply brilliant. Many, many years ago I fell in love with 1996's version of Jane Eyre and thought I would never find a period film that I loved as much. I was wrong. Dead wrong.<br /><br />I'd been putting off watching North & South for a long time but yesterday afternoon I gave in and was glued to my television from the very beginning to the very end.<br /><br />Margaret Hale is a beautiful, head strong, opinionated woman who's family has just been uprooted from the green lushness of the south by her father who's decided to leave the clergy. He takes Margaret and her mother north to a place that could not be more different than Margaret's beloved Helstone. The northern industrial town of Milton is dirty, busy, smoke-filled, rough and the air is constantly full of cotton fluff that comes from the cotton mills. To say that Margaret doesn't like Milton would be a bit of an understatement, and when she meets mill owner John Thornton her opinion of Milton only goes downhill.<br /><br />Okay, let's talk about setting. The setting was almost visceral. Milton made me feel cold, wet and grimy while Helstone left me feeling like I wanted to lay down in some grass and nap in the sun all afternoon. The people of Milton are overworked and hungry. I felt like I was walking the streets of Milton with Margaret. I was thrown back in time and it was all so authentic the way a period film should be.<br /><br />Characters. Richard Armitage who plays the mill owner John Thornton was the standout in this film. His brooding, strong and fair but tortured hero was a performance that everyone should see. The other characters were played excellently as well but Richard Armitage was simply divine.<br /><br />Daniela Denby Ashe as Margaret Hale did stubborn but sympathetic so well. She may be my favorite female character that I've seen in every movie I've yet to see. She had beliefs and compassion. I admired that.<br /><br />The love story. The train scene had me swooning and you'll know what I mean if you've watched the movie. I was rooting for Margaret and John to find their way to each other. I loved, loved, loved John and Margaret and I believed in their passion and love for each other.<br /><br />One thing that I adore about period films is that the little things in the movie mean so much. The fleeting brush of fingers, the secret looks, the way a wealth of feeling can be expressed with one whispered word. North & South does that beautifully. Beautifully.<br /><br />There is so much more that I want to say about this film but I would hate to ruin it for anyone else. So, the only other thing I will say that you should watch it. Forget any doubts you may have and watch it because it is an experience you won't soon forget.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|If I remember this book right I found some of it funny and a easy read.I really enjoy reading you can not put it down.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Six boring stories loosely connected by a flimsy thread does not a good book make. I think the people that like this book, do so trying to be fashionable and to appear to be \\"in the know.\\" Its not that I don't understand the book, and thus, don't like it, I do. I do understand it. It's just not very good. While some of the writing is interesting a great many of the characters are unlikable and boring.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I bought this movie for my mother-in-law to show to all the children and grandchildren. The men in our lives need to watch this movie and to step up and be &#34;REAL&#34; men!

B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game the graphics are sweet. I like the fact you get to earn credit points. I can't wait to play more
B001HC8516|5.0|This is definitely one of the best self-help relationship books I've read. I know for some women reading this book it would be easy to disagree with most of the advice the author gives but most women out there are in relationships like the ones described in the book and I think this book could show as a much needed reality check for most women. I would recommend this book any girl, single or not, because most of us have friends or ourselves been in relationships like the ones in the book. The book is well written by both authors and I truly enjoyed every minute of it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game is so awesome I got all my friends playing angry birds all the time however who hasn't been put in the anger zone lol

B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was great .The graphics were awesome well worth to buy the full game . Well recommended to everyone that likes mystery games.
B0059XTU22|2.0|I write this review with some sorrow.  The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) movie trilogy ranks among my all-time favorite movies and I had been eagerly awaiting the premier of The Hobbit ever since I heard that Peter Jackson (the director of the LOTR trilogy) would be directing The Hobbit.  What a let down!  It seems as if Peter Jackson is trying to force LOTR fans to buy 3 tickets instead of 1 or 2, and did this through unnecessary inflation of what should not have been a lengthy epic movie.<br /><br />Before I begin bashing the movie, I have to admit that it is not trivial to turn The Hobbit book into a movie.  The book \\"The Hobbit\\" appeared 17 years before the LOTR trilogy, and \\"The Hobbit\\" is not consistent with the LOTR trilogy in either content or tone.  This makes it impossible to be faithful to \\"The Hobbit\\" while maintaining some consistency with the LOTR.  For example:<br /><br />* In the written Hobbit, the One Ring is just a magic ring that makes someone invisible.  There was no indication of anything sinister about it until \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\"<br /><br />* In the written Hobbit, Elrond was an elf, and a friend of Gandalf.  He let Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves stay at his house shortly after they escaped from the trolls.  There was no indication that he was king of Rivendell and a \\"really serious person\\" until \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\"<br /><br />* The tone of the written Hobbit is that of a fairy tale, whereas the LOTR is a serious set of books about a world in deadly peril.  Similarly, the Gandalf of \\"The Hobbit\\" is a silly, comical wizard, unlike the dignified, serious, and philosophical Gandalf of the LOTR.<br /><br />Based on \\"An Unexpected Journey,\\" it appears that Peter Jackson is trying to manipulate the facts of \\"The Hobbit\\" to make them consistent with the LOTR trilogy, while moving the tone of \\"The Hobbit\\" about halfway from that of the book and that of the LOTR trilogy.  This is not an easy feat.<br /><br />Attempts to quantify the bloat.  I own the extra-long DVD version of the LOTR trilogy and I just love it.  It is 11.3 hours long, and it omitted a major sub-plot from the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring book (the journey through the haunted forest on the way to Bree, and the encounter with Tom Bombadil) and a major sub-plot from the second half of The Return of the King book (Saruman in the Shire).  Including the second omission would have required changes to the beginning of The Return of the King movie, to let Saruman live.  Had these two sub-plots been included in the extra-long DVD movie trilogy, the resulting length would probably have been about 12.5 hours.<br /><br />Now, let us start with the written source material.  The Hobbit book is between 25% and 30% as long as the LOTR book trilogy.  Multiplying 0.3 x 12.5 hours gives us 3.75 hours as the length for a Hobbit movie that covers all of the source material with the same thoroughness as the notional double extra-long LOTR DVD.  The Hobbit book does leave some gaps that could reasonably be filled in.  For example, Gandalf leaves Bilbo and the dwarves slightly over a third of the way through the book, with virtually no explanation.  He returns at the very end of the book, and indicates that he had an adventure of his own, which he describes in less than a page.  It might be reasonable to explain Gandalf's departure and cover his adventure, instead of focusing purely on Bilbo.  Doing these things could increase the maximum length of a non-bloated movie to about five hours - two movies of 2.5 hours each.  Unfortunately, the first of three Hobbit movies is almost three hours long, thus implying a total length of nearly 9 hours.<br /><br />Another reasonable comparison would be with the Harry Potter books and movies.  Each of the seven Harry Potter books is longer than The Hobbit, but each of the first six books equated to one movie of less than 3 hours in length.  The final Harry Potter book translated into two movies with a combined length of about 4.5 hours.<br /><br />Description of the bloat.  The movie contains lots of bloated scenes plus unnecessary scenes.  I could go on at great length, but discussing the first hour captures most of the problems.  The movie begins with a brief scene of an elderly Bilbo describing his great adventure to an unseen Frodo.  This is OK and provides continuity with the LOTR movie trilogy.  The movie then shifts to a roughly ten-minute depiction of a dragon taking over the mountain home of the dwarves.  This scene is completely unnecessary and corresponds to a fraction of a page in the book, when the dwarves told Bilbo that a dragon had evicted them from their home.  The movie then shifts back to a scene with Bilbo and Frodo talking the day before Bilbo's birthday party at the beginning of the LOTR.  This scene could have been combined with the opening scene, and shortened.  The movie then shows the arrival of Gandalf and the dwarves at Bilbo's home.  The movie turns a few pages in the book into a plodding 30+ minutes of meaningless blather.  This whole scene could have been done well in 15 minutes.  This pattern repeats itself throughout the movie.  In particular, every action sequence in the book gets drawn out interminably in the movie, with the number of implausible escapes multiplied by a factor of five or more.  Moreover, the movie adds two unnecessary and extraneous sub-plots not present in the book:  the entire interlude with the wizard Radagast, and the battle with the orcs just before Bilbo et al reach Rivendell.  Ugh!<br /><br />It may still be possible to rescue the second and third movies.  Jackson needs to do whatever it takes to get movies two and three down to less than two hours each.  Most of this can probably be done by tighter editing of things already filmed.  In some cases, however, it may be impossible to get a bloated ten-minute scene down to a crisp five-minute scene by better editing of material already filmed.  In these cases, it would be necessary to re-shoot some scenes, assuming that the relevant actors are still available.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoy the game. It is easy to navigate screens and plan shots . I just wish I was better. Perhaps with time .
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We loved Season 2. It was a huge improvement over the uncomfortable, &#34;questionable&#34; scenes in some of Season 1. I think this is a great series & I hope they don't ruin the future episodes it by interjecting more &#34;adult&#34; themes into their script. It's great the way it is....let's hope it stays that way!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Quick read. Lots of action and suspense.<br />I can not wait to read the third book in the trilogy  of the Hunger Games.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|A bit confusing in the beginning. I never would have been able to predict the ending. I would recommend interested in history to read this book.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Lots of plot twists to keep the reader interested. My only peeve, and it's a small one, is that Holder seems unusually adept at love-making for a high school kid. Other than that, two thumbs up.

B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I don't because you only have a litter bit of time to play.<br />and not the same as real minecraft
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Wonderfully written book about the simple pleasures that can sometimes be overlooked, and how one golden old man discovers them and more on a spiritual walk across Britain. I enjoyed the characters- they were honest. Some I wanted to punch. Others I loved. All of them add flair to book filled with moments of imagery that are not to be missed. Emotions and connections run high throughout. The ending was satisfying... No- more than that. The ending was true. It may seem simple- if so, read the last pages again- they'll change you. Perhaps even more than the rest of this beautiful book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game. love that it keeps working when you're away. provides lots of fun and my kids love this game.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is what I consider an outstanding movie. Not just brilliant acting, but educational, entertaining, historically interesting, superb direction, perfect pacing. You will leave the theater feeling a special energy.  It will make you believe that people do know right from wrong...even if it takes them their whole live to figure it out. I was beyond moved by this movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great app to pass the time with. When your unable to do anything else at the time.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I stand speechless, in a good way. Perhaps after I read this book again I'll have more to say about it.

B006MW3VGA|5.0|Great character development continued...the characters you hated in the first season, you loathed even more in the second and those you loved in the first season became even more endearing in the 2nd.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've been avoiding spoilers for months, eagerly awaiting the return of Downton to the US while knowing that our British comrades get to return to the Abbey weeks in advance! I'm so glad Amazon is carrying the unedited British version of the show so we can enjoy it as intended.<br /><br />As the season is only a few episodes in, it's hard to rate it as a whole. The first few episodes have introduced a large quantity of drama, and Shirley Maclaine is a welcome and warm addition to the cast. Can't wait to see what happens!
B00AYL7OAY|5.0|This is such a solid Yo La Tengo album.  From start to finish it's just great song after great song.
034580404X|3.0|These books really got on my nerves after awhile, the repeated sex scenes were in itself boring and the description of their remarks throughout these books were actually comical. If it was said once it was said hundreds of times, \\"OH MY!\\" \\"WHAT?\\" \\"ALL I COULD SMELL WAS CHRISTIAN'S BODY WASH!!!\\"  Come on, give it a rest!!!  Oh and this one, \\"I PURSED MY LIPS!\\" Over and over again!  The storyline for all 3 books could have and should have been condensed in 1 book!  Very disappointing to say the least!
B00594XOZU|5.0|i have some friends who dont have phones so this isna great way to keep in touch with them if he have ipods and i love how it tells me if my message was read yet so i know whats going on i would definily reccomend this app @.@
B0061S073A|1.0|I have a kindle fire that I allow my 10 year old to use (I have a screen lock on it so he can't jump on it whenever he wants).  I was thinking of getting him a KIndle for his birthday, but I wanted to control how he uses it.  I downloaded Kid's Place and it has one big Gaping hole in it as far as I can see.  You can't add allowable books to the screen.  You can only add apps.<br /><br />Another question is can I remove 1 click purchased for only his Kindle if I buy him one?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What a wonderful product! This puts the Bible at my fingertips, anytime, on my mobile phone. I can even have it read aloud to me!  YouVersion lets me have a Bible Verse sent each day and many other inspirationl features. No excuses, I can always be inspired.
B009KHCT94|4.0|I found out what my problem was when I switched browsers. This movie is acutally a real hoot! Decent plot line, acting and special effects. If you enjoy strangely inspired Science fiction, this film is for you.
B005XLN97M|3.0|I bought this Barbie Beach House for my daughter as a Christmas gift. It looks great and is attractive, but it's not as attractive as some others such as the Barbie Glam Vacation House. There's not much any furniture or dishes in it, just spacey. The design of the house is very nice though. My daughter explained, it is like that so the barbie dolls would fit in it, which in the other house (Glam Vacation) they don't. Well I guess that makes sense, still for me it just isn't fun. Not much room for imagination. The product is durable, could be priced a little less since it's basically a tall shell of a home. I like Barbie houses but this one I would not buy as a gift for anyone. Would I recommend this gift, yes if you like this style home. It just doesn't suit my taste, a little boring.
B001NLYXOE|3.0|I rented this off Amazon Instant and thought it was ok but as a Shakespeare film enthusiast I'm still on the fence whether I would want it for my dvd collection.<br /><br />[The Bad]  So many of the soliloquies are in the form of inner monologue, and it's noticeably abridged to the point that all other characters feel very minor; a little reminiscent of Olivier's Hamlet In that there are no notable performances outside of the two main (i.e. Lord & Lady Macbeth).  The nudity serves no purpose other than to emphasize how Hollywood producers were still giddy as schoolboys after the abandoning of the production code in 1968 and, with that in mind, Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking episode was pretty gratuitous and the witches' coven in Act IV, scene I was seriously gross.  The violence and gore are actually a little cheesy but I suppose pretty tame by today's standards (I did like the final fight scene though).<br /><br />[The Good]  Although I had never considered it before, Lord and Lady Macbeth seem to have an almost adversarial relationship in this interpretation and I also appreciate how the diametric shift in their two roles (like the sun and moon never fated for harmony) played out.  I LUV the porter as well as the physical manifestation of a \\"dagger of the mind\\" and this version has by far the most attractive Lady Macbeth and therefore more convincing as seducing rather than nagging her husband towards ambition without conscience. Visually attractive production overall reminding  me stylistically of Zeffirelli, and furthermore made me wonder if maybe it was influential in John Boorman's fantasy classic Excalibur.<br /><br />If you're looking for sublime performances definitely watch [[ASIN:B0002TVWYW Macbeth / McKellen, Dench (Thames Shakespeare Collection)]], if you prefer non-traditional or very dark then try [[ASIN:B00443FMKM Great Performances: Macbeth]] but if you want to see the play in something close to its intended historical context then definitely check out this version.this version.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Simply love Pinterest and everything about it. Impossible to improve! So easy to use, categorize, view and search for anything and everything!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|This alarm clock does what it suppose to.  I would like it more if it did a little more.  For example, it would be great If it could offer a random play feature of music lists.  Also if it would be better if it offered a soft to loud wake-up feature.  Finally, the sleep timer should allow the app to return to the clock face.  But I got this for the alarm and it does a good job at that.
B009DA74ES|5.0|Well, they pulled it off again.  Don't buy the naysayers' reviews if you like the show cause it's as funny as it ever was.  And wow, the soundtrack.. it was good all over, but never heard Zepp or the Beatles put to such good use as in that last episode!  This show is pretty heady stuff.. and no pun intended.  ;)  If I had any comlaints it would be that I really could do without lewd scenes, etc., taking place in churches, etc. It does rather rub the fur the wrong way.  Come on guys, Jesus is just alright with me.  If it was good enough for the Doobies and Dylan, surely the writers could have our hero could show just a LITTLE respect in this regard?  Or leave the topic off the menu?  I guess it's all just part of Hank's Rolling Stoner Sympathy for the Devil schtick.. Hmmm..  Does God hate us all?
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It does what I got it for.  If it does more, that would be just icing on the cake.  I will never find out about it because in its basic operation, it does what I got it for.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to read the third!<br />I never thought I would read these books. Glad I did
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Tale of a dog that gets dognapped and taken from the comfortable confines of the Santa Clara region to a much less friendly Alaska.How will it survive?  By size and instinct.  Really this is a good read, but I think the themes in it are better explored in his other book, &#34;the Sea Wolf&#34;.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. The hidden objects and puzzles were easy enough to figure out but I occasionally had to use the hint button to move on. The graphics are fantastic and much better than some of the other hidden adventure games.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|that it actually is, honestly it is challenging to use, and works 1 out of every 5 bottles, and normally is not a straight cut, its also fairly dangerous in my opinion, buy at your own risk!
0767836286|5.0|This is a movie filled with great performances and lots of actions and suspense.  The plot is a good one...actors all deliver their lines like pros.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|The only problem I have with this app is that it is best to have a GPS installed in your Kindle to keep an accurate location on the star map.  The maps presented are very good and make night viewing enjoyable.
B009IJJ712|5.0|This show is fantastic! It has the thrill of Monk, House and Fringe, fantastic characters and awesome actors. The character set up is very similar to House, but the main character is not as much of a miserable jerk.
B00AB55BS0|3.0|While I absolutely LOVE the show itself, the way this is packaged leaves a LOT to be desired. It seems HBO now does the combo packs in such a way that it's nearly impossible to get a completely pristine DVD. The blu-ray discs are fine, but the DVDs are basically shoved into a cardboard envelope that makes them entirely too easy to be scratched. I went through two of these, and still haven't gotten one with scratch-free DVDs yet. Amazon has been doing their best to help, but HBO really needs to do this better. My wife bought season 1 of &#34;Girls&#34; and had the exact same issue.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book. Finished it within a few days of reading it. Honestly,it was a little disturbing but reguadless, i enjoyed reading it. I could not put the book down without wondering what happened next. I loved how everything tied together from beginning to end. I'm about to purchase a real copy of this book to add to my bookshelf.
B009EV7GF8|5.0|I like almost every song on this CD!!! I bought the Deluxe clean version of the CD.<br />I recommend getting the deluxe CD, I like the four extra bonus tracks on it, especially Gold Trans Am.<br />Kesha worked with some awesome artists on this, including one of my favorites Dr. Luke, and even Iggy Pop...all the hard work that went into this CD shows. I loved her first CD, but like this one even better!<br />It has a dance sound to it, wakes me up when driving to work in the morning and puts you in that happy, feel good mood. If you have a good stereo system or GOOD bass on your head phones you'll feel like you've died and gone to heaven on most songs. xD<br />Below is my rating from 1-5 on how much I like each song.<br />1. Warrior 3/5. Not one of my favorites on the CD, but still a ok song.<br />2. Die Young 4/5. Awesome song.<br />3. C'Mon 5/5 This actually had to grow on me at first, but now I LOVE it!<br />4. Thinking of You 2/5 This one is just ok to me.<br />5. Crazy Kids 5/5 One that I ALWAYS hit replay on. One of my favorites on the CD. Awesome beat, trippy, fun dance song.<br />6. Whereever You Are 1/5 Maybe this will grow on me later, right now I usually skip it.<br />7. Dirty Love 5/5 LOVE it! Has an awesome rock sound! Always hit replay on this one.<br />8. Wonderland 5/5 Beautiful slow song on the CD. It makes me think of Alice in Wonderland every time I hear it, and that's one of my fav movies.<br />9. Only Wanna Dance With You 4/5 Fun dance song.<br />10. Supernatural 5/5 Beautiful song with a trippy sound. Another top fav on the album.<br />11. All That Matters (The Beautiful Life) 5/5 AMAZING!!! This might be my fav song on the whole album, IDK so many good songs!<br />12. Love Into The Light 3/5 A little too slow for my taste, but it's still ok.<br />13. Last Goodbye 2/5 Just ok for me.<br />14. Gold Trans Am 4/5 Such a fun song!<br />15. Out Alive 3/5 Has a cool dance sound to it.<br />16. Past Lives 2/5 It's OK. Kind of throws the CD off too forme since it's so slow.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I like playing this game a lot better on my kindle than my ipod because for one the screen is better and for two the graphics is good. i do wish you could win more content int the just as you do with the ipod.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|The game was fun although pretty easy to solve and short.  Would be good for a young teenager.  Good way to kill time.
B001Q7JD5O|4.0|i like this movie but i do wish it wasnt so long. some of the parts were unecessary.But other than that it was directed well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun I like it I would get this app it is free and fun I like horses and they like me as well
