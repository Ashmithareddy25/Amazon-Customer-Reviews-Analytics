B0026PEMHY|5|I was very pleased!
B00QO1ENMA|5|Nice quality.
B000COHAX4|5|Great product and great price for all of this.
B00E8TAEZU|4|fair price good tool
B00SHWZOOU|5|both work great!!
B00OH0S5Y2|1|Save your money. These last about 5-days. Very poor quality!!!
B000C59YBY|5|It fit my 2004 Silverado 2wd & arrived on time.
B00EHINWSI|5|The product came to me with a malfunction and notify the seller, the same hassle- damaged bulb instead I would recommend
B00E1ETJNU|5|I did not want to advertise the dealership where I bought my car so I was glad to replace it with this great quality plain frame.
B00CA328C8|3|This is a pretty basic product. For the price, it is great and the EZ View is hard to find for UW, but required in my state. It looks a bit cheap, but the price is in line with the quality.
B00JJ66B9A|5|Great product.  Great value.
B003DNJ728|5|Very excellent and provide the demand for appointment
B009DJKL7Q|5|priced right and solved problem. No further explanation needed.
B0031GHBSE|5|Worked great. Plug and play.
B00AFVDM72|5|Exact fit for my 2015 Tacoma
B007TYJ9GQ|5|Perfect, it fit in my Explorer Sport 2001. Identical to the OEM blower motor.
B00QMWQK2M|5|quick shipping.  Just as described
B00M0CBV9U|5|I purchased this bag for the extra suitcases for a trip from Cali to Idaho.  After 2 days of on again off again rainstorms, this bag held up perfectly.  No issues on tying it down, keeping dry or any little bugs.  Great material that kept the rain out.  I could not have been happier to purchase this.
B001BS9VR8|5|worked nice
B007QV7F4U|5|Arrived on time. Works as stated.
B001OCXI2U|5|Nice solid mount for the tool box. Much better than j-hooks.
B00AC5HEF2|3|Picky Bluetooth connection and requires their app in order to connect your phone (Samsung Note 4) for music, etc. Speakers could be louder, and the mic boom is a very tight fit in my N44. Also, the battery life isn't great and the option to connect directly to your device requires a proprietary cable, as far as I can tell...
B00LQG51TM|2|the item was much smaller than I expected..
B0054N8ZZ0|5|Just as expected good product.
B00D2HW5EW|3|Kinda hard to see in the day light
B00T4DIYTS|5|It gave my car a sporty look and reduced a lot of weight at the back. However, I purchased a spare tire cover extension bracket so the tire won't hit the frame cover.
B00JUQFVX6|5|Good product. Easy to install and very useful if you have kids.
B006QH55YW|5|This Optima battery is a D34 8012-021,  I have been using this model in my 2004 Dodge ram 2500 4X4 quad cab truck ever since I purchased my truck new.  In some of my past vehicles I have had issues with liquid acid batteries damaging cables, battery trays, fender wells, A/C lines, Etc.  I will never buy another liquid acid battery ever !  And whenever I purchase a new vehicle, I remove the factory battery and replace it with a new Optima battery.  Why? They will never damage your vehicle with acid, and they last longer.<br /> My new 2015 Jeep Rubicon has a Optima D35 8040-218 yellow top,  Our 2003 GMC Yukon has a 78-  8078-109 red top, Our 2003 Ford explorer has a 34 red top.  And I wish Optima had a battery application for my H2 hummer.<br /> By Optima and never worry about battery cable damage, or vehicle damage.
B008WXL0UQ|3|Pleased.
B00230P7BW|1|Terrible. The mirror and it's housing seem very sturdy, but the rubber end is difficult to install and doesn't keep it in place. The minor vibration from my bike caused the flange nut to fall off inside the handlebars, resulting in a loose mirror that subsequently fell off. I'm going back to the cheaper end mirrors that use expanding metal to stay in place.
B000WJAH5M|5|I slid these over my stock grips, using hairspray (sprayed inside) to ensure grip.  Made the stock grips just the right thickness to make comfortable. Only downside is to be aware of the length ... on my bike the throttle (right) side grip is longer than the left, so might be  better to order one short set and one long and use the short on the left and the longer on the right. Upside is then you will have a set of spares.
B00BEN39EQ|5|They worked great and easy to install
B0013916XW|5|So far so good. They look nice. Help protect the door frame and the tape is sticking well. We shall see how they hold up in a Massachusetts winter with cold and snow and salt.
B00FX3SVL4|5|Easy installation fast shipping
B00J7HBRL8|5|Shipped on time and in good packaging and all of them worked. I operate a travel travel Trailer on solar power only and these low power consumption lights will allow me to use more at a time and of longer duration not worrying about draining the batteries..
B0068C24HG|5|Excellent fit.  Stopped my braces from rubbing blisters on my legs.
B002WH7AY8|5|window works perfect again
B000BYE7ZO|5|Worked perfectly. 1992 F150 4.9L
B00ET5VPHY|5|This lock really came in handy and it's great that it works with my 2014 GMC Sierra key!
B004CIOJIK|5|Really happy with this kit. Had this installed to replace my stock steering stabilizer as it was consistently having death wobble due to my larger tires.  This kit took care of the issue and I no longer have any wobbling.  Would highly recommend this to others.
B000CNNKHA|5|Love them & they fit easily. Install literally took 10 minutes.
B000AL8VD2|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00ES4X38U|5|Great half-helmet!! The small fit perfect and the clear/tinted changeable retractable shields are a nice addition. It also came with a padded snap-on neck protector that will be handy in colder weather. Very pleased with my purchase.
B000F9QFDW|5|It works.  Removed scratches from glass stove. Polished HD Fat Boy crome, and stainless steel appliances. This thin works.  Used Mothers power ball and drill. And used Lucas Slick Mist wax for a shine. Great product
B000E2AR5C|2|The O-ring was incorrect for my bike.
B005J5MRYI|1|applied it according to directions and put a laquer over the top and began to peel and bubble within 5 days. garbage do not buy.
B000AP57U8|5|More horse power
B000BRCKBE|5|works good, no leaks!
B001O04IUS|1|This product does not fit the 2004 Mazda RX 8. The diameter of the disk is to small allowing the brake shoes to have over hang.<br />The bolt pattern is the same but rotor is to small. This rotor must go to other Mazda models but not the RX 8.<br />If anyone from Amazon reads this I would like to have my money back.
B004A2YCBW|5|This was an Easy swap out on a 2000 Dodge Neon,no more bearing roar.This is a good quality part and the price is unbeatable.
B00IX5MOD0|5|Awesome! Kids think it is way too cool.  Even wife admits it's &#34;snazzy&#34; and &#34;so you.&#34;<br />Quick to install.  No tools needed.
B00M1OUBES|5|Had a dead battery in my 2009 Chevy HHR. Connected the GB30, which only had a 50% charge capacity, to the positive and negative posts located near the engine. Note the battery is located in the rear of the car and is not readily accessible to connect jumper cables to. The car did not start on the first or second attempt. Hit the boost button and on the third attempt voila the car fired up without any hesitation.  Only wish NOCO would offer an extension cable for their jumper cable. Update 12-15-2015 This morning my Nissan Quest had a dead battery. Took a couple of tries after activating the boost button but glad to say the van started up.
B001CA4GI4|5|Fits perfect. Fast shipping
B00B5FHUW0|5|Fast shipping and good item
B009W5RIQ8|5|Fit like a glove
B002LCD9XU|5|sends a powerful message!
B003721C0U|5|Great and easy to use on any vehicle!!
B00DSD5M9U|5|Was delivered on time and is a great product. Very durable sticker - it was applied to my rear window during a 3 day spell of rain and it didn't move an inch. would buy from this seller again
B008O9CHIM|5|Very happy with this faucet. Having a single lever is great, and having the pull-out sprayer in an RV is amazing. Really helps with saving water while washing dishes.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Excellent tire gauge.  Love that it holds the air pressure for viewing.
B00QMI3CZ4|3|Like many people here said, the claws do not fully catch on the spring, so they are pretty scary to use. But it still worked for me. 2001 Solara.
B005JCPZIG|5|Quality
B005GYDBNS|5|number one
B00ZVJ2T0O|3|Double check that it will work for your vehicle. It's an OK product for the price, it will keep your seats clean, but I don't think it will be very durable.
B00R4JTZLK|5|Good quality product; exactly what I expected.
B00D02KHKS|5|This adds a sexiness to my car and I love it!
B003SS62PS|4|This is a nice fan.  I placed it in my vw bus to represent the original and only air conditioning.  It works great and actually puts out a lot of air.  Oscillates well. I would reccomend it!
B0049IC59I|5|Love it, works great for our RV
B00FINZXRE|5|FIT PERECT EASY TO USE THANKS TO THE NUT ON END LOVE IT WILL REBUY
B004ZF39T0|5|I purchased the 9006 size for my 2013 Honda Civic. Fit perfectly. I love my new light. Way better than the factory ones of course. I ordered the 6k lights and its looks awesome. Just make sure you're getting the right size and you shouldn't have any problems
B002CMTBKY|1|The wheel covers DID NOT fit as promised!
B0030FBZ6U|1|These handles lasted less than 4 months
B000F6DNMQ|5|We've had this long enough now that I know that I like it.  It works exactly like I had hoped it would.  I don't have to guess anymore whether I've pulled in far enough into the garage.  The two humps are just the right size to work properly.  Nice quality.
B000ND33A8|5|I love it!  Makes the truck look better and keeps my fifth wheel hitch covered.  I can still put stuff in the back of the truck.  It also covers my aux fuel tank perfectly.  My only recommendation would be to watch the youtube videos about installing it.  Had I done that I would have had it finished in 30-45 minutes.
B000BPB346|4|This is PVC pipe with 4 holes on the bottom and a shut-off valve.  Probably could build my own for half the price, but it wasn't expensive in the first place so I figured I'd pay a few bucks to have it built for me.  Works good with LOTS of water pressure (enough that it almost sprays a mist back up the RV toilet into your face.... not a fun feeling).  I'm glad my Black holding tank is clean though...  Maybe they should include a face mask or operating room gown with this little device.
B00CMW0SYW|5|Buy this! Everyone else wants 60 to a 100 for it! My truck was stalling, bought this, took all of 15 Min to put it on, drove 200 miles! Tried to make it stall,nope it wont stall anymore! Also in Fla heat when you back off the gas the old one couldn't keep up with the ac blower, Now its just great! Its right up on the top so don't be afraid to put it on yourself!
B00192QBO2|5|Fits my spare tire perfectly.
B000TK3TMC|5|this thing is great.  If the peeps behind me can't see me<br />now they're blind
B00A5UEOLG|5|I just bought this for my husbands birthday for his 2015 Toyota Tacoma...he absolutely loves it! To ALL of  the people writing reviews saying that this Does Not fit a 2015 Toyota Tacoma ....IT DOES!!! You have to put it together inside the console....it works perfectly...It does not fit a Tundra....so I give it 5 stars plus 10 more!!! The price could have been a little lower... however still very happy with it :) and also like too that the plastic is very thick and durable....Thanks Amazon!!
B00FK1VAW6|5|fit perfectly !! great price
B009IF3KFK|5|Love this stuff...Mobil 1; there is no substitute.
B00BFDI666|5|OEM part at a great price. Fixed the trouble code on my 2006 Honda Accord (2.4L 4 cyl).
B0031BU53W|4|Well made product that shipped and arrived sooner than I expected.<br />Note that this only fits IMS tanks, it WILL NOT fit your OEM tank.  I say this because it is not always stated in the description; it was not stated when I bought mine (hence 4 stars on an otherwise 5 star product) I notice the seller has now made that correction.
B00UX1SO7C|4|Once I figured the placement of everything it is neat. The only issue I have, is not all the pieces glow, and the ones that day, don't light up all the way. Other then that, a neat accessory to my Jeep
B0099P7SA2|5|Only purchase this if your helmet comes with a threaded insert bonded in already. It doesn't include the backing plate, that's why it's cheaper. Otherwise it works just fine.
B000BROXRI|3|I do not want to drill to install
B005ETCIO8|1|These bulbs do not last long at all went through a hold pack in just a few mouths
B00C7XYSJC|5|Arrived quickly and as described!
B000MAJNW4|5|I went from a cut trinity full exhaust with the 3 inch opening on my yfz 450 to this exhaust with the p4 installed for trail riding in VT where sound needs to be limited for riding and registration.  The cut exhaust was way way too loud, people would just stare and you couldn't hear yourself think.  Although it sounded great, going to this exhaust with this tip installed was a great choice. It was nice sounding while being pretty quiet as well as no rattle, the supplied oring doesn't seem to be needed when the spark arrestor is installed, I tried to use the oring but there is way to much of a gap.
B000C5HT98|5|Works like a charm.  Easy install after watching YouTube video.  Still have to use old key for door locks but not a big deal.
B00L2QM806|5|Easy to remove and re place in a different position. Blocks out the sun for my little one and does what it should. Love how it comes in a pack of 2.
B00JSJMTPS|3|I haven't used it for very long.It looks like Good quality. It fits a little loose on a Honda civic.
B0001UZUW2|5|Grandson had a great time with it and safely shot a few flies.  Would still be going strong but dog got ahold of it.
B000VT0JOW|4|Works fine
B001PWA0IO|4|Works very well, however it does emit a odd sound while the tailgate is coming down. You can almost hear the sound of the fluid moving around inside. It's a small price to pay for the convenience of the slow opening tailgate.
B007WXUPQ2|5|Exactly what I needed to replace my worn out gas cap. Perfect fit for my 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse. Always choose genuine parts when available.
B00E1SOQLG|4|Product was delivered as advertised. I installed these a couple months ago on my Acura TSX. So far so good. They were an exact fit. No noise and the brakes feel better.
B00L1S0JU6|5|As a serious &#34;car guy&#34; I can actually say this may be one of the best car towels I've tried. I was able to dry my entire car without even wringing it out, and it's texture is soft enough for me to fully trust it wouldn't scratch my paint. It's a great product to use for anyone really wanting efficiency and safety when they wash their cars.
B00DUFC8ZM|3|It is too big. I ordered the size it recommends for an IS Lexus and it is huge. Drags on all four sides  Other than it being too big it is a good car cover
B00KJGL1LM|5|Greaat
B00CEXKC2M|5|Wear house deal worked really well easy to install Would buy again.
B005VWBGQ4|5|Nice service. Good price.
B0013FSR7E|5|Great shipping and just what I needed.
B00KSIHMCI|5|Works well in our Altima to extend the seat belt for my daughters booster seat so it is easier for her to reach and put on.
B002Y39MUU|5|Great fit with no problems.
B00BQN5SUW|5|Need a flathead screw driver. pull compression pin 3/4 out so you can slide over ball, then tap down. Recommend taking mounting plates of car to install shock, then mount the plate.
B00P86N30U|5|Worked great
B00MGI60RQ|5|A+++
B00IAYUHAG|4|Very cute ...I love Tortie cats!
B00EFFY46W|5|Looks great on the car, and get a thumbs up from anyone who sees it, haha.
B000XY10NY|3|There wasn't a description that a pipe didn't fit for injector.
B00ROPYHU8|5|I like it but ppl if u drop it the paint will come off so jusr letting u kno its  not a bad product its just thay the pain does cone off if u Dont take care of it
B005JU5VH8|5|I use the wiper blades almost exclusively on my 2011 F150. They work great and last 8-10 months in a Maryland climate.
B009YR00MI|5|I was pleasantly surprised about how well this generator lasts.  Definitely recommend.
B006SMFRMA|3|Fit perfect would have given it a 5 but did came wrong color.was not taupe as advertised. Came as a slate gray.
B000BQWLE6|1|Unbeliveable!  This is a joke. I cannot believe this trash can was $7.00!  What trash would even fit in here?  This is such a rip-off, they should be made to return everybody's money for even selling this product.  i couldn't even give this to one of my kids to use this.  I bought it last year for when we went camping this summer.  I never even opened the box, I just put it with our camping stuff.  When I opened it at our campsite, I couldn't believe my eyes!  When the one review says a soda can doesn't barely fit, they are not joking!!!!!  I was so disappointed.  I can't even return it because it's been so long!
B00SGGWIFA|1|Cheesy plastic plates....pass on these.  Would be cool if different material.
B002801LEE|2|It may be a good product, however as it does not fit my MB 320E I have no grounds to rate it. Only 2 stars because the description said it would fit. As I am currently abroad, shipping costs make it uneconomic to return it.
B00GB8614E|5|Very pleased with the lights. It is like being in the daylight. I would recommend these for someone needing lots of light, either driving or work lighting.
B00E5UCYZ0|5|My husband love it! Perfect Fit
B001RBQF4G|5|I love these! It fits perfectly on my 2011 Honda Shadow. I used it the other day to strap diapers to the back and transported them home. I was bringing them to a friend, but I'm sure everyone thought I was a terrible mother! Haha :)
B00P6ZLYWM|1|Mine arrived with no batteries. 😟 I guess it works...I don't know.
B00TG3PFYS|4|inexpensive at times gives trouble with install but can't beat the price.
B00MN8MX66|4|For the price, it's great. It is cheap quality, but it works. You'll probably need more wire to make it work on most vehicles, the wires included are about 3 feet too short
B00EUDYFZO|3|tnx
B001TITC0Q|5|Easy install.
B00002N57X|3|good replacement
B00D8BFJP4|5|Very kool...on the car now ! Goes well with my punisher decals !!
B00YS2664U|5|Does exactly what it says! Great harness with it that most other switches do not have. And the light on it is extremely cool, not too bright but gives off a cool illuminated look! I recommend this product.
B00QN62V0M|1|Although I specifically sent the year, make, and model of the vehicle I discovered it would not work on my car. I had opened the box when it arrived, and found no instructions included. I just assume it was correct. My naive mistake. When I finally wanted to use it today, I discovered it was totally wrong. The item is meant to be used with straps the which wrap around the rails of the car-top carrier. My rails are totally flush with the body of the vehicle, so there is no way to attach the carrier. I'm old enough to know better, but I still feel duped.
B000CGZELC|5|Works just fine
B008GAH5PO|3|They're more than OK as long as you remember the savings compared with getting OEM key blanks from an authorized VW dealer.<br />Having said that, my experience is like other customer's, in that you can swap the transponder, electronic door locks and the battery, BUT the key blank ins 100% unswappable, so in the end you have to go to a locksmith who has a cutting machine that's compatible with VAG keys to make a duplicate on your new blank.<br /><br />You cannot simply swap the original &#34;swing&#34; key cut from the original remote, because it won't fit properly in the new key housing. Don't waste your time as I did, and instead invest time in looking around who can duplicate the mechanical key blanks. Another, tip: Leave the &#34;VW&#34; logo sticker to the very end AFTER the new blanks are cut and verified that they open doors and turn on the ignition properly. THEN you can affix the logo signaling that you're done.<br /><br />And for the very nitpickers, the OEM key stalk can be pulled out from the swing mechanism by removing a wristwatch-like pin, BUT the new key blanks are affixed permanently (the new pin is a non-functional fake), so they cannot be simply pulled out and swapped over. I tried and nearly broke the thing in two.
B001P2DULI|5|So far no problems
B009EF5STK|4|Love it great looking...but the screw  came out of the top a few days later...had to super glue it in to hold
B00RWLN476|1|Product received (twice) did not have the &#34;improved&#34; mounting system pictured and touted in the ad. Both returned and went with another brand although I preferred the Eyourlife due to the space available for the light.
B0015PK3AG|5|Excellent shipping, items fits perfectly. great job
B00I5VQ5U0|2|Looks pretty good but it is about an inch short on both sides.
B007V2CVW0|5|Great product I have one for the car and truck and they really help keep your vehicle cooler whole protecting your interior.
B008ECC31U|5|perfect and looks great.
B001S8F2V0|5|just the right part
B00I825I72|5|Gasket fit perfectly, shipped very fast, good price.
B00M6FNDR4|5|Went on super easy and clean.
B0049HQJ8C|2|This is massive, granted the windshield is huge so it probably needs to be.  After a few weeks it has begun to sag in the middle, which lets the light in near the rear sensor.  Agree with other comments that the velcro strap is too short and as a result you need to keep re-rolling it to get it tight enough to fasten.  Will keep looking, but I'm sure there are better alternatives than this.
B000L9AD2K|5|Good item!
B009XRKFQA|5|👍😄
B001OMVCIC|3|Tips for installation that aren't in the Instruction booklet: 1. If you have any form of lift/leveling kit on the rear coil springs (if your truck has coils), this kit will not work without unconventional modification. I would scrap this idea from the beginning. 2. A tiny bit of spray lube (WD-40) helps to get the tubing over the barbed fittings. 3. The higher you get the rearend, the easier install will be. Ideally you want the rearend hanging from the shocks and linkages. 4. After bag is inside of coil, and you have removed the rubber cap so the bag can inflate... at this point you have just caused yourself lots of frustration and learned a few explicatives. I know the instuctions tell you to do it that way. But if you'll leave the air out of the bag, run your air line through the proper holes, bend your bag so you can see the barbed connection, then pull the rubber cap off of the bag and quickly attach the air line and hose clamp before the bag inflates all the way. This will help to see and reach the important parts of the line and bag. Just be sure you have the line run correctly, the clamp already slid up on the hose, and the spacer/protector on the hose. You can have all the slack you need so long as it is run the correct way and all components are in place. You can feed the excess slack back through the top when done allowing the bag to inflate.  Reason for the 3 star rating is I checked multiple times to make sure this would fit my model truck with a lift on the rear. After getting the kit, I found out that it does not. It also changed the ride of my truck, even with the minimum psi in the bags. It would have been more reliable to change my springs if I'd have known I would be changing the ride of the vehicle anyway. I won't go this route again for pulling or hauling.
B003BZQ5F0|5|Great price, works perfect.
B0022ZFJV6|5|I've used this bag for air travel and for road trips on the motorcycle. Took it on s road trip from Washington to Texas and back and it worked great. The waterproof cover is really effective too (everything inside stayed dry through multiple thunderstorms).
B008427D88|5|purchased from amazon on basis of the reviews.<br /><br />had to do some repairs on our honda CRV - a good number of the nylon fasteners had broken or simply been lost over the years of having the vehicle - so bought these to replace any that were missing/damaged.  they worked exactly as expected, seem to be of reasonable quality and were easy to pop right in!<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to buy them a second time if we needed them!
B004C69LPS|4|As advertised.
B00KLIWMCU|4|Advice - measure inside of window before ordering.  This item was too big, so I contacted the manufacturer at the website they provided in the package, in order to get the correct size.
B00CR9WVPE|5|Perfect fit on my 2015 Mazda 6, a little more spunk and little more than a mile in fuel mileage
B000C8Z8LG|4|Product is OK the price was great
B004ZF4NAY|5|It's been about a week now since I installed this HID kit in my 2012 pilot; as I said earlier, it's so far so good. Like it a lot. I will definitely get one more for my fog lights!<br />Thanks to Kensun!!
B00S09T8M4|5|The kids helped me wash the car with this and it was fun and worked very well without having to scrub a lot. A must have for you people whom enjoy washing your own cars!
B00Q09UL86|4|Could not get it to fit by latching the center latch. It was necessary to elongate the mounting holes for the lower part of the latch. It now fits well.
B000KYV79E|5|delivered on time and works as promised
B00MB0DU9K|5|It stays cool even in extreme heat(102f). Great styling and quality. Shipped promptly.
B001GQ12PO|5|Good quality for a good price.
B00MHDEK5O|5|Great Jersey I wear it all the time while riding my Banshee
B000COL4A4|5|Thx
B00W8H4KH2|5|I've been wanting one of these devices for a while but couldn't find one at a good price.  I got a great deal on this one because I received a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  I am very pleased so far with the product, it comes with a lot of useful attachments and should be quite useful in an emergency.  I would highly recommend it to family and friends.
B005NYDRIU|5|Thanks looks great!
B0037W0JPO|5|As expected Timely delivery  very satisfied with<br />Product
B00AIJY2ZM|4|These bulbs looked great and performed the way they were supposed to, but on my 2014 ML350, it caused the computer to think the bulbs were out.  So these are not CANbus compatible (at least on my vehicle), just an FYI for those who may want to use these to replace standing/parking lights (not headlights).  Would be great for license plate lights or other lighting, just not good for the headlight assembly.
B001IA9C2S|5|installed in less than 5 minute on my son's 04 Monte Carlo and price was great
B000AMBNRC|1|this stuff is impossible to cut cleanly, looks cheap, purple faded look- Bought for boat application and tried for 2 hours to cut for window.. DO NOT reccomend.
B002UJVNFA|1|They are really really bad! They do not hold air enough as they should. They are also relatively short! they look very cheap too.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|very bright easy hookup going to order some more shortly
B006ONRS9I|5|Quick install. Very sturdy. Used on my 06 Polaris Sportsman 800. Best way to prevent a bump from behind braking lights or plastics.
B00SKKD83I|5|Just received it tonight  it took 5 days to get coast to coast. Seems sturdy good welds. Packaged better than I thought it would be. Will post a picture when I put it on
B00FXSHCR8|5|Exactly what I wanted a few spares incase I misplace my original. Really nice quality, definitely better than my original key.
B000VKRQA6|5|fit perfect.  but getting the panel skirts off and back on is a real hassle.
B0085KGOH0|4|So far so good
B000EPZDJO|4|I've been using Fram filters for years - works great. This time, instead of shuffling to the auto parts store and looking up what filter number my car needed, I looked it up on Amazon. After using the decision tree on Amazon (my car model/brand has five possible filters, depending on engine size and model level), I bought the recommended filter. Guess what - it was correct!
B00A9T28S4|5|Comes with self-explanatory directions for use and works like a charm
B00CFALFXY|5|Great Cleaning Cloths.  I love them to clean my &#34;screens&#34; (desktop, iPad, phone, etc.) and even the TV screen!  They also work great on my glasses and mirrors.  They are a great buy and have an outstanding performance!!
B009F5AISA|4|product arrived in near record time - - - but without hardware,<br />fit perfect
B00H7PQ50U|1|So I saw this at costco where I bought the same kit as on Amazon. Impressed by the demo and wanting to detail my wife's car.<br />Used the wash wax solution and was disappointed.<br />After drying, I used the wax and the application foam. It stated &#34;easily removes&#34; tree sap, tar etc. it doesn't do anything.<br />While I was waxing (I didn't even bother finishing because it was worthless) my wife used the leather solution, it cleaned and it felt cleaner but it didn't condition it.<br />Good thing I can take it back to costco.<br />I'll be sticking my other goodies.
B00H6XPZN6|5|Best product for its purpose! Invaluable!
B00B67BEX8|5|Very nice and on time
B004HMBK5G|5|Love the item.  Had looked high and low locally for it and no one had it. It is the only type that really works.
B00HV8LQTI|5|I LIKE IT VERY GOOD SERVICE
B004HE6UOK|5|Great brakes pads.  Has recent brake job done as I needed the car in a pinch.  The brakes never felt right.  Replaced the almost new pads with these and full performance was restored.  Don't cut corners, get the real deal!
B001NZ0SP8|5|Awesome.  My 2008 Ford F-150 didn't have anything blowing out of the vents while on 1 & 2 settings.  Then the 3rd setting stopped blowing air.  Finally ordered this & installed it.  Now all four settings work with heat or AC.  The most difficult part was removing the two screws that held the old blower in place.  I found it easier to wrench from under the glovebox with my hands while looking into the glovebox at eye level.  Easy fix
B00BEXGPVA|5|Very nice and slim while adding style all with a great price and fast shipping!
B003E22UCC|5|Excellent product and good quality
B000W0RQ8C|5|This think works as advertised.
B00FUT7IP6|5|Came before date promised and work great
B005IUP9LC|5|Works as expected
B00SRKGVP8|4|easy to install
B007KEVN00|5|Pricey? Yes.<br /><br />Worth it? Yes.<br /><br />Filled up a 37x12.5xR17 from about zero to 30PSI in 3 minutes 30 seconds. Nice knowing you've got quality equipment that will do its job when you're 10 miles from a paved road.
B00BN46J9I|5|Exceptional product.  Sleek, solid, and very well-made.
B002801E2S|5|I have about 2000 miles on these combined with the UBC USR sport series slotted rotors on the front and rear of my 2009 Dodge Ram and they are a vast improvement over the stock brakes rotors and pads. They bite quicker and it stops the truck like I want it to when I hit the brake pedal; more abrupt than gradual stopping power. I believe the yellow pads are the way to go if you have a pickup truck. I hope this helps someone.
B000CLV3NK|5|Fits perfect. Quality is good. We have it installed on our 2005 odyssey EXL. Performance seems to be very good.
B00XECQNP2|2|Durable other than screw fell out and had to go to a hardware store to find replacement to fix it so we could make it back home with our luggage
B007SG7X9A|1|I ordered this for my 2003 vw gti.  It came with the incorrect shift pattern and a completely different shift boot from the description.
B00TZ8GTJE|5|Exactly what I wanted. Packaged for  protection and shipped promptly. Very happy.
B004K27DA4|5|I recently used two of these when removing a tree and stump with my winch and snatch block and they held up great. Great heavy duty product. The paint is a little thin and scratches fairly easily. Just setting them on the concrete driveway was enough to scratch them. But hey, they're a work tool and not meant to look great. I'm not even sure if there is a paint or coating that would really hold up to dragging them across the ground with how heavy they are.
B001THQP84|5|Works exactly as they should - great price too.  I use these on my camper awing for the  Innoo Tech 20 LED Outdoor String Lights Christmas Decorations Multi-Color Lantern Ball Solar Fairy Lights, sold here on amazon.
B000W8FMXU|4|Works  well  for current  draws, well  buy the other  version
B004RCV0OM|5|Replaced the smoked acrylic skylight cover on my motorhome.  33 screws hold this cover on. Bought two tubes but one was sufficient.
B009G5ERVS|4|I ordered this part and I received it in 2 days. Instead of the estimated week. And it works fine.
B000CD8HZA|5|Works good
B002Z64P4Y|5|Works Perfect only problem there is only one in the box. I failed to notice this when it was ordered.
B00O83NNMM|5|Works well and looks good
B000BPOI8O|1|As a small-engine mechanic, I have fix several mowers that would not start - the only cure needed was to replace these plugs. Not recommended at all. Use a champion, bosh, or NGK for better reliability.
B004555PZG|5|Good deal! Fast shipping too!!
B00VVWZD3A|1|I received the wrong color which I didn't order.
B00G52W352|5|Fits my Honda Pilot 2013 perfect
B00UIZQGZA|4|Thought I would be able to easily replace the dome and map lights in the cabin. Unfortunately it is very difficult to replace the map lights.
B001GIG78E|5|love it
B00PYQC3BO|2|Low quality product. Stitches ripped when trying to mount.

B0006MRRR6|5|Works perfectly and fast delivery.
B0010E3750|5|Excellent pads. Installed them on a 2007 kia sedona. Initial mild dust which is not an issue but they have the best stopping power. No noise or squeal.
B005RUPM1K|5|Excellent buy low price and excellent
B001P2DQOO|5|Perfect fit and heavy duty.
B006LGKI1I|5|Worked out perfect

B001GJ3EJS|4|Great brush set, reusable. Cheaper alternatives elsewhere.
B000RGXLG2|3|Work well enough I guess, They do streak quite a bit.
B000BUOSGG|5|Well made and perfect for the RV
B00BFDG672|5|The part was genuine honda, what more is there to say. It worked just as it should.
B007S0LDME|5|Works great, there is still an odor in tanks but not near as bad as before.
B00UZHBFPM|5|As described fast shipping
B0009I2OL6|1|This was not the right attachment needed for connecting to a popup, we had to go out and buy another set locally to connect to the car for brake lights. If you are looking to pull a trailer or camper don't waste your money on this product.
B003TKRZ7Y|5|Easy install.  Made the car sound much better.
B0018YGPNI|5|This was great for my 2010 Xterra Off Road!  I used to bottom out on rougher roads, and this has made it so it doesn't happen any more.  I would highly recommend this lift option.  It was also really easy to put on.
B007NKPV18|2|Works great but it does not fit my rigid 10 inch E series
B004A69H8G|5|replaced the factory one and made a difference. The car idles smoother and better throttle response
B000JFHMVQ|4|Works great just wish it had a screw on cap for the pour spout because it drips after emptying.
B00SV54M00|5|Great buy
B00QU70X7M|5|Product works great.  Fast shipping!
B005VHN8JC|5|The leveling fit perfect and gave my truck the stance I was looking for. I would recomend to others.
B002P8OUBA|5|Fits 2009 camry LE!!!
B005TKXHCO|5|installed this on a 98 VW GTI VR6.  fits awesome, no vibration or rubbing issues. I also heat wrapped mine and sealed it with silver silicone heat temperature spray paint.
B00F4FAKDS|4|I love these they add a nice look to my car I was sceptical because there universal but they fit nice they have to be sat in once before the folds from packaging disappear. Would of liked if they completely wrapped and the back pocket pulls in  a little. These seat covers do come with s clips they are in a bag attached  inside the seat cover. I was disappointed at first until I found them
B0024ECJSQ|5|Good! Came with all mounts, etc
B00KYDZWBU|5|This is a butt-kickin light. WATCH OUT ON THE MAGNETS - NO JOKE. So the story: I bought a couple around this price (more and less) like this: [[ASIN:B00JSCK650 Xtreme® Yellow 44 LED High Intensity Law yada yada)]] and tried them out on the bench and this one is the KEEPER.  It is better in all areas, intensity, strobe lighting choices and so forth  Spend the $50 more and get the one you will have for years (unless someone steals it) Recommend that you don't leave it magnetically attached overnight - even though it will seem like it is bolted down (magnets are that strong!) the neighbors will crowbar it off that roof, just so they can sleep though the next snowstorm - without being annoyed by this light!
B00A9MZAJA|5|Ordered for a 2002 Honda Civic EX Coupe. It works perfectly! Finally got my stupid door lock working again. So cheap too!
B0029XLMU8|4|Great decal.
B007TY6UJ0|5|Easy and perfect fit.
B000A8FJ12|5|Hard to find item. A must have for old cars.
B00TQ662OW|5|Plug and play for mercedes cla250, no error sign and works perfectly with crisp white looking daytime light
B00B4S2B0Y|3|These mats are mediocre. They are genuine Toyota parts, but I really don't like all the separate pieces.  It may be easier to remove the pieces to clean, but in doing so the design makes these mats move all over the place.  The kids move these mats with their feet naturally from getting in and out.  Recently one of my kids accidentally dropped a soda on the mat, but because they are not one seamless part, liquid went between the mats.  Defeats the purpose of getting all season mats.  I hate to see what it will be like this winter so I am saving up for the better mats here online.  Honda all season mats are SO much better.  I wish Toyota would have gotten their cues from them although with the way the floors are designed on the Toyota I am not sure there really is a better way to design them.
B00DQU9W4G|5|Good
B008KV70SG|5|Great product; bad packaging the pump had a broken leg, not affecting the pump, overall great pump
B0033WDG58|5|Great!!  Bought this and the wiring harness for use in our Ford F150.  Plugged right in, and was ready to go in 5 min!! Awesome
B000EQ19TG|5|Works well.  2002 CRV
B0049QIUY4|5|Great product no issues
B00P1KZJAK|5|Looks Great. Extremely bright. I can't even tell if my headlights are on when this is on. I've been waiting to write this review to see if I get moisture inside with use and car washes. So far, So good. No moisture inside whatsoever.
B00MR4DR2U|5|Easy to install and use.  You can't even tell it is there from peeking in the back windows!  Great for peace of mind.
B004GW41ZS|5|Love the looks.  Littler hard to install but not too bad.
B00M9IYQ7E|5|Quick shipping. Easy to install. Did it myself. It looks great and LED's are bright. Very pleased!
B0002X7T5Y|4|Worked fine. Makes putting patches on so much easier!
B00FZTUS12|5|Very nice bedliner. Easy installation and great fit.
B007I6RDW2|5|fits much cheaper than the dealer
B005GQTEQ4|5|It's gives it that more aggressive stance without paying a fortune  Money well spent.
B004I13WCK|5|The light was wonderfully and the fit was a 10
B000BQO1OY|5|Replaced a failed thermostat on my Sears water heater.  Works fine so far.
B00CA6TAHQ|1|Junk... I know it was cheap but only had about 12 hours on ski with new motor!!
B00ZL3HOYQ|1|Very displeased The lights do not fit correctly, want refund,
B010SEJSN2|5|Best decision I've made, looks good and brought my fuel mileage up 1/4 tank
B00651OAVS|5|Great Price
B003NI15E6|5|Works perfectly
B0021UMTZQ|5|Great product - there seems to be no limit to what you can repair with this (within reason).
B000C3ZCKI|5|On-time and perfect fit.
B004158O26|5|Perfect for beach and/or pool!
B00LFASX26|1|No XXS on them .
B004OEHAS8|1|Not what I thought when I opened the package the corners where bent
B002UC6RSA|5|works has advertised
B000BPWTM6|5|Perfect fit... about 10 minutes tops. Arrived as stated.
B005KYV9HE|5|Snug nuts and bolts with this and finish with torque wrench.  Put your ratchet handle away;  this is faster & easier.
B00TMFDUTC|4|Very nice
B00I8U3O3E|4|There was a lot of extra vinyl on the sides so they were over sized and a bit difficult to install but when trimmed they worked fine. Not the best quality vinyl but for the price it works and they're way darker than my other tint. I actually left my old tint on for an even darker look.
B00RM327NG|5|Very sturdy hold even in my car with a stiff suspension.
B007FZYUNQ|5|Harri's grips have always been my favorite. Comfy, and last along time. A little smaller diameter and less swishy than the original ones from years ago.
B000BUU5Y0|5|the best way to stabilize our 33 foot camper.  My husband totally loves these.
B005LVLJY4|5|Very well made. Exactly what I expected and wanted.
B00DUGQTE2|5|Very fast delivery n works great.
B000C9I7Z4|5|The subject part fit my vehicle and so far has performed well. The check engine light has extinguished itself and has not reappeared. My only disappointment with this purchase was the delayed response in receiving approval for my Amazon.com Visa Account application. This delay resulted in my not receiving the promised $30 discount for this purchase had the approval been given at the time of purchase. I feel that you should send me a refund of $30 since I acted in good faith by applying for the credit card with which to make the purchase.
B00ED46XHS|5|Tried gluing my broken part but it didn't hold up and the work installing the glued part wasn't worth the trouble. If you have this broken part just buy a new one, it's not expensive and will save you work fixing it right the first time. Don't be like me and remove your dashboard twice. Part is as good as original.
B00M8V63MI|5|Color is great and the price is right.  Will see if they last long or not.  So far I am very pleased.
B004MSA3PI|2|I had a real struggle getting this to fit my 2.5&#34; Tailpipe. The finish is not a bright silver stainless like Magnaflow even after you polish it it still looks kinda dull/yellowish. Price is good but the brand &#34;MBRP&#34; is not anywhere on this tip, so who knows if it is truely legit. I wouldn't buy again.
B009HMTBK2|2|The back cover it wasn't the right size the front it was good the rocks was good and the we are covering it was good thank you
B006MK5RNC|5|Exactly as I had hoped.
B00EA2VLPM|5|now i am cool!
B006X8AEUY|5|Grest fit
B00S9YRD40|5|I love this so much! It is so cute!
B001CFDDE2|3|No directions
B00KOHHLTW|5|I installed the Vance & Hines FP 3 Autotuner on my 2015 Road Glide downloaded the App to my Iphone and a very easy setup.The bike right now has stock exhaust and Air cleaner so I used their recommended map for stock bikes ...It took no more than 10 minutes to set up...The instructions are right on the money,plus if you are still not sure there are numerous videos on You Tube...put about 400 miles on the bike then decided to try the Auto Tune Function.Turned that on and drove around for a week and updated the Map again it worked flawlessly...It works with Iphone,Droid,you can download the app to an IPad,or a tablet and it does not have to be carried with you..Just park the bike in your garage and flash it via Bluetooth.This spring going to do the exhaust and the air cleaner ..It cost's over 300.00 at the dealer plus the price of Harleys tuner and it comes no where close to the FP3....<br />I want to thank the guy who posted the review advising that you put it on a stock bike to see the results before you start doing upgrades,he was right..
B002O1N9Z6|3|I thought that this was a GM product and not made in a foreign country. Had to switch out the bulbs to give off same light as other headlight.
B000BZ6XO6|5|Perfect! Installation was easy enough. Spent a little more on a timken bearing because I don't want to do the job again.
B00NOKPPK8|5|This is an awesome light bar. It is extremely bright and just the right size for my rzr, and you can not beat the price!
B000JFHMVQ|1|This pan is the WORST when it some to trying to pour/dump the used oil into a 1 gallon container for my local recycle pickup. The pour spout is bigger then the gallon jug opening and it is impossible to aim the oil flow correctly into the jug as the bend in the spout creates unpredictable flow.<br /><br />It has very sturdy construction. This was tested as I was destroying it into pieces to put in the trash, took longer then expected.
B00KWRMK1S|3|not any brighter then original lights. less power used only plus
B000BGM2XG|5|Nearly perfect fit replacement for our 1970 Aristocrat camper.  Works great!
B011Q18D14|5|Great price. Works great. Easy to use.
B00GHT7T16|1|Beware of the 30 day warranty. I purchased this part in June and it failed in August. For good measure, I replaced the vacuum switch along with the power steering pump on my 91 Celica GT (which I've rebuilt and is in great shape) and also installed a line filter. After a short period, my power steering started whining, was hard to turn, and then a cloud of white smoke came out of the tailpipe. I worked in auto parts, so I'm very familiar with Dorman products and they've been mostly reliable...until now. It's very obvious that the QC on this switch was very low or the seller obtained it from a sub-source. Maybe both? Either way, I purchased another switch from a reputable auto parts store with a much longer warranty period. Again, buyer beware.
B00NYCEXJA|1|Wasn't what it said it was, and wasn't the same as my quad
B00HNGBRBU|5|these are coated and much nicer than what I received from RK
B00IIRGXVM|5|This badge is high quality and makes my charger look like 1 of 1.
B00SG7UAFY|5|These worked great on my Chrysler Sebring.
B007TG7I0I|3|Work OK but started chattering after a month. They work but noisy , that's probably why so cheap
B000CO7IK4|5|Good Switch. 3 months on an outdoor application and no problems.
B008G20RL6|5|Perfect fit, looks great.
B0088PZVOO|5|Received it really quick, fits and looks great. I expected to be more of a rubber car mat feel ( should have read more detail, my fault). I ended up returning it for that reason. Purchase and return process was absolutely quick and easy for that I rated a five star.
B00KWNUXWK|5|Got these for my grandmother and even though we have not put them in her car I'm sure they will be great all we need now is the steering wheel cover she would be set
B00ZBHS0NG|3|Don't have good quality the pieces
B00009AOCF|1|Terrible product. Left smudges.
B00Q7H8Z98|5|you will not find a better set of seat covers,  I did have a problem with the head rest covers,  they seem to be made for a tapered style, they worked but a little of baggy at the top.  the fit on the back and seat are perfect. they are water resistant and easy to clean,  this makes running top less worry free.
B000JFHMPC|5|great
B008YJLHOW|3|I wish I ordered the glass panel, this is flimsy.
B000CSPFX2|5|started right up!!!!
B001U7LTE8|4|Convenient wrap around step cover for our trailer. Makes the step less slippery and helps to clean off shoes! I didn't give it 5 stars as it was quite tricky to get it on the step!
B00DPIFNME|5|Works great.  Installed it ourselves.  Not too hard if you read the directions.
B000CM3H4M|5|Perfect fit
B001J85CLE|5|work great
B00FFRSWYE|4|Worked well initially, then stopped &#34;freshening&#34; up the air in the car. The original cartridge has definitely not ran out yet. It's just not as potent after 3-4 months
B0009H51WQ|4|Fit perfectly.  Easy to change.  No reason to pay mechanic to do it just grab it off Amazon
B002SB00QS|5|Took out most of the lean when turning. Better handling. Easy install.
B0002RNSLO|2|Bought three so all my trucks would have one. I needed to convert them to trailer brake, which is fairly easy to do: four screws to remove cover and two wires to switch. The reason for the two stars is one of them came with a stripped screw, and its location makes it impossible to get at with an easy out. I guess if you need three, buy four. Or something else
B00BUHVXH6|4|Finally got the correct kit.....
B00PUPG04U|1|Wish I can give 0 star. Did not fit my bike and did not  come in mat black.
B00G620ZVU|5|Precisely what I was looking for to enhance my Kawasaki Mule!
B00HZOBQAM|4|Great quality product. They are slick, my wife has to be careful getting into the truck or she slips trying to step on them.
B00WNUDS54|5|The parts were exactly what I needed! Delivery was on time and I will order from this company again! Very satisfied
B00PCV1J3E|5|Loved it.  Just the right size and very easy to put on.!
B00VYNDKK4|4|Good product but it's too strong. It lifts the hood up like it would throw the hood and making clunk sound(hood). I guest this is generic so it would fit other similar makes and models. Over all it's good.
B004RNR9QY|5|Really, don't try it. Don't try to clean out the absinthe with a lighter either. The flame running through the hose pushes the air out so fast, that the other end of the hose can whip around hard enough to get buried in your garage drywall. Seriously....water only.
B0085FOF0S|5|My husband loved these covers. Easy to apply, fit his 2013 silverado perfect. Look like they cost a lot more. Quick delivery.
B00D42AFS8|4|Got it same day AWESOME , 9hours later I actually needed it...... IT WORKED!!!
B003L31RHI|4|haven't had a single problem with this product. continue to use each oil change I've done for a couple years now. I do extended interval changes on all my vehicles.
B00498MMI2|5|Fit perfectly on my 2003 Matrix. Delivery time was excellent.  Might get another mirror.
B00355OW2O|5|Worked out great
B007EF20GQ|5|used it to add a little trim to my cars interior, worked well and molds very nicely and all i used was a hair dryer...
B00SLKS6SO|5|Awesome fit and look!!
B00EU1FTYM|5|Easy to install and perfect fit.
B00CIJ7M6G|5|Easy to install and it looks great!
B00X2TUW1I|5|just got back from our family roadtrip...54 hours combined in the car! This was our incentive for buying the shades and we loved them!  Great size and shape.  Attached to the window perfectly...really like that it doesn't have suction cups.  We initially had to re-position them and didn't have any problems taking off and putting back on.  Very pleased with the price and performance.  Great job on the product and even had a personal email to follow up and make sure we were happy. Very impressive customer service.
B00859HI12|1|Useless. They have a Velcro in the bottom that is supposed to stick to the floor, but it doesn't hold.
B005X4FPAS|5|Fits good. Im 135 pounds 5' 3&#34;
B002Q3H4US|2|fades in the sun after a few weeks. I wouldn't use this on a  motorcycle fairing again.
B004J2YST4|5|Works great
B0096EDVRA|5|What a great price for these! Other places like stealerships sell this for more than $100. Keeps my cargo in place. Love it.
B005K227ZE|5|Exactly what I was looking for !!
B00GHS6BJS|5|Easy install and own fit, good quality
B0007KJJ3W|5|Works great.
B005H12XG6|5|Perfect fit and color
B00E5UHC7A|5|Great for my kid who is beginning to ride MX. He is 5, and a bit bigger for his age in head size. Overall, I think the quality and price is right for something that we will likely have to replace in a few years anyway.
B00ROS4GOC|5|Quality product, just as pictured
B00OTFP8V8|5|A
B00MAQMZSW|5|Great size and quality fenders.  We use these fenders while our boat is in it's slip.  Nice size and withstands everyday usage.
B008DIZ1S2|5|Beautiful.  Fabulous shine and haven't lost any stones....yet.
B0012OG73M|5|Works great with the aluminimum polish
B004SRTN3Q|5|Fits perfect.
B00C6Y74PC|4|fit perfect whith no problem
B00MJ7S1T4|5|Very good quality bulbs and very bright. Highly recommend.
B00P2HRGPI|5|Thought was over priced at first but these are VERY GOOD. Great upgrade. Wish I had done sooner.
B00R139Y6U|5|Very good
B00BXO70UU|5|Great price with factory (OEM) fit. Product is manufactured by Kia.
B00GNT5ZWK|3|This was a tight fit in my 2013 Chevy Silverado and the bottom strings could not be tied. It does fit snugly, so I just cut them off. So far its working okay, but not the best quality. Would definitely buy something different next time.
B007J7E2FG|4|The first mat I received was crooked, however, the seller replaced it and the new one looks fantastic!  Nice quality and large enough for a smoker or grill.  Great way to show WI pride!
B000XY2WMW|5|game changer in terms of comfort and better control of bike.  Great quality.
B0013RIOMK|5|I love the look of this inserts.
B000TXZCPQ|4|This one works fine.  Two previous cables from another amazon store did not work at all.
B00THRM80M|5|Used on Kawasaki Vulcan 900 w/sissy bar&windshield. It covers the saddle bags & windshield but doesn't quite cover the front fender. Best quality cover we have purchased. Snug, easy to put on and is 100% waterproof despite torrential rains. I will repurchase from the same seller when this begins to show signs of wear. The material is soft on the underside, no concerns about scratching paint
B009ANV81S|5|Works as advertised and looks great
B001D3O3HE|5|Perfect fite
B006GZHJTS|4|cool, angels the plate pretty weird tho
B00O2AP6L2|5|They are not exactly as pictured. I ordered for GMC, the flares did not have the recesed  bolds as pictured.  Then I was contacted by oxgord and they resolved the issue.
B00BTHNEDI|1|Product great at first but every one of them burned out in short period of time.
B002S9V0KA|5|Extremely happy with this purchase. Got many compliments.
B00BVEI8ZS|4|Not of the top notch quality, you do get what you pay for. Looks great on the car is all I know
B00BODWPQ4|5|they were delivered quickly and looks fantastic on my impala
B00QWUEJBS|5|Perfect to get my IR231G back up and running. My throttle seat was completely worn out, which caused the gun to keep running, even after the trigger was released.
B00DG7RALQ|5|Excellent product worth the money
B004X96DQ4|5|Color is perfect for my 2015 mustang.  As others have mentioned, the clear cap is impossible to remove.  You'll end up just using the brush tip.
B002MCVPOO|5|works great
B00XKTT30Q|5|does the job. arrived quickly
B000FT2WBG|1|It broke the first time I used it.
B00NTNX7BO|4|Worked great on our trip across the US this summer.
B00RW7WXDQ|5|I was very happy with these wipers and found them slightly easier to install than other wiper replacements I've installed on our Pilot.
B002R1GAM2|5|Fit perfect and seemed to be a quality part.
B00UHD4HJA|5|what you see is what you get
B0048DU8RK|1|doesn't fit, waste of money, cheaply constucted
B00O40ZWV4|5|Good looking, great fit. I put this in on my driveway in about two hours.
B005JZOKO8|5|Looks great on my Triumph
B001534XCC|5|perfect fit
B0066RRE4G|4|very good
B000ALG1AW|5|This very good product
B004P9IS3I|5|Just what I was looking for. Easy to install and does the job. Shipping was prompt and on time.
B000NWA8M0|5|Works great!
B00029JXOI|5|Very nice.
B001CF3J96|5|Fit perfect.  I trimmed down the padding so that it would close easier.
B00NAIS6UU|5|I would order these again. Got them to use with my motocross helmet.  Just recreational riding, not racing and they worked for my needs
B004K6HZFS|5|just what I needed
B00C5TGYLS|4|This product is great quality and the workmanship is awesome! The only reason I gave it 4 Stars is because the directions could have been a lot clearer. This was my first time installing a fender eliminator kit but the instructions were for someone who may have done this several times before. Never the less, I love the product and the end results! Nice job Yoshimura!!
B00PVVWWW2|4|would've given 5 stars but the two bolt holes at the rear of the manifold are out of line, I should be able to force them through. Very high quality, very impressed!
B00KMD3IB8|5|So easy to follow directions and saved me a lot of money buying this remote. The remote is identical to the factory one.
B000WK4CS4|5|Very reliable product. Lasts a long time.
B008BMN8X0|5|These LED lights are the right brightness you would want to enhance your license plate. These work flawlessly and do not flicker or stop working when you drive over rough roads ie: going over bumpy rail road crossings. If you want stylish and bright LED license plate lights then I Highly recommend these here.
B00802FVX6|5|I upgraded to these after putting projector headlights in my Nissan. These are great lights, super bright and not too tricky to install. The only issue I had was that the rubber dust boot I had in my Xterra had to be modified a little bit so that the Kensun gasket would fit. Overall, incredible difference between these and the stock bulbs.
B00HS5JLYQ|5|Easy install, run cool and stop better than oem brakes! VERY affordable too
B006BAQ6Y2|5|When my old remote died in the middle of a road trip, all I could think was how expensive I had heard that they were to replace at a dealership.  However, to my delight I found this.  It was inexpensive and super-easy to program.  The package came in the mail, and 5 minutes later I had a working remote again.  Awesome!
B005345DBY|5|good
B001DRNNHG|5|Works great so far and the cheapest filter I could find which also happens to be stock.
B00SKSO73A|4|The connector worked with Toyota Techstream and I was able to access vehicle systems (ABS and SRS) on my 2002 Camry. Any OBDII device should be able to read and reset basic engine codes, but you usually need special software such as Techstream  to read and reset other network controller codes such as the ones associated with airbags and antilock brakes.<br /><br />Hardware worked great. However, I subtracted one star because I wasn't able to use the software that came with the device (evidently the archive file was corrupt - possibly the result of a bad cd?). I tried opening the file with several unzip programs on different PCs with the same result. With a bit of google research and some experimentation, I was able to locate an alternative online download source for the appropriate software and device drivers.
B0030DEQKO|5|Perfect!  Cheaper than anywhere else, came quickly and installed super easy.  Note that they are a hair to long for a 2001 Navigator so you have to remove both old supports before the gate will open wide enough to install the new ones.  Once they are installed, all i have to do is unlatch the gate and it goes up by itself.  Fantastic!
B00KGNSGNE|5|Taking in consideration that it came from China the arrival time was faster than what I expected quality was great looks great I highly recommended
B00UBTQRXO|5|just the part that i need tu my carburator it function perfectly y recomend this one
B004BROQ6C|5|Great part, perfect fit.  Couldn't ask for anything more
B002TMLJL6|4|Good fit excellent quality.
B00PZ00UE6|3|Purchased this item. It was shipped on time and is fairly accurate to the description. Only disappointment is that it is very small for a key chain. It had weight to it but is not much bigger than the top of my Yukon key itself.
B00FW1JXGO|5|Good product and great company.
B005OZNZD0|5|Excelente.
B001EEC45A|4|Great product.  Fits like a glove. I would have given a 5 stars, if I knew it was only 1 car seat cover and not two. The picture and description were deceiving.  Delivery was quick and I am satisfied with the product.
B00MARZUI8|5|Fit my 2015 Golf R fine a little tweaking for the front sensors not to read it at slow speed..
B00WW0LI66|3|Looks good but it did not come with the rocker switch and its straight not curved other than that it's very brite.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|This is my third purchase since I got mine as a BDay present. Best survival gear you can buy. Buy it even if it's. It for survival, great for traveling
B003ZUE5BW|5|Was easy to install just a plug in go. would recommend it to anybody
B00J3D75QM|5|Accurate description.
B00L2YR218|3|More pink than red
B00D3OBPLI|5|Was just what I needed.  Delivery was great.  I hope I never have to buy one again, but would buy here again.
B001BS9VR8|5|Worked great so far.
B000CO88C6|1|Product is not universal, would not fit 2007 Dodge Caliber Struts
B005MZZ1WA|5|Works!!!!!
B00C1GD2T2|5|Perfect for Reckless Batwing fairing!
B002R13N68|5|Good quality, great price.
B000VTW8CS|3|I gave it a lower rating because of installation challenges. The hitch itself is great. I'd give it five stars.  The install was for a 2014 Equinox.  I had to tap out four existing M12 nuts as they were full of rust.  Very limited space for this. The tool used for 'fishing' the bolt and plate thru the end of a hollow bumper was short in length.  I had to add wire to it, plus connect some wire to the other side to pull it back out because of obstacles inside the bumper.  If you are okay with some difficulty and have patience this is a great hitch.  You could have it professionally installed.
B002X6VXL4|4|Like it.
B00DP4BH3M|4|It fit after filing down an edge on the plastic that shouldn't have been there and was throwing off the alignment. You can't beat the price. It looks great now.
B006WZOMLA|4|Great boots only problem is they're made in China.
B00S6H4MYO|4|fast delivery , right part number
B00BVPOC20|5|Perfect fit and is like new now
B000E67SHS|1|This product is not an original product made by Honda. Earlier today, I installed this fan switch into my car. When i was applying the required torque, via torque wrench, this fan switch broke in half. Took an hour to remove the broken piece from the radiator. This is a cheap Chinese made alternative. Purchase this piece either from Honda instead, or buy the $30 dollar version off of  amazon. Very disappointing to learn how thin the brass is, which was used in this piece
B00BODWPQ4|4|Perfect fitment, and so far seem good!
B00KJGCEXG|5|Good replacement key.
B004ME11FS|5|love it
B00OB3BL78|5|they worked fine
B00KGICIJM|5|Perfect fit, exact replacement. Arrived quickly, well packaged with quality control sheet and actual test data included. Better than expected at a fair price. Finish is good, should holdup well.
B0000AXTUY|5|Keeps battery up to snuff during storage and easy to mount
B00496LXJ8|5|Perfect replacement part for a 2006 LBZ Duramax
B00BVPOC20|5|Saved me from going to the mechanic! Great product! Glad it came with the spring
B00IN4EY6G|5|Love them!
B00JFMDUV0|5|Great product, super fast shipping.
B0049W4VZA|5|fits a 550 XP like a glove!  Should have came with this.  I love the extra space for carrying gloves, straps, drinks, tools etc.  If you are on the fence about this box just get it.  You will love the extra space.
B0017LWDN8|5|Fast shipping and good price!
B002373BQ8|5|works great
B006WBRU4U|5|Fit perfectly with no problems.
B004ZF48OA|5|High beams no longer needed.  These really light up the road.  Ease of installation depends on your car. Kensun part of installation is easy.  Getting to the light in a 2102 Subaru Outback is not!!!!  But I went to HID mostly because of the long life. Bulb replacement in the Outback is a nightmare!  Now, I won't have to replace them for a looong time!  Great lights at a good price.
B00S58V56W|5|excellent, easy to install.  made of quality materials.
B00PDT8M9Y|5|Sorry about the last review was ment for a different seller. Thank You for the product, works great. ;) Thanks. :)
B00DCCCNOO|4|It works -not perfect
B00CFQSHDO|5|Excellent price nice service
B00Y85UM7O|4|Very effective as a sun shade, fits fairly well on my tacoma crew cab rear door windows.  I'm not convinced they will last all that long in the socal sun, but did not deduct for that since I'm not psychic.  Only weaknesses are nothing to hold them all the way down so they ride up a litte (the door being closed keeps them from moving far) and they sometimes make an annoying noise when driving fast.<br /><br />I ordered them not believing they would be good, pleasantly surprised that they are.  Much different car temps left out in the sun, more cooling than I would think.
B00MB0DTQE|5|Super comfy and keeps my steering wheel from burning my hands on hot summer days. Great purchase and fast shipping!
B00TE3ZZT0|2|nice piece but incapable of integrating with oem 6-disc cd changer, wihtout which you are left with a big hole in your dash.  If you don't mind losing the cd changer, its probably just fine.
B004HCM9H4|5|Great wax,like all Meguiars this is real good.Easy on and off.
B00XV4XC9I|2|the bottom half covers the year and month tag on my liscence plate, so i am unable to use it.  i found nothing saying how wide the metal was and how deep the opening was, unortunately
B001NZQIDE|5|Fit my 2015 Ford Explorer with factory equipped tow package perfectly.
B00FNAX7KW|1|I used these as running lights for my mercedes. They did not flicker and were bright enough (filled the headlight housing with light, didn't put out a lot of light). However, they lasted nowhere near the advertised run time. Mine lasted 6 months before the first set (2) burned out. Don't waste your money on these, spend a little more and buy something that will last.
B0073WEZU4|3|quality and craftsmanship is high and exatly as advertised, but reception, even in a suburb on 25 miles from downtown Dallas is just ok. In some areas (close to power lines, etc)  reception is weak. Closer to the Dallas reception is better.
B0036VUGWW|5|Good product. It is pretty bright. It went in very easily. I haven't noticed any moisture inside and they have held up to a decent amount of abuse by the brush along the mountain roads in Montana with no scuffs. And they look great.
B008C9YS0Y|5|I replaced the original relay in a 2002 Camry because I had replaced the signal bulbs with LEDs and was experiencing the usual &#34;hyperblinking&#34;. This has worked great so far and was an exact plug in substitute. No more super fast blinking.<br /><br />No fault of this device, but it was a pain to reach and extract the original relay.
B00MB0EX46|5|Looks great.  Made inmediate hit with &#34;honey&#34;.  When she is happy, everybody happy.
B00E3UM8A8|4|Good buy.
B00WN5BM3E|5|The 2 in 1 Car Wash Mitt from Bee Auto Care makes washing your car a breeze! Normally a task that seems daunting, due to tough, stuck-on grime, washing my car with the 2 in 1 Car Wash Mitt is quick, easy and painless. I love that the mitt has two sides - one for removing stubborn dirt and the other for a smooth wash - so that you can get the whole job done with just one product. The mitt is a great fit for my hand and the soft microfiber material is soft and gentle on my car. Hand washing is simple as it usually only needs a quick rinse, with a more thorough washing after every couple of uses. Happy to have a great product that delivers on all of its promises!
B00KTHUXKQ|5|I did find a very small mold remnant on the edge that I was able to remove with a razor blade. Other than that, I had no problem with it, and it seems to be an exact match to the original.<br /><br />The move of the electronics was very easy. I just eased it out of the old unit by removing the battery, and gently pressing on the buttons to get it to slowly slide out. The electronics is encased in a soft plastic shell that does not have anything that restrains it in the old enclosure, so there is just the resistance of the plastic to plastic friction to overcome.
B002T017KG|5|Good shocks, great price. I always buy KYB
B007KCXG0C|5|Fitment is perfect, excellent light output.
B00AN8DOBG|5|Now it's easier to remove the clam style clamps.
B004042Q1I|4|Nice grille, looks great.  Although after looking it over I realized the chrome look is no more than an insert . The grille itself is standard issue . My suggestion ,, if you dont need a new grille and just want a chrome grille , just buy  the chrome insert and save some money.  . The emblem can be purchased separately also .
B00AN2L0TU|4|The package came earlier than expected...no complaints here. The box was way too big for the hitch, which resulted in the hitch moving a bunch in shipping, marring the paint off of the hitch down to the bare metal in a few spots. I applied black gloss spray paint and you can't tell.<br /><br />The hitch itself is great and the assembly instructions and online videos on how to install it are very helpful. As with most things I tried to make this a one-person job...but had to get extra hands for the last step. Overall, I'm very happy. It is a better hitch than the stock Subaru hitch at a fraction of the price.
B00AEBAF8W|5|Perfect fit.  It was easy to install,
B00651C1EQ|4|great antenna replacement
B008Y9KAWM|5|Overall it was great!
B000IZ5YHG|5|Solved my problem
B003F8GNVE|5|These spark plugs are really good, I recommend them to anyone except Racers.
B006GZBMQO|5|My 2006 Nissan Frontier had a bad fuel level sensor.  Gas level readings were all over the map.  A nagging Check Engine code was omnipresent on my gauge cluster.  The sensor is bundled with the fuel pump so it makes sense to change out both.  Nissan wanted $1k and a local shop wanted $0.7k to do the job.  What to do....?  The Spectra fuel pump is only $150 so the rest is labor.  I located a place that would rent me a lift and I did the job myself.  Not simple.  But not overwhelming.  Most of the work is in taking down the fuel tank.  Installing the Spectra is very simple.  It works fine and the nagging code is gone.
B005ZZOQ82|5|High quality piece
B0002UEOLO|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00KY0MLGC|5|Yes, it fits perfect in my 1997 mazda B2300. Is working good and for the price it was a great deal for me.
B001UC3BQW|5|Looks good, fits nice on my 2004 Chevy express 1500 cargo van
B007TY69HI|5|PERFECT
B00F4B5VOA|5|Very nice wheel
B000E2APZO|5|good fit.
B000JFHNEC|5|AAA+++
B00079FOK0|5|Good product
B001OIRUKK|5|These fit my 2008 Unlimited Sahara perfectly.  They are heavy, clean easily, and look sharp against the black carpeting.  The only gripe is that when the doors are completely off, the back seat mats tend to float in the air when driving on the highway.  They won't fly out of the Jeep, but I worried at first.
B00COYYGFU|5|Great, easy to install and has held up to trips up the AlCan highway.
B007Z1FSKO|5|Very excellent and provide the demand for appointment
B000M5YZ2W|5|Works as expected
B00656YZR2|5|Made by Honda for Honda. Fits like a glove, and top quality!
B005YP3CWO|5|Received faster than expected and is an original chevy key. Got it cut and am using it every day
B009XAR2CM|5|great
B006NSN7OE|3|The sticker was printed on good material bit the print job was not. The black in a botchey discolored black  and the green was grainy.
B00K7X92BI|5|Great for a small steering wheel. I have this in my Kia and it fits perfectly
B00CMWGIMI|4|This part was described exactly how it is. I was concerned that it may not be the right fit and that the description could be wrong but it wasn't. I would buy from this company again.
B001DRNNKI|5|Good Quality replacement cabin filter.  Relatively easy to install on my 2007 VW Rabbit.
B00QQUD334|5|This product is great! My Highlander console looks like new again.
B00700SJEC|1|Lasted two months.  Garantee not honored. Also rear shock are bad.  KYB is not for Kia Sorento.
B00PZ53OZS|4|it was exactly what i needed and is a perfect replacement for oem at a decent price as compared with vw trying to rip your teeth out.
B00WZWXO68|4|It does what it's supposed to.  Wish it were a little bigger.  My trunk is a lot more organized with this. I may end up having to get a 2nd or 3rd one for the other things in my trunk.  It holds stuff like my antifreeze, fluid containers, tools, etc.  I have maybe about 30lbs of items in one bag and I've lifted it up a few times and it seems to hold the weight okay.  It folds up flat in case you're not using it.  Has a paper-like quality but a bit more sturdy than you would expect. The cooler bag is a bit smaller than I expected too but it can hold a few items.
B0048J036K|4|good
B000AM8C5I|4|Have used this product for decades and I believe that it works.
B00AESRR1I|5|My husband LOVES this holder, as it holds his 24 ounce thermos, AND he can set it any which way because of the two pivoting directions. After three years of rough riding on his ATV on our property we live on and smacking this yet again into an unforgiving tree, it finally snapped.  It held up well.  We're buying another one.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great size, comfortable in hand.  Massive improvement from the small digital one I had before.  Several characteristics that I didn't realize it had that I found great:<br />- outer casing is a flexible plastic; I was worried squeezing it might hurt, but the radiating edges flex<br />- release valve is very useful for releasing air after over-inflating, just press for desired duration, and release to get a new measurement<br />- gauge holds the last measurement after being removed from the tire, until the release valve is pressed<br />- pretty easy to position so that there's no air leakage when taking a measurement.
B001RB61LS|5|I received this yesterday and am happy with the quality of the this work. Thanks!
B00MWULLP4|5|I needed these clips when working on body parts.
B004PXAUGC|5|Great product and easy to install! Thumps up!
B00K17A2E6|1|The fuse shattered when I inserted it into the holder.  Piece of junk.
B000EALHHG|5|This is the best degreaser I've ever used.
B00F9RNIPI|5|Very nice jumper cables with soft pliable wire. Everything  about these jumper cables is top quality. They even fit in the cloth bag that they send with them. Being 4 gauge wire they will jump start my 440 cubic inch diesel motor if necessary. I say buy them, you will not be sorry.
B00F52X712|5|fits my 2013 versa
B000MVRTGK|4|Good quality
B00K8EXPA0|5|These installed in just a few minutes and work perfectly. There's no need to purchase more expensive lifters.
B004UMBIPU|4|Too expensive, but I think it worked. Needed two bottles for an SUV.
B008LMM8I6|5|Will probably go near my front door in a couple years when my daughter gets older.
B001FCG7XG|5|Excellent fit and good value. Block almost all light coming into the vehicle even on a bright sunny day, plus they offer complete privacy at night.
B00PXFPU5W|4|Clean cuts. High quality vinyl. Backing peeled off just right durring application. Use common sense... the sticker in the picture is way bigger than the 3 inch sticker being sold here. The picture is misleading, but 3 inches is in the listing.<br /><br />Price is higher than what i would expect, but not unfair.
B005345DBY|5|have purchased two of these they are the best on the market
B00NEFCSVW|3|Products are good.<br />However, no installation instructions now product descriptions were provided in the package.<br /><br />Seller should at least provide a simple write up of part description and what part of the car it is for.
B00PXC5PNC|3|Says MOPAR inside it. But no way is it a mopar product. The paint flaked off in 2 spots pretty easily and the fake bolt at the top did not fit flush to the cap. It still looks better than this stock opening though
B001EP0GMW|4|Works great as long as your installing it on a newer clean vehicle. Bought this for our 08 Town and Country Touring that has 90k. Install would have been a breeze if it was a new vehicle but putting it on my 90s 2008 was definitely not. A few of my bolts were pretty rusty. I ended up snapping off one. Also you need to remove a couple exhaust hangers to get tone side as noted in the instructions. I ended up snapping one of those bolts as well. I now need to take it in to get both bolts removed so the hitch is secure and also so my exhaust isn't banging around into the hitch. If you have a higher mileage, slightly older vehicle, I would recommend paying to have a business install it. If your vehicle is newer with low miles, install should be a cake walk.
B0083G3AXC|5|fits gravity chairs good. handy to put drinks, food, smokes, whatever you need to have beside you.
B00HVHKB8G|5|I bought this to protect my Outback remote key, as I have a bad habit of dropping it, and I don't want to damage the electronics or the case.  Interestingly, because of the silicone texture of the cover, I haven't dropped my keys since putting it on my key.  So, it's served it's purpose.
B011Q18D14|5|Just tested it, and it worked on the first try simply plug and play and follow the prompts on screen. It works just like a $500 unit would work. Must have for DIYers. Extremely fast shipping and quality product.<br /><br />Pros: No need to wait in line and rely on &#34;monkeys&#34;<br /><br />Cons: You may occasionally drive to the Zoo to see monkeys if you have &#34;monkey&#34; obsession.
B00QU6VDZY|5|Fit perfect and in great shape when arrive
B00RELRAEM|5|personalized my car very well
B0085IJVBI|5|This is just perfect.
B00B5ZY07I|1|Wrong size.
B002UKYKIG|5|Now my car is a good conversation starter to people who aren't familiar with the saying! Lol
B0000AY3X0|2|Rag can't go through car it stays.....
B00RW7X1QE|5|very cheap, Overall a great product for its price.
B00029KC2A|1|does not hold up heat..i will never pay or recommend this product
B00Y17ASEG|3|Very nice product.  The welds could be better and packaging definitely needs looked into.  Light tab on bull bar was bent down from shipping and D-Ring mounts' paint were rubbed off also.  Overall, for the price I would definitely buy this bumper again. Uninstall of Stock Bumper and Install of New took 45min.  Wiring Harness will need to be spliced or extended to hook up the fog lights since they are now moved out. Update - I have had to removendure the bumper and sanded it down. It starTed rusting and flaking pretty bad.
B00B1K8YO2|5|Great tires!
B00U5OKH22|5|Exactly what I expectes
B010MXGTUE|5|Vote for Trump!
B00C813OPM|5|I used these to update my 03 excursion to the 05-07 front end and they work flawlessly. One of the clips was a little tough to get to engage but other than that no issues at all.
B00H7HD9VQ|1|Didn't really fit my Malibu. Seats tear really bad as well. Bought this in August and the two front seats are ripped. Not to happy with this product
B000CQOIV4|5|Much easier to get my hitch balls on and off with this wrench than an adjustable wrench.  Main reason is the extra length in this handle compared to my adjustable wrench.
B00KOU2UYU|5|Bought this kit for my 2011 silverado. Leveled the front end just like it was supposed to, the spacers seem to be made of good material, installation was less than one hour with a helper, didnt need to grind bolts and delivery was ahead of time. I highly recommend this product.
B007XZJTWK|4|Thanks solved another issue on my wife's Toyota.
B00QMVKIEO|5|It was a lot easier to put on than i was expecting, just make sure you have a razor blade on hand. I put it on my impala SS and it looks great.
B005MZVLBA|1|Put it on my car on July 15th, removed it from my car on August 3rd as it had faded so badly. I would have given it zero stars if it was available.
B00Y5HKZH2|5|Came on time and are better than expected,colors are really great.
B002IATXS0|5|I bought this to address the TPS error on my 2007 Acura TL and it fit like OEM and took care of the issue. No more TPS error or surging.
B00436O8BO|1|Well, I took the chance and was disappointed. The product appeared to be built pretty solid, but after removing the old parts and trying to replace it with this part, to my horror the mounting holes were too small. The stock bolts would not fit. I could have just drilled out the holes to fit the bolts but I did not have the correct bit size. I contacted the seller for a full refund as I don't want to deal with another unit that may be defective. I decided to spend the money and just order factory parts. BIG difference in price (cheapest online price is $197). For those who plan on purchasing and taking the chance, good luck.  I'm sure they're a good co and make good parts but their QC needs fine tuning. I'm awaiting a full refund for this unit and hope they're responsive.<br /><br />UPDATE - I was contacted and provided with a return label. I would be happy to give another of their mounts another chance considering how responsive they are but I don't have the time to drill it out, file it down, or whatever others did to get it to fit. Perhaps on my next set, I'll be a little more patient and reconsider buying it again - hopefully they work out some QC issues by then. With that said, thanks Motorking for your excellent service!
B000BUU5Z4|5|I love the fact that the water drips off the brush and onto the sink top, I hate when water collects in the bottom of the tooth brush holders and gets disgusting.  Also the little shield keeps the brush clean of dust.
B004NFXA7I|3|I dont know if i put it on wrong or if i'm just used to rain-x.  I followed instructions and it just doesnt repel like rain-x.  I'll try again since they give you plenty, if it works better I'll update my rating.
B00ANZHG7C|3|good product
B00UADG1WI|5|Perfect fit and delivery was as advertised.
B00UJ62GU2|5|Great little product. Does many of the functions that the much more expensive items in this class do. Definitely would recommend it.
B0083H5QPG|4|Fixed my problem
B000ENOPO0|2|Tube inner diameter is too large for filling through presta valve stems.  You will need to wrap the stem in tape or something to make it a bit thicker if you want to slime presta tubes.
B00Q4V568U|5|Bookoo laughs
B00LUS5DNU|5|works great
B004GDD4XW|2|Bolt holes do not line up like they should on frame or bumper
B000IDUW5C|4|I bought a yellow two-pack.  One fires, one does not.  Amazon has a great return policy, so I am replacing the one that wont fire.  It is a smart design, much smaller and lighter than I imagined.  It is only slightly bigger than my car's key/remote.  I prefer to keep it in the center console, and the bright yellow makes it easy to find.
B00WW0B9JM|4|Doesn't get much better for the price! Will be ordering again.
B0002M9UUW|1|Have to edit my review, this bulb lasted less than a month before burning out.  Worked perfectly in my 2002 Toyota Sienna. Nice and bright. What else can I really say, its a light bulb.
B00IE3Z4DS|5|Perfect, very stout I recently lost my flimsy plastic one.
B00B9F0ON8|4|The bumper itself is ideal for the job. Unfortunately, it received two gouges at the bottom during shipping and, given the size of the product, I chose to keep the bumber rather than ship it back.
B002FY3ZGA|5|Fit perfect. Gonna buy another set for my other truck
B00NLR3D9O|5|Best helmet I have ever had. Comfort,  safe and has terrific features.
B004OFNJZ0|5|Works great!!!!
B001LHVOVK|3|Gives a very basic diagnostic reading of your CEL light.  It would give you a code such as P0770.  Then you can use the booklet or the internet to search what the code means. But even then, a single code is up for interpretation.  If you're a car buff, this is a good cheap tool to help figure out what the problem may be but if you're the average person who has a car, this won't help much.  Some codes are more easily identifiable than others.
B00CO850WY|4|It looks great on my truck but I had to take a grinder and cut a notch in it to make it fit properly,for me no problem but for some people this would have been a real issue
B006BBHEJW|5|This smells awesome and was easy to put in place...just slipped it under my drivers seat and everytime I get in the car I take deep breathes so I can enjoy it.
B007TYD3RM|5|Good
B00BITKIOA|4|Perfect OEM fit on my 2008 Toyota Sienna.
B003XWB7UE|4|The mat definitely made a big difference when unloading.  Much easier!!
B001RITO1A|1|doesn,t work bought one from walmart and it worked perfect
B00F8O9ESC|5|Excellent product! Works as listed and looks great too.
B00HV1VDY8|5|great looking
B000N9PVMU|5|A
B00KN6L8G6|5|This product works wonders. Installed it on my 03 rsx type S. Gives your car that clean look and it helps you by giving you more light when reversing. I got the product on time and I would recommend this product to anyone needing more light when reversing.
B00QNUO7FK|5|I've used these a few times now.  They absorb and retain the water well.  Good product and price.
B000C13Q6W|5|nice, perfect fit.
B00C5T2BPG|5|An incredible Jeep accessory when you don't want to you bolt on a big cage or you don't want to spend the money on one.  I used it for two kayaks with 4 J-hooks and it was great.  WAY more solid than I could ever have imagined.
B00FKOIY2C|5|Excellent product, it was according my expectations.
B00GBVHPNW|4|This wouldn't last me a month based on how it reacted to me on the first day of usage.
B002M27D4K|4|Fantastic product...i put it in right away and fan was working ....yea ac again!
B000IYYTP0|5|Worked as described
B005XDOV9A|5|everything was great
B0051MYLS4|1|Falls apart after one use.
B00IER05ZG|5|Great product. The interior of my Dodge Challenger now looks much better and the light is enough to see things at night.
B00069CN2I|5|Very easy to install and work great on my 2005 Avalanche.
B004VRO19Y|5|What we needed
B00OBZ9H4A|5|Had some challenges receiving the original item, but EmpireTactical went above and beyond to resolve the issue.  Great customer service.
B0089GM56E|5|Bought this bag at cycle gear.  Works great on my 636.  A lot of storage space, magnets are strong, and does not cause damage to my paint.  Also the clear front map pocket works great to hold my phone and garage door remote.  Would definitely recommend for a sport bike especially 636 bc it only needs have the tank to stay on strong.
B0040CTTH4|5|works well
B004A6I9OY|5|Good product and good price
B00OZVCTZ4|5|Just as described looks great in wife new mustang
B00G6ITARY|1|Was'nt the correct color
B00DJ688VU|4|So I started this nice long review under the &#34;Valspar light gray garage floor coating kit&#34; this is the rest of the review detailing the clear coat.<br /><br />So I put down the gray valspar garage floor coating and it went perfect.  I let it sit for 72 hours then went for the clear coat.<br /><br />So I had a couple of issues with the clear coat.  Here is how it went down.<br /><br />It goes on identical to the gray floor coat.  Mix the 2 parts, stir for 3 min, let sit for 30, then stir again for 1 minute.  For the clear coat, during that 3 min stir I slowly worked in the anti-skid pack that was included.  Tried to mix it thoroughly so it didn't just sit at the bottom.  The clear coat felt MUCH thinner than the gray, and went on really fast.  I cut in and my wife rolled right behind me.  Its the exact some procedure as the grey coating.  My wife and kept thinking this stuff is REALLY thin but kept doing our thing.  I continued to mix this up as I was trying to keep the anti skid pack mixed in well.  We finish the first half and it looks just about perfect.  We start to work to the other side and you almost can't even see where you have rolled (it goes on like a whitish color typically).  Its even thinner and then is starting to get clumpy with all the anti skid at the bottom even though I have tried to keep mixing.  Things on that 2nd half just aren't looking right and so we call it a night.  Keep in mind I used just 1 can for a 2 car garage because it was so thin.  It actually picked up the gray color in a spot or 2 and that's what really made us stop!<br /><br />I came back the next morning and the 1st half of the garage is sexy.  Not slippery, nice high gloss sheen, really love it.  The other half isn't very shinny and you can kind of see some of the clumps from the anti skid.  I let it sit for 24 hours and pulled out a new can.  I resealed that one screwed up half and it looks WAY better.  Its about 97% there.  Only used about half of the gallon can foressential a 1 car garage.  There are a couple of spots right down the middle that aren't that perfect high gloss shine but it looks really good.<br /><br />My theory as to why the first gallon didn't work perfectly.  I think it got too hot.  It rode around in the amazon truck all day and as soon as he showed up I started working.  When I first picked up that can it felt warm to the touch.  I think this made the entire mixture thinner and thus the anti skid settled to the bottom more.  So rule of thump keep your paint inside, room temp before you paint with it.  Who's fault is it?  Not Valspar even though I knocked them down to a 4 star, I guess its mine but I had never done it before and didn't know.  Overall very satisfied.
B00P3SLXSM|1|Do not waste your time or money on this horrible product! It broke the first time using it with my 35 gallon tank! Of which was no more than half full. Clearly not suitable for its intended purpose. And being my tank was half full when it failed, just assume it will not work for any size tank.<br /><br />I cannot believe a company like Thetford would allow this product to be made available for sale. I thought they had better quality control. It is as if they never bothered to test it!<br /><br />If you did buy this product and it failed, or you have the tank and need a way to attach it to your hitch, I simp!y used a heavy duty binge cord. I wrapped it several times around the front handle of the tank and connected both ends of the cord. Then simp!y place it over the ball hitch. The binge with the carabiner works best. Until a better solution or product becomes available, this has been working g for me so far.
B006H34BUY|5|Love having this in the console for a quick spruce up  My car has never been to dust free before.
B00080QHMM|5|Works great , keep one in each vehicle. Easy to read and use
B00GDF3QZC|3|Worked great but $25 for what I got was a lot
B00NJRZ68M|5|I couldnt believe how accurate the paint matches the factory color. Easy to install and looks great!
B009ZG8NJ0|5|Great quality and makes the car look brand new!
B0041G3DIU|5|easy to install and really like not having to drill holes in original bed
B00YI3IGA6|3|This shade is a great concept but it's hard to see out of.  During the day it's pretty distorted when looking out of it. At night you can't see anything out of it. I had to just take it off because it creates such a big blind spot. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.
B00C4XFMO0|5|Did the job, back in the cool
B00O343D7G|5|Perfect fit.  Literally took a matter of minutes to install.  No water leaks since replacing.
B00BEN3BNU|1|This was the worst compressor I have EVER purchased. What a waste of money. I would recommend any other brand honestly. Viair is the way to go. I bought this compressor and it lasted 2 weeks then took a s***. Couldn't even get my money back after haggling with the manufacturer for over a month, they were also rude in responses, clearly no respect for their customers and no care for the quality of their products. DONT BUY.  Ridiculous!!!!!
B008J5H6I2|5|Arrived on time, I was leary if it work : but to my amazement it lowered the sound 5 decimals. Which makes sitting on my patio enjoyable.
B00S82LK3I|5|My dream cam thrue! This MICTING is perfect and complet connetion to my fog light(sienna 04). Auto shop ask for $200 to wiring to my upgrad fog light, I buy this MICTUNING and following diagram , I spend less than $30. Easy to install , but the black cable from on/off switch to battery is short about 2 Ft to the (-) battery.<br />Fast delivery, good product , good price and my upgrad fog ligth is work , help me driving at nigth!!
B00B5A6PCQ|3|I LOVE this jacket! It took me a long time to find it in this color as it's a 2013 model, so when I finally found it I was super happy. However, it took me more than 2 months to find the right size! Alpinestar really has its sizes wrong. I'm a US8, EUR40, and had to end up buying a EUR46! I had to find each size in a different website as the jacket is super hard to find in this color, so beware as Alpinestar sizes run REALLYYY SMALL!!!! Overall I'd give it 5 stars as it's beautiful, comfortable, and offers great protection, but it was a hassle to fine the right size.
B004ZF4MO6|4|Works great so far for the last couple of week. Only issue I had is one of the bulb has a bright define streak of light. Customer service was awesome as people said, sent a new bulb right away.
B00KWDTVSC|5|perfect.
B00V3PMH7A|5|Good lock. Better than others out there. Cheap padlock included defeats purpose. Use your own quality lock.
B00X35BYFY|4|Not as bright as I thought its about same brightness of my bright headlights but it looks great fit perfectly behind grille of my 06 silverado
B00079ZFL8|5|Looks great, very stylish. Good weight, lots of pockets. Highly recommend.
B00D7T4LX8|5|Daughter loves it!  Feels safer walking to car after work and not a problem with security.
B0055DMZ3W|5|Thank,s Great item
B000CIFVN6|4|It's a stick.....  it's a lubricant.  It's a stick lubricant.  I pretty much lubed up every moving object in my house.  Windows, doors, drawers, etc.  It works surprisingly good and since it's like using a Vaseline crayon you don't get any drippy mess like you would from WD-40.  I do recommend you wear some gloves though since your fingers will smell pretty bad all day and since it's water proof you won't be able to scrub it off.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product that covers all sorts of dashboard real-estate.  Stores easily and quickly, though you may have to get used to the folding technique.  But once you get it, setup and storage is done in under a few seconds.
B000NTKRSI|4|I purchased this for my SO, who needed the part for an old truck that he's just bought. The truck's original handle was missing the metallic circular top. He had a few problems figuring out how to properly remove the old and replace it this one but eventually managed to place it correctly.
B000TYOS3C|5|Got this item quickly, and it was just what I needed.
B007Y5W9RG|2|&#34;O&#34; ring on plunger too big. Would not seat and seal fuel passage. Took much time and several tries to determine problem. Had to remove &#34;O&#34; ring from old plunger and replace the one on new unit. Someone is asleep at the wheel manufacturing this turkey. Other components seem to be satisfactory. I would think this problem would have been caught long before the manufacturing stage as it is a CRITICAL component in the fuel delivery and SAFETY aspect of the fuel system!!
B0068N17QO|5|Boyfriend absolutely loves this, e said it was a nice quality especially for the price.
B001UCBMO0|5|This product is touted as such as the seller. It is top quality
B00S1NT2SE|5|Works as they should, easy to use.
B00BU618V8|1|Huge piece of crap. Visor clip that holds position broke the second time I opened it so it just flops around. Can't use helmet with visor down as there is no mouth cone or venting in the front to prevent fogging. Very surprised that they would give this a real snell rating based on the design and quality of the helmet. Guess you can't expect much for 150$ or whatever its worth. I probably wouldn't pay more than 20$ for this boat anchor in hindsight.
B00FH8P1DG|3|Was missing proper brackets and wiring system
B00RKXO43O|5|Works well, just what I ordered.
B0024NSMQA|4|They and look work great!
B00R5Q8CPW|5|excelente
B003E3OG4Q|5|Slow Ship but excellent product and price
B001M6VAHS|5|Just what I needed
B00UEC87QS|4|Very easy to install, have only had them on for a month or so, not sure how long they will hold up. They are just made of plastic and stick on with double sided tape. I bought them to give my radiator some extra protection. I read other reviews to be sure how to install them properly since they do not come with instructions.
B00FSBZT7A|5|Works just like it should.  EASY to pop out old and install.
B00JF5MXZQ|5|Works, fits like a charm. Thank you!
B00HK4G3ZU|5|Looks Good
B00RNIQQS2|2|Doesn't fit my 2012 GSXR 1000
B001T9HXY2|2|wrong part
B004ME11FS|5|Good price.  Quick delivery.
B007RGZHG2|3|quality is fine but did not fit and required a little modifications.  2005 XR 650r
B00684TD6O|5|Great deal on this item, instructions were easy to  understand helped every step to program! Awesome!
B0027Z6F3W|5|EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED
B00AIJY2ZM|5|So far so good, very bright let us wait and see the life span.  The cheap stuff in Ebay is not woth buying as they only last about 4-5 months.
B0011KZNW8|5|works great...
B0085UE1B6|4|Very good
B001C63ZZ8|5|Worked perfectly in my 2011 328i
B000UO7ACC|4|Wow... 2 day shipping with USPS! Cant go wrong with that, installed the pillar itself in less in 5 minutes, ***NOTE*** this does not replace the stock pillar, it goes over the stock pillar and then drilled into, none the less its not even noticeable and fits quite nicely.  I installed this in my 02 wrx, along with my gauge, (more on the way) and I absolutely love it, for 40$ as well? Cant beat it! Easiest way to get the pillar look at half the price as others. I've heard reviews that the sun will warp the ABS plastic used, UV protection as well as window tint will help not let that happen. Overall I am very impressed.
B000OZS9Y0|5|works great.
B00THR39SC|5|Excellent product fit and finish as described.  Installed easily in about 30 minutes.  Highly recommend.
B00ONH6BEA|1|I  34
B003SG431U|5|Love them!
B0026KP6GK|4|I loved the sticker, looks great
B00U6G8ICA|4|Using on 09 Canyon to haul kayaks. Received earlier than expected well packed in bubble wrap. Assembly was easy and hardware all available but used clamps and rubber matting to protect truck surface. Would have give 5 stars but coating scratches if pipes if bumped together or tapped with wrench, Still would buy again and recommend to others.
B00KTHZZ3Q|5|Shipped on time and works perfectly.
B00EAM6JKO|3|Pain in the dick to install that's the only reason I gave a 3 other than that it's fine
B007GR5DC0|5|Light is right!
B00K6PTNAC|5|Recently rescued a pup and like the car magnets to advertise how important adopting can be.  Hasn't faded or worn.  Doesn't fall off.  I ordered four other magnets at the same time and all have been a great product.
B0049Z3GRQ|4|No issues. Item was as described.
B00FDQPCR2|5|we bought two for our barn. Great lighting. Solar power works great and the output is great. Very easy to use. The motion sensor works great with no problems. Follow instructions. Easy install.
B00XU374D0|5|It is very cute and my 4 year old LOVEs it. However, it is a tad small for my 2015 Honda Accord. It still stays up with the visors down but it doesn't completely cover the whole windshield. Sun comes in from the corners of the windshield. Regardless, I like it and I'd buy it again.
B00HS5RT4A|4|I've only had them on the car for 4 days. The rotors made a big difference in the road noise, a quiet ride. The brakes are OK so far.<br />The garage that installed them said there was some difficulty in installing the back brakes. But an overall good fit.<br />Great price for the set!
B00IZNZOYQ|5|Works pretty good @ a very reasonble price.<br />We can save a lot by doing the service @ home.<br />Excellent delivery time.
B01180JE2A|1|Part does not seem to perform correctly. When installed check engine light came on and vehicle ran poorly. Had scanner run at auto repair shop and code called for MAF replacement . Put old MAF back in and engine light went out and CFM went back to normal range. Part looks good and exact fit for old one, but performance not good.
B003ZWEGD2|5|As described arrived on time
B00J52R3AE|4|Very happy! Worked right away and was shipped immediately.  Actually,  we received it one day ahead of time.
B0000AYFTV|5|plenty long enough and plugged right in.
B00I8IXV8Y|4|arrived as promised.
B00B0C1WKE|3|The finish isn't that great. Lots of bubbles and nicks and imperfections. Not even sure its powder coat.<br />The clips on the pads keep falling off.<br />And this is NOT for a GT. Is the V6 part. Has smaller rotors and different front caliper bracket. They're not very clear in the listing and Amazon says it &#34;will fit your 2006 Mustang&#34;. It fit, but is NOT the correct part for a GT.
B000VT59LU|5|PERFECT FIT
B002LNLXY6|4|Great, natural leather smell - reminiscent of a leathersmith's shop, or that great handmade leather belt.
B0055PD1H4|5|Great product! Used it on my 1999 Jeep Wrangler. I live in the northwest and I've had it on there for about 6months. Works great in rain, sun, mud and snow! Still looks brand new.. Ended up giving the rest of the bottle to my friend to do their jeep and they love it! Just follow instructions perfectly and it'll work.
B009DJSHSQ|5|Works good in my 94 Ford Ranger. Well packed, good price, fast shipping
B007ESJSIG|1|It didn't fit properly
B0082OYG3I|5|Love it.
B00B2HMFJ4|5|Perfect fit with my after market exhaust<br />2011 subaru sti sedan with q300 exhaust for the mufflers to mid pipe
B0040TE3XW|5|Love it!
B0022ZRKNG|5|PERFECT
B00W4B4UQS|5|Excelent
B008G27ECG|5|After ten years of use and abuse, I finally replaced my 2005 T&C LX's headlights with these. They look and feel like the orginals, and supposedly are built to the same spec. Hopefully a little better, since the plastic on the old ones had fogged pretty badly, and had been filling up with condensation for the past 2-3 years. If not for the weathered paint job on the front of the car, it would look like new now. Headlights and high-beams work, as to the blinkers. All bulbs are included.<br /><br />Even better, the swap out was very easy. Using a flat head bit on my drill, I loosened the 3 screw bolts holding the old headlights in, pulled them out, detatched the 2 wires and the little plug that holds the wires in place, and swapped in the new headlight. Repeat the process on the other side. Overall, total work time was probably about 10 minutes. And for about half the cost of new lights from Chrysler, I consider these a bargain. I just hope they hold up for at least five year, which is about how long we plan on keeping the family transport.<br /><br />~ Kort
B00J5SYPEA|3|There okay for a old 97 camry  quality is fair!.
B000F09CEA|5|Driveway mechanic.It's about twice as expensive as PB Blaster, which has been my go-to penetrating oil for the past few years. Years ago, it was Liquid Wrench and CRC. This weekend, I replaced front shock absorbers and flushed the brake lines in an 02 Jeep. The shocks were original equipment and the car has 155K miles on it. So... they were rusted on. I don't know when the calipers were last replaced, but the bleeder bolts were almost welded on - if you've ever tried to remove a stuck bleeder bolt without help, you usually end up breaking the bleeder off. Not the end of the world, but still a PITA.<br /><br />I didn't perform an experiment to compare, I just used my experience with fasteners that have rusted with heat into place. I used this Aero Kroil (which is a silly name), and I have to say, the bleeder bolts gave me less trouble than I would have expected with PB Blaster, given the amount of time it was applied to the bleeders. The shocks came off like butter.<br /><br />In summary, I became a convert. I hear ATF and Acetone (50/50 home made mix) works as well, and it's cheap. But I'll tell ya, I was impressed. Your mileage may vary...
B00L51ZPCQ|5|Always on point with the lights I get from these guys
B00EFRZ88I|5|100K is a metric century for cyclists.<br />Funny, many thing I've ran a 100 miles! Or even biked it (that is a century).<br />This sticker is a medal to my first (not last) 62.1 mile ride...
B00MF2830U|3|Everything is pretty much as advertised with one exception. In direct sunlight they are functionally invisible. Nice in the evening and at night, but driving during the day with them is risky. I'll be replacing them and maybe using them as bug resistant porch lights on my solar cabin in the woods.
B0031BSFU2|5|works like a champ. no complaints. had it over a year now.
B00A66GYDA|5|Worked as posted
B00AHJZBCG|4|Works great except the first one arrived DOA. Amazon replaced rapidly. May want to handle with care despite the rugged appearance.
B005ASY23I|5|Great product!
B00OQSBQEG|2|Ordered a pink sticker with white letters but received a white sticker with black letters.  I've had it on my vehicle for about 6-7 months now and it's still holding strong.
B002OPWOQM|5|Works and looks great!
B001PYG9I2|5|This is working great on my son's Kia Sportage. Found it here and saved a lot of money.
B0002NYDRG|5|Worked Perfect
B004GCQPYI|5|Excellent fit, well made, works perfectly. A much better deal than Acura at 1/3 the cost.
B00J8WJT1C|5|Good quality.
B000BZEILQ|1|Bosch junk, should've bought a Denso.  The product failed within 2 weeks, but outside my 30 day return window.
B008WA7E36|5|Air is really cold
B001T8OGI4|5|Loved it
B001KO38C2|4|perfect fit
B000BUU5WW|4|Works well. A good product. The only problem is that the orange handle does not work. You can't pick up the unit with the handle. I know that CAMCO can do a better handle.
B009AD9J00|5|LOVE
B000IE0F12|2|I purchased two of these. One for myself and one for my husband. I love the idea of having these on my key chain for emergencies. I like all the color choices but the product is not built well. We tested one of them out and it didn't work. In the process of testing it a wire poked out and punctured my finger. I would not recommend purchasing this brand. It is not reliable and when in an emergency I want my emergency car escape tool to work.
B000GKD5NI|2|The previous reports of the suction cups being subpar are on point. The suction cups do not work at all, no matter how clean your glass is. Other than that it does work at cutting down glare, I just had to find another way to attach it. Also, I have a 2014 Jetta TDI and this shade is significantly smaller than my rear window. Would recommend getting another one if you have a similarly sized rear window.
B000CONUEC|5|This is the best product out there. Have now bought sets for all my vehicles and trailers. Buy the extra keys.
B01092I9LA|3|It looks good on the front but on the back, the video didn't show one for a split bench seat. The back rest is split and the cover for the middle headrest is too big. They didn't check how the headrest looks like. Besides that problem, I like it.
B00AUFMGBG|5|Received an installed, we are very happy these items.  They fit inside the window channel and look like OEM.
B00CXGQKE4|4|worked great for the kids
B009OBVS20|5|this with the DA power system removed the oxidation on the paint and restored  the shine on a 14 year old car
B00K72C1T4|4|A nice  little unit for me. Two notes, from battery clips to outlet plug its quite a bit shorter than my NOCO Genius charger and this unit seems to<br />go back and forth from charging to charged (red light/green light),where my other charger stays green once charged. With that being said it still<br />does the job at a good price.
B002JH469I|5|Great product
B000C19DL4|4|Works very well. I would suggest taking off inside panel the tailgate for best fit.
B005N6Z4ZM|3|Quality was fine. However the 3XL I purchased fit me like XL. Would purchase at least 2 sizes above what fits you.
B00L4G67TC|5|Fit on my ex500, were easy to mount, and make checking, and filling, the tires so much easier.
B003BZINKU|5|Good
B0085KGOH0|5|This was a great buy.  We are very pleased with product.
B001BXKWE4|5|Great and reliable product!
B009V04CEK|5|Awezome
B00U3CS4CQ|5|These look great on my yellow 2015 Wrangler Sport. Really kicks up the front end looks of my Jeep a whole bunch.
B0051MYLS4|3|ok item to buy with great shipping.
B001O0A668|5|Perfect
B00IO4EYMY|5|its freon?
B002P8P5O6|5|My son said a garbage can &#34;blew into the street&#34; one a windless day this past winter, and tore the mirror off the door. I bought this, and two days later we replaced it in 20 minutes. Was a perfect replacement, and stopped the shaking issue from vibrations the previous mirror had.
B004LWVEKS|5|Great charge, charged up my bike from almost dead to fully charge in about an hour.
B000EQR7XS|5|Same as factory.  Works great!
B000I2SWXC|5|Great I love it
B007L79EXY|3|great sticker just took a long time to get here
B00IKSRTBM|5|Easy to install. Very bright
B008TTD1AU|4|A little tight in the temples, but they keep the dust out well!  As a rigid contact lens wearer, the smallest speck of dust can be quit and irritation, so to ride a bike or work in my shop, this type of protection is imperative!  I think you will be pleased with the blue blocking ability and clarity of vision, as well as the protection you receive!
B00GWFKT26|5|These liners are amazing.  They fit perfectly and cover all the pesky nooks and crannies that dirt was like to fall into before they were installed.  Highly recommended!
B009DJY6UY|5|Great fit, same brand part I would get at the local aftermarket parts dealer, but for about a third the cost. And it gets delivered free, can't beat that.
B0024ECHXI|5|Works like it said. Very stable.
B00T4POQCA|5|as described
B0006IX87S|5|Works great.
B0002L6SHG|5|Excellent product.  Fantastic customer service.  I wish more companies took care of business like HeatShield.  I had to contact them once and my issue was promptly resolved in the manner you'd expect from a quality business.  I've been through many different types of windshield covers but after buying my first Heatshield, I now have one for 3 of my vehicles.  They are a little more in price than the corner store special's, but they do a 500% better job.
B00XO0NTYM|1|tried to put on my rear window and the letters stretched to the point where they were unrecognizable. could not put it back in a return box because they were destroyed upon attempt to place on my truck. really wanted the sticker, but it just had too much adhesive sticking the letters to the backing. waste of money that i can never get back.
B001JT3DYQ|5|Works well for a small speaker. We can here the radio loud and clear over the machine noise.
B00DX8AA74|5|Great fit, very happy with AVON brand grips.  Good price for the grips with the Excalibur end caps.  Last grips lasted 0ver 12K miles, hope these do the same!
B0087NB088|5|This gadget will make ur motorcycle ride 10 times more fun.......as if that wasn't  impossible already.
B003RVKZK4|4|They replaced the non working orginal perfect,directions were simple and it works perfect
B00DGXCDNU|5|I guess I have to love it since it cost so much money! I have to admit the simple &#34;powered by&#34; part really makes it look cool. The screw caps are really useful to give it a clean look.
B0000AY3TA|4|it worked
B003UT3S6Q|5|This stuff works very well
B005DUNK2W|5|So far. So good. I have had these for a couple of weeks. Install was easy. Great look. 2011 Tundra. I changed the interior overhead lights, the rear cargo , third brake light and the license tag lights. All seem to be doing well. As mentioned in an earlier review, the single small bulb that comes with the package, will not fit in the socket under the dash, at the light near the emergency brake. At least mine did not. All in all, good deal.
B00B1KZ8UU|4|works well, lots of torque.
B001OCXHZS|5|Wonderful fit for the truck, Love it.
B00FRHOO9O|4|Easy to install and work very well.
B00YB5GAEA|3|Great solid design but not as brite as Planet Bike Superflash Turbo.
B005HAYDR4|5|These handles have held up very well.  I didn't expect much being they aren't a necessary part of a vehicle, but after installing them I realized how much I actually used them! (Which is a lot)  The only thing that is a minor inconvenience is the Velcro strap lengths.  In my experience they were more than enough in length but no problem. I would definitely recommend these to Jeep owners!
B00VGL7I0W|5|Fits as described. Plus $10 cheaper than buying local.
B000NCOKZQ|5|A+
B000VNQIYS|4|Great!
B0021I2CPU|3|Holes didn't line up and one side takes just a nut that wasn't provided not ver happy should of took 10 min instead it took an hour
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great, and easily folds up for easy storage.
B0006SU3QW|4|Good stuff
B004SRBXJ8|5|Everything about this exhaust manifold is better that the OEM and I couldn't be happier. Plus it saved me hundreds compared to what the dealership wanted. With that said, the installation was a pretty major undertaking, so be patient depending on your skill-set and tools available to you.
B00FEAOF2K|5|Great product, size chart worked! And it's really good
B007DJHKEA|5|Perfect fit . Work good
B00CASDZKC|5|Though we've only lodged a few kicks on these mats thus far, they seem to be sturdy, well-constructed and easy to wipe off.  They also fit very well to the back of our (SUV) seats, with few gaps for muddy feet to exploit.  All in all, very happy with this purchase!
B0041RPGQ6|5|Amazing!  I bought this item for a colleague who is always cold.  Between the heat and the massage feature, she was in heaven.  It's like a portable spa.  She had to fight her husband for dibs on it.
B003HB29AI|5|I'm very happy with my purchase. I got my item the next business day through SurePost. The wheel covers are gorgeous.
B000A09MOU|4|These FRAM air filters are very well made, are an excellent fit for my air intake unit, are long life and reusable units, and will undoubtedly do a very good job.  For an installation guide I refer to my 2004 Jeep Wrangler two-door unlimited extended cab as the application.  However, what stops this filter from being excellent is that you need to purchase the FRAM air filter oil with the filter because this panel filter require that you spray (lightly) each of the groves on both sides with this lightweight oil and let it sit for twenty (20) minutes before reinstalling the air filter.  If you do not have or cannot gain easy access to this type of oil your garage change operation comes to a sudden and speedy stop.
B004INGZR2|5|works well
B005KLPS9W|5|Works great
B00CYV1XSG|5|Work great for the price awesome product make sure it fits your car! Nice camber on it!
B00SBZRR8O|5|Works beautifully
B008YFT7XE|3|This are not that bright kind of hard to see at night and they are easy to install
B002UM73GA|5|FAST SERVICE, GOOD PRODUCT
B007RW3KJM|3|Worked Great!!! Fast to change. Loved the price.
B00H6ETIWY|4|The 4 stars, only, because it should have had a 1 5/8 adapter with it. It would only fit a 1 3/4 inch tubing.
B001GC6H3K|4|This will not fit a 2000 Ford Focus WAGON. Good product otherwise.
B003X9TLUK|4|Got here fast and was as expected.
B000C36C4I|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|I've had these bulbs for about a month and they are still going strong.  I drive a lot of miles every week, so these bulbs have been running for quite a while.  Also, it's been hovering around 100F the last couple of weeks, so there's no problem dealing with the heat.  I'm using these bulbs both in the trunk and in the license plate light holders.  The color is a cool white which looks good with my white plate and blue paint.  Photo shows the difference between the new bulb and the halogen original
B000JIA7TW|3|Did the job but the bolts were the wrong size and were not machined properly. Ended up going to a specialty bolt store to fix the issue. Also, a purely cosmetic issue, but the mounting plates on the outside always end up crooked. Just looks like bad work was done does not affect performance. Overall great hitch and got the job done.
B00068WNZG|4|best polish that I have found!
B000Q8B5UU|5|Fits perfectly in my 2008 chevy cobalt. A must-have for those of us with obnoxiously large cup holders! No more spills, no more holding on to drinks while making a simple turn.
B00L842NSY|4|good fit good price
B00803BKOO|5|Sick
B001J0FGVS|3|It is not as luxurious feel and look.
B0006H8BEY|5|👍🏻
B0101A0C38|5|Makes the point very clear.
B000BZL08A|5|It was as advertised & arrived on time......
B000C9WLA6|5|Always a great product
B0009VF1DQ|3|I love how well this dusts and shines up my dash, however I HATE the red lint it leaves behind. Because of this lint I find myself cleaning after I've already cleaned. What's the point?!
B005S59HQU|5|It was exactly what I needed.
B00CJFLOJU|5|1,000 miles later, so far so good
B00CIZ4TPM|5|Met all expectations.
B007USKLYU|4|Slow delivery. The tail had a hole inside that was easy to fix. I'm going to use the tail as a cat tail.
B00CMP7S9W|5|Use it for work as roadside service. So far it's started every car, have failed me once
B00T4USC4S|5|It really is bigger on the inside.
B00LAPV6W0|2|These pedal covers are extremely difficult to put on. I consider myself relatively handy, but they took me a while to get on securely.  You need to remove the gas pedal entirely to install the pedal cover (unless you want to drill in to the hinge and electronic housing) and the break pedal is even worse. I would say that the majority of the difficulty is with the pedal design, but these covers should come with a better trimmed fit, more appropriately sized screws and bolts, and better instructions/suggestions for installation.
B00PW2ZN44|5|awesome product
B00AEBALLS|4|Got them thanks
B00U9M1V5M|3|WHEN I READ CHROME-I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING CHROME. THESE ARE OKAY FOR THROW A WAYS BUT THEY ARE TOO PRICEY TO BE SO FLIMSY. I AM KEEPING THEM BUT THEY BETTER LAST SO I CAN UPGRADE MY REVIEW. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY WERE JUST LIGHT WEIGHT PLASTIC. The frames are really too small as they cover the Texas & 1/2 the star on lic plate. why is good enough-good enough? I consider these seconds.
B002TMYW38|5|Very nice
B004VNJXNW|1|Only reason I give it. 1 star is that it's so blurry you can't make out what it is. It is only a couple inches by a couple inches so being that small you can't identify what it is or says. If you want one I suggest going bigger and maybe it'll be more legible.
B00L6FWK0G|5|Great dress up on cayman s wheels.<br />Made in Italy. Wow.
B001KO2P7G|5|Worked great and fit like the parts should. Love K&L.
B00K889FCI|5|works great
B0000CBILL|4|TOUGH CLUB!
B005FRHHRM|2|did not fit properly returned
B00WL4KV0W|4|Can't u make the juke Nissan all black not pink
B006PI0KK6|5|Fits perfect and easy to clean
B000C9TD2U|5|Filter appears to be of the same quality as the Motorcraft filter it's replacing. It was easy to install, and all the parts fit nicely.<br />2004 4x2 ranger edge.
B009CI3G8E|5|Fits good
B00L5NXPYY|5|Quick-n-EZ.  As promised.
B002EQQ5ZW|5|Worked fine.<br /><br />I needed an adapter with a flare fitting to connect to my AC manifold gauge set, but that came with the set.  Otherwise it connected to the can of R134a just fine.
B008539UTG|5|Awesome look and fast shipping!
B00076RL5Y|5|works great I use this for a light duty snow plow in the winter all holes aligned perfectly.
B00V5NEQAG|5|They work an show really good in the day as well as night
B00KME2I90|5|Great
B00UL3HR8O|5|GOOFIT Left Brake Lever Handle is perfect product for any scooter or ATV.I had a problem with mine which was so loose and hard to grim on but i finally solved the problem with this.Even you can fix it yourself.You won't regret buying this from such a wonderful seller.
B000ALG86E|5|excellent
B00O92ISFE|5|Job at what I needed for my 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse. Can always count on Genuine MITSUBISHI parts
B003IS3HV0|5|Received this product at a reduced product for review. Product does a good job of protecting and preserving new and older leather products.
B00B8T1150|3|Was purchased for a friend.  It was received timely.  She likes it.
B009R1EXWE|4|Bought to use with the mesh organizer.  Ended up using the mesh organizer and this just took up space.  Maybe if I didn't have the mesh organizer I would use this more but for now it's being utilized in our supply closet where it does a great job of keeping small items together!!
B00U65S2OA|5|Would not have been able to do as nice a job without them. Really helped with a couple of tight areas.
B00XM7JBTO|5|Exactly as described. Fast Shipping. Thank you!
B001JT1IPM|4|It was larger than expected but for the price it is a good bag, The top handles are a bit awkward, they should have just stuck with the side handle which works well. Other than that I have no complaints.
B009Y0DP40|5|So far, so good.  Our old one developed a leak (the camper is only about 3-4 years old), so I hope this one will hold out well.  The problem with the leak on the exterior shower was that it was also dripping on the inside, under the sink, where it potentially could have caused a bigger problem.  I'll update if I encounter any problems, but fingers crossed, it will hold out!
B009FUF6DM|4|They work just as expected; not better nor worse.
B000GU5PGI|5|nice deal
B00COGK3O6|5|Great stuff sealed the leaks very well
B000IZ3K4U|5|Fantastic!!!!!
B00BCRM9RM|2|I rarely have anything bad to say about a product and I feel terrible giving a low rating but this product was incredibly disappointing. The smell was noxious and immediately filled the whole house after we started taking the items from the bag. The covers were very pretty but are very cheaply made with a thin stretchy material over a very flimsy and very thin foam backing. As I picked up one of the pieces I felt as if though I would rip the foam wroth the slightest movement of my hands.  I love that it comes with a backseat cover and separate head rest covers. The steering wheel cover is pretty hefty suprisingly. I am used to getting my orders in 2 days because I am a Prime Customer and I didn't like waiting to receive my shipment, lol. My package was delivered no problem in the time estimated and it probably still would have been used even though it wouldn't have lasted long due to the quality. I will be returning it because the smell never faded even after airing it out outside like I expected it would.
B000IZ9T4U|5|This was the solution to my heating and cooling issues in my Explorer.  It's a perfect fit, but a pain to install--find someone with small hands to help you install it!
B00823FSRC|5|Nice wheels for moving my kayak.  Well made and folds compactly enough to fit into the kayak hatch opening after removing the wheels.
B00CWJYFSK|5|This has to be the bargain of all time. Fits perfectly, great price and looks great.
B000WJA7KW|5|Looks cheap but sounds amazing. Defiantly will feel and hear the difference between the stock exhaust and this one. Perfect!!!! 🍻
B000C57YVG|5|Exactly as described!
B001RLS1O8|5|They're great, just the power needed.
B00ATGRJ9K|5|Use this everyday in our pool. Love it!
B009DJW8NQ|2|when I took the wrapper off  bumper had a crack in it I just felt it was little to much to send back that was the first bad thing I ever receive from y'all
B002Y107A6|5|Looks great. Need to take your time to install
B00LMMXJ7G|5|Glad they started making this again. Used it on frame for a Chevelle. Sheen looks perfect. Covered well and no mixing.
B00496F0HY|5|good quality
B0033YHGVG|5|Works great, perfect fit for 06 Escape
B00SS4868I|5|It's a sticker with a good message.
B00RCQAQUO|5|Great
B002TTU96A|5|The mount worked flawlessly on a two week backcountry motorcycle trip. Held my 2 gallon RotoPax firmly in place with no issues at all over some very rough terrain.
B00KL51814|5|as described and works well
B0053ZJ846|5|How can you not love &#34;The Donald&#34; /
B006CN9FNM|5|Quick and easy.  Had all that I needed to do the job.
B00ANZHG7C|5|Love them !!!
B00480J4JG|5|I decided to get a known brand rather than risk a cheaper no-name bulb.  $40 was MUCH better than $100 for Sylvanias.  They work. No complaints.
B0031H2KFM|5|Compliments the Mobile 1 Oil.
B002R12LEI|5|As described and fast shipping.
B00C6N8E16|5|Absolutely love this and the size. The Delta sign and &#34;Z&#34; are separated so I put them on either side of the Apple on my Macbook and it looks very cute!
B007F1FMIC|5|Very handy and for the price you can't beat it. Went to my local headshop and they wanted 22$!!
B0070Y35OC|4|I received the shipping very quickly.<br />The film was well cut, still needs minor trim.<br />I was not able to put the rear window piece, after a couple trial, I gave up.<br />Such windows tinting really needs professional to install, I am not.
B00B62PBKK|5|Product was perfect fit and works great!
B00N6D7K38|5|Easy install and great upgrade to my day light bulbs
B00O1C2L7S|2|Did not work for me, terrible instructions/support. I went Mikuni and cut their kit to length.
B0002SRGXY|5|super beef, Made in the USA (the main part at least) worked great for some super duty Dana 60 BJs.
B001R9UTJ0|5|Comfortable and easier to tie than a bandanna!
B00U7XT1C8|3|The item serves its purpose but the material is not of good quality since it cracks so easily. When I got my first order it came with a crack so I have returned them and ordered a replacement which arrives after 2 days. I had only used them for a few days and saw there was a cracked at the side.  I was so careful in using them but the material is so fragile. I'll keep them anyway.
B00I9SK8WK|5|Works exactly as described. I'm using it to coat the tips of my USB devices!
B00D3QZTD6|5|Perfect
B00MB0EDTG|4|Cheap means be careful.<br /><br />Mostly because you will destroy it first trying to hurrying to install it.. Just pretend like you're dressing up an infant.
B0024E6V30|5|great price bought for camper work great
B0002T8FIS|1|Dissatisfied with product . . I have been using this for  more than twenty five years. And seems that this has been diluted by 50% .
B0085IJCIK|5|used it for camper wors great no swaying now
B00S8PRHFK|4|Perfect
B009S2YXTK|3|did not come with power cord as shown. having hard time finding plug for this
B000KVZZ3G|5|Fits good, installs fast, great look. Holds the cd's well enough. The pouches are a little deeper than I'd wish since I don't have small fingers to pull the edge of the cd's out. Workable though.
B005H5XTRY|5|comfotable
B003XVGEDK|5|works great
B007HA7RF2|5|Perfect fit on my Kohler engine works great and considerably less expensive than om I would recommend this product
B007Z09GCQ|5|worded great fast shipping
B00GA704W6|5|excelent replacement ,fast delivery .can't complain on anything
B00JFWKM2K|4|Just used it for first time this past weekend.  Took a couple of minutes to run tests so don't plug in until blue light shows it is ready.  No issues with the hookup so all went well.
B006B27GGM|4|Descent Rotors for a really good price!
B0029818Q6|1|Color is NOT BLACK!  Once clear-coated with Dupli-Color Paint Shop Finish Clear, color is a very dark gray - especially in bright sunlight.  Primer, base, and clear were applied &#34;by the book&#34; per can instructions.  If you want true black, this will not meet your expectations.  I gambled and lost on this one.
B00FKFNWLY|5|stisfied
B00GSAUHB8|2|Doesn't keep my car cool at all.
B0094MF3F2|5|Loved the stickers..it comes with two sheets that contain 2 stickers each....i put a couple on my car and even threw one on my macbook..they look great!
B004VRLGU6|5|I get compliments on this scent all the time.  One of my favorites.
B00TDCN4B8|5|Excellent product
B000CIXMM8|5|Loved it fixed the wife's Jimmy in a matter of min
B00LHUI4XM|5|I'm very pleased with the product and especially pleased with the customer service. An email with important tips arrived hours before the package from Amazon. Installing was a breeze. I also really like the shape of the frame because my tags and county ID are much more visible than they were using previous frames from car dealers. If the frame holds up as advertised, it's definitely worth the money. If it doesn't, the manufacturer's replacement policy seems solid.
B00F9G8E6C|5|Nice and light wish I bought the 5 footer.
B00GSWYU4G|3|Although it was compatible, some components were different.  Most of what I needed was there.
B003N9MQCK|5|well insulated
B002LF434G|4|The part went on easily just as advertised.
B000F5LIW4|5|Yeah, 5 stars. This unit is well made and worth the $$. Used it on a Jeep 4.0 this weekend to pull and install. Worked flawlessly. Always wanted one and glad I did not get the loaner from the local auto parts store as those tend to be beat up and with fewer covered models.
B00REUUO3C|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B000FPYF6U|2|Purchased to replace the original seal in a brand new Rugged Ridge slip yoke eliminator kit on my '00 Jeep Cherokee. The original factory installed seal leaked so bad that anything from the output shaft back was literally dripping in transfer case fluid. I called Rugged Ridge and was sent a new housing with a new seal installed, but that still leaked. I pulled that seal out and put in this one, with a leak still!! Kudos to the customer service however, and it was a very pleasant experience and they were amazing help. I still have a leak, but no where near as bad as before. I'll live with this leak until I get my front driveline angles set and then swap in a National or Timken brand seal when I do the driveline work.
B003YMRNVA|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00CZG1ZRY|5|EZ-Pass Toll Tag Holder is very convenient for EZ-Pass presentation and interchange among vehicles.  Good value.
B000C1LLCS|5|perfect OEM replacement pads at low cost.
B0009IK6IY|5|Part worked and that is what counts.
B00BTJJKOS|5|So glad we bought the led lights to replace the bulbs in the small side wall lights we have in the RV. Just as much light, does not use as much battery power and so much cooler if you touch the shade or light. Parts came quickly and had bubble wrap around them.
B00ARUSHYO|4|Very high quality
B00C0WQYCO|5|As advertised. New color very similar to the green pads.
B0088CNNGK|5|Great Product
B00FB0V2M4|2|Great top. Great price, this was when i first installed the top,<br />Now 2 years later the top sags so bad that it is unusable<br />I have asked to return it for a refund
B00515NICG|5|Work good so far, good price.

B00Y1HQ45I|5|Shipped fast and worked perfectly.
B007KPU5BC|5|NICE PERFECT FIT
B00WAORHVY|1|The vent visors did not fit very well and the double faced tape that is on the product don't hold up.  After spending more time to install them as it took from dealer purchased product for the exact vehicles owned before, they fell off after only 2 days.  will not purchase after market products again.
B000I1LJ4M|5|Works
B00KTIUM88|5|Works well and a Great alternative to paying $130 each at the dealer!
B009DIZKK0|5|thanks
B003VLBPJA|1|I cannot recommend this as the hooks are WAY TOO SMALL!!! The webbing is decent quality but the hooks are lightweight and too small.
B0031G8GME|5|Fast delivery. Relatively easy install once you figure out how the factory trim clips come off.
B00K1KBFP8|1|I am not happy it came to me spilled all over the package and bottle was not sealed properly!!!! Beware
B000V2W0GE|5|Works great.
B000VKOD9S|5|I do driveway maintenance on four Hondas in my family.  Just love the price and quality of TYC cabin air filters.
B009DJSFBA|5|Arrived quickly and as described!
B00CHDC2RW|5|beautiful, perfect fit to my 05 corolla ce
B00EQFOI58|4|The fit perfect on my 90.5 mm VW 1600 cc piston pins. Cannolt comment on legnevety as the engine has just been rebuilt. So cannot give a 5 until I see that they hold up to use. They better... a lot of engine damage if they fail.
B000JZGML2|5|The part works great and the shipping was quick.
B00BH0K67E|5|We love them.
B00HX1ZY7I|5|I received my key gloves for my 2012 lexus is250. Very impressed with the quality and craftsmanship ,also excellent fit.
B00QSI48TC|3|Rattles quite a bit and brackets need to be revped for better fit
B00YMT2BW0|1|Different than the image advertised - all you get is the angle bracket.  Now there is no image associated with the product listing at all.  Returning the item.
B00GR57N3E|5|Well made, colorful, nice product.
B00R587N4G|5|Seems like a sturdy decal that'll last a long time, easy to put on and timely delivery, great product!!!
B00ELHTE5A|5|Use in my HD and no worries
B00NHIV6DW|1|do not buy this part, it does not fit a 1987 Honda Magna 700 bike, then to top that off it costs $75.00 to return, it was only a 23.00 part.  Watch out for things sent from China, you can not return them
B00JH2GMMC|5|Fit right in like OEM part!
B000C3XDB8|5|I am able to use these for 2 vehicles, so it's convenient for ordering. They seem to perform well, no leaks. I find the molded nut at the top of the filter a very easy way to loosen the filter off. Works much better than the oil strap kind.
B000C0XF6E|1|Part did not fit my vehicle.  I had to cannibalize the part to help make something work.  I would not recommend ordering from this supplier.
B00AC83LAQ|5|The triangle shape makes this oil pan so much easier to empty oil out of it than the traditional round ones. Glad I ordered it!
B00KYB9ZC4|5|Very nice, fit mr pontiac vibe except a little off by the foot rest , quick delivery
B00ATRL64I|5|Great parts
B00SQ1K19A|3|Odor problem still exists, although somewhat abated. The odor problem could be a function of sustaining level of summer heat, 95+.
B000C7W054|5|Works as advertized
B000C9PY1E|5|Genuine Delco, USA made , great price!<br />1970 El Camino
B000V2R7KI|5|Delivered promptly and as expected!
B00GJKXW8M|4|This is a nice light and a great value. I bought the flood version and it definitely diffuses the very cool 6500 kelvin daylight color all around. My light does have a quality issue. It seems the front lense isn't sealed properly to the housing causing the whole reflector tray to be loose and vibrate. I only discovered this after installing it so I'm choosing to let it be. If you want a focused beam be sure to get the spot version.
B004BTAJ2A|5|Fits a little bit big on my 2010 Honda civic Ex just a little but I looks badass: )
B00V2TS4LK|1|This product does not fit
B007V2CGVG|5|I really can tell there's huge difference with and without this sunshade!!<br />It's far better with this than I expected.<br />Fits okay with my car, and it covers most area of windshield.<br />Highly recommend to anyone, who considering buy sunshade.
B00NW45C0E|5|Very high quality I love it! i chose to plastic dip mine and den attach them and they look great!!
B008Y9K0OU|5|Perfect match for the original.  Snapped into place with no problem and works perfectly.  I was very pleased.

B0074C6YES|5|Perfect and Fast shipping
B000BNFEKC|5|This cover is great.  Easy to setup, took about 5 min is all.  It is easy to take down too. This is great so far and would recommend it.
B008TW2C5C|5|Nice product. Excellent finish, light too. Fit perfectly on my 2015 Honda PCX150
B0044AVLF0|5|I've changed my oil on my 2003 Tacoma a couple times now with these filters. It's nice to spend a few more bucks and go OEM.<br /><br />Update: I've been using these for 5 years now. Great filter - never had any issues. Not only that, but I think they're half the price they used to be!
B00HVGG95Q|5|It was a gift to my husband and the first time he used he loved it and said it was a winner.  His truck seat had been uncomfortable before this.
B000HS1356|5|It's a fantastic cover, outstanding quality, fit's perfect. I'm glad I bought this cover and not a cheap one!!
B00829HBEE|5|Looks and works exactly like the original on my Tacoma pickup.
B00CSWMRVS|5|Perfect fit.
B001F02NCW|5|very nice it fit well!!
B009EVOWPA|5|This organizer is nothing fancy, but it is at least five times nicer than all of the other junky ones that cost half as much.  You might as well spend the extra money and get one that's made properly!  I installed this on my Vanagon camper.  Running a length of elastic shock cord beneath some holes in the seat frame gave the bottom clips something to hang on to.  It would be very easy to adapt to just about any car in a similar way, as long as it has a headrest to secure the upper strap.  Good quality, tidy appearance, no flashy graphics or colors, fair price.
B000GIVEII|5|Perfect fit.
B0080CDDO0|5|excellent replacement, excellent price.
B0018KVP4Q|5|Loved them
B00E7WEFQ2|1|Terrible , didn't even stick and fell off within two days 😒😒
B00CO9AQTK|5|On time shipment<br />Great price<br />Reliable parts<br />I'm very pleased n impress
B003WOZOUM|5|Used this on an 06' Camery from VA to South FL....worked out very well.  Straps stayed tight (only rained once) and the pack stayed in place.<br />Would recommend this item but definitely purchase the mat that goes in between the hood and the cargo pack!  (If using without roof racks)
B001467VFQ|5|Just as expected and great delivery timing.
B0054KSFI0|1|It broke in the first use. I dont recomend anyone to buy this.
B003CK0P4G|5|Great fit on my 93 Kawasaki ninja 500. Install was straightforward, slightly difficult to drive in, but that makes for a great seal! Would buy again.
B00510E3DY|3|They slip off of the car frequently
B003ZE32F8|5|As advertised.  Works well, is strong and perfect for my Jeep.
B00D329B8Y|3|Seller was absolutely wonderful!!!  Product is okay -- it is a heavy-duty set and seems to be holding up well.  I wish it had a little more coverage as far as width.  It doesn't cover as much in width as the old set.
B00XKN6O2M|5|Good strong tool, necessary on Toyota Rav4
B00ANR0L36|5|Very nice . Very useful when using easy pass to move between cars.
B00KZJQ2L2|3|Kind of a pain in the butt. Works good when up.
