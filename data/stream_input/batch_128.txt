B00FZNE5BM|5|CK did it again t]with a warm and fashionable coat. I wear it all the time.
B00PHMBSBG|5|Hi quality back. Plenty of space and compartments. Easy to acces from different angles. Great construction and craftsmanship.
B003XVYBEY|1|I am a &#34;bottom heavy&#34; 34A, which means the tops of bras (whether camisole, sports, or traditional) are often too large.  This bra was no exception.  Had that been the only problem, I would have given it 3 stars, as it was well-made.  However, the band was way too small despite having ordered the proper size band.  I returned it the same day!
B00NPC09OW|5|Great quality, just as advertised. I might try to get something a little thinner but that is just my personal taste. Over all quality for the money is unbeatable
B001XFLDR0|5|Comfortable and nice in a bra?  I didn't think it was possible, but I was happily mistaken.  These are wonderful.
B00JTRVC4S|2|Chinsy
B004GKM7LU|5|my daughter loved it.... got this for our trip and she just loves this.... thank you so much.  cant wait for our trip
B008KKSIKG|4|This runs on the smaller side. But very soft and nice quality. Would order another if i needed one again.
B00CFIPVFY|5|love the pants, fits very well
B00S9WXAXA|5|12 pack wonderful price feel good and look good
B001CVCTTQ|5|This fits perfectly in all the right places!  :)
B00K6NIS9Q|5|excelente
B00C4QPFAI|5|What a great statement shirt.  It is a nice quality shirt.  Most shirts are too heavy to be comfortable in Florida.  It made a nice gift.
B00SFNFBG2|4|Very lightweight...hasn't been cold enough to wear to see how warm it will be, but I like the look.
B00SIUQDBE|2|Boo. I picked this suit because it was super cute, and looked fitted.After waiting about 2 monhs for it to arrive, it finally came today. as I pulled it out of the bag, the first sad thing I saw was that my suit is blue with white polka dots and a blue bow on the top. there is NO red on my suit at all. The other horrible thing that is noticed is that the bottom of the suit I got looks like it is a maternity suite. all bunchy on the side and does not come in at the waist as in this picture. so disappointed, but that is what I get for getting a cheap suit. just wish companies would actually sell you what is in the picture, not a bait and switch. i really wanted this suit for the red in it
B0018OKRTQ|5|Bought these for my son...the fit him and he loves them.
B00BPQJU8Q|4|I am 6'0&#34; 230lbs and purchased the X-Large tall. The coveralls fit with a shirt and shorts on no problem but it was extremely tight getting it on and off my shoulders. I decided to exchange them for the X-Large X-Tall as I haven't even washed them yet and was worried that they might get tighter. Hope this helps someone else in their purchase. As far as the quality, everything seemed good and will work well for yard work and crawling under my house.
B008XNLZWS|5|Very pretty dress!! My niece love it,She was a flower girl at my mom wedding.
B001PE65RW|5|I bought this bag in order to take it on vacation with me, and I've had it for about two months.    It's a great overnight bag, and has so many pockets and zippers to store any items you need to pack.  The only problem I've really experienced with this bag is that it gets VERY HEAVY, VERY QUICKLY. The more you pack, the heavier this bag will be to carry.  Luckily, it comes with a shoulder strap (that has a moveable pad). This is quite useful for me.    Overall, I really love this travel bag. I get so many compliments on it, and if I don't overpack it, it's a very easy to carry bag with many places to store your travel items.
B00K64XI0Y|3|Super cute. Especially for the money. One thing though, is the stiches are really loose. First time I put it on the buttons on the bottom started falling off instantly. I suggest sewing on the buttons better as soon as you receive it. Really adorable though
B001V8YMW2|5|recommend several, i own 7 blue and white. always take to the cleaners so you need enough to alternate weeks.
B00FKMRTY8|4|Comfortable soft  cotton. A little tall for my liking.
B004IAIK9Q|5|LOVE these! They are perfect for making you look like you had a bit of a breast lift or for just filling out your bra!
B00FBD2G2Q|5|good.
B0067PBZH4|4|This robe is nearly prefect. It was purchased to replace a 15 year old Turkish Cotton robe, I am sure after a couple more  washings and more wear it will be perfect, it is still a little &#34;stiff&#34;. At 5'4&#34; and over weight it was a great fit, not too long and wraps around me fine.
B00NUPNOXC|5|Ok so reviewing kids gloves is tough. My son is so thrilled to have green gloves I am not sure if they were a paper bag colored green if he would say they are terrible haha.  However, these gloves for very nicely and seem to have held up pretty well.  I can also say he seems to be able to use his hands and fingers pretty well While wearing them.
B00HA23Y0E|5|Nice thick socks as bamboo socks go. i would definitely buy again.  The only complaint I have is that they are slightly on the small end of the scale, but then again I have large feet (W 10 shoe size). It's workable for me though so I can't complain.  Would not recommend for feet larger than 10 though
B00FUX99AO|5|I had to purchase this dress for a wedding. I loved the details and the way it fit me. I am 5'9 and my measurements are 43-38-45. It fit me perfectly.and I loved how I felt in this dress. I paired it with a necklace and gorgeous shoes from Rampage.  The skirt fit me well and showed off my legs and curves in such a positive way. I loved the detail on the top and it is perfect for the summer months. I highly recommend this outfit!
B00A65Z3M4|5|so many compliments, it is unique, and it looks sexy on but still classic enough for work, really like it
B001NXBQUG|5|I never thought I would find this bra again since it has been 5 years since I purchased the original at Belks.  It is the exact same bra and the price was half as much.
B00MG3D0WY|5|Beautiful fabric, great fit, well made!
B00BKRLGKA|5|Very nice
B000MT9KEG|5|Perfect!  Soft and comfortable.  Stay in place in ankle but not tight.  I will buy again.
B00WH2D5MO|4|Nice quality, fits as expected.  These did not ride up at all, which makes them a winner in my opinion.
B008LTNBLW|5|Great jacket
B00MBAKX0E|5|My wife look super hot on it
B000EDGB4M|5|I love Geoffrey Beene, and I wear primarily G.B. for work.  It keeps me looking professional and up on the latest fashion.  This shirt was just an addition to my collection.
B00JLA9N44|5|The patchwork is beautiful. The T-shirt fits US size 8-10. I was not sure about the asymmetric design but it is flattering. T-shirt looks on me exactly in  the same way as on the model. The colours are also true to the picture, even nicer.
B009E897ZI|5|Great fits and well constructed for the price point, I both one in black and have not been disappointed. And Im a plus size girl, I both the 52 I am a true size 20 in american sizes.
B00IGT3RCA|5|Carters is a very good brand for baby and kids<br />It has decent quality<br />nice look<br />soft to the baby/kid skin<br />can take few washs and keep its quality<br />and price is right, so we can buy more items
B00PK2WRNG|4|Nice!
B00BP5CFV6|4|Love the little buttons on the sleeves and nice color!  A little shorter in back than expected, but still like!
B000H5I6YU|4|These feel really strange and they are expensive compared to the Xhilaration leggings. They aren't worth the money. Get the Xhilaration heather Grey instead. Those are more comfortable. I wish I didn't buy these.
B0030BNK62|3|I purchased this bra and unfortunately I was expecting a better fit and I pulled the tags.  I figured now I couldn't return it.  I don't use it often as it's a big too big.
B004HJSYAS|5|I bought this bow tie for my wedding. Because I was buying it online I was a little concerned at first that it might not match my shirt/suit. I wore an eggshell/cream colored shirt and wanted a bow tie to match. Needless to say this tie was one of many perfect parts of our day!
B00IPNHJQW|1|LOOKS VERY NICE BUT THEY IGNORED MY ORDER SO FOR ME WAS A BAD EXPERIENCE TO TRY TO BUY THIS
B003MQLT68|5|These jeans are great!  I love them so much that I came back to see if I could order them in other colors (and I can!)  I'm 5'6&#34; and about 165 pounds, and I got size 30 medium.  So very excited to have these.
B00NPQ82VU|4|The pullover fits as I hoped, lose and comfortable. I would wish it was a bit longer, but otherwise happy with my purchase. Delivery takes a while, but I wasn't in any hurry to get the item.
B00AOCX3TE|2|It didn't really fit right, it was printed badly, and the fabric was really itchy. The sweater was much much larger than depicted in the picture. Definitely not worth what I paid.
B00CBWZ7QW|1|Way too small and I am very petite.
B006J30MU0|4|I needed new croquet pants and like these as they are comfortable, cool to wear in summer and look good. They are pretty true to size.
B00H9JXRIW|5|I am a big Doobie Brothers fan and the shirt looks great and fits well. The sizing is pretty true. Was sent promptly.
B00J504796|5|My daughter loves this and wants more.  She wore it everyday to school over her clothes and the teacher even asked where I got it.
B00DOG5O30|4|I am at the point in my fashion-life where I really only have  2 - 3 GO-TO brands for the jeans I buy.<br /><br />Cookie Johnson happens to be one of those few.<br /><br />Love her style and her jeans.<br /><br />I really like these jeans because of the color and style. I went up a size so they would fit a little looser through the hips and buttocks area... and they do, but the waist is SUPER big. And even with a belt, they dont have quite the fit I was going for, but they are quality made and a good deal, so I will probably take to the cleaners and have them dart in the waist some.<br /><br />I would definitely buy again, but in the smaller size, and hopefully just stretch them out with wear.
B00NBMYXK2|5|I ordered 3XL because I had read the previous reviews, which said that these tops run small. My real size is L or XL..... the 3XL fits perfectly! I love them.
B003K7QIAG|5|Pretty good, fully satisfied, the product was what I expected, I received exactly what I expected, i highly recommend, the product was received as was described.
B00KKIEHDS|1|Too tight
B00QV3BYP0|3|logo seems like its about to peel off ..
B00MQ59D50|5|Great quality and fit.
B005V07H9Q|4|i like the product, made things handy for me- it has the pockets i like the most- i just wish the material or fabric used be a little more thicker  but i really like it, it came just in time- thanks amazon for helping me find the right fit and the right product
B00AU98BKM|3|runs large
B008WZCE9A|1|I order this three days ago and it just came a few mins ago and they sent me something I didn't order!!
B003OE3PWE|5|nice athletic shorts.  are wearing well too
B00DJ56GO2|4|I like this very much (as does He who purchased it!)  However I will admit it runs small, and the sheer number of garters are difficult to handle. I think I have worn it twice. I am sticking with the four or maybe 6 or 8 garter style from here on out.<br /><br />The quality of this belt is TOPS!  Love how it feels and looks.
B0037OZ2L8|5|What can i say i love the whole animal farm bit. This is my second hat from Goorin. Fits good and looks great.
B00QY5AEWO|5|Great hat.

B00Z124N32|3|It's beautiful but I'm disappointed. Runs big and the point of waist training is to compress my waist. I  hooked it on to the third row way to easy.
B00HUS6XV0|5|My wife normally wears size 6 but she feels the quality is very exceptional, but she will order size 6 the next time. Can't go wrong fruit of the loom is still top notch
B009S895GU|5|Beautiful coat and hat...well made and they shipped it very quickly. Will buy again from this vendor if I want coats for the grands.
B00R11Q4QK|4|Good quality feels a lot like the material a wet suit is made from.  5'2&#34; 120 lbs I ordered a small the top is a bit big definitely have to wear the straps with it and the bottoms do run small. Great color as quality overall. Do recommend!
B0007QMNNE|5|I have been wearing this brand and style for many years as the fit is perfect for me. I prefer full coverage which I have with this bra. My only disappointment is that Lilyette does not make this style with a seamless cup so that I could wear it under thinner fabrics. Otherwise this is a most comfortable and well fitting bra.
B00RCX9BVW|4|It seemed a bit short around my ankles, but otherwise it fit fine. I'm 5 feet 4 1/2 inches.
B00CBR1O3W|3|...so he's the physical target demographic in terms of measurements. He's 5'10&#34;, 128lbs (eats like a freakin' horse but never manages to get above 130) and for the most part wears US small to extra small sizes. He's got very narrow shoulders and is the very definition of 'slender' head to toe, has no gut, wears a men's 28&#34; waist because he likes his pants a little loose over the backside and through the groin so this is a very very thin man I'm talking about.<br /><br />I went by the measurement guide given, and double checked his physical measurements, and according to the guide he should have been the US Small. Yeah, no, it's a good thing I went with my gut and ordered the US Medium because his shoulders threaten to strain the seams. Be very very wary when ordering this if you have broad shoulders or any sort of development in the bicep/tricep region, and avoid this at all costs if you have a muscular back, unless you're able to order up several sizes from what you would think you'd need.<br /><br />Otherwise the quality beyond poor fit ranges is fair. It smelled heavily of chemicals which is normal for something straight from a factory but it did require several washings to clear out the smell. It's a moderately heavy jacket, and nowhere near as thin as I was worried it may be so that is a very pleasant surprise.
B005OFLTEM|5|excelente
B000Z6S3FS|5|I love this bra.  It is the most comfortable bra I have owned.  I have had it for over 6 months and it still looks great.  People say it will not hold up becuase it streches well, but that is not true.  I would recommend this bra to my girlfriends.
B00IKCV1WG|3|I liked it, it's just when it came in I found out its a push up, and it runs small. I'm just glad you gave me a bigger size.
B003DDAGKA|5|Was a gift for a 6yr old & he loved it. Perfect size not too large. Nice quality too.
B007KFZGGQ|5|This bra is awesome.  I only wish that they had them in an assortment of colors, but I will be purchasing more.
B007NLXBZA|5|I am a size 12 in Womens, so I was afraid a large might not be large enough, because of other clothing I have purchased in this style (from other sellers).  But it fits well, the style works well with my wide hips.<br />It is very flattering to any figure, I imagine.  I purchased the gold color, and it is really pretty.<br />I am really pleased with this purchase!
B003I7VQC8|4|Good fit, durable, great price. Will buy again.
B005UPSF20|5|More comfortable than I expected, and very sexy!  Not necessarily practical for everyday use because it has zero padding; but thsts not why we buy a bra like this, is it ladies?  ;)  Love it!!
B0042U2XKE|4|Greek costume was ordered in size small.  It was definitely over-sized.  It was exactly as pictured though in terms of the look.  Once altered, it looked great and did the job for the greek goddess warrior costume for school.
B00K9FYIAO|4|it is cute, wish I have got small one. i am 4&#34;11 and 95lb
B000V3WXL0|5|A
B0043RJQBU|5|This was a great gift for Hunger Game lovers<br />price and shipping were great even during the holiday season<br />would order again if I needed more
B009R0VJ7C|5|they fit .
B005AOO59S|5|ALL OK THANK YOU
B00EMG3UAU|5|loved it!
B007USGES2|5|Our son looked great in this. We were stopped by many people who wanted to know where we got it. &#34;Is that..........bacon?
B005ANWF6Y|4|Bought as a gift.
B00IXPFJP0|4|Love these pajamas, much better quality than many of the snug fit cotton pjs. Shipping can be a bit, but seems faster than their estimates, a week or so (coming from overseas...) cute! I buy XL for my almost 4 yr old who wears a 3t well up to 5t loose... But I don't want them as tight as the thinner ones which ride up on the belly and down on the neck... I'd score higher if bigger sizes were available!!
B008D5H42G|5|Arrived on time and were exactly what I was looking for!
B00ITXRCK6|5|I liked them so much, I let my wife wear them....besides she looks better in them than I do. Oh boy!
B0017WGUTK|5|Nice clutch bag for those who don't want a big purse.  well made and peace signs are awesome.
B000NBJAGQ|4|super  cool design and fits really well
B000JMMWJQ|5|I ordered two of these micro fleece zip ups. One for my brother and one for my boyfriend. THey are really so soft. I can't wait to cuddle with my man while he's wearing his.
B004LKTHO0|4|This dress is absolutely darling.  I got several for both my 2yo and my 5yo, and they absolutely love them!  The material is floaty and frilly enough to make them feel (and look) like little princesses, but sturdy enough to stand up to playtime, and lined in soft, stretchy fabric so they are super comfy.  And machine washable!  I knocked down a star because they are very expensive for kids' clothing since they grow out of them so fast, but I have two girls so my youngest can keep growing into the bigger sizes I bought for her sister, and I can justify the expense :-)  They were just too cute to resist! perfect for special occasions or everyday wear.
B002E3A5CE|1|I've spent almost six years of my adult life nursing babies. With my youngest I finally bought one of these tanks after hearing rave reviews from friends. I couldn't be more disappointed. This tank has fallen apart and faded SO much more than even my cheap Target nursing tanks. (I will include photos of the fading and lousy workmanship.) I also don't like the shape of the 'bra'. I am a 34 DDD and even with a size large the bra is awkward and too tight. The clasps cannot be closed without using both hands but PPP open as easily as single-hand clasps, I would never buy another one, even if they were the same price as Target tanks.
B008J1OBCA|2|Very thin fabric, poor design. It doesn't look like at the picture. It's just poor&#62; Thant's what we receive for such a money wasted. Not recommend. I don't use it for mu baby..
B002R0F79A|5|My daughter is 18 months (about 21 lb. and wears 18mo. clothing) and this fits her perfectly. Great material! Just be sure to order a size up.
B00N3OVQSK|1|Not the best quality and oddly fit in the legs, and I am only 5'1 so if you are taller than this probably not a good purchase.
B00GNC699U|3|The belt comes with instructions to cut it with a sharp knife and then singe the end with a candle. Tricky, and  can be unsafe. Frankly, have never singed anything with a candle, and  not so keen on the idea. Maybe if they included instructions of how to singe things, but they don't.<br />On the upside, Amercan made, but dodges the question of whether of any of the materials are made in China.  Not of fan of Chinese goods,<br />China threatens the rest of Asia, and the toxins in they're manufactured goods  make you think...<br />The nylon seems cheesy, go with cotton. Will look better.<br />Good idea, for sure, but the cheesy nylon, and the candle bit...not liking it.
B0058YUCQU|5|Even though it says no need to iron, you will still need to iron it from time to time, but definitely looks better than other ironandum shirts
B00EW86Q2C|5|awesome!
B00IPQSWAQ|5|Fit as expected.  Looked good.
B00KX3RVOC|5|Very nice pants, gets compliments each time I wear them
B004GGUAOK|2|This shirt started to fall apart at the bottom hem after one washing. One of the strings at the hem unraveled.<br /><br />The material is also a bit thin and very course. It's not as soft and comfortable as a 100% cotton shirt should be. I also bought a Joy Division shirt by the same brand, which is also rough-feeling and thin.<br /><br />The printing appears to be well done.<br /><br />I'm disinclined to buy any other shirts from this brand.
B008F5RXSY|3|These are like regular Dickie's around the waist, but then just kind of cut off at the knees, and with pockets on the side. Made for kind of a weird look, for cargo shorts -- ended up returning them and going with the Wrangler &#34;Riggs Workwear&#34; shorts (which I really like). http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LUAWM2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1
B00N0A50RK|5|I gave it to my sister as Halloween present, she loved it and still using it on weekends. Great outfit on high quality fleece.
B00PGJGSNS|5|Love this
B00NVLWOBS|5|My kids love it
B008YWF86C|4|I always get smalls, because I'm an average sized person and apparently that means I'm on the lower end of size for all clothing. These didn't quite fit; it was a bit unusual having things be too small for me to wear.<br /><br />I gave them to my girlfriend. She likes them. Ergo, 5 stars for good pants, -1 for using stupid S/M/L sizing instead of waist size so I can buy properly fitting pants.
B00KBSI22Y|2|Says they run big. They run true to size.
B006Y3IGJE|5|I just love, love this gown it's just precious, but I was disappointed that it was NOT made in USA!
B00DQ82OXO|1|the first time I wore these shorts the material ripped at the seams, material is very cheap, don't buy these,<br /><br />update:<br />I would like to thank the seller for standing behind their product, they gave me a full refund, nice to see a company that values their customers.
B0007OF310|5|I purchased this to keep the sun off of some recently acquired scars.  It's exactly what it looks like....a floppy fishing hat.  It keeps the sun off of the top 1/2 to 2/3 of my face and is very comfortable.  I have a huge head (hat size is over an 8) and the 3xl fits very well with a little room to spare.
B004ZJVLRI|3|This item is okay.  The material is not what I expected (not bad - just not what I wanted).  I would recommend anyone wanting to purchase this item do so, because they will probably love it.
B003GJE3OG|5|Very delicate, lovely lace thong.  Fits comfortably; does not bunch up.  Would definitely recommend this thong.  Sexy, yet functional.  Great buy!
B00E9DG0S0|2|Not what i expected...My old shorts have a 2 1/2 in. inseam,and are a little to short...these said they were a 5in. inseam so i thought great,should be just the right length...wrong!!...they are just as short as my old ones!! And unless you like wearing under wear under your shorts [which i don't] i wouldn't recommend these,when it said they had a mesh lining thats what i thought it would be,a lining...they actually have mesh under wear sewn into them...not happy as i bought 3 pair.
B00GTTM24I|3|It does the job, a button broke the first day I wore it, I noticed it was weak when I got into the office, by the afternoon it fell off, other than, it's a shirt, can't complain, and it fits my rotund body frame.
B004D6BVKA|5|Love these they make your sweat in all the right places, they dry quick,wash easy,,, the think I love the most is the pocket for your keys or phone,, and the elastic top… I had a pair before that cost way to much more than this,, that had a zipper top,,, what a crappy design that was,,, these fit great,,, no zippers and doesn't stretch out after wearing them for over a year.
B00AMKPSQY|5|Fits exactly as size chart says.  Very nice and super soft.  We are going to order more.
B007O3S6P2|5|Costume was perfect! Description did not include the crown, so we were pleasantly surprised with the included crown.Would definitely order again.
B00J5XTXEC|5|Ladies, these shirts - the rayon, handkerchief style specifically - are excellent!  They fit is as you would expect - not too small - not too large.  The fabric is so soft, washes well, hangs just right.  The colors are as they appear on your monitor assuming your monitor is calibrated correctly.  I recently gained 20+ lbs and was looking for something longer and that would flatter my new fuller figure.  I searched awhile on amazon but have been reluctant to purchase anything as in the past some items I've ordered seem to run small.  I can assure you that is not the case with these!  I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only do they fit well but they are so comfortable and arrived quickly.  I can't rave enough about these shirts.  They are thin - as rayon is - so if you get the long sleeve version you may want to wear a cardigan with them (which also looks cute with the tail hanging out).  In fact, you can dress it up or down - wear with skinny jeans, boots, a cardigan and scarf or capri leggings and ballet flats/sandals.  So cute any way and I feel so much more confident while I'm working to shed those extra pounds.
B00946GMRQ|1|you dont even get what you paid for. these are thin, shrink in the wash, and tear fairly easily.
B001UJB43C|5|This cami is great. I bought several other brands and this one is my favorite. A large is fairly tight on me (38a) but still very comfortable when I get it on. There is double material over the bottom half that really tightens up my belly. No bunching, no rolling, and its even comforable to sleep in. Getting it off is a whole other story but thats to be expected with shapewear! The material is soft and feels great.
B0017LDTDG|5|Perfect for my costume ...won best costume on cruise ship with this!
B00L7QG244|5|Very nice same as pictured.
B00O62H4SY|5|Nice shirt! Very comfortable material. The design and fabric is an A+
B009TB0ILW|5|Was a present for my niece, she just love it and is so nice looking. Perfect<br />I also order a Blue One and ordering 2 more for myself
B00DULWMAM|5|It is all I was asking for. Fits perfectly and I just love how much my son enjoy putting it on! Great price its really worth every penny!
B001N4NX6A|1|I worse these for a wedding I was in and they were awful! They gave little to no support. By the end of the night I had a bra on with my strapless dress.
B00ONQG4AC|5|Super cute top! Exactly what I was expecting!
B00NHUQ8KQ|5|We ordered the medium and the tag says 10/12.  My daughter wears size 8 right now, but this fits great on her.
B005XS08EC|4|Nice hat, but the one problem with it is that it is black, not blue. you can't really tell by the picture, so beware.
B00GMEHY0M|5|Love this shirt ! It's maybe a little bigger than I was thinking it would be .. But all good 💚
B00F2T9BUO|4|This was purchased as a gift from the recipients wish list The fabric is of good quality, nice design/color. A little pricey.
B000S9IAAA|2|I was very dissapointed.  I have been buying Thorlo brand socks since 1997.  I purchased size 13 thinking it would fit for a man with 10.5 size feet.  They were too small and fit me, I wear women's size 8.
B00GFH9E0E|1|It did not fit well at all! I usually don't have a hard time with things fitting right. I'm about 124lbs and 5'7&#34; and this swim suit did not fit well at all. It was not flattering. I recommend purchasing in a larger size. My swim suit was too small!
B00AK4KDPS|5|It's very cute.<br /><br />The fabric is quite cool and smooth. The first time you wash the shirt, it must be done separately, as the red lines that are near the neck tend to fade the color.
B00E9O81TA|1|Don't want to say much, just really really don't like this robe.  Don't like the weight, the fabric, the belt style.  Color OK.
B00GMSJPEG|5|5 stars
B00IOB7HC6|5|Although it was too small for me, it fit my Mom perfectly. She loved it!
B0026RHEC2|5|I bought this for my wife. I don't know who likes it more her or me, but it is an inexpensive gift for your favorite gal. I highly recommend this product!!
B0037TIDY6|5|So I did what you did and shopped around, read as many reviews as I could stand. JUST BUY IT! Looks exactly like the photos, well made, seems sturdy. Both my kids immediately went into a pose-down, even let me take pictures! The masks are big enough for adults to wear! Oh yes I did! Yeah, it WON'T hold all your stuff. I fit a 1\\" ring binder in--barely. It's the height not the width that is a problem, so textbooks will fit and a bunch of other stuff. This will be the school/sleepover/swim lessons pack. The straps are adjustable enough for 7 and 4 year olds as well as a 5'6'' medium-sized  yummy mommy. I was deeelighted, plus now I have something awesome that I can use as a threat=\\"I'll take your shell away if you don't...\\"yes, it's THAT good!
B00MR9QSOY|5|These fit wonderfully.  I wish the straps were not removable but I love the bras
B00AKAZRUI|3|The dress is a jersey knit and is a bit large. It looks cute on the model, but in person looks less dressy and more like a hospital gown. Plus mine had a small tear in it and i don't have time to ship it back for a refund. I was disappointed.
B001GID3U4|1|I ordered this sweatshirt for my husband - it is quite difficult to find a full zip sweatshirt with no hood.  I ended up having to return it because it ran so big.  Do order the correct size or even a size down - the sweatshirt runs very large and LONG.  I looked for other options to reorder after processing the return for the 'too large' item only to find that the seller has the same sweatshirt listed for $10 cheaper under a different name.  I can assure you that the tag on the &#34;Upscale&#34; one I paid for and have is exactly the same as the &#34;Sport Tek&#34; version for $10 less.  Fraudulent and dishonest if you ask me.  Either they sent the wrong thing knowingly even though I'd paid for the nicer version - or they are double listing things.
B007XH8UDM|5|These tights are awesome. I got a small and they fit great. Even when stretched, they aren't see through. These are so fun to wear.
B00LJEAD1C|3|Decal starts peeling/crackling after the first wash.
B003G5MBGC|5|I recently gave this bathrobe as a gift to my son's girlfriend, a lovely girl in her early 30's. She loved it and it fit her perfectly. My husband and I live in FL and wanted to give her something very nice for her to think of us when she wore it. She washed it and it came out of the dryer fluffy and soft. She and I both liked that there were just enough appliques on the robe to be pretty but not overdone. This robe is excellent quality and the fabric weight is perfect for the Midwest climate. Thanks, Amazon, for offering this lovely bathrobe. I would have bought one for myself also but one size is not large enough for me.
B00LVSA2BM|5|The fit was fine, my grandson loved them.
B00DA1BALY|3|VERY VERY Thin shirt.. if you are looking for a thin shirt, good, if not keep looking.
B00K5LKE4Q|4|The material is nice. But it's not really what I exp
B00HQQOR1E|5|Very nice vest.
B004954TO0|2|The product looks really great with neutral colors and a nice suede patch on the thumb and palm that give it grip. I love convertible style mittens/gloves so I can stay warm when needed and keep from sweating when it warms up. However, I had worn these for about a week and the yarn and stitching starting breaking apart and unraveling. One week. That's all it lasted for a total cost of $17. I basically threw my money away on these gloves. The yarn is thin and weak and this is obviously a low quality product, not a defect in one set. It's a waste of good leather on the palm when the rest of it cannot hold together. Extremely disappointing.
B009W5PWXY|5|Well made t-shirt. It looks exactly like in the picture. My nephew loved it.
B008OHTBUG|5|This items was for my mom, she said that was perfect, she use her &#34;faja&#34; for work, shopping, go dancing and for the day to day.
B00IO6PW8W|4|Cute and very inexpensive. The pants run a little large though.
B0073E5164|1|I really wanted to be catwoman for Halloween so I went on Amazon, and this was the cheapest, best-looking costume I could find. The picture makes it look very nice, but it is very crappy and cheap. I read all of the comments about how awful it was but I didn't listen to them because I really wanted to be catwoman and I thought that they were just picky about all the little things. Man, was I wrong. I got it, and at first I thought it was amazing and I thought I made the right choice. I put it on and it looked alright-even though it was a little baggy and the belt did not stay tight unless I pinned it-but I figured it was no big deal. I ended up wearing it to a convention and within less than an hour I was super itchy, the plastic headband was falling apart and squishing my brains in the process, the stupid boot cover things looked so ugly and cheesy, and I had to take off the super cheap and smelly mask that I pretty much looked like a hot and sweaty mess in a cheap black jumpsuit. It wasn't pretty. So if you plan on buying this costume, don't look past the comments because you think you know best. I made that mistake and I regret it so much because I was picking between this costume and a different costume that was super cute and had good ratings. I thought it would be super flattering and make me look good, but I think it made me look worse in the first place. Whatever you do, do not buy this product.
B006KDDNZ0|4|Fits well. Worth a look if you need gloves with smart phone touch
B001ETXJVS|5|My son wore this at six months. He was very cute! This costume is VERY warm and you need to be aware of not over heating your little one. It was great for a cool night of Trick or Treating. I would buy it again. It was easy to get on, but I was unable to snap the hood on to the body of the suit. It still worked and was comfortable for my little to fall asleep in it.
B00LG9D2Z4|4|Good
B00GFMS5SG|2|Gold Toe has taken a huge drop in quality. All I have had in my sock drawer are the quarter length and the crew length for the past few years. The last few packs I have bought rip at the toe so quick and they don't even feel as thick as in the past. I am now looking for a different brand for work which is a shame.
B00BQKKV34|4|I love this sweater. I just purchased a grey one  and It is almost perfect. I was looking for cardigans similar to those from express an this one is pretty close. Def getting more in different colors
B00P71LFN8|5|People always say they like this jacket and I love it too. The fabric if you look at it closely its cheap. But from regular distance it is great. I love how it looks and fits great.
B00C0JPIBK|2|Asian sizes are smaller than American, but the American conversion chart isn't right either. XXL might be closer to a large than XL.
B00K08Z1GU|2|fit my band size is 32&#34; bust is 36&#34; fit comfortably however did not like the removable pads it comes with. took them out and used ones already have
B00CNKP9GU|3|These are great jammies!  HOWEVER, BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE SIZE!!! My little boy is 3 years old and pretty small for his age. I read the reviews about this running small and decided to buy a size 5.  It fits him PERFECTLY!  At first glance, I thought they would way too big on him, but they weren't!  He LOVES them and he is obsessed with garbage trucks!  The material is soft and warm.  Great buy!
B009F1P8EI|3|i bought this for my husband and of course men put their wallets in their back pockets well of course the mopar symbol fell off i was really disappointed but the wallet itself is hanging in there
B009LIXB0I|2|a little too big. too polyester-looking. i never wear it.
B000M9O4L0|4|Nice lightweight and comfortable pants.  My son uses them when working outdoors in the heat (100+ degrees). Regular sweatpants are too heavy.  The pants are definitely on the baggy side, but waist fits well with elastic band. The pockets are a plus as well as the elastic around the ankles.  Small size fits a person 5'8\\" and 130 pounds.  The mediums were too big.
B00XBBH1H0|3|I know that my daughter is a bit chubby so l ordered a size up - these barely fit.
B006ZZU888|5|Very nice wallet.
B007JA9UO6|5|So cute and soft. Unfortunately too big.
B007G86CV0|5|Small size 9-11.5, medium 12-2.5, large 3-6. I bought a small for my 4 year old- size 9 and the socks are a little big as expected, excellent quality!<br />I bought a large for my 7 year old size 1 and as expected was a little bit larger but she still looked it for ski!
B00JQSZT3K|5|fits like my skin
B0000ASG31|1|I am a big guy, wear 44/30.  I started with 46/30 (too small), then returned and got 48/30 (too small), then got 50/30 (too small) and then 52/30.  Well that didn't fit.  Odd thing was after the 48/30's it was just snug so I kept returning and the 50's and 52's were still too small.  I just gave up.
B00G3OPKYI|4|Received the socks very fast. These socks are perfect for my low top sneakers. No problems except at toe seem of 1 pair have started to tear a bit.
B00BGHVOPG|5|This shirt looks terrific right out of the dryer...never wrinkles and always looks great. Third one I have bought for my husband.
B0047EZVT0|2|they sent me 3 smalls and I only ordered one small a medium and a large need to know how to get the other sizws before Chjristmas they are very pretty.
B007PSE3DA|5|I LOVE THESE PJs!<br />I love the feel of this fabric and how silky it feels against my skin.  I had some socks that I liked so I thought I'd try some other clothing made of bamboo.  Not only are the pajamas great, dealing with this company is a good experience, also.<br />I will definitely buy more clothing made from bamboo, I will also recommend doing business with TexereSilk.
B00GWJJV6M|5|Loved the jacket, fit excellent,  The sleeves were a bit long but a simple alteration took care of them Love the fact that Nanette Lepore does manufacturing in New York City
B00KDLTRFU|4|Lightweight sweatshirt material, decent construction (only thing &#34;wrong&#34; is the sleeve ribbing on right arm wasn't sewn completely. Easy fix though. Color, fit & design as expected.
B00CONNILE|5|I love it! Holds me in nicely and gives me that hourglass shape.
B00DCKPIPC|5|These are adorable.  I read the previous reviews and ordered a size larger.  The size 6 is too large for my 3 year old though.  I wish I just ordered the 4.  The other thing,  I didn't receive the black and white batman, I received a comic book style pair of wonder woman.
B00HSHOC70|4|Long- more transparent than I thought- but not bad
B004BR1UD4|5|Perfect! My new favorite... Fit, length, color...just perfect
B00UIKKGFG|1|i sold size 5 in a lot of clothes,  and it was unique too small, my girl cant use it
B00OC87TXM|4|Product as a thinner appearance than anticipated but my friend enjoys it
B00E3OW8QI|4|I like
B002FU5XHS|3|These were big in the legs and small in the waist for me. Had to return these.
B00AF5AGEU|3|reminds me of problems LuluLemon had with black leggings being too thin.<br />Not ok for my daughter to wear, too bad they are so transparent
B00EKT1MP4|5|Arrived on time and fit my husband perfectly!
B0019TUU56|5|Its useful to have a tape measure with the Scale and the price was very reasonable. Just what is needed to avoid paying an excess luggage charge.
B00ELMYN5G|3|The material is too thin, is good for summer and hot climate only
B00JHCRX4S|5|I sent back the medium and ordered 2 in small. The medium hung down under the arms too low but the small is perfect. This day/night dress is so light and comfortable to wear around the house!
B00YHNXOT0|5|He was very happy with the gift.
B003YQJE8G|4|The color is red (not the orange-red that some shirts are).<br />Fits well and is comfortable.
B00UJFNVMU|5|Love these shorts,  I bought them in green and red. Just decided to buy the black too. Nice comfortable fit, bright colors....just a great buy.
B00P7FQN0Y|3|I'm a C and reviews said they're cut small so I got a D. probably should've got DD. gave support and everything but I had to fix it so there was no spilling
B00A3U731G|5|Very soft and comfy. My husband loves it.
B00GJ1EDPW|5|a little thiner than I espected, but nice
B000YGH3EG|4|this is a good product. although the bra is pointy, i dont like that, if you like pointy bras well then this is a great bra. other than that it is very comfortable and soft, and it doesnt ride up either.
B00YYM8M6Y|5|Love it! Would buy from shop again without hesitation.
B00C82T4FK|2|I was able to use it for swim class, but I wouldn't lounge around in it for the afternoon.
B00C0PGFPW|4|Looks Great
B00GABQFAW|3|It's GIANT! Like literally giant. I am 5 foot 3. It's so large I would need to wear a belt, and then it will look stupid.
B00NJ48CTA|5|Great item: super fast shipping-  Thanks
B0101A8SM0|4|Nice versatile piece of clothing.
B00DY7UIZI|5|My daughter will actually wear these without complaining. That's a huge success.
B00GV30UIW|5|the first time i saw hiim,I really loved it.For the shape is my style and fits my denim jeans perfectly.
B00EFW7MAU|5|Very cute!!
B0011EV05S|2|I gave this bra two stars because it does keep me from bouncing around. However, as somone who wears a DDD, I found my size in this bra to be very uncomfortable. I experienced the \\"uni-boob\\" and a little spilling out of the sides - a problem I don't have with any other of my DDD bras. The plastic strap connectors have yet to cause me a problem, but they're very light weight and bend with very little pressure.
B00ESFDP6O|4|It gets the job done.
B00CBDT834|3|The swimsuit is very cute, but the top did not fit. Didn't look at return policy, so didn't try to send back
B00EHJN3EU|1|Small around the rear,  but too big at the waist. Would have fit fine on a tree trunk.
B0092C79PQ|5|Love it
B00BPFJTU6|1|It fell apart before I even tried it on
B007RX4ZHM|4|Good quality , fast deliver
B001PBC506|1|i looked everywhere for a purple case this is my moms favorite color . just got it in today and it is no where near purple. very disappointed! so now I am back on the hunt to get one before Christmas. I usually don't buy online and this is why I am out of the money and don't have the tiem I needed.
B00GR8NAWO|5|This was the perfect gift for my loved ones birthday gift!
B003ZW1AEU|5|The fit and the weight of the fabric are what I like most about Champion yoga pants and these were especially nice.
B00HA23KY4|5|Love this item. I'm a S in MPG and this was no different.
B00EZVI89A|5|I have a large head so I need adjustable headbands.  This one fits perfectly.  It also looks beautiful.
B00CQS9PX2|5|very good
B00PWKNH6W|5|Adorable, my niece loves it. It's bigger than expected but not an issue.
B00U4HTHT4|5|Super cute!
B005XK8UTK|5|good
B00D3E0VWM|5|have not had a chance to wear it yet but it fits great and I love it.  It's exactly what I expected.
B00NGH7GAQ|2|Fits small.
B002VLZH0Y|4|This shirt does it job it keeping you cool and dry.  Highly recommend to anyone that goes to the gym on a regular basis.  Compared to other shirts and this is by the far the better shirt for the price.
B00J8BVS44|5|Soft and comfortable
B00E89WOUS|5|Every time I get in bed, she gives me  a hug just to feel the texture. Needless to say what's follow next. Very soft and elegant if you have a sexy body.
B00MPR59NY|3|I got my black jacket and was SOOOOOO excited.  I have purchased a ton of Cuddl Dud's Fleecewear and up until this point have absolutely loved every piece.  I'm REALLY shocked at the quality of this thing.  I wore it once last week and noticed a lot of shedding on my non black shirt when I took it off.  I decided to wash it to see if I could get the excess fleece off.  Bad news, all it did was make a really big mess, it pilled up the jacket and it is still shedding like crazy, but it now resembles a matting, shedding dog!!  It is not soft and pretty looking anymore.  What a mess.  I think I may return it.  I'm so bummed.  It is really warm.
B00LX09ZY8|3|This is cute but I.m not sure I would've spent $30  on it had I seen it in person
B00Q9Y8DFA|5|Great mask for the price
B00GKF5KXQ|5|Looks fantastically Ugly and corny , perfect. Well made , the lights all work. Can't wait to wear it at the departmental xmas party.
B00AU52WVK|5|I absolutely LOVE this tank!! It's long enough so that it doesn't ride up when working out. My favorite part is that its super softt!! I will definitely be buying more.
B000LX3FEO|2|These booties are cute and soft, but they don't have enough elastic at the ankle. They constantly fall off my daughter to the point that I don't use them anymore because her poor little feet are constantly getting cold:(
B002LE867M|5|These are very cute.  They are a good weight for the cool weather around the holidays, but not too heavy.  Can't wait to see them with a party dress.
B00HS8JW60|5|I was searching for a wallet clip with a low profile and I bought something else first that didn't work.  The leather and craftsmanship is superb and it is such a great look.  If you want to just carry a few credit cards and D.L this is perfect and it is just the right profile for your back or front pocket.  The clip is really sturdy and I anticipate that it will last a long time as well as the leather.  When it wears out I am buying another just like it.
B00CZ7TXKO|5|This bra is very comfortable,fits great.
B00NRFQCDE|1|Too small
B00EMG3U8C|2|These are thin and very small. Baby can wear them maybe once and even then they're stretched paper thin. Not worth the money - spend a little extra and get some Carter's.
B00724JXUA|5|This romper is adorable! It's well-made and stretchy enough to be worn for several months. It was my little girl's First Birthday outfit and it was perfect for the party occasion!
B00CB3NNO4|4|It is ok. Looks like the photo, only that I found it quite ordinary and rough...not delicate and dressy. But anyhow, was a very good buy. I gave it as a Christmas present and the person loved it
B002VWHUS0|3|product looks good I expected some information regarding perspiration traetment like other product clima cool or other.<br />I'm a little bit disappointed
B00D3V14X0|5|Great look, fits well but a little snug under the armpit and upper arm
B0031IRRWM|5|because i didn't use them for work they met my needs perfectly.  I do not know how well they would hold up if i was constantly washing them.  I am not saying they would not hold up--maybe they will.
B000HQ8VBM|5|I got this for my husband for Valentine's Day. He needed a new jacket and this was the perfect one! He loves it and it keeps him super warm! Wouldn't have wanted a different jacket especially for this great price! And it's made in usa is a huge plus!
B005F50EP6|5|I ordered the white one full well knowing (from the image provided) that it had black trim. In fact, that is the reason I ordered it. I love the black accents! The only thing I wasn't expecting was for the material to be so coarse/stiff. It isn't a problem though, because it isn't uncomfortable. The skirt is very full and works for what I need it for.
B00IFXDYX4|4|Picked this up as a prop for a play and it looked pretty good on stage. The FBI letters on my badge were not painted black but this was used for a stage play so I just painted the letters myself. This wouldn't look too good for a movie or photoshoot but did the trick!
B00RL61Q5Y|5|No
B00DQYXH84|3|does not really give me a boost of any sort but it is very comfortable and perfect for work or heavy errand days
B00MH647AE|3|I purchased these pants to deal with an inability to wear a belt after groinal surgery.  They are perfect for the job.  If they have any flaw, it's that they wrinkle at the merest suggestion.  If you don't like ironing in the slightest, you will hate these pants.
B00ABKARS4|5|I really like these. They don't stretch out during the day like the 100% cotton version do. Hanes could do a better job communicating, via their packaging and product info, what makes these different from the other models they offer.
B00DHXY2ZG|5|was good
B00MM1TG7S|5|👍
B00801Q3AW|5|He didn't ask for this shirt, but he's always wanted a &#34;Don't Tread On Me&#34; flag.  He probably still wants the flag, but he thought this was pretty cool for now.
B0002TOZ1E|5|I can only comment on the Gold Toe white Sock.<br />The expression you get what you pay for apply here with this sock that cost $20 dollars for quality that last ten times longer than regular ones that do not pill or get holes in them.<br />I've
B00L9CU2OW|4|Great solution for gaping blouses or low neck line tops. Not too binding and you don't feel like you're wearing them.
B00MN7CQNW|5|**A WORD OF CAUTION!**  (I'll say this first as I feel it is the most important thing if you are considering purchasing this jacket).  This jacket runs small.  I normally wear a medium size for most everything, so I ordered a large size in order to give myself a little extra room for layering articles of clothing underneath.  Still, even with a large size, the jacket isn't very roomy so it isn't conducive to layering.  My suggestion to anyone planning on ordering this jacket is order TWO sizes up.  That will best ensure you get a proper fit and can wear whatever you'd like as far as layering goes beneath it.    That being said, now I can get on with my review...    I adore this jacket.  The design is sleek and minimalist, and the cut is very flattering for a woman's figure--it has a sort of flare quality that creates the appearance of an hourglass shape for the wearer even if she doesn't have one.  It could be worn over casual wear, something slightly dressy, or even over business attire.  The length is perfect--not too long, not too short. It's pretty much the fashion equivalent of a good trenchcoat.  The addition of the soft cuffs with thumb-holes is also an unexpected plus.    As far as utility, the jacket is suited to temperatures typical to a cool or brisk day.  I wouldn't recommend it for temperatures dipping below 30 degrees Farenheit, though, unless you plan on wearing a bunch of layers underneath--which probably won't work out anyway (see above) unless you bought a size that can accommodate this.  The mildly water-resistant outer material could probably withstand a light rain shower or drizzle, but definitely wouldn't hold up in any sort of torrential downpour.  The hood is nice and roomy, however it doesn't have any sort of drawstring-like feature, so during particularly windy moments, the hood does blow back off of your head.  One of the pockets has a hole through which you can route headphones, but I've never used that feature so I couldn't tell you if it works out well or not.    In essence, this is a perfectly fashionable JACKET.  Keep your expectations realistic and don't expect a winter coat.  Don't expect it to withstand winter, period.  This is what I'd definitely categorize as \\"Autumn-wear.\\"  But truly, it's a gorgeous jacket with a very sophisticated design.  If you size your jacket right and are looking for style over utility, this is the jacket for you!
B00HN1ET7E|3|It's a good hat but when ordering I measured and got the hat and did not compensate for material inside of hat making it too tight to wear so now I'm stuck with what I can't wear and wife threw the box away lol so now she has a new hat.........happy wife,happy life
B005M761D6|5|It was a great shirt... until I let my mom wash it lol I don't know how she washed it, but it shrank a bit.<br /><br />It's still a beautiful shirt and very stylish!
B003VOYN82|4|Typical/inexpensive costume, good for a casual party.
B00C5TP3O2|2|Didn't look anything like the picture.
B00I11T3KS|5|Very nice quality wallet!
B000VK7OVW|4|everything was great until the band under the cups quit being a flat band and gathered up under the cups creating a sweaty location and then rubs for occasional rashes.
B00XR56M1G|5|My daughter has recently found the Harry Potter Movies and she loves them.  So, I bought this for my daughters birthday.  She loves it.  I couldn't be happier.  Thank you
B00ITMKBNM|5|I like the feel of the shirt and bold colors and print on the inside of the shirt
B007PYJMEO|5|Wow.. What a bag! It is true what other have said. It is really really big bag. Most likely a carry on bag for vacation or road trip. Even though it is roomy, it has space for your laptop,ipad,cell phone and etc. It also has other compartments where you would be able to store lotion, make up, anything you need for your day. So overall it is a bag where you can store a bunch of stuff and keep it moving.
B008PTAS5A|5|So many bras to choose from - took me years to finally find Bali brand!  This particular bra fits like it was custom made for me.  I am small with average size breasts - (C cup) and for some reason, finding a bra to fit properly was impossible.  Love, love, love this bra.  Light-weight, excellent quality and keeps it's shape while I tend to my 106 acre ranch!  Hope they never stop making this style!
B005KN16SM|5|Purchased this for myself as this is how I've been feeling as of late and want to share how I feel with everyone else!
B00AQA8SHG|4|Love it. Very sexy & comfortable also
B0086UVL8G|5|I have a really hard time finding jeans to fit my little girl. Levi's are the only brand we've found that fit her well and are comfortable. Love the quality and the adjustable waist!
B00GMAEAOY|3|The lace up back was a blessing and a curse. Made for a custom fit but I need this for an out of town event where there would be no one to help me get into the dress. The quality was ok... There were two loops in the back that were sewn into the dress. You couldn't get the strap through to lace up. I'm 5'10&#34; and it was barely long enough. Flats or tiniest of kittens heels if your as tall as me. Made my waist look tiny!
B005MHGFTQ|5|Sounds like a great product, can be washed in the washing machine, colorfast, is very nice, the drawings are beautiful and my baby is looked gorgeous
B00NYQZONU|5|very beautiful , good quality
B007ABX5HM|5|I bought this for my 6 month old to match my 4 year olds police costume. It was cheaper then in the stores. Perfect fit to size also.
B00HJIIGSO|3|Too large for my body
B00LTKLIJM|2|Ordered size 3 for my 2 year old. The dress is to short. But love the color.
B006SRTEG0|5|I LOVE THIS
B00A30AWCS|5|Super cute - fits my 2.5 month old just fine.
B000UK12CK|5|Very nice, comfortable uniform skirt.  It makes a nice change from scrub pants.  I've received many compliments on this skirt from coworkers and the residents at the facility where I work.
B003IH5BQ0|5|this was exactly what we needed for a very particular costume party. My husband didn't even mind wearing this at all and he is not a costume kind of guy!
B004COMHEW|5|This costume arrived way before the delivery date. It's way better than I had hoped for. It's durable and extremely comfortable. I ordered it 1 size higher than my shirt size and it fit perfectly.
B00069PERO|3|For the price I expected a little more, but they are still more than acceptable.
B0006I7IEC|1|It was not too small, that was okay.  It was much too short and &#34;crawls&#34;  A waste of money!
B00KCXJMZE|4|Quality  great just runs very big... ill give this to my pregnant  wife to sleep in
B00HWFCUNG|5|soft and comfortable.
B00570XBB8|5|EXCELENTE
B004YVUIF8|4|Okay
B00CII4QMK|1|Because this item doesn't looks like the picture on amazon, and I tried to replace it but I couldn't because they have a stupid policy that returning's cost as much as the item's price.
B00EHXTLBK|4|My husband loved these but likes the knit ones a little bit better. Runs true to size.
B003NVKI0K|5|fits well and fast delivery
B003V4AL8S|2|the belt was approximately 4-6 inches too long, so it was returned immediately without being worn.  The return process was great.
B0029KJ7BW|5|I am happy with this purchase.  Packaged neatly and shipped in a timely manner. To be honest, I was concerned at first.  I was surprised to see a little pink lining along the collar and questioned, &#34;Was that Eddie Bauer tag just sewn in there?&#34;  But, once I got to school and saw the jumper this one was to replace (after a 6 year old + acrylic paint = mishap) I saw it, too, had that pink collar lining.  So, first grade girl, mother of first grader, and teacher are all happy.
B000P15I56|2|Although the belt clearly has &#34;Genuine Leather&#34; stamped into the back side, this is not leather!<br />Looks like leather but it's too perfect to be real.  The only non-finished edge is at the buckel end.<br />Here you can inspect the &#34;inside&#34; of the strap and it appears to be a felt like material sandwiched between,<br />or laminated between plastic like material.  Buyer beware! I'm surprised that Amazon tolerates the false description.
B00MMZAHEU|5|Material was good.
B008MATMBI|3|the xl seems to fit like a large but it shapes and displaces as it should i like it z.
B0037IYWT2|1|Ordered in November, threw away in July.
B000JGIEBM|3|The seller has quick delivery and I would use them again. The bandana material however is very thin. I rinsed it and wrung (sp?) it out by hand and it tore the material. Its an okay bandana, just be very careful with it and realize it tears easily.
B00CMXZDKU|5|I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this item. I can dress this up and down. Shipping time was great too!
B00KFZIQ4M|2|Just recieved the polo for my daughter. Bought a size large and its too small. didn't realize that Large is a size 6.. Will return.
B005SN5I7Y|5|I bought this item and it works and fits great on my husband. Couldn't be happier. Thank you very much.
B00O8AKKAS|4|It's warm.  But forces you to wear your point tail weird if you loop it through the opening.  So maybe it's my fault,  but don't love it.
B00F0T5JKM|5|very good
B00HXCMIWG|4|These are ok pants. The fabric is a bit stiffer than I'd expected, and it's not as comfy as other pants that I purchased with this one. The fabric is of good quality. Also, these are one of the few pants I've had that are not long. They reach my ankle and I didn't have to hem them. I'm 5'2
B00DS5NX62|3|These slacks are just OK.  The material is very thin - like a summer polo shirt, and so it has no shape.  But I guess it will be good enough for summer use.  I got it on sale so I can't complain.  It is worth what I paid even if I eventually use it as a pajama pant.
B005CSOF9M|5|Great fit and just what I needed to run in.
B0007YXTYI|5|Would recommend this product.  Is comfortable and stays in place. Have worn this product for several years. Now I know the best place to buy them. Amazon had the best price.
B005HYDQRS|4|I joined my colleges Amnesty International organization about a year ago, and one of my family members purchased this shirt for me during Christmas time.<br /><br />I have to say that from a design standpoint this T-shirt is very simple and very nice. I have had this shirt in the wash multiple times and it has barely shrunk and the candle logo shows no signs of breakage. I also enjoy the bright yellow color that doesn't fade and catches one's eye. I have been complemented many times.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this shirt is the fact that if you wear a very dark colored bra underneath the shirt you can see it showing under the material. So I would recommend wearing lighter colored undergarments that won't show up.<br /><br />Overall, I really love this shirt and what is represents, I just couldn't give it 5 stars because of the problem with dark undergarments showing underneath.
B00IOIBOFK|4|The pants are about the same length as all other 2T but the shirt seems like it's a bit small. I'm going to order a 3t set so I have a shirt that's a little longer.
B005W0LRW8|5|This bra is great!  Usually wear a 38 or 40 B, so was a tweeter in this sizing.  Had to exchange the medium for a large, but love it!
B0081TB2CW|5|I bought this dress because I am four months pregnant and really not interested in purchasing an entire new maternity wardrobe.  I am 5'9&#34;, normally a size 8 with a C-cup, and the elastic waistline fits just below my bust and dress is roomy enough to accommodate the entire pregnancy and wear afterwards.  It is sheer and stretchy - not &#34;high quality&#34; but typical for a summer dress.  I did wear a cami underneath since my bra didn't match but I didn't consider it a burden.  The neckline does dip quite low but is not too &#34;scandalous&#34; for summer wear.  There is a bow at the front to tie but it isn't a drawstring so a smaller or larger wearer couldn't adjust the waistline for their wear.  The hem fell to my ankles, so someone shorter than 5'8&#34; would probably have it dragging.  I washed it on cold and hung to dry and had no issues.  I wore it to work but it's comfy enough to lounge in afterwards; it feels a little like a nightgown.  I am quite pleased with this purchase and will buy more colors.
B00D4K1MQY|5|My little girl loves this so much. She looks so adorable when she's wearing it. She never wanted to take the shirt off. It fits exactly as it should and the look on her face when she saw it for the first time was well worth buying this :)
B00FE17UI0|5|I bought this T-shirt as a Christmas present and the recipient just LOVED it.  Good quality T-shirt!!!!!!  I would definitely buy from this company again.
B0041FIBV0|5|This is smaller but that is why my husband liked it. Very nice and box was beautiful for giving it as a gift. Very happy.
B00CYAY046|2|Don't stay up. Crawl down to arch.
B001H0FBVA|5|Bought these as driving gloves for my mum as she has had some cancers remover from her fingers. It was difficult to find full fingered, unlined gloves that were suitable for Australian weather, but these seem ok. I hope they aren't too hot when it gets to summer.
B00F9LLTDM|5|Too bad you have to order a 3X to get a regular XL fit.
B001TV098W|5|this has to be one of my favorite buys off amazon. it is too cute and has a nice silky feel to it. The only thing is that it runs a little small. it's worth every penny!
B00H43II00|1|When I ordered this dress, I either overlooked the statement regarding Asian sizes or said statement had not been posted. I believe it to be the latter as I was comparing the same (pictured) dress from several sellers and diligent in reading the fine print to guide my decision. Sizing aside, however, the dress I received resembled nothing of the dress advertised. The only similarities, really, were the color. Both dresses were black.<br /><br />The dress I received, had it fit, would have been above my knees. The detailing was all wrong, there was lace in spots there shouldn't have been lace, and the fabric itself was very sheer, almost see through. The neckline and sleeves were also wrong when compared to the picture.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and they were able to give me a full refund on the condition I payed the S&H to return it. I contacted Amazon, then, and Amazon's customer service people were kind enough to reimburse my S&H expenses. More than a month later, I've received my refund and am happy again.<br /><br />But... point of this review?<br /><br />Don't purchase this dress unless you want a grab bag with a surprise outfit.
B004EKKI5Y|2|My opinion of this bra is - it is not comfortable if you have a 'fat back'.  The back of the bra rolls up (and the sides).  Flimsy material for a plus-size product.
B007KF1U98|5|Fit well
B00LPBRKBA|3|Pretty colors...soft fabric..way to small for our 3 year old
B0064HI1DQ|3|I suffer with Parkinson's and actively sought a 'front closure' bra. I have not been able to successfully close it. Perhaps my sizing is wrong , but I wear Bali 36C.<br />I will wait until I'm feeling more 'nimble to attempt putting it on again .<br />Ah well.
B0051U1706|5|Love em.
B0012C79CM|2|Was too small - good for someone else in the house - not so hot for me
B008A3WZAC|5|I'm giving it to my grandson for Christman but his father loves it and assures me he will too. I will let you know at a later date.
B000A2KB02|4|Finally ripped the crotch out of my last pair. But durable enough to order 2 more pair.
B004M6UDF0|2|Didn't last very long. Seemed to be cheaply made. Wouldn't recommend.
B00ISQ7T20|5|I am 5'1 and this dress fits perfect. My husband really loved. I will be wearing this dress to my sisters wedding.
B00GEC38ZC|5|Love Love love it! Everybody gave me compliments with this hat. I recommend it to anybody who likes this style of beanies
B001G2L30M|4|It is a good product, and fit right to size, but in between legs it fit in a bit strange way, i guess<br />that they can do better
B00FE4YD50|4|Pleased. Bought for an adult. Had room to grow option. Love the jacket
B00SXTZB9U|5|These are great, they look great, and I feel so free when I am wearing them. totally recommend them.Great service from Shein. Good product. I love wearing my new dress so comfy!!
B00FJ3NL5O|5|I have warn this shoe for 3 years and it is by far the most comfortable shoe I own . Even beats Clarks...and they are very good. When I travel I make sure I have these with me...can walk forever with great comfort. I purchased these in FL on a trip and will get another pair when these finally wear out...if ever!
B00ENLQ3VW|4|Thank you!
B00AWTIBW8|5|I gave this Adorable Carters outfit to my Grand Daughter. It fits well for size.<br />Her parents say as with all Carters clothing it washes & wears well. I am So glad to say that has not changed, her Daddy wore Carter's outfits when he was young. Few companies are still around & keeping there Quality as it has always been.<br />This Floral set is more coral pink in color. The Beautiful Little top has pretty flowers decorating it. The leggings pants are a darker solid color. Fabric is on lighter side, both top & pants are soft 100% cotton.<br />I would highly recommend this purchase.<br />It came well packaged. As always Amazon Prime products (for members) have Free shipping & arrives so quickly, there is never a worry.
B009WSXGBG|5|Slightly large but I'm sure will shrink once I wash them. I'm 6'4 and the 40 tall was just a little big pre-wash
B000OR4FH8|1|I ordered a Khaki skirt, but the skirt looks more of a greenish color than khaki.  Would not purchase this again because the fit also was not great.
B00BQK8MP8|4|Obviously simple tubes with a hole cut out for the thumb. There were a few stray threads around the thumb holes, but snipping them off wasn't a real problem. But they are cute and inexpensive, and they will most definitely do the job, so I am happy.
B008AU8D24|5|Fits as expected.  Fabric softer than I expected from 'twill' description, but OK and color is better than I expected.
B005SRN8TK|5|Multiple complements were had.  Looks good, even 2 years after purchase.
B003FBXX28|3|Make sure you realize how small these are, they would be a lot better if they could be seen by someone standing nearby.  Nobody could read them without asking to look close up.
B001GCVHHQ|5|Great!
B00NX74DX2|5|love it
B00CFR2H8Y|5|Great hat. Well made and relatively inexpensive. Although I am certain that Mr. Mars would look much better in this hat than I do, my lady assures me that she like me just the way I am!
B007VKT7O2|5|My daugher loves these and they are so much softer and flexible than regular jeans.  One big plus is that she can wear jeggings on days that she has gym, which is twice a week.
B00D8SLC7G|2|the model on the picture looks fine. but it is not fine on me. quality is ok, but far from fashion
B00GBT8QM8|4|Overall very cool!  I ordered two hats, ones ears were kind of wonky but still managable hat.
B00IGI09U4|5|This leggings are great! I need something to protect my legs because I work outside. I'm not hot in them and they are very comfortable!
B00JBH2T16|5|Very nice &#34;stop the chafing&#34;  shapewear. I'm gonna be honest: I don't buy shapewear to tighten me up. I hate being uncomfortable. So, I ordered above my size. It's very comfy that way and keeps my thighs from rubbing under skirts/dresses. I with they were shorter--more mid-thigh, and I'm not sure if they make mid-thigh--so I could wear with my above-knee length skirts/dresses. As it is, these only work with below-knee styles or the shaper shows. But the lace is pretty.<br /><br />If you just like light shaping and comfort without chafing when walking, go HIGHER. I wear 2x  (3x when they run small or I want it loose) and I got the 4x and it's comfy.<br /><br />Update: After purchasing 4 of these (or five, I forget), I changed my rating to 5 stars. I really find these comfortable under skirts, even today in 93% weather, I wore this in place of a slip. Stops the chafing without being constricting. For folks who want a lot of shaping, maybe not still. But if you want no chafing, comfortable, longer sort of shapewear with a nice lace accent, here you go. I've had mine long enough to ocnsider them a staple. I'm wearing 3x now and it's snug without constriction and no chafing at all, ie, no chub rub. :D Comfortable.
B00RCL0O8S|4|Love this! Very cute! I want more in other colors!
B00K4QBPZY|4|The patches had lots of string hanging off so it looked a bit frayed.
B004YVUJS4|5|The wife loves these. They have no edges so they never rub the wrong way, and don't show through tight clothes.
B00MFAW4AM|5|This thing has seriously been one of the best investments I've made in 2014. Not only does it light up, it also goes through a series of patterns/colors so it's constantly changing. I can't even tell you the number of times I get stopped by people asking where I got it from. It's also very handy at big parties when my friends are looking for me. But seriously, if you want to add some fun to the next rave you go to, I can't recommend this enough! Just as a precaution, it does run a TAD big, but nothing too unmanageable. Size down if you can!
B001D3RAGK|1|Terrible wig, awful quality, way over priced.    Wish I never bought this wig. Do not make the same mistake.
B00MXIT8PK|2|too big for my body size
B006WRGOF0|4|Wanted to buy a bow tie for a holiday party and I've been very happy with this one. Good quality and ties without much fuss (once I figured out how to tie a bow tie in the first place -- thank you, YouTube!) I would definitely recommend
B00NPBZ5Z6|4|Nice
B0018VDRPU|1|Doesn't fit right, too baggy in the legs and the inseam of the legs hangs too low.  I feel I have to roll the waist line to get them to fit.
B008JHY6G0|2|Product was cheaply put together and was not comfortable or fit the size that was ordered. Way too small with no room to close.
B0081UB1D6|5|Arrived on time with the two day shipping! Not damaged at all! I love it very much! It's very cool wearing these, especially because it's my first morph suit! I recommend it for everyone!
B00E1PX0SE|5|I bought this wig fir a redneck party and everyone loved it! This wig is exactly as advertised. The wig fit comfortably.
B00ITLHWFI|3|I liked the dress, just expected better quality of material
B007W0WNP6|5|I enjoy this belt and wear it for occasions where I need to dress up and it does the trick!
B00USIICAE|4|I am 5'2&#34; 127# and I ordered a medium and they fit perfectly around my waist. The material is stretchy and thin, which makes these pants really comfortable. The pants are extremely long, but I am also extremely short. I definitely cannot wear them with flats, but can wear them with heels.
B00PLXN5OE|5|Just what I needed to fit my boots and shoes without added thickness. I'm 5'8&#34; and they fit to my knee.
B009XC879W|1|Waste of money and time...one was broken and black paint was chipped.
B00CEH1Y98|4|I like the material; fit and feel are lovely.
B00APFET8Y|5|I was VERY pleased with my purchase!  I agree with other comments regarding needing a hoop skirt or petticoat to go under the dress.  I was extremely happy with the seller - the expected delivery date was 4-6 weeks but with one simple email they shipped it ASAP and I had it in 7 days at no extra charge!!
B00H97J12K|1|i thought this was such a beautiful lace up to buy; but in person it looks so ugly and cheap. the buttons in front are so huge! The silver clip ons are visible for everyone too see. it looks does NOT FIT or even LOOK the way it does on in this picture. it fits too small and does not curve ur body the way it shows here ....DONT BUY IT .. this doesn't even deserve 1 star
B004DQYISM|5|one size should fit most<br />its great for those who want the flap flat or not<br />I like wearing it however I like<br />but where's the 'Legacy' title?<br />oh well
B00FEW5XZ6|3|This bag is HUGE....ok for overnights or diaper bag. I like the looks and it would be good<br />If it came in next size down. As for FAUX leather yes it does look like FAUX leather but<br />What. do yo expect for less than $30
B00BFN092U|5|My grandson loves the shirt and I like that it is silk screened rather than a plastic transfer. Delivery was prompt and shirt fits well.
B00BJPTBNM|3|I just received this hoodie and I do like it but is not fully what I expected. For $47, I would expect it to be like a sweatshirt material but it isn't. It is more like a thicker t-shirt. It is definitely not worth $47. If it was at a store, it would probably retail for $25. Also, I wear about a size 11 in juniors and a large is slightly tight. I will either have to deal with it or deal with the hassle of trying to return it. This is why I usually don't buy clothing online. It is never what it seems. Live and learn.
B00AWB12EA|5|These are my go to support panties after c section! Had to buy extra pair! Great support at a decent price!
B000Y8G16U|5|Perfect
B00C0COCSC|3|Belly is fine. Penguin usually fits me great. Shoulders are also tight and narrow, but I can pull it off. But great looking shirt.
B002BSGWBU|3|The quality of this Gown is very good. But it doesn't suit my son. I purchased it when he was 4 month old but still kind of small for him. Also, I was expecting a glove to cover on his hand to prevent from scraching. From the picture, it looks it has the attached gloves, but not. So I ended up return this product. It may be good for other babies, but not mine.
B00KDEZKVC|5|The jacket fits perfect and is much nicer than I expected considering the price.  Material and construction looks good. Great find!
B008JH9O62|4|I love these PJs and they help me get my little guy dressed at night b/c he looks forward to wearing his trucks.  I usually go to Amazon for deals, but I really needed some warm footie PJs, so I paid a price higher than I wanted.
B005HF5QIO|5|the fit was prefect, need more colors such as red,blue and green
B00WJDRFMC|5|In love so perfect and I got it on time
B001LRFZ1A|5|They are Carhartt.  I have three pair and two of them the most, seem to fit a little bigger than my other Carhartt jeans, but not much.  I wear them to work every day.  They usually last 2-3 years.
B00O3NNW9G|5|Love these!  Perfect fit!  Great quality!
B007VQNFNK|3|I'm wearing the socks, but it seems they could be a little tight for a person's circulation?
B00LW2W1YI|4|The jacket is very nice but it's to small for my daughter I just want to buy another one with the right size...
B005XAZWDM|1|the zipper broke a day after we got it, it was cheaply made I will not be ordering another one
B007P28SRS|5|I love Bruce Lee, he is a great example and a great motivator.<br />I just saw the shirt and wanted it. Its a comfortable shirt<br /><br />Just a great shirt for anyone who loves martial arts
B00F0NBU0Q|5|Yes, they're a little small but I got these for my 11 yr old granddaughter and they're fine for her.
B005QHRE10|5|good quality as always, great shape.<br /><br />i like it, while it really fit my body.<br /><br />maybe i will get others for a try.
B002BZVONY|5|Very nice so far - for a 6'5&#34; person - the tall XL is perfect.
B003XT041U|4|Bought this dress just for something fun, I'm not a 'dress' type of girl, but I'll make an exception for this one!  Really fun, you can dress it up or dress it down.  VERY FAST shipping too! I got it much faster then I expected!  I honestly think that the model in the picture doesn't do the dress justice because it really is a 'one size fits all' style dress.  The halter is completely adjustable and you can just tie it yourself.  I can't wait until the weather is better so that I actually have a chance to wear the dress to the beach.  Currently, it still has the tags on it, and I'm a little nervous about what'll happen when I wash it... but overall, this is a great purchase for anyone! I really love peace signs and I think this dress is SUPER cute and at a great price! THANK YOU!
B004GKJCBI|4|They are very cute and good quality but they fit just right no room to grow don't go by the size chart by one size up from what you need.
B008LWWV74|4|Needed black shorts for band performances outside on hot days.  These fit the bill.  Require a belt though to keep the waist cinched in from the usual back gap oasis issues that women's jeans typically have.  I purchased size 8, and I'm 130 lbs, 5' 4\\"
B005CSOQJQ|4|Good fitting bra!!!
B001AUCGC4|5|Great costume.  I was surprised that it looked so nice.  It's a little itchy, but that's not a big deal.  Runs pretty true to size too.  The only \\"complaint\\" is that the neckline of the red part is odd.  I am large busted but come no where near filling this out.  It doesn't look bad though, just doesn't lay as nicely as I'd like.
B00KAVWO80|5|Love this bathing suit! I feel super very comfortable in it as it covers my belly completely. I am 5'1 about 145 lbs, size 6 or 8, 36C. Make sure to order up a few sizes. I ordered an XL and it fits me perfectly.
B005GYGEWI|4|The only reason I am giving this product 4 stars is because I have a bigger butt so the leggings are slightly see through I'm that area. But overall they fit great and are extremely comfortable! Perfect for working out!
B00O7JPIKC|5|Purchased this set for a gift to someone, they purports loving the feel and beautiful color combinations, absolutely adorable!
B00K86YNQI|5|They're super cute and the boutique's thank you note was a fun detail :)
B00GNU65MI|1|Pure quality product<br />Would not buy again
B00ELI7N5C|5|Thank you.
B003UJPIVE|5|This dress is so comfortable and fits great!!! I love it an plan on buying another one in a different color!!! :)
B004B8QHOK|4|they worked. came in time. look good and seem well made. Ears are bendable which is, of course,  a major plus.
B007P8A6Y0|5|I am usually a XL or XXL (big boobs and extra love in the middle) The fit is small. I bought expecting it small. I got this to go under a sweater with a scoop neck that had holes. this is perfect, and comfy. again it is very fitted not tight, and not tight under arms. but definitely would never wear with out something over it to hide my 'roundness'
B008KK1CTU|5|This is just adorable.  Well made and worth every cent!  Would definitely recommend. Seems true to size.  good quality. 5 stars
B00A2J5MIO|5|These gloves fit my hands perfectly. I have small hands so medium fit was fine. I love putting them on. Very soft and warm inside. Perfect for driving on cold winter days. I don't  use the smartphone touch feature as no gloves will be as accurate as my actual fingers, but it does work.  Great purchase!
B00ELYN7UG|4|The sweater fit well for a 115 lb. figure. Large would be as expected. It came shortly after purchase. It fit hip length and I loved the color because I'm trying to put more color into my wardrobe. If I could rethink my choices, I believe I would have purchased extra-large because I like roomy, loose clothing.
B007BL1LU4|2|i've only worn these once and it was when it was snowing and the temps were right at 30. My hands were freezing and wet after shoveling snow for 5 minutes. They look awesome, and i got them for a cheap price, but I was disappointed in the overall performance. will give them another shot, but think they will get donated.
B00939U07C|5|Love these! They're super cute and match my red scrubs perfectly.  All my nurse friends love them. They're very comfortable and they fit well. I have larger legs and they fit just fine and didn't slide down at all.
B00NB6NC2I|5|The suit is really comfortable and I like how it fits the shipping was fast and am really happy with my jumpsuit . 👍🏼👍🏼😃
B0050JDVTS|2|First of all the material had a really strong chemical smell that took several washes to wear off. Secondly, on the chest, the pattern of the fabric is sewn so that it stops mid-breast on one side and makes my boobs look completely uneven. Not worth any money as far as I'm concerned, but I'm not good at returning things so I kept it as a house dress.
B008BDXB90|5|My husband loves the fit and softness of this top.
B00EVOO61K|5|Replaced Spanx....better quality and fit
B00CTLKPU8|5|This size for 8 years old fits very well to my son. For boys  aged 8 years it fits actually perfectly.
B006LPT2K2|5|Perfect
B0053EWNG2|2|these legwarmers are NOT 2-6x...they are for pre teenage girls! Way too big! The quality is decent, however. I would not buy them for a toddler girl.
B008F4G4KS|2|An XL is more like a L due to the sides being tailored and the arms being too skinny. I had to return it.
B00X6F0STY|5|I always choose to support small, independent businesses whenever possible and this one did not disappoint. This is the first in my soon-to-be large collection of Bernie Sanders gear. Thanks for a great product!
B00729TNT6|5|I love it's the best my friends like it and my mom? I recommended to my friends because it's so amazing.
B00BCW73VY|5|Great dress and looks amazing! Worn it at weddings and even in the office
B00AQ4SDJU|1|NOT A GOOD FIT AT ALL AND WILL BE RETURNING IT AND POOR QUALITY WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING.
B00LJKNQMY|3|I am was made of good quality and stick but I typically wear an extra large and this was extremely small on me. This would probably be best on the size no larger than medium (US sizes)
B00DGEKWL4|5|A bit pricy for a keychain, but happy with my purchase.<br />Item as pictured.
B003B9ESBY|5|To the max.
B00LIS0FVC|2|I ordered a 3xlt and it felt like a tight 2xlt. This jacket is more like a in between a Carhart Xl and 2XL. Also not very thick. Maybe good for 25 and higher on the mercury but no real substance for any thing colder.
B005CW07S6|4|Love these briefs and are larger than the previous brief (same kind). They don't fit as tight are a little baggy and not low rise bikini's but high hip fit.
B0009PUJT8|4|I love this dress, but think it is a junior cut.  I will wear it with tights, I think.  The material, color, and structure of this dress is very, very nice; I know I will have fun wearing the dress.  However, had I known each item I bought had separate shipping charges, I may not have made any purchases.  The s&h on a few items were as much or more than the item cost.  Of course, this is not this seller's fault and I thank him for this quality item.
B00GO0LX9M|5|Looks great, comfortable. Thanks
B00ZMYDLDC|5|Excellent garment at very good price.
B00FHAE7X4|5|I usually wear a medium, got a large to have some room, but it's a perfect fit.  Love the color.
B00IABHXKG|5|Super soft shirt, great design.
B00DFAIPGS|5|Keep you warm
B00GS7XO7K|2|wayyy to small-- bought others from the same place and they fit great...will b trying to sell this to a smaller friend.
B00J235E02|3|They are definitely cute and made well, but my size 10 feet just don't fit these comfortably. There are pre-made seams in the fabric to help keep your foot in place that I would step on because my foot was bigger than the space given.
B0016J9UDM|5|the fit was fine i like them and THANKYOU
B00O3GS56I|4|great feel material abd comfort. my boyfriend  loves it..
B00HFIANBG|5|the material is a little thin so a nice cami underneath is a definitely. Overall very cute with leggings and boots
B006VR8EXQ|3|This bra is comfortable, but it is not &#34;barely there.&#34; You can clearly see the outline of this bra when you wear a fitted shirt. I had to return it.
B00BZDTHBY|5|It fit perfect and it is very warm! Very good for east cost winter. The color is a little bit darker but it really doesn't matter
B004CO4EKC|4|This is very comfortable even after washing it the fist time. Very nice to touch. Will buy some more later on.
B0091IZ0G6|5|This top is a nice fabric (a little clingy, but in the right places), and it is very comfortable. It looks good under a jacket or a sweater without being to bulky. The color is rich and deep.
B00B7WP3IO|5|It was a Christmas gift so I cant really comment on it honestly. It was one of the gifts requested by the recipient.
B00EKG5O24|3|This is a great backpack, I only wish the zipper on the main section had lasted longer than 6 months. I use this bag for work every day and have gotten multiple compliments on it. However last night the main zipper broke in two spots and I'm unable to fix it without replacing the entire zipper. I'm going to continue using the bag as long as I can, but will have to start looking for a new one.
B00OT4DGP4|5|Not dressy, but perfect for casual wear. Love it!
B00C7LIQWO|4|Dress purchased for a 4 year old and it fit quite well. Strong material which should last through a number of washings. Suitable for warm weather.
B00L2CM5XA|5|This dress looks very elegant worn with a wide belt.  Try different colors... I use gold.
B002HJ377A|5|The world may not be ready for you in this shirt or you may not be ready for the world in this shirt.  Mine has yielded me with seductive powers with the fairer sex beyond the realms of mortal man.<br /><br />This shirt is not for everyone....be sure you can handle it before you hit \\"Add to Cart\\"<br /><br />A must have for the aspiring ninja.<br /><br />I'll probably being adding at least one of these to almost every amazon purchase I make.
B00MWE9GT8|4|excellent
B009LHGBGK|5|These are my go-to retirement tees.  I live where it gets hot and stifling in the summer and these tees allow me to leave home due to the fact that the cotton is what another retailer calls \\"tissue\\" cotton.  I have more of these tees than I'd like my husband to know about, but will no doubt buy more because they are quality, hold up well, don't shrink and \\"say\\" something.  The sizing can be a bit iffy.  Chaser sizes go according to the contemporary size chart for women where the sizes are:<br />Sizing: XS=00-0, S=2-4, M=6-8, L=10-12<br /><br />Try one...<br />(I am MRS. J. Guy)
B0042PUU0O|4|Super excited by this vest.  Purchased for my brother for our trip to the Ren Fest.  Love that it can be reversed.  Offers different looks with just one piece.  Thick material. Arrived super quick!
B00BUECJKE|5|I realized after ordering that the company recommends ordering a size up. The shirt fit, but I wish I had taken that advice! The shirt itself is very cool and my son loves it. Thanks!
B00BI44RLA|4|The color and style of this was great.  Loved the lace top.  However, the length of it was entirely too long.
B00GQTQVHA|5|I have received more compliments on this jacket than anything I have purchased in the last 20 years.  I have this jacket in both black and red.  The black can be classy and formal, and the red adds a surprising spark to jeans.  Love Neon Buddha styles.
B000BNSDSC|5|I LOVE this t-shirt; it is now my favorite.  I get a lot of compliments.  Even my 89-year old mother said she loved all of the colors in it and when I mentioned the old rock group - The Grateful Dead, her response was \\"I remember that name\\"! It's just a very FUN shirt to wear.  Quality is excellent - and it has not faded out over the many washings, just looks better every time!
B00I38TU48|5|I purchased the purple/black one which is not listed now, however I am overly pleased with the quality, color and design. Looks better than what I was expecting. Recently got purple highlights and this headband set them off. Will continue to shop from this seller!
B00H5LO1BG|5|It's comfortable, I love that it has pockets, fits just right and I got tons of compliments
B002HJ3DKG|4|I use these so my shoes don't stink when I don't wanna wear full pantyhose. Don't put them in the dryer cause they will shrink and then they slip all the time. Other than that I like them. Good for work shoes.
B00QHCI8KY|5|Washes well. Colors have stayed bright. I'm happy.
B00DUWZ8M0|4|These are basically exactly as I expected them to be, slightly small.  My son is 9 and of average height and a bit below average in weight.  I bought size 10 and they fit him perfectly.  He loves them!
B00IO32GM0|5|This is a great sweater, I am 5'10 170lbs and I have size medium. It's form fitting and if you want a long life out of this item, I would be careful to follow the washing instructions as it is 100% cotton
B00I16NHTG|5|The style of top are awesome! Love it, its soft and good looking.... fits well and nice. I really love this Top. and they made good time on the shipping. And size is perfect.
B004PBJ2UE|5|I put it on after 3days of being in the hospital i totally love it and very satisfyed with the results im seeing..
B004M6XUI2|5|This is a soft wallet. I feel baaaad for the sheep that haaaad to be destroyed for my money holder. And many other wallet holders around the world. But as Aunt Jinny used to say, &#34;One sheep is 1000 others wallet and food.&#34;
B00HJ6P75Q|5|I was not sure how it would look and fit but to my surprise jacket fits great. I would definitely recommend this to others.
B003OQTY1I|4|I have received this shirt in Ukraine. It is made well. However it too big for me - Medium, but as XL.   I regret that have not read reviews earlier.  From-zo a problem of the size I put 4.
B004BA076C|4|love this pant.  the waist is so comfy, no digging, no adjusting, no red marks.  Sorry, but I have a tummy and hate  being in uncomforatble scrubs for 12 hours.  Let's be real, there are not many of us who can wear the little junior fit low rider scrub pants to work and be effective.  It's like a 3 inch waist band so no digging, folding, rolling, adjusting through out the day
B00CONNILE|4|Rides up a little but that's as expected! I like it.
B0018K0SR6|5|I can't believe how realistic this wig looked based on the price!  Great deal!  It fit comfortably and did it's job on Halloween.
B00OFPEAW0|5|Perfect. It was just the perfect finishing touch to my son's Graduation Outfit.
B00ICHCPI8|1|I ordered a size small it is so large on me there is about 7 inches of extra fabric on the bottom the armpits hit somewhere around my waist the only dress that is offered in an extra small is twice the price of any others bad deal for me all around
B00CENWBF8|5|Keys 97cm, weight 14kg 32 개월 daughter goes well. The size is good, the underpants so far like it.<br />Summer seems to fit in neat.
B008XG4HKC|4|Very light and thin. Exactly what I was looking for.
B00PJB0BCW|3|These panties are very pretty, but if you have full hips good luck getting them on. They don't offer much stretch or ease. Granted, I am a bigger girl. I am 5'3&#34; and typically wear a size 20/22 I decided to go with 3X (which usually is kinda big on me). These however, did not work.
B002AQ6F6A|3|I would have rated it higher but the button closure came off on the 2nd time I wore the pants.  Poor quality control.  I always thought Dockers Men's Pants were prepared with better quality.
B00KHM9C1E|2|It keeps falling, I could pull this to the top of my armpits and it would still manage to fall to my wast (I got a small and I'm a 34-B and this is tightened to is fullest extent) it has loops for additional straps (not included) but one time through the wash and now only one is left.<br />Do not get.
B004AZ98PO|5|Love the brand and its overall product.  The shade of grey compliments every shirt or jersey that my son wears with it.  Love the cut and length, as I often fold it , to give it that desired look that I'm looking for.
B007W0XRK6|5|very natural and just enough enhancement
B00B1W0EP2|1|This is not an American Apparel shirt. It is printed on heavy cotton Anvil. That could not be more different then what is described in the description. Very disappointed.
B0080HKJWE|5|My new favorite shirt
B009SDU20S|5|The packaging was damaged upon arrival, but the product wasn't the least bit touched. The metal-work is beautiful and easily bendable to my facial shape. The plastic it arrived in was stuck to a couple of the jewels and pulled them off with it when removed. Otherwise, I'm very fond of this product.
B008S47E40|5|Loved how this is a formed mask and not a flat mask - it is much more comfortable.  Even the inside doesn't make you feel as &#34;sweaty&#34; as some of the flat plastic masks.  Well worth every penny - I highly recommend anything from SODIAL - search them.  They have lots of different products at excellent prices.  Good inexpensive costume stuff.
B00YD4ZFTA|5|Adorable and comfy
B00IY9MK5W|5|This shirt looks cute on my son. Its definitely a hot pink.
B009DEP9LY|5|This skirt was a present for a friend setting up her life hundreds of miles away.  It was assuring to select something that was not size sensitive.  The feedback I got was overwhelming gratitude.  Easy to wear, easy to care.  Comfortable and lined.  Something for work or at home.  I have since sent several similar skirts in a variety of colors.  Equally appreciated!!.
B007OU6O54|1|I got theses jeans to match my boyfriend true religion sage  jacket, once they arrived we found out they where fake!!
B0009GHP2Q|5|very good material, durable, and holds up to many washes.
B004I7B1TA|1|Since I have not ordered from Roamans before I ordered based on my measurements that they publish.  I had to return the sweater and order one 2 sizes smaller, and it's still too big.  I got my refund minus the amount of shipping I paid plus they subtracted a $7.50 return fee.  They \\"courteously' refunded the fee after I got upset about it.  So be careful because their sizing is WAY off and you will likely end up returning what you order.  I was told yesterday they get a \\"huge\\" amount of returns.  I guess this is why.
B00IODQKWC|5|So cute!
B001E1FJEG|5|Most wonderful pants, fit great, don't have to keep hiking them up when you sit down or bend over as with low riders, very comfortable to wear, look even better on :) Been wearing these jeans for a year and they still look great! Plan on buying them forever.
B00W6LYD0O|2|Great material and color and style but I went as the chart said and ordered a medium (my regular size) and it was too large. The arms fit well but the stomach was way too lose. I don't think I can order the small because of the arms but I would need a small all around elsewhere. Contemplating just getting it taken in because it's a beautiful dress... I am 5'10&#34; 140 lbs, 36&#34; 28&#34; 38&#34;
B00COYZOZG|3|Great to enhance clothing
B00EZRZXA6|4|I ordered a 2xl and it was just a little bit smaller than I expected. Still fit, but I prefer a little extra room, so Iif you're like me, you might want to order a size bigger than what you normally wear. Otherwise, it's a great shirt, representing one of the greatest bands of the '90s. Can't really go wrong!
B00MDH7T0W|5|This dress is as beautiful in person as it is on the computer. I did have a delay in shipping (expected delivery was between January 14th- January 22nd  however it came on January 27th). Customer service was very good. They answered my emails and got back to me so fast. I love this dress. The material is thicker that what was expected, but that's good because it isn't see through. It is very stretchy so I would recommend getting it very fitted. I am usually a size 2-4 so I ordered a 10 according to their sizing, however I should of ordered a size down just to make it more fitted around the waist.<br /><br />Love it, will be purchasing more colours.
B00WNBDYZW|2|Had a bad smell when it arrived and I wouldn't really say its fitted
B00GGHAFTM|5|Gift for my son who loved it!
B004K2W0KC|5|These are fabulously functional, practical, and beautiful dresses!  That's the best I can define their usefullness, wearability, and eye appeal.
B00EAEB5JM|5|very flattering
B00CPYIKGA|5|This wig is beautiful! I'm using it for a cosplay, and it's very thickly wefted, and the fibers are fairly high quality. The wig was a bit shiny compared to what I'm used to, since I usually order from very high quality wig sites, but this was easily fixed with talcum powder. The fibers are super soft and highly pigmented. The blue is especially pretty!<br />Customer service is incredible! They contacted me when they shipped my wig to make sure the address was correct, and to let me know how long it would take to arrive.<br />This shipped in about 10 business days, which was AMAZING compared to what I expected. I would highly recommend this seller and wig &#60;3
B00KDHN46C|3|it has a cheap zipper that I;m scared will break off eventually
B0013EE0K8|5|Cheap and just what I wanted.
B008ODSK7A|4|This dress was very flattering. Only wish the belt piece was detachable. I added another belt over it to create more definition for my fuller waist.
B000OR9GB8|5|as expected
B00AOHH6VK|2|Not very impressed with the fitting.
B00BOO4FE8|5|Nice quality
B003ANLJ4U|4|These waist extenders are well made and comfortable to use. Unlike plastic versions, you can keep them on the pants and put them through both the wash & dry cycles.  Doing this, I was able to keep them on my pants for six months before the buttons failed.
B0092P482K|4|First there are no shoes. I'm pleased with everything else the material was thicker then I thought which made me happy the head needs to be stuffed I used a towel and some under shirts. I'm 6 feet tall and a thin guy so I wanted to fill out the mid section to look more like a giant teddy bear. So I took an eh crate for a twin size bed wrapped it around my body and got into the jump suit and it worked wonderful. You can cut the egg crate if needed for more or less fluff. The only other negative thing other then no shoes would be the velcro which could be better. I'm happy I bought it I would recommend.
B002APZM5G|5|good
B00BCXO7LM|5|For the price you can't beat this pretty little girls dress. It fit's as expected, it is lovely to take pictures in especially for Christmas.
B000UCFGPW|5|This skirt is just what I wanted for travel.It really gives you 2 skirts with 2 different looks for the price of one.It is a long skirt on me and I think it could not be shortened.
B003H21FHU|4|A little big, but its an adult size not a child's.
B00EW0Q03K|3|I was shocked at the workmanship of this product knowing the manufacturer. The pearls on the hat are very loose and I am going to have to find a way to secure them so that they do not fall off, possibly glue them. I was also surprised at how cheap looking the lil diamond studs are. Once I add my own touch I believe that I can make this hat meet my expectations. For the price I shouldn't have to do anything to it...but I really love it overall.
B00AOI3I2U|5|I love the dress itself, however it was shipped with the link belt on the dress itself, rather than being in tissue or a small plastic bag, so there was a pull in the dress from one of the links on the belt. Too bad, someone should have thought the material might pull.
B00A76JKQ2|5|Great jacket
B00J59B3C6|4|The bottoms fit snug and the cups in the top are slightly too large ( I'm a small a-cup) but it's very cute and really soft!
B003IHS1GM|5|Absolutely great looking pants. Have a flat front look that looks amazing. Would definitely recommend.
B00MNUPPLY|5|This is a fitted sweater.  No looseness to it but that is how is should fit.  My daughter likes it so much I am ordering black too.  Adds sleeves to a sleeveless dress without ruining the profile of the dress.
B0052WBU1E|5|These jeans are a great fit for your man if he has fit legs; yet needs room in the waist!
B00B9L462C|5|Very comfortable fit, I like my hat.
B005VO3BHY|3|My son is wearing a size 10 for Kanu Surf so I tot get him this in 10 is good, but this runs bigger. So I gotta keep it a little longer before he can wear it. And the front I can't tie it smaller so he needs to grew.
B00F6MPOVW|5|Excellent....
B00UZSAX1I|5|This is my 3rd pair of these pants. I love the comfort and the fit. I'm sure pair #4 is in my future!
B00ATVS9MQ|5|Purchased for 2&3 year olds little bit big on them I figured they will grow in to them great price super cute with boots
B00FARD88O|5|I have been looking a long time for a shirt/tank top that would be flattering to my figure - this fits perfectly! :) I have 4 and am planning on purchasing 6 more!! I love all the colors too - excellent tank for those who don't like their backside hanging out when they bend over ;)
B007WAF8TO|5|Great buy, very cute. Long sleeve or roll up. Great for the office or out. Chain accent is cute too
B009VMUGHK|3|This shirt shrunk in the wash. I would suggest going a size or 2 larger if you order this shirt.
B00GYTNSLO|1|Long sweater? It was a tummy shirt and no return slip in the package waste of time and money
B013CSAX9O|5|This is a great wallet, it holds my keys very snug and all of the cards I need. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice wallet that also holds keys. It is a little large but thats because of the keys. It's a good trade off, the extra size to hold the keys.
B009RILC7G|3|Little snug for the size.  Not a true fit.
B0099ICA9S|4|With a sleeveless turtle neck under it ....it was perfect
B00UF77YQQ|4|I am actually really impressed with this jacket.  It has pads in the wrists, elbows, shoulders and the back.  The leather is a nice feel, the sewing is good and it look quite nice.  my only complaint is that there is no way to cinch it around the waste.  Other than that, great!!
B00SU6PGA0|5|Beautiful top....fits perfectly
B0047N101O|3|Comfortable to wear. Not as wrinkle free as I had hoped. Need something with more adjustable waist. Have a pair that I really like.
B001MAAGX8|3|Well for the price i paid it is and ok wallet. Wish it was a little thicker but it will work
B001PIHRIE|4|I've used these for my spinning class and pilates class. If you aren't afraid to show off any leg, these shorts are attractive to use. They are comfortable, stretchy, will last a long time, and look good, but not the best for a spinning class since they ride up, then allow the inner thigh to rub on the bike seat. They do make my tushy look good though!!!
B00AKKB1NA|4|There's no such thing as &#34;One Size Fits All&#34;<br />I have very large breasts and the top fits well - as in it covers my nipples and stays tied.<br /><br />Obviously this is not to be worn as an actual bra, but as a novelty item, and it works as such.<br /><br />The bottoms - I didn't even try on because I have a huge rear and I knew from the get-go they wouldn't work.
B00IDHAHS2|1|Bought 2, both too small.  Not happy at all.
B003021UBS|4|0K
B00LFGU8VO|5|Awesome guys even sent me an extra Tie or a matching style!! Very perfect look and length for me at 6'3&#34;
B00MUXUK28|5|Perfect!!
B008TXGI06|4|Got this for $8 dollars so great deal otherwise dont think its  worth $25. Yes the leather is nice and it does have graphics on the bill holder inside pocket but if you need to carry business cards they dont fit in the slots. Also it is super thin hard to hold more than 7-8 bills unless they are crisp. Held up so far with everyday use still looks new and I have had it for almost 4 months.
B00HT12ZNI|5|This top is very flattering for me because I'm tall and thin. I really love it! I liked it so much I got it in another color !!
B00PL1WI62|5|Better than I expected for the price. I bought two more colors because I like it so much. It is long enough to nicely double wrap but lite enough not to feel too warm.
B004B9YKV6|5|Purchased the Cherokee flexibles top at a local store but they didn't have the pants available in a petite length so I ordered here. I was worried that the color wouldn't match my top but it's perfect and the fit was just right.
B00UFA79V8|3|Get a size bigger
B00DST8ILI|5|The hat is great! Fits well and looks good
B009GGVW6U|4|I really like the style of these jeans.  But I have bought several pairs of Gloria Vanderbilt over the years, and they are  heavier denim, and sized larger.  Usually I have to buy a size down, but these are my regular size and kinda' tight.  The price was however very reasonable.  They are certainly worth what I paid for them,  But not exactly what I expected.
B00GFMS5SG|3|The socks feel thinner than the traditional Gold Toe, but were good for the price. So just ok for me....
B00FRGSYFA|4|its so cute and is a little snug but not to a point where i wouldnt wear it. this is a great hoodie when youre not sure what to wear. its cute an comfortable
B00K5T88IM|4|Has become my go to sweatshirt for the gym. Very comfortable. Bought a second. May purchase a third.
B00C2JR81Q|5|This is so GREAT! It looks like high quality, not cheap material. The accessories are a nice touch. Sexy but classy.
B00B1H5FC4|3|I made the misteak of ordering the wrong size but it does make you sweat when you are running or exericsing
B007C9LSGW|1|Purchased this and got it yesterday.  It is at best a tight large verging on a medium and I ordered the XXL.  Some of the worst sizing i have ever experienced.  it is going back. Also there is some kind of writing blazoned across the back of the shirt.  Guess I missed that in the pics....
B00LO2T7B6|5|Love these socks. Very comfortable and fit great!
B002P8X9IK|3|A little tight I the hip area
B0014UEVHI|5|man's shirt but I'm a woman.  but shirt fits great.  not tight.  material is good.  design is striking.  love the original Godzilla think he's cute.  wanted one & this design just jumps out at you.  very pleased w/it.  it is a long slim fit type shirt but no problem for me.  I love t shirts. came through washings all right hasn't shrunk faded yet.
B00AHTK0CM|5|I have been running for years plus I do bootcamp and spin. Nothing fits like Champion sports bras. The best thing is that they come off easily when you are sweaty from a run. The band is comfortable and the support is great even for runs up to 17 miles. I own several colors and this is the only brand I will wear. Note: I would wear a small according to the chart but I always buy a medium so you may want to go one size up for maximum comfort.
B000OG87DW|5|Not being the average girl - about 215lbs, work in a factory, and LOVE horror movies - I always hated the designs and slutty, &#34;vacuum-packed&#34; sizes available in womens' clothing. I love clothing that is baggy, last a long time, and worth the money - all The Mountain shirts fit my needs. They're big in sizes (XL and up), last a long time (over 7 years now of crawling through dust and small places), and are beautiful artworks in themselves. Only one of my 12 The Mountain shirts I own have started to unravel at the stitches at the bottom of the shirt. So if you're looking for larger size, beautifully designed shirts than The Mountain shirts are just for you!
B0057X87YQ|5|Love this shirt. Shipped fast.  Fits good.  Looks great.  The quality seems good but time will tell how it holds up to wash and wear.
B004X8H8BO|4|This bra can feel a little loose when you're empty, but when you're full it offers the perfect support. Great price, too.
B0018OR0P0|5|My son needed 32&#34; x 38&#34; jeans.  A hard to find size, but Levi's came through.  The last pair of jeans I bought for him was from a much more expensive competitor (named for a precious metal).  In addition to not caring about the name brand, my son said the Levi's are much more comfortable...especially the way they are cut and don't 'ride up.'  I have always been a fan of Levi's.  I may have passed that on to the next generation as well.
B00H8AG1WQ|4|Great product. It's my first time using this particular design and I will always choose these in the future.
B00H23Y2ES|5|Fits great, no headache :)
B00HFYCQCE|4|I'm heavier and they are a little snug but comfy
B002806UUY|2|WIFE MEG WRITES:Top is cut too short in the torso, seam should go under bust, not over. Design is nice, cut and sizing are bad. I normally wear 16w and a 3X was too small.
B00RS7PYTA|1|This is STOLEN art work. The original artist is Alex DeSpain. Don't support art thieves. You can find the real art & product by googling his name.
B002K6F7JQ|5|This is much better than the Motherhood Maternity and Medela Comfort bras.  You can unhook with one hand, it's easy to wash, the fabric supports but doesn't suffocate... one note is that the sizing runs a bit large. I recommend going one size smaller than you'd normally buy.
B000JHD0F6|5|I used to buy the regular Carhartt jeans they were ok but my husband went through a lot of them.  My husband and brother both work construction and tear through jeans like paper.  I am not a great seamstress and even if I was by the time I could get one pair patched up anther one would need repair.  By the time all is said and done these are worth the extra money.  They still show the wear and tear but only one of them has a serious hole that I am going to have to take a needle and thread to.  The fit was a bit difficult to nail down we sent a few back without any hassle.  Once we had the right size after a couple tries its been smooth sailing.  My husband had gone down a size right about the time we decided to change jean style so it kinda threw things off but it was nice to know that returns were so easy.
B00IU3D8GM|4|It's nice and heavy more so then I actually expected it to be. The person I bought it for doesn't like it so I kept it.
B004ZDMLUU|4|Good belt. Followed review that said I should order by my pants size but it was too small. One size up fits fine though.
B00KB4HPEE|4|I was very happy with how this dress fits and the weight of the fabric. It is not flimsy or completely sheer (a rare find these days).  The colours are gorgeous.  I'm fairly tall (5'10&#34;) so I do wish it were a bit longer, but for a shorter lady it would be about the perfect length.  It is very clingy, so it will emphasize curves (all of them).  A medium fits well for size 6/8.
B00L2WQ572|5|Looks great!
B002QQ7TTQ|5|I have been wearing this same style/brand nightie for years.  Bought some for my daughter when she was pregnant.  It is the perfect combo of &#34;cover-up&#34; yet light.  I never wear any other style - even in the cold Michigan winters.
B002IRMHVS|5|My wife needed something for a custom party and this looked to be the perfect item. Great product and the quality was very good for the price.  Impressed and thankful.
B00AXIVH88|1|I got it shipped within expected time. What a shock. This is so thin that it will never be the windcheater I wanted. This is more like a poncho (raincoat) and I am surprised at some of the earlier reviews. Some of the earlier reviews were talking about this product being able to resist a considerable amount of cold.<br /><br />I tried and I dont like the way it has been able to protect me from the cold weather
B00A3KR47E|4|The clips are a little too tight but they hold forth well and haven't lost a glove. At least not yet!
B00SCR1TDA|1|Cheap!!!the cheapest looking material i've ever seen. It arrived with a spot on it... very dissatisfied 
B005Q8YT4O|2|very small. I wish the dress was less see through.
B00L5SAO6G|5|These are such perfect dresses for myself because I like the fact that they are modest but beautiful. You feel very pretty, but very appropriate at any event. Love them! This one is more of a tan color than the white you see in the picture, but it is beautiful.
B005SIH0MU|5|The next step beyond multi cam.  Same cloth feel and construction as the standard issue boonie.  Nothing fancy or special.
B00XOIRS78|2|Hit me mid calf instead of at the ankle like a maxi should
B00FF87VGS|5|Bought these as a Christmas present and the recipient loves them. Says they're warm and soft. Perfect for cooler weather.
B0073E571S|5|Love it
B00K47YYVK|3|The collar is a strange material that can be compared to a costume.The dress is a bit short for me but that isn't too bad since i wear shorts underneath
B00JTPJC4M|5|Cute shirt..
B007HY3GWG|4|Fits perfectly, light and airy, i can wear this shirt with any style or color shorts, jeans, sweat bottoms. Perfect to match with everything.
B00JQVYXFW|5|It was a beautiful wedding & perfect wedding gown. The services is excellent, they deliver fast.
B00O6ER5FO|1|Not what you seen on the picture. I'm usually a medium but feels like XXS
B00FSB662C|4|Will buy again, just in a different color! GREG
B000W8R6EI|4|i bought this for my vest, i thought it would be bigger. it turned out to be tiny. if you want to order this, it looks good on the front pocket flap of a jean vest, aka a \\"battle jacket\\" or \\"metal vest\\"
B00FHNJHZE|4|Love it
B00KDC898A|5|size up, good material tho
B004LRO45K|5|sexy
B00QQ8TN44|5|Made a nice gift.
B00CKHYW1O|5|The dress was absolutely beautiful, and a great buy for the price.<br />The front is slightly shorter than the sides, which gives it a sexy look.Love it!!
B007AB5YT4|5|Ordered this to go under a long wedding dress. It was totally comfortable but better yet it did not slip or ride up. It stayed in place and was very comfortable
B008M3TP7G|4|love these!<br /><br />i am wearing them today and they're fantastic. opaque and kept me semi-warm walking into work in the cold MN morning!
B006TC6R8M|5|The cost is worth the reliability of all their products!!! I bought 5 pair for work.
B006SRT1WC|4|Great fit. Reasonable price. I use them under shorts for running in the cold. Also great for layering on cold hikes and under ski pants. Just what I was looking for.
B0073VBKG2|5|great &#34;t&#34;
B0076R6O64|5|fit perfect
B004OPK7YG|4|I ordered a size XL since description of the shirt said \\"fitted\\", but the shirt is not fitted at all. So, I will need to return it for a L.
B00AAVVD2I|3|I returned this as the sizing wasn't correct<br />good material decent value and cute just be careful on the sizing
B00KGIRDKQ|5|Mrs. CyberDad here:<br /><br />I bought this recently and am thoroughly enjoying it. Sleeves are a bit long, but easily turned up. The cassis and amethyst colors have nice contrasting linings which enhance the turned-up cuffs.  Adjustable tabs at the waist allow for expansion if you wear extra layers. It's machine washable, too. Practical and fun to wear!
B00HYB18NG|5|All good
B005KC8NH0|5|I love having a variety of colors to chose from so that my daughter has a headband for every outfit. They fit my two month old but there is enough room for her to grow so I think they will fit her for a while
B00M9WIIW4|5|This tee runs a bit small (it is a junior size) and is fitted.  I sized up 2 sizes and this tee is perfect.
B009XGW2E4|5|My daughter wore this for a graduation ceremony.  She had the prettiest dress there and received A LOT of compliments.  It's very worth the money.
B0041EI5YO|5|Got one for my husband, and one for my son, they both love them. We got the Rasta colors and they're very stylish.
B00KJF2LOE|1|It was to small I do not recomend
B005PPMSOG|3|The circles in the picture are cheetah print like the suit but mine are just plain black. When I got the package it was just a bag with the suit thrown in it. It feels kinda cheap but still cute. Also not really a push up.
B00DDPV7QK|2|Be warned, this runs about 2 sizes too small.  I don't know of any other companies that says 3x is this size.
B00D0VVCH6|5|Thanks
B00QQ4EIO8|5|Ordered this dress for my daughter. Placed the order on April 1 and received it yesterday, April 15 (contrary to Amazon's estimated delivery date of May 4 - 26). She loves the dress and loves the fit.
B00GYS3NCY|1|THE TANK WAS NICE QUALITY BUT THE LARGE SIZE EQUALED A REGULAR SMALL SIZE, THE LARGE THAT I RECEIVED FIT A 95 LB FRIEND FINE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.
B009YECQ6E|5|Joes curvy are the best designer jeans out there for those of us with a little xtra thigh & booty. Love the look & feel of them & the fit couldnt be better!
B00GYU0YWE|1|Extremely small... My 11 month old 22lb cannot fit in this. Bought a 24 month size.
B0096HNM58|1|I don't like this product because it looks like a at home project that went wrong and not done neatly.  I am very sorry that I spent my money on this . I am very disappointed in  the quality of the product... I would never recommend this to anyone!. If you going to sell something make sure it is done correctly!  I am very upset!
B00C3N82Z2|5|Bought 2 and had to give them to friends who thought they were outstanding. Buying more.<br />John
B0012QM98M|1|It doesn't match the picture and fits terribly. I threw it away and I didn't even bother to return it.
B001BDS1KG|5|Falke is well known for a reason.  Their products fit well, wear well and wash well.
B00IUMURU8|5|Just what the man wanted.  More of a cotton shirt than flannel.
B005G4G3ME|5|Easy to care for, easy to pack and wear.  Great stain release and I love the odor guard.  I bought my first pair 4 years ago and they still look great.  I bought 2 more pairs and that is all I wear.
B00J0QDT2G|5|It was fast
B00DUKEDA0|5|great
B004VO7UE0|5|These are very nice socks. They are not super thick but still have substance to them, which is what we wanted. My husband is retired and as such he has not kept up with his dress socks supply! When we had an event to go to, his everyday sports socks were not going to cut it! He ended up going with some old worn out \\"vintage\\" socks! I came home from the event and immediately ordered these socks to replenish his dress sock supply. These could be used with loafers, boat shoes, or dress shoes and they look and feel great.
B002XNKJ94|5|Well made case that my prescription glasses fit easily into. Also has room for a cleaning cloth. This case seems solid enough to last a while and protect my glasses. Time will tell, but so far so good. I will buy another one of these as a backup since I am pretty rough on cases because of opening and closing them many times a day.
B00B8AA5EM|4|color seems a little lighter in person
B009DNWG5C|5|fits perfectly and feels nice and soft! and warm! I wear them with a long sweater and boots and Im still pretty warm in Boston!
B00O8OJE1U|4|Perfect for the Costa Rican forest.
B007PESRT0|3|The size 4 fit my son in an 18 months perfectly. They run way, way small but they are cute and they wash up very soft.
B000RH1VUO|5|I don't know what the Kangol people use to make their hats but it cures cancer<br />and it does it in style
B00MSKBFL8|5|These keys are quite lovely!  I was very pleased with the variety.  They were perfect for the craft I had in mind!
B00ISPVC4C|5|Great shirt for Baratheon lovers!
B003UP68Z8|3|Seemed to have a bit of shine to them which other Lysse leggings don't have
B002G9UDGE|1|I ordered an M and got something like an L or an XL. The shirt says M but in what country is this a Medium?  You need to order one size down.
B00FM9OFQE|4|looks great
B005GVM5HE|3|after washing the top the sleeves are shorter, yuck!.  stains easy too.
B000PWB84K|1|Ridiculously rigid material and 2 sizes larger than my normal t shirt and I couldn't even put this on.  FAIL.
B007E1NO7E|1|Why would anybody want to wear a clothing article advocating the slitting of a woman? This is a dangerous message advocating and approving violence....how sad... :-(
B008TN2I96|5|VS stopped carrying my fav bra (48.50 was steep anyway) so one day I went to Kohls and tried on 1000 bras. Or that was what it felt like. Found this bra, loved it... came home... found it on Amazon for a much better price. On sale in dept store it was 32.00... so this was a bargain. Same lift and look of VS but much better price. Covers back rolls perfectly and makes a clingy dress look fab! I have curvature of the spine too, so it seems to flatten out my back and make me look less crooked. YAY!!!  Please VF, don't stop making this one.(I now own 4)
B00M10M8T8|5|Very good fit good quality sweatshirt I love it and proud to wear it
B00EG0KTME|5|It gets the job done! You can see a noticeable difference within a week of consistently wearing this. Consistency is key. Be sure to drink lots of water while wearing this or you will get lightheaded
B0007CKQG4|4|fit great
B00K3ZNHJI|1|my baby is 7 months.looked great in the  dress.the rose got a little wet by her putting it in her month.then the red dye ran into the white not good.
B00LOV7VQA|5|I bought a large as this is what size I always get  This product was very nice but runs smaller than usual. Be aware of this when you order.  I bought for my daughter and she gave it to a friend that usually wears a small.  Fit her perfect....  The company offer to exchange it but she lives in Ca. and did not send it back.  Nice company to do business with.  Would buy from again.....
B00666SSHY|4|Nothing says xmas like tacky sweaters...or tacky t-s that look like tacky sweaters. Packaging was great! You HAVE to order this shirt.
B005FXADA4|5|I was using suspenders to keep my pants in an &#34;appropriate&#34; position, and my wife suggested one of these.  Wow, super comfortable, easy to get in/out of and cool to work in.  Be aware that this is not a lined, heavy, warm piece of clothing.  It is lightweight and intended for use in mild temperatures.  I've washed mine many times and it hasn't shrunk such that i notice, and it's very stain resistant.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat, strongly recommended.
B00OBM7TFW|3|Shorts.  You don't get the colors pictured.  Nothing special.
B00MBAKX1S|5|I love this!! Just got it in the mail, tried it on, and the hubby and I both love it! I got a 3XL and it fits perfectly. I wear an XL shirt, B cup bra, am 5 ' 0&#34;, weigh around 170. Other lingerie that I have is just too tight on my 50's year old fat bod, but this fits perfectly (I read the reviews on the difference in sizes). It's super soft, too. I wish it came in all different colors. I guess for now, I'll just order the white one as this one is black. And, of course, as always, Amazon Prime free two day shipping was as expected--on time!!
B007OSK2KE|5|Comfortable and good value -- what more can you ask?
B00PIM3AUM|4|I ordered a size larger than i normally wear and it fits perfectly. its nice. its a little shorter than i thought it was but i just put a pair slacks underneath and it was all good.
B005GYGEXC|2|With all the great reviews, I was expecting something great. There is no support in the them at all.
B00RKXN4OO|5|This was a great gift to my grandson.  He looks very handsome in this outfit.
B00L3T686M|1|I ordered this in an XXL, because I saw that it was Asian sizing.  I'm 5'10, and usually wear a M/L depending on how it's made, but I wanted a cute flowy tank to wear under a cardigan, and loved this print.  When I got it, it looked a little small, but the label said XXL like I ordered, so I tried it on.  First of all, it didn't come anywhere close to covering my navel.  I know crop tops are making a comeback, but no.  It also was very tight, and one of the side seams was crooked, and ended in the front.  It's a good thing I only spent $3 on this thing, because it's going in the trash.  Don't waste the money, in my opinion.
B000U64MAI|5|No thrills design,good price, outstanding quality, and good fit...  Leg was bit long, but easy to just tuck into my kicks.
B001O8XXWY|5|Good product & Fast delivery~!
B00DNO15QI|5|I coveted this for months and had it on my Amazon wishlist.  When it went to 50% off regular price I couldn't resist buying it for myself.  It has a nice fit; stretchy in the back.  Lays nicely.  Love IT!
B009FHN6AU|5|good quality and fit - fast delivery.
B003O86NMY|1|I am 5'7\\" and I wear a size eight but the size large was not long enough for me. The fabric does not stretch so would not recommend this costume for adults.
B005C9GD6Y|2|Its toooooooo long for me
B00LST76BS|5|Fits very nicely. I bought my normal size (16-18). Since it was an international order, it took about 2 weeks for the shrug to reach me which is what I expected. But the wait was fine. I was in no rush and planned ahead. I love the color.
B006J64X0M|5|Son loves it. Fits great.
B00E2V214G|5|Love the fit and the material.  Very comfortable.  They are long but not too long.  I bought it in 3 colors!
B00422M6JA|5|good
B0055B39FM|5|I'm so happy that L'ovedbaby clothing is now available on Amazon. I ordered a pair of these pants when my son was three months old and they quickly became my favorite pair. They're soft, he seems to find them comfortable, and I love the simplicity of the dark gray color. I thought I might not like the &#34;bootcut&#34; of the 18-24 month pants (the smaller versions are straight leg) but I actually loved it. It makes the pants a little less baby-like. I'll keep ordering these pants until he's too big for the brand.
B001AI9ZD4|3|It's good wallet but the problem in the description it was written the one size as 4&#34; by 3&#34; which was not correct. It was 4.5&#34; by 3.5&#34; ... I wonder why that mistake was there ...
B00W6URXVG|5|The dress prinr is BEAUTIFUL and the material is comfortable.  The somewhat small is maybe not normally so because I have a medical condition that increases the proportionate amount of stomach fat.  I rate this product as excellent. I intend to buy more.
B00LH1OB38|4|Logo could be bigger and darker
B007C4GGP0|5|Bought this for my Granddaughter she loves it it arrived at her home right on time i would recomend this to anyone
B000VVVMSW|4|I am a 5' 3&#34; female and had purchased a men's medium a couple of years ago.  The men's medium fit perfect, however this one was way too big.  I love the fabric and style and will order a small to see if it fits better.
B000MUZ8MS|3|I am a huge fan of Cosabella products but these fell a little short. They are comfortable but they run small and the rear offers moderate coverage. There is moderate coverage in the front as well. As with any Cosabella product, they are well made and have held up over 20+ washings. They are definitely sexy and soft. You could without a doubt call these low rise!
B009AV1CIY|5|To my surprise it fit like it was made for me. My man was was texting me all the next day telling me how sexy I was. This was a good purchase for me. I was unsure at first because of the  S M L sizing. But it worked out for me.
B00BQKKDDW|4|The short is a big / large  but very comfortable! It is soft and cute! I really like this brand.
B00V7RYUU6|5|I love the juxtaposition of the power of the chevron on this light-as-a-whisper infinity scarf! The color combination is equally bold. You can only imagine what style power this will have on the most mundane garment of black or shades of gray! It also will look fabulous with any denim, light or dark. Since the chevron has been called a symbol of unlimited power throughout history, I'd say this gorgeous scarf will empower you to liven up your wardrobe every season of the year. When not in use, you can keep it's power contained safely in a dainty net bag with satin ribbon closure. That's an awful lot to offer at this tiny price. Sample provided for review, and I adore this bold and beautiful scarf!
B00DI8M6FI|4|It's adorable. This is the second shagwear wallet I have bought for my Mom. This one has tighter card slots which makes getting the cards out slightly difficult at times. Otherwise it is perfect. She loves it and is always getting complimented on it.
B001RFI356|5|GREAT !!!
B00FY4RDA2|5|Very nice look and very well made.
B009GPPMWG|5|Good for cosplay use, I will definitely get another color when I get the chance. The socks are comfortable and I don't have to worry about feeling cold.
B00ND93ZWA|1|They are see through. Returning them.
B008BRZ4ZU|4|No surprises, decent jammies, no regrets, what more is there to say? Guess I need to say more, but over and out ...
B00FFZ3FZW|5|Good looking sweater, fits well and construction is of very good quality. Fabric is soft and very comfortable to wear.
B00I3PFQJ4|3|Cute dress, but it is EXTREMELY short.  Like just under your butt cheek short.  Other than that it's super cute!  Would be fine on a smaller framed woman or young lady but I've got too big of a booty for it.
B00F13N8TQ|4|I am a 5'7 and it fits well enough. the shoulder shape is a little strange and the pattern is not exactly the same but they are not big problem. By the way it's a little smelly. I think the red is a little brighter than picture.<br />Overall it's fun to wear and it's a nice product.
B002BCHR1K|5|This shirt is very good quality.  I've ordered from Rockabilia before, and am always happy with what I've bought.
B004061V4O|5|The only jeans for me.  Great fit around the thigh.  Fast delivery
B00O9VTPLQ|4|Nice grey and snowman shirt
B00HY0PQ8A|5|Great shirt
B009KC46YA|5|Nice
B00KQ12S58|5|Great shirt. Soft & sized perfectly. Purchased as a gift for a favorite teen who is an Imagine Dragons fan, & loved it! Quality, price & fast shipping awesome
B003DV30ZA|5|This is my favorite nursing bra.  I have tried the lamaze, medela, motherhood maternity and seraphine bras.  The main thing I like about is that the band fits low so there is no pressure on the breast to cause any clogged ducts and it can still offer some support.  It is also the most comfortable.  There is a small pad that is not removable which allows you to wear it under T-shirts without fear of nipple exposure.  It keeps nursing pads in place well.  It is more expensive than the other bras, but well worth it.
B00IEM5KV0|5|Darling dress Love it its soft and fits great!! I am impressed since i don't dare shop for clothes on line (need to try them on) but I was very Impressed on how it looks and feels thanks seller was fast and effecient on sending it !! Thanks =)
B00N8MMO8I|1|Order 3 sizes larger. It is that small! But cute really nice top. I will have to lose 10# to wear mine! Guess that is not a bad idea
B00024OFY6|4|I have had other items like this and they don't even begin to compare.  I was thrilled with the flexibility of this product. I loved that I had so many pockets to use, it made organization much easier.
B00CIZNFMU|2|Extra small size is also a bit long on the waist. Material is light and seemingly warm, but the front silver zipper was a total surprise, not clearly visible in the picture, and looks pretty cheap and low class. Its like a vertical silver shimmering line in the vertical center of your body, for no good reason. Get a Columbia fleece instead, its a few dollars extra, but well worth it.
B00EFLM5PI|5|Great . Gives you a nice looking shape . Perfect I'll order a whole lot more soon as summer hits
B00M6FMJAG|5|Love it!!!! Will be purchasing more! Maybe at a discount ;)
B00DQYWSE8|5|very comfortable
B0036URNGA|4|Very pleased!  I am right at the edge of 3x and this fits great.  Looks professional even pulled out out of a suitcase from being wadded up and stuffed in at the last minute.  Comfortable all day.
B0037J32V0|4|Comfortable- somewhat small, but all of the 874s seem to run that way, hence, my posting &#34;fit as expected.&#34;  I always go a size up with these.  The resist stains, have a  more acceptable appearance than denim, and are constructed from durable material.
B00BXPQNB6|5|Durable and light weight with a great feel, look and style!!
B00KT1VO46|1|This dress did not come with a zipper back as pictured. It came with a lace up back, which I did not want. I ordered it expecting to get what was described and pictured here on the website. Not only that, there is hot glue all over the place that I'm having to pick off piece by piece. Very unhappy with this purchase.
B00EZ04UMA|5|Fits great. Snaps did get annoying.
B00EV5D8YA|5|My grand daughter will get many wears out of this shirt for her cello performances.  Great service.
B008M52WYC|5|Purchased this lunch box for my daughter and she loves it.  Her friends at school really like it and it is very colorful
B001UDNT4U|5|as advertised, good quality
B005GPHTYO|3|Fabric is heavy & stiff & not sure I like how the seams are but other than that I like them. Have had now for several months & the color is fading but they seem to be holding up well. The petite is just right & I am 5'3&#34;.
B00IFXX6E6|5|Nice shirt
B00DMEAZB0|2|Belt is a different size than described.  Luckily, it will fit.  I would suggest the seller to adjust their description.  Would not buy through this seller again.
B00LGI9VPA|5|My wife simply loves it.
B001UE74AY|4|Wallet is made of high quality leather, and will take abeating. Have had mine for over three years and is first now starting to show its age, but I am very hard on wallets due to working in a factory environment. The inside cloth is blue and white striped which was unexpected and not my style thus the 4 stars.
B0047WQ94I|5|...as described and perfect for a major Duke fan for Christmas.  The logo on the front is a good likeness.
B00GYTOETE|4|A small hole on side seam but can be easily fixed. Pretty dress I got the orange.
B00PDR1S10|4|great quality sweatshirt and I got a lot of compliments from people that I don't even talk to, but i should've ordered a larger size.
B004HSSYIQ|5|I love it .It fits perfectly it is as beautiful in person as it is in the photo.
B006WVLSCK|5|There is an app for that and now you can show your smartphone alliance when wearing these stylish trunks at the pool or beach.<br /><br />Super quality material, fast drying and very comfortable.
B00G0LRTAM|5|This dress is made very well and very figure flattering. It is so comfortable. I received many compliments. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B00BQ0Y7DE|5|I have very short hair but still need a headband when I'm working out.  I love this headband, it fits perfect!
B00K79VIDW|5|Nice quality washes up great!
B00B15FNQE|4|Exactly what I wanted, but glad I read the reviews and ordered a size up. Would have been way too tight if I ordered my true size.
B009NUJVUI|5|Always like 2 for 1 pricing!! Beanies are bright, floresecnt yellow--not so much gold, which is good for me, as I wanted bright yellow, so I was pleasantly surprised. But if you want gold, these are not :)
B001E563BU|2|Sewn poorly, holes in some seams, material quality left much to be desired. Poor fit, even after following recommended sizing guide.
B00G3JEH6A|3|I like them, but they shrunk in the wash so I had to give them to my girlfriend who has really really small feet. They fit her perfectly though, so it's not so bad.
B00LK3RPT0|5|I loved !!! As in the description !!! Thank you !!
B009P0FNAI|4|This cardigan fit well and is of good quality. I have never bought anything from Patty Boutik before and was a little anxious with this purchase because it was not cheap, however when it arrived it fit properly and is just heavy enough to wear when it is cold, but not freezing outside...which is what I wanted. I am happy with this purchase and would also consider buying it in another color.
B00J4E2SDK|1|Ordered for a christmas gift for my 9th grade son he used it less then 2 weeks and seam by zipper totally ripped out. Beond repair very disapointed.
B008CITPXK|5|they fit well- I am somewhat petite so the legs are a little long but I love will always love Lucky Brand.
B004J9ILX6|5|And these fit snuggly on the skin so that when she wears a  tight dress, the ripples of the underwear do not appear.  Very comfortable as well according to the spouse.
B009AW97PI|4|Nice fitting shorts, have to see what they look like after a year.<br />I like the back pockets with no flap covering it and the fronts<br />are nice and deep. Pretty good price too...
B00ESPTUUE|4|I bought these for my mother in a nursing home.  Easy to get on and off and still look very fashionable
B002DGMZRA|5|super soft and large enough to be versatile
B00O5C8YEI|5|the hat is a good fit and really warm! It arrived very quickly. We are happy with this purchase
B00CA6YWJW|2|I got a 511 black color 29x30 ,it fit and hip low rise I like it<br />But 511 midnight blue 30x30 hip too high I don't like it.<br />I suppose it's should be the same 511 black one low rise
B00EOH87DC|4|I’ve worn a size 8 for 20 years.  These fit true to a size 8 in the waist and the leg holes.  However, they are very very long-waist’d.  I’m tall so this is a bonus for me.  However, if you are short-average height these are going to be granny pants you can pull up to your armpits.
B00D63WXBC|5|Bought it for my piano playing son - he really likes it.  Good quality and appreciates that not everyone has it.
B0091EZ73Q|5|This thing is soft and looks like totoro.  If your special someone loves totoro get it.  This thing will keep you warm in the winter months.
B002JZXNFS|5|Great look!
B00OPYB6EG|5|Great Quality.  Material is great for an active guy - it is not cotton which stays wet with sweat - this material seems to keep your skin dry and breathing.  Love the snug fit and the support.
B00B5BOJ9Q|5|The product arrived within the given time frame. It was packaged well and it fit nicely. She really enjoyed opening this birthday gift and wanted to put it on immediately.
B00DSNO9CG|4|however the sizing seems to run a bit small, it fits him but prob should of purchased the next size up
B009V0QWCA|5|These are great! I ordered a size medium and they fit my 36\\" hips perfectly! The item is very comfortable and fits well!
B00EK10OEW|5|It looked just like the picture on my pc which is rare.  I did not have to make much adaptation. The elastic smoking was slightly high for my waist but I had a wide decorative belt to give it a nice waist. I needed it for a party and it arrived as advertised. I was most pleased.
B00DYRHM3E|5|Beautiful dress on my girl I love it
B00GW7YBPK|3|Great color, but the fabric is very thin and the dress won't stay closed without constant adjustment to make sure that it won't keep falling open.
B004W1QDP4|5|This scarf had great color, texture, and length. I wanted a Ramsay Tartan Scarf, and that is exactly what I got.
B007MP85VM|5|My friend loves Lazy One Apparel, their cute, comfortable, and fun to wear for sleep. Love their gowns and boxers. You should def check out all the adorable designs.
B008MVST6G|1|Just fit weird.  Too big in places, too small in others.  Overall, very unflattering.  The knot in the front of the fabric just didn't look right on.
B000CEFV8U|2|I THOUGHT THESE WERE BUN SIZE, THEY ARE FULL HEAD SIZE. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I HAVE NO USE FOR A FULL HEAD HAIR NET.
B00AMXHIVE|4|I have a medium and it is a little large but a small wouldn't have fit. I am usually a fluctuating small/medium shirt size. But it is really nice and lightweight for packing. Too warm to wear on non rainy days as the liner makes you hot. But for a cool, fall rainday, perfect.
B00I0ZB14Q|5|i love this Scarf<br />- Very Soft<br />- great for stay worm<br />- fashionable<br />- wonderful material<br />- the color is perfect for mix with all your closes.<br /><br />i happy with this product.
B006NTFB7Y|5|The product is great ,some people don't know the right size and put on bad feedback , you have to know your size  before and fixed perfect the  same in the photo.<br />The seller is very keep you informed about your delivery and the product  and I am happy what I got and I will do business with that seller for sure again. Thank you.
B00PLRB4MU|5|I purchased the Red hat & scarf set, The color is rich and true as it is in the picture. It doesn't look cheap nor does it feel cheap. Wearing the set is really nice and my cap I wear the brim down closer to my eyebrows  turned  slightly  left of right to give it a more  sassy look.  For as  my  opinion the picture isn't enough how nice this set is.
B00C6U9NWI|4|Well Made.  Is very fitted and does run on the smaller side of Medium.
B00DMGTL0E|5|Socks. Good. Use them. Buy them
B00WQQAS7G|5|Very cute
B013W6REU2|5|Just a skater boy to be :) I love this company.
B00817DZWO|5|Nice
B00M3ZK4SS|5|SUPER comfortable!  Stretchy, which may be why some found them too large, but absolutely no creepage or slippage. I would maybe like to have color options, but will definitely buy these again.
B000N93SFM|5|l Iike the color of this vest i have some green shoes that will match color of this vest very well
B007WA2HRA|5|awesome shirt i love the look and the fit of this shirt it makes you look hot lol its a really sexy top and i love it
B004YRU1GS|5|Was bought as a gift as it was their favorite band and they absolutely love it. Will probably buy others like it.
B00L6EK1OY|5|Kids love Cuddl Duds for long johns and for PJ's .... Thumb holes just make them more fun.
B00I5W2AUI|4|My son likes these shorts well enough as he only really likes shorts with an elastic waistband, but the one thing it doesn't have is front pockets which he says is very annoying.  I probably won't buy them again because of that, but if your son doesn't care about pockets then they will probably be just fine.
B0034T65JO|5|Haven't been in a down pour yet so I may have to update but the fit is great. Big enough to layer without hanging off like a sack, Plenty of room in the sleeves and across the back and the velcro wrist closures let you adjust to whatever your wrist size is. Very well finished jacket, Well Done Columbia!
B00K3HEJLQ|5|Adorable, slip-proof socks!  They seem to run a little small, but they stretch.
B00ANKOVM0|5|I have a couple squeezy things, but I only wear this and the \\"miracle suit\\" one.  I don't like having multiple straps yoking my shoulders like an ox, as with the wear-your-own-bra ones, and I HATE the foam padding in every other bra made in the last 20 stupid years; I had a breast reduction already, I'd prefer if they don't look gigantic again.  The bra on this is amazing, keeps 'em high, and is pretty should it make an appearance with a low cut shirt.<br /><br />I have a waist, but also back fat, and it doesn't sink into it like some other materials.  The straps are comfy and it doesn't make my butt look flat, nor does it make too much of a line on the crotch/thigh--though it doesn't have that nice soft edge that others do.  It's not any different than what regular panties do to me, so I can't complain.  The back is high, but not too high, about an inch lower than my underarms.<br /><br />Recommended for ladies who loathe the padding.
B002P8Z8Q6|5|I wanted a raincoat for summer travel, since I will be walking a lot. This coat is exactly what I wanted. It is very well constructed, fits as expected with room for a light sweater underneath, and hits at mid-thigh for good coverage without a full-length coat (I am 5'3&#34;). I am very happy with this purchase.
B0094QTO4Y|5|Very happy with this dress.  It's fancy with a bit of sparkle.  I love the watercolor look. Perfect for my 3 year old daughter for Easter!
B000NXVOG8|5|Amazing jacket,with the pic its  hard to tell. but after receiving this jacket, i have to say its has to be one of the best jackets for riding there is. And even if you dont have a motorcyle, its still worth getting. very smooth feel to it, works really well in cold weather. theres too many good things about this jacket, also shipping was very fast had it just under a week after ordering it, and i live in germany.
B00DV0NU44|5|I have none of the complaints I have read in some of the other reviews. I did take their suggestions however, and ordered a size up. I typically wear Small but ordered medium and it fits perfectly.  I have long arms and the sleeves are the right length  and the thumb holes are comfortable and  reinforced with a trim. The colors are more beautiful than the picture.  The fabric is very soft and just barely heavier than typical t shirt material. It is very unique. I will order more in other colors. Shipped super fast. Wasn't expecting it until January 7th but it arrived December 20th. A few loose threads but nothing that affected the quality of the seam work.
B008BUCGXK|4|Nice, but too smail especially on the crotch.
B0031U0P7E|3|My husband really liked this belt at first....but after a few months he said the belt started stretching out and fit him too big. And he didn't lose weight, he actually gained a few pounds....so he doesn't even wear it anymore. :(
B004VMPKVM|4|These rompers are adorable! They make my son look like a little sports star. The material is soft yet thick and the color is delightful!    I took away one star for 2 reasons:  1) I wish they had snaps running the entire length of the romper to avoid having to put on and take off from the top. The snaps near the neck make this easy, but I still prefer not having to struggle with getting the material over his head each time.  2) I wish the length of the legs was a bit longer. It seems a bit too swimsuit-ish at times.
B009LLKOX2|5|great socks
B00DDL9YP0|5|I have to say after a few months use I am very satisfied with this wallet. I wanted a simple wallet that was not too thick, but still durable and carry a decent amount of cards. The wallet will definitely feel stiff initially, at least mine did, but will break in quickly with regular use. I only with it had a removable ID card insert, but that is the price you pay for a thinner profile. As a bonus, which I didn't realize in the pictures, there is a quick access card slot on the front face of the wallet by the stitching. This is very convenient for a card or cards you use frequently because you do not even have to open up the wallet.
B00HRCJCT4|5|I love this cincher! I wear it during my workouts. It's extremly comfotable and helps me get the job done!!
B00Y3TD03S|5|The fabric is great and it's wash and wear! I bought this and the purple one, but I haven't worn the purple one, yet. The blue one was very wrinkled when I unpacked it, but that washed out. Wearing it is so fun, it just flows around you and feels great. Looks great, too! The color is exactly what it looks like in the photo. I normally wear a large, so I bought the large. I could almost wear the medium, I think, though, because of the cut. The purple one came out of the package without a wrinkle on it and the fabric feels different, a little bit heavier or maybe a difference in the dye and finish? I'm looking forward to wearing that and then seeing if it washes up as well as the blue! The color is so rich, royal purple! For the price, these were a great buy! I'll be able to wear them into the cooler weather easily, too! They'll look great with scarves and such!
B000SKLT5M|4|These fit great nice socks a good price, I would recommend them to anyone not trying to spend a lot.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Greg
B00IAAVMIQ|4|As expected. Good quality.
B001AB62I2|4|The product came as I expected.    I am happy with the product.
B00EI53Y2O|5|As always,great product,for a fair price.Quality materials,quality workmanship,nice looks,that's Southpole. Just a great thermal without breaking the bank.Don't be afraid to buy a top like this,you won't be disappointed,I plan on buying more products from Southpole soon.
B00I40CJDO|5|These shirts are just so soft and so comfortable, even after a handful of washings. I love these shirts and would recommend them to anyone!
B007IRAEKO|5|It was great
B00093CVI2|5|I love it.  lots of comments.  And more original than the \\"Vote for Pedro\\" shirt.  Which is too bad since I have three of those.
B002I22II0|5|I was totally impressed by this costume, I won two contest with it...Its a great buy, I would buy it again....Thanks
B00MMMSK3I|4|I am not really a fan of buttoned wallets but I got it as a back up wallet in the event my other wallet wasn't as good as all the images I searched over for it. And the great thing is the two wallets I got I was able to swap out the chain from this one into the other one if I wanted.
B00KQIX6ZW|3|If your abs are in a nice shape, well, no problem then
B0007VDN1A|2|Misrepresented: listing says 100% cotton, tag on hat says 60% cotton, 40% polyester.  Also: hat does not look like picture--the brim is narrower and the crown is much lower.  For all I know, they may have shipped me the wrong item.  Not that I would ever know, though, because no packing list or any other documentation was included.  Pretty much money thrown away.
B005NYO3TM|5|I LOVE this bra!  I have gotten so tired of T-Shirt bras with under wires that eventually feel like torture devices and evil bindings.<br /><br />My search for THE BRA...<br />I used to love the Gap T-shirt bra but now they print the label on the side next to your skin and after a few washes that label paint is really uncomfortable and the wires started hitting me in places that make me want to rip them off after about 4 hours.<br /><br />I tried the \\"Wonder Bra\\" and while I liked the all cotton - it left me wondering what the big deal was.<br /><br />What I do not like in a bra and love in this one:<br />1)  Skinny straps that cut in on your shoulders - CHECK - this has very smooth reasonable straps.<br />2)  \\"Invisible support\\" bras that can slip up to unreasonable positions if you raise your arms too high while being very active. I don't know if you have ever had this happen but I have and it is annoying. This bra has great construction with out feeling like its made of rebar!<br />3)  Some bras have padding that feels thick and hot and if you are running or it is particularly hot it is really hot in there. And yet I want a little Padding and this is GENIUS in this bra - there is a little extra ridge like padding at the bottom of the cup that really honestly lifts in a most natural wonderful way without looking fake and enough padding over the cup to handle a chill without fear!<br /><br />My only issue with Warners Bras is that they seem to be about 1/2 size smaller that Gap or Wonderbras in the band that goes around the body although the actual cup size seems right on.
B009RV1IW2|2|I have about a 32 chest so i bought a size small as i normally do with all my tshirts thinking it would fit me relatively snug being slim fit but these were way too tight.....so much so that i would even say they were uncomfortable
B001K9IPOI|2|The item is not completely welll constructed. While the material is doubled up to give light support and opaque coverage in the bra top portion, the material is too sheer and see through from the bra line down so you see the outline of your belly button and your entire waist area. The shirt needs lining added for structure support and coverage from the bra line down.
B009NA6ANE|3|This shawl is very soft and silky.  However, the colors are too muted to be almost hard to see.  I was going to return it but changed my mind - no time to get to the post office or UPS store.  I started wearing it but disappointed because of the dull colors.
B000P52YY0|5|very comfy
B00GKRD9OG|1|I love the line of Pendleton jackets and sweaters, but they STOP at size xl. Wake up! There are many big boys like me that need a XXL or more, we have the same green money as everyone else. We are told ad nauseum that too many Americans are obese. Conceded. But that does not mean someone who is having a battle with obesity doesn't want to look good doing it! WAKE UP, tap into the resource of the big boys!
B00FDUWQP4|5|well-made, adjustable sized, comfortable. would definitely recommend this to anyone who does not get dressed in the bathroom.  fast shipping, exactly as described
B00NPF81VW|5|great value for the price! Great customer service!
B008CRQSJ0|5|Excelente
B00BPLS1CM|5|Of good quality, but seems just a bit tight, wish I had ordered next larger but most other shirts are same size so I say these run small
B00II5APF4|5|Very nice leather checkbook!  Has some pockets to keep receipts and bank cards. Comes just how it appears in picture Two slots accommodate register and check book. Feels like leather should feel. Also arrived promptly. A must!
B000KN6NIU|2|Not a 6 pack, 2 3 packs. One of the shirts had blue ink on it when i took it out of the package. Would not recommend...
B00HDA3LBA|4|They're burp clothes. They clean spit up pretty good. They're smaller than I expected, but they do their job!
B00C5KFO90|5|Beautiful jeans, classy in the grey, wear them with boots, flats or pumps, they r always right, always super comfortable too!  I have received many compliments on these :).
B0009MZTNW|5|These socks have a nice combination of padding but not too thick or bulky. I find them to work well with Johnston and Murphy shoes
B00M43Y3G8|5|This was for my granddaughter. She loved it !!!
B0084ZASDM|5|I absolutely Love it just what I wanted warm stylish greatcoat very well-made<br />I would definitely purchase again<br />Received it immediately
B006LHMWJ8|4|They aren't super tight, room to move around in. Not sure if they will stretch over time.
B00480J4QY|5|this is a perfect for my honda odyssey  i love and I save time  because I was looking for this...
B0009OMYAQ|5|Necessary to remove stupidly designed new GM oil filter cartridge cap. Typical top quality Lisle tool, I can't blame Lisle for Government Motors engineering SNAFU.
B00L6UW8YO|5|Great item great color love this hid
B00EJA3BU8|5|I am very pleased with the purchase I made.  Perfect fit for my vehicle.
B001EQL1HA|5|I am very impressed with the look of the LED Taillights. It really adds to the look of my car. Overall, I am pleased with the product and would definitely recommend to others
B00BDEMQTK|4|We had a lot of fun stringing party lights from the canopy of our motor home using these hanger clips. They went on with ease, and were sturdy enough for holding both lights and a small flag. The only problem we encountered was when we had to take the canopy down quickly because of a wind storm. Sliding the clips out before we could roll up the canopy took quite a bit of time (all the while the wind whipping us), and we weren't comfy leaving them in place. I think they might damage the fabric of a canopy if not removed before rolling it up. Other than that, they are a fun addition to camping in style.
B001W0FSMM|5|Direct replacement
B000CO9T60|5|A+
B00C93S0LC|5|Love this cover easy installation
B007EIU0K6|3|a sticker
B001U60T9U|1|It does not fit in my car and they are cheap covers. I will find something else in person to get the right fit
B00GPJPBBI|5|A+
B0012TRIWQ|3|Used on a Honda VFR1200. It fit, though I had to do some customizing for it to fit properly. I followed the directions literally and when tightened it would not &#34;swell&#34; enough. But it works. It just requires a bit of adjusting with a hacksaw and a file to get it to fit better. Still doesn't tighten up to what I would call...solid.
B004FRY7J4|5|Fits good.  Quick delivery
B00067BWWM|5|Awesome, works like a charms.....
B003VV423G|5|I started using Gliptone leather products when I lived in England, and who knows more about taking care of old leather than the Brits? Gliptone products have never disappointed me. The cleaner is really only needed the first time you treat the leather item. After that, wiping with a damp cloth is all that is needed prior to using the conditioner, as long as you &#34;feed&#34; the leather with the conditioner two or three times a year. I find that the consistency of the conditioner, slightly more liquid than toothpaste, makes it easy to apply. For leather upholstery, make sure to get the stitching, which often fails long before the leather will. Keep your leather clean and fed, and it will last more than a lifetime.
B002XZ3OUS|5|Easy installation.  Works and looks exactly like the dealership part. We'll worth the money. I highly recommend this product.  A
B001SB8OI0|5|Great replacements for my F-250. They are the identical models used by Ford from the factory. Everything you need is included. Much better construction than the high dollar aftermarket lights. Glad I came across these.
B00B3YL3OY|5|Love this bag.  Fit my bike perfectly and the rain cover kept everything dry.  I definitely recommend this bag.
B00IN4CRD8|5|Great buy
B000BZG8ZU|5|easy to splice into existing harness.  quality product
B00WW87PVK|5|Work great so far.  Easy to install
B00030DLEE|5|Very Nice.... Sales
B00I80FR6Q|5|I love this shade. It works great. I'm waiting for them to come out with one that is bigger.
B00EWHO2P6|5|Very bright I love themi will post video later
B005R41LIO|5|Very clean look. I put it right under the f150 badge on the fender. Looks awsome and gives it a nice look
B001EFP1WC|5|excellent
B00GSZQ8NE|5|I didn't realize how dated the yellowish light made the interior look.  This kit replaces everything inside but the visor mirror bulbs, and includes the bed lights, reverse and tag lights.  The interior lights and courtesy lights when you open the door are a huge improvement, as are the bed lights.  The reverse lights are just a little brighter to the naked eye, maybe the same.  But you don't have to worry about replacing these.
B000C2SUSA|4|IT WORKS WELL SO FAR.
B005YHEM5S|5|Bought 4 of these keys for an S10 and an Astro. I decided to get these because I hate having tacky looking &#34;ilco&#34; keys on my key ring for starting my vehicles. Keys were cut by locksmith and work great. TIP: Test both sides of the key after they are cut. Otherwise you may end up with a key that will start your car on one side but won't even turn in the ignition on the other side.
B0077H4BE0|5|I was looking though the RAYD Workshop profile to look though any decals I was interested in and found the silhouette version of Morrigan Aensland from the Darkstalkers franchise. Growing up she was my favorite character from every fighting game series she stared in, I knew I had to buy them!<br /><br />The '2x' on the title represented that you get 2 of each decal, YES! TWO Morrigan decals! I just applied one on my laptop and I am going to save the other one later for when I get me a car!<br /><br />I will mention that applying the decal was verrrry tricky... With the decals they gave me a piece of paper explaining how to apply the decal but it helped to a certain extent. I had to use a credit card (or any flat card you can use to smooth out the decal) to apply to whatever outer surface you put it on, BUT also I suggest after you smooth out the decal and while you are removing the outer plastic from the decal that you should use that same card to smooth out the decal while you are removing the plastic. It was pretty rough removing the plastic layer especially I was having a hard time with Morrigan's bat wings and her bat ears(?) So when you are removing the plastic, use the card to hold down her sharp edges and peel it off SLOWLY. If you peel too fast the sticker will stick to the plastic and you are going to have to stick it back down to the surface and try again.<br /><br />Other then being frustrated for a good 10 minutes applying this decal I absolutely love it! They have my business! Thank you RAYD Workshop!<br /><br />By the way, the 911 sticker is very tiny... I didn`t expect that but it`s okay, I didn`t really care.
B00MGRD6Q0|4|The shipping took awhile since it is from China but I have them on my 2013 cbr500r and I love them, had to adjust my clutch freeplay though. Makes the bike feel completely different and looks aggressive
B008H7IEWY|5|Very pleased with the difference in look by putting the blue bow ties on my blue truck. they do not match the dark metallic blue color or the truck but still give it a nice look!  Easy installation - just take your time and follow the directions.  I've had mine on for about 6 months and trey are doing fine.
B000MF6HZA|5|Great for hiking on hot day
B008VR61HU|1|it was actually not what was described.  All the parts were not there, and no instructions were include so I had to call Bestem and when they emailed the instructions, there were pieces missing and extra pieces I didn't need.  What I did get put together did not fit.<br />Really wanted this backrest so I returned it to exchange for one with all the parts and instructions. Hope the new one is better.
B000GZLMOM|5|Took 3 days to &#34;prepare for shipment&#34; which consisted of a cardboard box with 3 pieces of newspaper in it.  But once I got them I like them and more importantly the girlfriend really likes them.  As the other people have said, takes about 5 minutes to install.  Remove your old pins, remove your pegs, slide these floorboards in place, install the supplied bolt/washer/nyloc.  Repeat.  Bodabing.
B004BD0N1I|5|the cut is perfect, no flaws in the lines. its the perfect size.  The color is solid.  Great product.  Thanks!
B004A6JA2O|5|I am not one to write reviews but this product defin, deserves one. I used this to replace a fram brand cabin filter (roughly 12,000 miles). I am no car expert but it took me 5 min, to replace and after placing it in the air flow from my vents simply outstanding. I am not sure if this is because the old filter was clogged thus restricting the air flow, or this filter has bigger pores to let air pass through. none the less, the vents were blowing better. i live in AZ. I will see if the filter helps reduce the dust passing through.
B004UL5RUI|5|This is I would like to buy things for a long time. Now I do! I like it very much.
B00JHK34RA|5|I love it
B007Y85H5E|5|super fast shipping, and this fixed the problem.  Thanks
B0058KVQY6|4|good
B000VJPULY|5|Super !
B004HMBK5G|5|These are a must have to keep the shoulder strap out of my neck! Every vehicle now has one!
B000ALBS0K|5|This arrived in a timely manner. What can you really say about a support arm? It does the job as OEM equipment and has held up thus far one year later. Would order again if needed.
B0002MBVCC|1|Be warned these are not custom fit mats, more like semi custom and that's a stretch. They did not fit well in my 2005 honda pilot. Returned to amazon and had to pay return shipping. Not worth it!!!
B002C25YCS|5|These Solar Power Controllers are very reliable, and I would certainly recommend them.
B00OPA48MC|5|Such a wonderful surprise to receive this tag.<br />Quality is excellent.
B0007TBP12|5|I purchased the Weather Tech Pet Barrier over a month ago.  It received good reviews, so I took a chance . . .  as I was desperate!  Driving with two beagles in the car (when they know they're going to the dog park!) can, at times, be extremely DANGEROUS!  I found the product to be very sturdy and well made - no way those beagles would make their way to the front seat:)  It was SO easy to put together and fit to my car (a crossover) like a glove.  I appreciated that they customed a product to my car's make and model. . . . The first day Otis squirmed his way through the  barrier - but, i just adjusted the panels.  No problems since. . . . I found the price fair, the installation easy - and I'm really happy with it!
B0085H6J9G|1|Window lock switch was inoperable.  Returned for refund.
B00413CLYU|3|The only thing I didn't like was the instructions they're not good at all but if you have common sense you'll be able to figure it out
B00E6BZ8WE|5|Accents the interior very well
B001P2JONQ|5|My puppy had pulled our old bumper plugs out, so I purchased this as a replacement.  It fits very snug so I'm hoping he can't pull it out- the only mistake I made was in thinking this was a two pack.  If you need two, you need to order two.  I'm not sure how I missed that!
B0015PN010|4|This is a good tool, but I was trying in vain to buy American, even paying a little higher price for it. Turns out that, like everything else in this country, this OTC Ball Joint Separator is made in Taiwan. Says so on the OTC package. And there is no OTC marking on the tool either. So, if you are thinking of buying American, don't bother. Direct from Taiwan would have been a lot cheaper.
B0068FWSV0|5|Its a filter!  Replaces a K&N that a previous owner installed, I'm a fan of filtering my air, not voodoo wishes of horsepower. Installing any vstrom filter is a royal pain, but it fit well and the bike runs. What more is there to say?
B000COB166|5|I got these pads for a steal from amazon.  They were less than many far inferior pads.  Only had them for a few weeks, but so far so good.
B000FR61JM|5|has worked flawlessly over the last year and even comes with the option to send in the core to get a little money back.
B004BC9ABS|5|Item was exactly what I was looking for. Timely shipping too.
B000KVAM20|5|Fits nice, looks nice, durable, great for the dogs
B000HA9O5A|5|ITEM JUST AS PICTURED.
B009VMUHX8|5|Any boot might save your foot but I know for a fact that this will do it as it slides down the asphalt with a motorcycle still laying on it!  My ribs ached for a month but my foot was unscathed! I bought this pair to replace the ones sacrificed.<br />They are easy to slip beneath the shifter.  They do not feel clunky while riding and they're not bad to walk in casually but they're not casual shoes. I wear a US 13.  A little narrow on the foot but I'm sure they will break in soon.  Adjustable calves so they don't bite you in the back of the leg. Nicely lined with wicking material to keep the feet dry.  I wear cotton athletic socks in the summer with them and my feet stay comfortable. The legs of regular jeans slide over the top fine.  They do look good.  This is my second pair and I could have spent a lot more on a fancier brand, but why when I know that these do the job? I was able to buy this last pair with free shipping too!  That made a good deal even better. I believe in wearing good safety gear while riding my motorcycle and I hope that you do too.
B00EQ15YCI|5|Bought for a friends birthday for a joke.  Worked perfect
B007G7PUMS|5|good stuff
B0066SMFEO|5|Exact fit for BMW 325i 2001 Model. No issues.
B0022XR7FO|5|Better throttle response. Lowered the sound of my exhaust. Parts/instructions are easy to understand and well built.  I would recommend the product to my friends.
B00P60E276|5|My husband love it!!
B000HE6H6K|5|Served the purpose like nothing else when I needed to mount a transmission cooler to the radiator. I was lucky to find it.
B00AQ29EY0|4|I like the product. Would have been helpful to have instructions on how to put the wire on notch side up or down.
B00C0WR8JC|5|Can't work without these!
B0039T059U|5|Is working super good and received before the time is was suppose to be delivered. Was easy to install and fit in the same place as the old one.
B0041FVH6Q|5|Great item.  Now I can get into the bed of my pickup.
B001A0J2JO|4|It's good quality and you are able to see your blind spots. Would recommend this to friends. I like that it just clip on to the existing rear view.
B000H94F6E|2|Item arrived quickly but was non-functioanl.  Obviously a return or refurbished though not advertised that way.  Took several hours to disassemble and get working and you needed a EE degree to make it work.  Still not 100%.  Price was cheap, but as they say you get what you pay for.
B00FF1K7BQ|2|I don't get it...I diluted it like they suggest and it lasts 10 miles.  If I don't dilute it, it's overpowering but also just lasts 10 miles.
B000CRPFHE|5|This mirror is very solid & not hard to install sheenly colored with no shaking while driving even though i bent the plastic on my car door a little during installation i got it on and pluged in but next time i will be more gentle or pay a professional. this item came on time & with no damage at all im very pleased.
B005FANOIK|5|This White Tiger plate was a gift. A new car, a new front vanity plate of a White Tiger. Kind of steep prices compared with other plate manufacturers but they claim durable quality and well made plates. And I'm happy to say they are BUT...the plate that came was a way different color than the picture shown. The car came and we had no plate to give her because we had to wait for the replacement plate in the correct color. Still, they did send the corrected plate at no charge. The settings on the spray guns must have been off that day or someone over there really really likes Purple Tigers. All in all they did make it right. It ruined our surprize but, we did get the corrected plate which was absolutely beautiful. Honest sellers. I would do business with them again.
B00I5GLHR6|1|Doesn't fit, try to put it on my 87 won't work, doesn't lineup.
B007XJ9CBO|5|It's a lanyard, what can I say.  Works and great design.  You just gotta be ready for people asking &#34;What is on your lanyard?&#34;.
B00KX0XKYU|5|Work just like they're supposed to and look great!
B000A37G1S|4|Fast delivery.  They go on easily and I love the look but fitment could be better.  I can't say how well they'll stay on only time will tell
B00C50NI5W|5|Excellent!....cheap insurance for doors. Installed super quick on 09 JK 2 door. Even came with small magnetig paint protector for during installation.
B008FITHS0|5|Husband has not put on camper.  I know I will like it if and when it ever gets on the camper.
B0036R6IT6|4|Very strong and well built.  Mine came with the rubber latches which is fine, but they require 2 hands to lift cover since they catch the hooks when trying to lift. My only real complaint.<br />Installation hardware included is fine.<br />Installation was a bit tricky.  I had to take off my rear rack to get the holes lined up correctly. (CanAm Outlander 800)<br />I bought a rubber seal kit at local hardware store to dust proof the door.<br />Good price for the product.
B004056HFS|5|But my knucklehead kid totaled the vehicle after I bought these, but for the short time they were on there, they were great.
B002XM5G70|5|Positive:<br />Much quieter than Airstream OEM Shurflo Extreme 4900.<br />Water flow is even without noticeable pulsing.<br />It is an exact fit replacement for original pump water intake and discharge connections.<br />Installation was easy with the only difference being  mounting foot width is different by about 1 inch,  but that is no  problem as the pump is attached to wood floor with self taping screws.<br />I like it, it works, it is quiet, and it does not leak.<br /><br />Negative:  None so far
B000CII93U|5|Packaging was as good as it gets. The price was ridiculously low compared to every other place out there. I HIGHLY recommend this product. I replaced my flowmasters for these along with a new bassani catted x and it turned the note into a BEAST. Well worth the money. Stainless steel and well put together. Would definitely buy again if I were to do it all over again. A+++++
B003VAPEHA|5|Excellent, very easy to install.....
B002X7TGSK|5|Just purchased this item and installed same on the trailor hitch of my SUV. It makes a statement, identifying the owner/driver to those in the know without saying a single word. With I.D. basically established, there is much less pressure during a possible interview on all involved, though proper protocol and procedures should still be observed at all times.<br /> If the preceding seems cryptic, then you are NOT in the know and do not need to be; if you undersand what it means - good, and above all, be safe out there.
B00B5HSLO4|4|product was as described and fits well to my 2014 Rhino...
B008W03RFK|3|It's very small.  Had to enlarge the hole so it would go on my antenna.  Cannot see it across the parking lot but is visible if I'm in the wrong row and checking right and left.
B00HJ158ZA|4|Keeps the smoker's stink out of my car
B00ABQAJAE|5|perfect for people  who want to look at muggles all day lol. fits perfectly, any harry potter fan will love this
B000E5XM0Q|4|I've used K&N in my previous vehicles and just dropped one in my 06 GTO. As before the fit was factory perfect. While there's no seat of the pants difference I have noticed a slight increase in fuel mileage, nearly 1 mpg more. I expect this one will outlast my car, as did my previous ones, paying for itself. My only word of caution is that if you do correctly follow the cleaning and re-oiling instructions be careful not to over oil it, you really need very little, or you can damage your MAP sensor.
B00WU0BHUA|5|I love this stuff and love the price!
B00684TAYY|5|great item
B00A3WIW78|5|all very well as expected reponsable store.
B005HMDF1M|4|I purchased this fender pack for my 08 yz450f and it fit the front fender very well. It stayed on and was still tight after 3 hours of riding. Fits plenty of tools and gear. I use it for a spare front tube, tire pump, patch kit, tire irons and some zip ties. I would have liked to see it fit the back fender too. I tied to tie it down on the rear fender but it just slipped off. pretty durable and has large zippers.
B000BGOJCS|5|This is an improvement of the original of the same model. I have the original toilet which sprang a leak after many years.  I thought this model was identical. I was wrong the operation has been simplified and much improved.
B0009IQZFM|5|Fantastic
B0055EMW34|5|This mudguards fit perfectly on the Sienna XLE Limited 2011 as advertised, installation was very easy and they look great, would buy again!!!
B000924QO0|5|Just used this on my new 2013 Ram 1500. Wanted to give it good protection for an upcoming trip. Goes on and comes off very easily, and leaves an awesome shine. You can feel the difference in the finish before and after, and the gloss is remarkable. Will definitely use again and again.<br />Here's an update on this product.........used this 4 days ago, and last night drove through a massive swarm of bugs, leaving splatters all over the front of my truck. What would normally take 20 minutes to scrub off took less than 2 minutes. The glossy mirror finish basically wiped clean and the bugs came right off with no scrubbing at all. An awesome product, I highly recommend this.
B000BO6O96|4|These are a little larger than the OEM ones that disappear when you park at Walmart.  But they are light enough that it seems like they aren't putting stress on the valve stems.  The accuracy seems to be within a couple of pounds.  I'm pretty certain the plastic is cheap enough the UV will break it down in a couple of years but its cheap enough to replace if I still have the vehicle (I've still got one OEM to swap in).
B003S8GDTI|5|This key only needed to be programmed to vehicle. I could have done it myself but did not know how. I paid Ford and they programmed key and fob for 50. Excellent way to get a second set of keys for vehicle.
B004992OJI|1|I agree with the other two Xterra reviewers - this air filter is the wrong size.  Don't buy it.  The length is supposed to be 9 inches, but what gets shipped is over 10 inches, and it won't fit in the Xterra.  I am annoyed with Amazon because two other people have complained about this product, but they keep selling it.  After I found the first shipment did not fit, Amazon sent me a replacement, but that was identical to the first one.  I sent back both shipments for a refund.  Amazon folks, if you read this please pull this product and don't waste anyone else's time.
B006VU3TL0|3|These are ok- If I had to do this on another car I would spend the money to get powder coated calipers or just paint the ones I have. The mounting is universal even though the are specific to you vehicle. They didn't seem to fit quite right and it does not cover the entire caliper. I ended up painting them anyway then using the cover. for the price I do not think it is worth it.
B000EPSVCK|1|Bought this about a year ago. Worked great in LA but as soon as I moved to NYC it crapped out.  I typically use this to jumpstart my Harley and it just doesn't seem to produce enough juice to crank the bike. I've had to jump the bike using jumper cables and my car.  Would definitely get something stronger next time.
B000BNOI8G|2|The quality is too cheap for real use. Great fun though when using it at a party or as a throw away.
B007RLPX4S|5|It is aftermarket item, made in China. Fits directly and works well. I give it 5 for low price and good quality.
B004J0X7UW|5|The only thing that nearly kept me from buying this gauge was the fact that it had no reviews, but let me tell you I'm glad I ended up buying this. It feels solid and looks like its good quality. Absolutely needed this today as I was running nearly 50psi lower than what is recommended for my purposes and now my fixie feels so much better/faster (averaged 5mph faster than my ride yesterday). Definitely a tool you'll need even if your half serious about riding.
B0056N19UG|5|Nice size for rear window in car...suggest you place it in a corner and not directly in middle of window...<br />vibrant blue color...shows up well in window...<br /><br />great price for a semi-specialty item (military-specifically: Air Force Mom)<br /><br />* it can definitely fit on a laptop cover<br /><br />I am very pleased!
B001KSGJKQ|5|Original switch, fit perfectly.
B009KW82CC|5|The order came right on time. There was nothing wrong with the product and it spun perfectly fine. I'm even thinking about buying the others for a collection.
B006B270OU|5|Solid, sure, secure feeling brakes with this set of pads for the front disk of my 2003 XLH1200C Harley-Davidson Sportster. I just wish I could find the same pads for the rear.
B009WQPY72|5|Just what you would expect, a box of 3 amp fuses.  Hard to find in stores, but if you need several of the same size, this is the way to go.
B007G2KJTW|4|This is such a nice rug.  It's all woven plastic sweeps up nicely. Water goes right through it and it can be hosed off easily to clean off mud.
B003CJMUXG|1|not get the full kit missing seals
B009THCEJA|5|If you have a BUELL XB12XT, these fit perfectly. I didn't realize how bad my old bearings were until I installed these replacements! Done about 1000 miles so far - all good!
B000RFUF12|5|Works great on motor home where it is important not to overfill batteries.
B00GKTZAHS|3|Good for registration plate but a little small for window
B001O026WA|4|I only give it 4 stars because, even though it arrived on time, bolted right up,and works just fine, I don't know how long it will last because there was no built in screen on the suction side.Otherwise its fine.
B00CRB2102|5|Work excellent in my kia sedona 2006
B00COYNZHK|5|love them, they have a  safety lock so they not slide
B009DJTQJU|5|Perfect fit
B003UXZ6RG|4|I love the cover, just a little difficult to put on - but, otherwise - very nice quality.
B000BN3A4Y|5|This was shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.  It was exactly as advertised and will last us for many years to come.
B000PEW4I2|3|Auto dealer that can't be used with self etching primer? Seems odd, but I guess it has uses. Keep in mind you can't return it. The price was right, if you aren't priming aluminum, I like I need to do.
B004LF5BQ8|5|Landing pad matched my other original pad in both looks and quality.  Quick delivery so no camping time was misses.
B007RUVZD2|2|The product description said it would come with instructions, there were none.<br />I had to figure it out on my own.
B004C443P8|1|I am 5'3&#34; 155lbs and large was too small?
B0082365AQ|4|i will agree with all who say these wheels stink...bad, but at this price i can store them outside of my apt or vehicle.<br /><br />my kayak is a 9ft ocean kayak sit on top that weighs about 50lb. I am 5ft10 female.<br /><br />at first these wheels frustrated me - the strap that comes with them is pretty much useless and does not hold it even near tight enough.<br /><br />It took a few tries (and a few spills of the kayak to the ground) to finally get this down. With no instructions, it was all trial and error - I added two bungee cords along with the useless strap it was just ok - also found that i started with the wheels too far to one end of the kayak which didn't work so I just kept moving it forward to find the magic spot.<br /><br />The winning combo.... (for me and my Ocean kayak sit on top)<br />wheels placed center of kayak with the heavier back end of my kayak to be my front when pulling - the two little &#34;legs&#34; of the wheels frame face the actual front end of my kayak which is my back end when pulling because, as i mentioned, i pull it with the heavy end to the front. The HUGE difference is to get yourself a ratchet strap so that you can wrap it around the wheel frame and the kayak and fasten those suckers tight together so there is no wiggle room! with this combo i toss my paddles, seat, vest, water bottle, etc on the kayak and, because the weight is on the wheels, i effortlessly walk a couple blocks to the beach and across the sand to play in the surf!  (obviously its a bit more effort on sand)<br /><br />oh...and they are light enough that i put them on the front of my sit on top and it doesn't weigh me down much.<br /><br />deducted a star because it is trial and error and my kayak fell to the pavement a couple times.
B001P2LBPA|5|Work's well
B0030GBLRW|5|Best Carcare ever
B005O25CXE|3|Pro: install was easy, and they attach inside the window channel.<br /><br />Con: my wife is short (5'3&#34;), and they obstruct her view slightly, increasing the size of the blind spot on the drivers side frame.
B0009IQZPW|5|I have never seen this type of applicator pads.  They are wonderful<br />for applying Meguiar's leather cleaning and protectant.<br />I have not washed out.  I probably won't, since they will always<br />be used for the same leather furniture.
B00HYMFCUU|1|The smaller backseat view was extremely blurry, do not purchase if you need it for that reason
B00192JGY4|2|Not worth what they cost. In cold weather the gauge shows empty even though the tank is full.
B0091YWA22|5|Make my boat look fly
B006WHEBGE|2|Did not work for my 99 intrigue, i eventually had to go to the dealer and replace it with a new one that actually worked.
B000OQJJQ6|4|i love mickey so its hard to disappoint me....they are  a little flimsy and thin...trying to flip up on driver mat...but worked it out...
B00MVUWHRG|5|Top notch!
B003JIGOUK|1|Bought this cover for my Warn Winch.  Has no way to secure it to the Winch frame.  It seemed to fit tight but flew off on the freeway the first time out.  Not worth the money!
B003V1BHX4|5|Had to alter the cooling shroud slightly otherwise good product much less expensive than buying local
B005SUW82K|5|These brake pads fell right into place on my 08 KFX450R. They good quality brake pads and will last quite a few seasons of riding.
B001J7CO02|1|Train horn was very loud until one of the horns snapped off will diving down the road almost taking out the car behind me not very happy. Only had the horns installed for a month or so they were sitting in garage then I finally had time to install and this happens. I won't buy this product again
B004KEIF4U|1|Waste of money tried it on a variety of filters (i have five different cars) did not work for any of them. Great paperweight and conversation piece
B00751HREY|5|These gloves are 100% waterproof. I put my hand deep into water for 3 straight minutes. Took it out and put my hand in towel and was 100% dry.<br /><br />Cons: They are big makes driving a little unconformable, but not by much<br /><br />Order big sizes, I'm normally L on this type of gloves I had to buy 2XL
B00ACFOCHU|1|item is listed as fitment for mk3..but it doesnt...material is cheap is not worth what i pay,,i would avoid
B000XG8Q0W|5|These are the greatest things for the car!  They keep things organized, safe, and provide much needed hanging space for big shopping trips, backpacks, and purses!
B00755JMYS|1|I just put these in the map lights of my suburban. They didn't seem very bright so I got out my light meter and compared them to my 17 year old incandescent bulbs and discovered that these bulbs put out half the ouput of my old bulbs as measured by my incident light meter!  The reflector base also had to be drilled before they would go in as their square shape is larger than the old bulbs. Look elsewhere if you're looking for high output. \\"Bright\\" is not an accurate description of these lights. I'm looking for more LED's now that can at least match the output of a 17 year old incandescent bulb.<br /><br />Update: These are the ones to get if you want bright:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008KP7MIA B008KP7MIA]]<br /><br />They cost a good bit more but are much brighter than my old incandescent bulbs.
B009R57LBU|3|The Size of the reindeer auto outfit was a lot smaller than the ones I had seen driving around, the nose is very small
B00UXK6G5U|5|Nice item
B00HQZNOQO|5|I was a bit nervous buying this for my 2007 vw beetle, but it fit perfectly!
B00173U7D4|5|the scent is fresh and clean, a little goes a long way, i really like it. i like it being natural.
B00DNDBJVK|1|Cheap. Have bought better ones for a cheaper price at Walmart. Regret this purchase.
B003ULTBJ2|5|My 2004 Mini Cooper backup light quit working. Bad bulb, I thought. No, it was the backup switch.<br />This one fit my vehicle perfectly, though reaching the original switch requires to remove the air box from the engine bay, not hard to do if you have the tools.<br />Dropped it in, backup light on again.
B000QGI6E0|4|You have to purchase the lamps separately from the bar they mount on. They come with separate mounting instructions.  The installation instructions are practically worthless.  So if you buy this product, just find the Yamaha website blog that shows a blow-by-blow how-to on installing these.  These are pretty nice OEM lights once you get past the poor installation instructions.
B00252F3AI|5|Well it's been over a year and a half, my poor car needed a new air filter, with the heat and the high gas prices, this was a smart solution! My mileage already increased by 3mpg!!
B000CODE0W|2|It's too big and bulky. Can not use with Euro cars because no space to get angles and in tight places. Don't buy this because I return it. I'm you can use it if you are repairing lawn mowers, motorcycle, but for automotive.
B0016I8E1M|5|I had been looking for an extended period of time, for a receiver based cargo platform. Every other unit I had looked at was cheap, flimsy and lacking a safety breaklight system. The Rola system is made out of strong tubular steal. This created a song non wobbiling platform for our goods. Be sure to buy the optional light kit. That upgrade is well worth the added security and peace of mind. I plan I buying one of these four other family members for there camping excursions
B00LBK05MQ|5|Recommend to get the job done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great Quality!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fast Shipping!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007KCXNJ6|5|The product was shipped quickly and performed as advertised.
B009TDVRKQ|3|glove is not warm it is very , very cheap material, does not protect or keep hans warm would not buy again
B00EDFM5QU|5|These were a bit bluer than I expected but not to the point of being unpleasant.  We use them in the RV kitchen, bunk bed, and hall areas with a very nice result.  These were very easy to put in the sockets, which some I ordered from another vendor were not.  These are excellent pleasantly bright and well built.  Would absolutely use this vendor again.
B005K97RRA|4|After 18 months our childs ride on train would no longer charge well. As the charger was supplying voltage, I took the chance that the problem was the battery and decided to replace it . The battery dimensions, voltage rating, and current rating matched perfectly with the original battery and was one third the price of the replacement battery from the toy manufacturer. I unsoldered the old battery connector and used it with the new battery. After reading about charging of these very cheap lead acid batteries with their very cheap chargers, I decided to carefully monitor the obtained battery voltage. I found that although the original instructions said to charge the battery for 14 hours, 30 minutes seemed to give this battery a complete charge. So far the battery has worked well in the ride on train and my two year old grandson is having a ball.
B00DHUA9VA|4|Works well for the most part.  jumping between preselected radio stations does not work correctly in the corvette.  I've tried the default programming as well as custom, and it still doesn't work.
B001AIZ5HY|2|I consider myself very detailed and direction driven. No directions in box. Watched several videos and did procedure twice. Not happy with results. Not good.
B00AH4GX4G|5|It is cute and different. Good service. It arrived quickly. It's easier to find my car now! I would buy another.
B003EOZCHA|5|I wanted and got a quality gasket set to go with my JBA headers, but quality, you will not go wrong
B003TPGKJ8|5|Fantastic oil, highly recommended!
B00C5RHTG4|5|Worked and fit perfect,, measure your glass and also the side with holes for screws??? No holes so I drilled mine out and countersink the holes. Worked great as replacement on my 1996 Flair m/h..
B008CE09N4|5|Perfect Adapter.
B0075XHDHI|2|This unit had superb fit and finish.  The threads didn't need to be chased to operate smoothly.  I only used the 4.75 mm DIN/ISO die to make a few test bubble flares in 3/16&#34; Copper-Nickle-iron alloy line before returning the kit as unsatisfactory.  In each of my tests, the profile of the bubble flanks and mating / sealing surface was wrong.  Slight linear adjustments to the line's position in the forming bar did not help this condition.  I really liked the way the forming die fit into the depression in the forming bar.  This made for wrinkle-free, and perfectly aligned bubbles.  The bubble flare dies are chromed and they impart a polish to the mating surface.  Because I was unhappy with the look of the results, I didn't use the tool to make my actual replacement brake line.  To be fair, the bubble flares made with this tool may have sealed just fine but I'll never know.
B002OPKWZW|5|Good stuff, not flimsy Chinese junk
B004A6OEVQ|5|Great price, on time, and exactly what I needed. I plan on being a repeat consumer for my parts. Thank you!
B00075OSCO|2|These batteries are great, I've owned several.  They're non-spillable and last much longer than your standard lead/acid batteries.  The problem is apparently Amazon does not read any of the reviews here about packaging.  My batteries arrived in a thin cardboard box with one piece of brown wrapping paper wrapped around them.  Needless to say both of the batteries were destroyed and now I'm at the mercy of Amazon's customer service to get new ones.  Thanks Amazon!
B0006SU3QW|5|Awesome product, plasti-dipped my 04 mustang hood,rocker strips, door handles and rims. If you are creative and know what you are doing I would definitely recommend this product.
B00KL3ALGO|5|The shades are absolutely amazing and easy to use! I drive a Mazda CX-7 and they perfectly cover the windows and keep the sun out of my sons eyes. They go on so easily the first time, which really surprised me because shades are normally so finicky. And the customer service with enovoe was the best experience I've ever had. THEY emailed ME just to say thank you and let me know they cared! Wow!!
B00CUQPS40|1|The seatcovers I received were not the seat covers depicted in the photo that accompanied the the description of them.
B005ETWJCO|5|TOP NOTCH
B004YWP942|5|Good
B00V92PAMQ|5|My 2015 Jeep Wrangler has holes on the ledt side top and bottom. I was able to attach it with one screw. I love it and already have gotten several compliments on it.
B009UH66R0|5|Great product and quick shipping
B00D0IA5TU|5|Easy installation, went on without problem, works great!
B008I26JNO|5|Although this part works perfectly when installed it remains to be seen how long it last. Beck Arnley generally makes good products, but time will tell for this one. A lot of aftermarket wheel bearings don't last more that a year before they are howling. I'm hoping this ends up being one of the good bearings available.
B004NFU3C8|5|Works great... Perfect
B000F5ECUY|5|For the price, this was perfect. Did all the valves on a six cylinder Subaru engine very quickly with this tool. The instructions state that you should tap the valve spring caps with a hammer, i used a piece of 1&#34; tubing i had laying around. Definitely do this part for every valve, it loosens up the keepers and makes the whole job easier.
B004KEJXZA|1|used it once to suction oil (approx six  ounces) from engine. drained it and stored.  3 mos. later and no suction when i went to use it again.<br />. contacted company and no answer.<br />took it apart and was unable to develop a vacuum to pull oil.<br />waste of money and time.
B003TAB6Q0|2|I purchased this frame back in September 2012 and liked it right away. It looked set apart and of better quality than the ones I've seen on other cars. Plus it complemented the silver color of my van. Now that the Midwest winter is over though, at least we hope, there are three diamonds missing and it has lost its luster. It is hard to remove what debris has accumulated over the winter in all the little nooks and crannies. I was planning on buying the second one for the front but it would not be wise to do that now. This can work for someone who lives in a milder weather but I wouldn't recommend it for snow bunnies.
