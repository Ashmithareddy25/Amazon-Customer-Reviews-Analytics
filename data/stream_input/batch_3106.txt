B00BXDOSXS|5.0|Will play files that other video apps will not. I'm not sure if it's my file but I can't hear the movie. Sound is there, just too low to enjoy. I will try other files to see what the problem is but I like this app.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|great simple app. period here for enough said.<br />except for this to fill minimum word requirements. I like waking on time. you should too.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app that I strongly recommend for any horse lover. It has also has lots of fun mini games.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|just like any book to movie the director takes creative reign. i saw a lot of bad reviews complaing about how it wasnt like the 1974 movie.this isnt 1974 and it wouldnt make much sense to do the exact same thing over again. This is a fun and creative version of the book. i loved every minute and the soundtrack is amazing as well. i have a feeling that perhaps there might be a generational gap but appreciate this version for the creative liberties as it is not copy and paste version of the book. i loved it so much that it is now the theme to my new years party. not to even mention leo was amazing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great gadget for little money! Works like a charme and does exactly what it´s expected to do... not more, not less :-)
B00005JL0I|4.0|The parts with Woody Allen are funny. He saved the show, I think. Other than that, I like it for nostalgia. It's typical Peter Sellers romantic comedy from the 60's. Maybe a little boring by today's standards, but still recommended.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|great and easy to play<br />love the twist and better than upset fowl. if you like campy vamps this is the game for you.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The app is flawless and the graphics quality is awesome. I just don`t understand why he (the minion)always at the. beginning of a game turns and screams?
B0018AO9A8|5.0|Containing just five numbers, Dire Straits' fourth album release from September 1982 remains one of their most highly regarded and enduring. The compositions are often complex, the playing exemplary and the overall mood more `serious' than on their other work to date. David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine wrote of LOG:<br /><br />\\"Love Over Gold is not just the title of Dire Straits' fourth album, it is a statement of purpose. In almost suicidal defiance of commercial good sense, singer-songwriter-guitarist Mark Knopfler has chosen to follow his muse, fashioning a collection of radically expanded epics and evocative tone poems that demand the listener's undivided attention...\\"<br /><br />Lyrically we are in Dylan-esque story-telling territory here, with a streak of irony and semi-detachment from the material. The >14 minute opener `Telegraph Road' tells the story of how small-town America and, by extension, the nation was built:<br /><br />\\"Then came the churches then came the schools<br />Then came the lawyers then came the rules<br />Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads<br />And the dirty old track was the telegraph road...\\"<br /><br />The souring of the American dream as economic and industrial decline sets in is poetically described, while the human spirit remains strong.<br /><br />`Private investigations' is another perennial favorite with fans, a downbeat but powerful slow number full of menace and dark humor as a PI recounts a professional life spent looking through people's dirty little secrets.<br /><br />Not as commercially successful as its record-breaking follow-up `Brothers in Arms', LOG is nevertheless overall a more satisfying experience for the listener and a strong contender for DS' career-best album release. The oddly memorable title was reportedly taken from some graffiti found sprayed on a wall near Knopfler's apartment in London: \\"Give me love over gold any day\\".

B00FJTYDKK|5.0|It was unexpectedly good. I laughed, cried and fell in love with the Croods. The movie was so visually appealing and used such gorgeous colors.....and their hair blowing in the wind, amazing. Five stars all around!
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|so bored..I've read every J.G. novel, always a good page turner. This time, meh?!just bored.In all fairness I haven't finished this book yet,but did I mention that I was bored by it?<br />Big disappointment for this long time Grisham fan.
B00AG0D4GG|4.0|Recorded in NYC in August 1980, Dire Straits’ third album was released in October the same year to widespread critical acclaim. Mark Knopfler’s brother David left during the recording sessions and remains un-credited (his already-recorded guitar parts were re-recorded by his brother), and pianist Roy Bittan gives many of the songs - the opener ‘Tunnel of Love’ for instance - a fuller sound than the guitar-rock foursome who cut the first two albums.<br /><br />The song-writing here is beginning to mature with more thoughtful arrangements especially evident on ‘Romeo and Juliet’, an autobiographical tale written from a third-person perspective by Knopfler about a failed love affair and one of the band’s most enduring songs.<br /><br />All in all this is a minor classic from the 1980s and stands up well with this band’s best work. From ‘Making Movies’ Dire Straits started to achieve widespread international recognition leading to eventual ‘supergroup’ status.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|This thing is crazy. My son is obsessed with it. There are many parts to it that click into and out of place that your kid will discover after a while playing with it, but without the annoying noises and flashing lights of most other toys. If your kid loves excavators or bulldozers I highly recommend this item!
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|I like this movie. It reminded me a little of The Croods what with the overprotective father and the new boy coming into the picture and introducing them to something new, but I still very much liked it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|not finished yet but loving it. I especially like the summary shows that summarize the previous seasons. I usually need that after the hiatus.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I thought the author was very clever, would recommend this book.  Easy reading, relaxing book.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|simple, straight forward, I don't care for all the pop ups but that's to be expected if I'm not going to buy it.

B00A8KJK7G|1.0|So...this is  cartoon movie about a dog who is brought back to life by his owner. Let me warn you: The whole movie does not make ANY sense at all and contains incorrect \\"historical\\" events(the movie appears to take place in the 1950s,but they talk about Pluto no longer being a planet. WTF?) Also, the movie shows mutated sea monkeys getting drunk on beer,which is totally inappropriate for a \\"kids\\" movie(it made me wonder if Disney was trying to make sea monkey versions of Bender of \\"Futurama\\") All the people looked alike-sunken-in faces with dark circles around the eyes. Disney and Burton must of been asleep at the wheel,for they REALLY fouled up this movie. If you want your kids to see a REAL family movie,let them watch something like \\"Cars\\", \\"Kung-Fu Panda\\" or even \\"Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island\\".
0525478817|5.0|I'm an 18 year old male that was assigned to read this at my local community college. After being assigned the book, I figured that because it was a mandatory read, I figured like previous experiences that it wouldn't be good.<br /><br />I can't be any more wrong. I had 2 days left to read the book. Once I started, I can't explain how much I got into this book. It keeps you hooked. Chapter by chapter, new things happen, suspense builds and you just can't help but to read on for what happens next.<br /><br />This book is sad, funny, but overall amazing.<br /><br />Finishing the book, I felt as if I was a changed person and that somehow, the characters in the book felt so real like I knew them personally and that everything happened in real life.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to dedicate their time to reading it.<br /><br />Great book overall.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|This game looks boring at first but it is amazing . It is a on the edge of your seat game. It is perfect game.
B00A6SZS2Q|3.0|I like the songs that are fast,but I just don't like all the ballads.  I've always had a soft spot for 80s metal and these guys are the reincarnation of it.  I really prefer a better flow to an album, that's why I buy them instead of purchasing individual songs.

1451666179|5.0|I love Hyperbole and Half and Allie Brosh! This book is NICE. It's full color and high quality paper. It has a good weight to it but it isn't so thick that it's obnoxiously heavy (like The Walking Dead compendium is).

B00CFYAT6O|4.0|I have been following Tedeschi and Trucks since before they were a couple and first saw him when he was 11 years old. That being said I am a big fan of both and together they are a powerhouse. Obviously a lot of lot of love gone into this and having been done in their nice home studio it has a relaxed and confident feel. My only reservation is while they like to compare this band to Mad Dogs and Englishmen it is still almost entirely a vehicle for Ms. Tedeschi and Mr. Trucks. This band has so much individual talent but you rarely get to hear it very much unlike MD&E where all the players got solid solo shots. Live, it may be different, I've been unable to catch them so far. But I was hoping for a more ensemble effort on this go around. Still a great album. But why I rate it one star shy.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Just love this item.  Good music and behind the scenes video.  I would definitely order again.  If your an Eagles fan good music and video
B005IULERU|3.0|I bought this book for my grandparents so that they might know the hilarity of DYAC since they don't own a computer or smart phone. Unfortunately I'm not sure they'll be able to read it. While the print is large, for some reason the book is formatted so that the images, in color, of the autocorrects are pasted as is and then printed out in black and white. This greatly lowers the readability of the texts, and some pages were much darker than the rest due to a printing error and even I had difficulty reading them. So I was rather disappointed with the quality and formatting of this book.
B001EC2IXK|4.0|I love this old classic. My husbands # 1 movie of choice. The ending could of been better relating to real life it makes you sad

B001NLKZUA|5.0|I loved this book as much as I loved the first one! This series is so addicting and consuming, I couldn't put it down if I tried! I'm so excited too see what the future books bring for Clary. Ugh! These books are almost too good, I'm beyond impatient to keep reading.
1400052181|5.0|The book was in perfect condition, crisp cover and pages. Came on time and as described. Great read, would definitely recommend!
B003UYUP58|5.0|What an interesting book and history of medicine. Mukherjee provides a full background about cancer without getting overally technical. There is little research or knowledge about cancer before the 20th century, so the book primarily is a review of the past 100 years and what an excellent discussion. My assumption is cancer research followed the scientific method. That assumption could not have been more incorrect.<br /><br />Mukherjee presents the human aspect of many individuals, both patients and doctors, particularly medical researchers. He discusses the rush for a cure during the 50s and 60s and researchers relied on hunches, guess work, and relied on ever greater radical surgery. There was an assumption that once a cure for one cancer was identified it would apply to all cancers.<br /><br />The book reviews fund raising efforts and government involvement, particularly the advent of the National Cancer Institute and it's role. Key personalities are presented. While the focus is on the U.S. where much of the research has taken place, but it does delve into research from Europe and Australia. While there are many failures a great deal of progress has been made in curing cancers. The genome project has been productive in leading to.cures, and there is now a complementary effort to identify and document all cancers.<br /><br />I can recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a background knowledge about cancer, particularly the human aspects. Personalities are presented, successes and many, many failures are discussed, all in a very humanistic manner. If you have any desire for a background about cancer, it's human impact from a generalists perspective then this is an excellent book for you. Highly recommended.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is a fun little hidden object game.  The story it's woven around is a classic pirate adventure yarn.  The quality of the photos used are quite good.  I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

B00F91H15W|4.0|We had an hour and a half to pass Friday evening, so The Bling Ring made the cut. It was good- and made more interesting by being based on real events. Emma Watson is always fun to see, and it was very interesting that the main male character was a baby- faced guy, not at first glance hot or charismatic, but he was just right in the role.
B00902AKK4|5.0|Great!!!!  Stimulates the brain.  Love the YouTube connections for when u get stuck and the great set of instructions.  I have recommended it to many of my friends.

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Great season, this show is real good.  We can't get it on TV, can't wait for the season 3 to come out!
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|This movie was recommended to me by a coworker and it makes me wonder about that coworker.  I remember when it first came out and was very popular, but I didn't care for all the blood shed.  I didn't think the story line was very believable. I just don't think a black man would have been treated that well back then.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|this app is so awesome .you can purchase it and can use these awsome features that can edit anything and everything.

B00915G6NK|5.0|Excellent show, we've seen the first 3 seasons too, it's well worth it, we don't get sick of this NCIS or the original NCIS shows.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Very good book and it got better as I got closer to the end.  I read a lot of detective novels and this one had some surprises.  I loved that it was a story of the two half brothers working together.
B008S80OU2|5.0|Quick. What pops into your head when I say \\"Blue Öyster Cult\\"? (and note that it took me like 15 minutes to figure out how to get the umlaut over the O). First thing is \\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\", right? And the second thing is \\"just another one-hit wonder\\".<br /><br />At least that's what popped into MY head. Until I was window-shopping on Amazon and saw a BÖC box set on offer. First, I was astonished to see that it was 16 frickin' CDs. And then I was even more astonished that the box came with a download code for four additional disks of live concerts. Yes, that's 20 disks of music from a band you thought had their seven minutes and some-odd seconds of fame in the 70s with (admittedly pretty good) FM radio hit \\"Reaper\\".<br /><br />I dithered over it for a while. Listened to the fragments of each song that Amazon offers as purchase inducement. Read some of the reviews. Decided to take the plunge.<br /><br />Well. Turns out that BÖC (love that umlaut) were far more than one-hit wonders.<br /><br />OK, you're probably thinking. More than one-hit wonders. Yeah. But are they 20 disks worth of more than one-hit wonders?<br /><br />Well...yeah, they are. Let's start with lyrics. These are not typical lost love, unrequited love, past love, need love, can't find love pop poems.  There's a song about the Messerschmitt ME 262, a jet fighter aircraft that, had it been used in timely fashion by Germany in World War Two (it was available beginning in 1941, before the allies had workable jet technology or even advanced piston engine fighters like the P-51 and P-47), might well have altered or at least extended the outcome of the war. Then there's this ditty: \\"This ain't the garden of Eden, there ain't no angels above, and things ain't what they used to be, and this ain't the Summer of Love\\", from the album Agents of Fortune in 1976.<br /><br />But the real treat across all of this massive horde of music is the guitars. These guys knew how to throw electric guitars into a mix, like some unholy genetically engineered spawn of Jimi Hendrix and Keith Richards. In fact, they had a concert gimmick where they ended up with five guitars on stage for a fan favorite that held up year after year.<br /><br />So. Not a one-hit wonder. Rather, a heavy contribution to rock history, extremely listenable music, gorgeous guitars, pounding drums. No Household Should Be Without. And don't forget to download the additional concert disks!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Super cool game and its hard sometimes and easy others but the number one thing about his game is that you got to take risks
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is a fun game that you have to sirvive in! zombies creepers spiders. I love it! best app ever mojang is awesome and so is the game.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Trying to learn is fun, not quite clear on the strategy but I like the game helps you out...recommended this one.
B004RKXN44|5.0|This book was a great read without any suspected conclusions except for the obvious that everyone knows from all Nalini Singh 's books that the heroin always prevails. Some parts of the book you have to reread because the whole power capabilities of Psy's are complicated but still an excellent read.
B00FQMZ5M0|5.0|Great movie!  Intelligently written and great graphics. Love the character development, the scenery.  My son is 3 and although some of it is over his head, that doesn't affect him watching it.  He can't get enough of it. He loves it!  I personally appreciate that it doesn't have any lag spots and it entertains both adults and kids.  I recommend it.  Hopefully they make a second movie for Planes!
030746363X|5.0|I lost over thirty pounds using the simple principles in this book. You still have to apply the principles using willpower, but they work if you work it.
B00F35BV64|4.0|If you thought kids could watch, you'd be wrong. F- is used and also a few sexual scenes I won't describe to keep from spoiling if you're not a kid. But there's one point of absolute murderous rage that I still haven't seen because I know what's coming, and like CSI, the TV series, you really can't get certain graphic images out of your memory bank. So, that all being said, I never liked Chris Pine as Captain Kirk, and finding out not long ago that Spock actor is gay is a killjoy for most women. Admiral Pike and Doctor McCoy characters are very well cast. I preferred the first new Trek to this installment. Romance between Uhura and ______ is NOT believable.  Scotty is also very well cast.  Chris is a good actor, just not my pick for this role as I watched all the original airing of Trek on TV back in the day. The actor portraying the villain is excellent, but also not my pick for the role. (Too white, too British.) Also Carol Marcus character is British with no explanation since her father is not. I have not read any Trek books, so maybe her mother is British? Don't remember her being a weapons expert in the old movie in the 80's. She was a scientist who loved generating life, not blowing it to smithereens. I like the humor in both movies but letting children watch is not an option.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This is the second time, I see the movie and it still engages me. Its a good mixture between action and suspense.
B001BANK32|5.0|Excellent read took a little while to complete it but really good book. Glad I read it you should too
0375507256|5.0|This is one of those rare works that feels complete when you have finished reading it. Mitchells storytelling device is genius metaphor instructure and content. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and enjoyed the way I felt about the beautiful if slightly tragic human condition. This is a must read for humanists, futurists, and anyone with a beating heart.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. Hope everyone else likes it. But the other reel steel game is no where near as amazing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't stop turning the pages. The story depicts a young woman's love for her family and friends, and the tough choices she has to make in a world ravaged with oppression, corrupt governments and  unthinkable terrors around every corner.
B007THA4FI|5.0|A great story of discord in a small town, and how they are all connected.  I little sad, with the coldness of some characters.  But it is a fun read because of Rowlings writing style and turn of a phrase.

159463176X|4.0|It was a very good book, but not as good as the other two he's written.  The major story got wrapped up, but I was hoping for some closure on some of the other characters who were introduced along the way.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read a book that had me completely engrossed. I don't generally enjoy sci fi or zombies stories, but this is nothing like a horror novel. It is an piercing look at the human soul when confronted with annhilation. Great read!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Really a great show.  Very easily draws in the audience.  Violent, but I've seen much bloodier shows in the CSI empire. AND, they aren't afraid to cull the cast from time to time, to add a touch of the feeling hitting home, if you liked that character.<br /><br />THAT takes guts!  (no pun intended!)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Interesting twist in people's lives. Some thought provoking issues. One never knows until they walk in someone else's shoes<br />Gave it a 4  because I liked the book, once I figured out who everyone was<br />Review by margaret not Marc

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I do enjoy  playing this game. I just wish it didn't cost money  for extra time when you're almost done with a level.
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|this album kicks ass!!! but it doesn't surpasses recovery but it is worth the money to buy the entire album i love this album because he tells his ups and down he had in his career which we all had witness,em had somewhat matured as an artist and is running the show instead of the label and he's happy despite Illuminati puppet strings he complains about sometimes other than that he's in a happy place as far as people thinking he's running out of ideas for albums is ridiculous em tries to cover all his basis as far as topics to talk about em is a think tank and never run out of ideas this album is a classic also in my opinion listen at least 3 times and make your own choice.<br />i bought the entire album and have NO REGRETS!! = money well spent!
B008I34Y6W|5.0|This was the first one I bought.  Back then, I didn't have a lot of cash so I basically listened to it until I got it.  It took a while.<br /><br />Now, it's in my top 3.  The guitar solo in Inca Roads is worth the price of admission.  The vocals are fabulous and the studio doesn't have that slick overly done processing that you hear on some of the later recordings.  The group of musicians are among his best.  Quit reading and buy now.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Couldn't put this one down.  The relationship between a young boy, his dysfunctional family, and his strange young female friend and her very unique family provide the setting for a trip into fantasy land without even leaving the child's neighborhood - I think!  If you love imaginative stories or are just starting to explore the world of fantasy, this is the one.
B0053B347M|3.0|Overall packaging was good as usual but the package was 3 days late and one of the LEDS does not have on/off switch. Are you serious Antec? What is that supposed to be?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a fun book. The ending is predictable, but I liked at anyway. It was easy to read and not intense. Enjoyable.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I I love it it so awesome love the part Bella beats Jacob up so funny you will love it
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I devoured the first two novels in this series.  I liked Divergent, found it to be a quick, light read that also contained an interesting and creative premise, and so of course I purchased the second novel.  Insurgent wasn't as good, but I was willing to wait for the third installment to see how Ms. Roth wrapped things up.<br /><br />There were many things left unanswered in the first two books so when I picked up Allegiant I was expecting to have those answers I was hoping for.  They were given to me.  And I was not happy.<br /><br />It seemed as though the author wasn't quite sure of her own story with the first two books, and I had my suspicions that this was the case but I was willing to give her a chance because this story had SO much potential to make a statement in a creative and artistic manner.  I was greeted with pages of characters whining and repeating the same sentiments over and over, a lack of distinction between the voices of Tris and Tobias, unbelievable explanations for what is beyond the world of factions and Divergent individuals and much, much more.<br /><br />First of all, for there to be no real reason for Divergent people is ridiculous.  The first two books placed so much emphasis on these different individuals, building them up to be special just to blow that plot line off entirely was a complete letdown.  I think, had the author perhaps had more time she could have come up with a better reason for there being Divergent individuals in the first place, but she had no idea in mind in Book One, no idea in Book Two, and certainly no idea in Book Three.  It was frustrating.<br /><br />Also, there's the alternating perspectives.  Many have addressed this so I'm just going to say that the two characters were absolutely indistinguishable from one another.  One thing I CAN say is that while Tobias did spend a lot of time whining about being 'damaged', I thought his character development worked fairly well.  Tobias spent his whole life thinking that we was special, that he was a leader.  When he finds out that not only is he not special he is literally considered, by the government, to be 'damaged', I think his reactions though redundant, were accurate.  I wish he could have developed beyond that, maybe finding a middle ground between badass and wimp, but that didn't happen.<br /><br />The explanations given for all the things we were curious about were just lame.  The plot felt contrived and the story felt rushed.  I didn't read this one as quickly as I did the other two, and I didn't even feel like I was in the same series, to be honest.<br /><br />I read somewhere that the author stated that she had no idea when she started the series where she was going with it, and I think that this fact unfortunately caught up with her in 'Allegiant\\".<br /><br />The author is young and shows a lot of potential for development in her writing so I will be reading more from her in the future because I always give authors a second (or in this case, really, fourth) chance.<br /><br />The ending...I knew what would happen when I was introduced to the dual POV, so it didn't come as a surprise to me and I wasn't sad.  I was angry that the author didn't end the series in a more realistic way.  Tris, being truly selfless, would never have left Tobias to grieve her loss after all that he's been through.  Tris wouldn't have been so selfish as to essentially go on a suicide mission.  I think the Tris we've grown to know would have realized that death is the selfish option, not the least selfish.  She didn't have to die, and I am not saying that because I am upset about her death.  I saw it coming a mile away and while suffering through the narrative I wished for her to die many times.  No, I am saying this because she really did not have to die.  We, the readers, already knew that Tris was willing to be a martyr.  She tried to do so before and was unable to.  We were aware of her savior complex.  She could have shown her complete selflessness in a hundred other ways that I can think of rather than dying for her brother who, by the way, could have been given his redemption.  Ultimately I think the more selfless thing she could have done was to have allowed Caleb his redemption.<br /><br />As I've said I will read more from this author, but right now I think she's just too naive to pull something like this off properly.  I love the potential she shows and she's a wonderful story teller.  I think when she was self-published she did a much better job of telling a story.  I wish she would have just stuck with that, to be honest.  I think she's an intelligent young woman with a lot of talent and I do hope that we all get to explore her true potential someday.  Unfortunately, that is not going to be today.

A message appeared and said  &#34;it would not play in my REGION&#34;  I could not believe Amazon would allow to sell this product on their website  to sell to US consumers a product that you cannot even use.  This product came from United Kingdom and does not work in the U.S. I requested a refund for $17.00 and they told me to return it for a full refund. It costs me $12.00 for shipping.

B00005KC4W|5.0|So I ordered this with very little confidence after reading many disappointed customers with most of the complaints coming from. The 2 disc half speed mastered version. This arrived shipped from Amazon.Co.uk and was in excellent condition, almost pristine with one small scuff and a nice sleeve that I will reuse. Now on to the sound because everyone knows this is one of the most classic metal albums of all time, still third next to Kill Em All and Ride The Lightning, but incredible none the less. This sounds fantastic barely ANY surface noise whatsoever and the sound blasts through the speakers crisp, clear and the BEST I have ever heard it. I felt compelled to write this review immediately, that is how good it is. Possibly others have legitimate complaints or I got lucky but I think this kicks some serious tail!!!

B008RZF1UO|5.0|If you are a follower of Kamelot, then you know this is the first album with Tommy Karevic on lead vocals.  After the departure of the highly lauded Roy Khan during the supporting tour of their previous album, Karevic provided vocals during the European leg of the Poetry for the Poisoned tour.  I have been a avid and rabid fan of his first band, Seventh Wonder, ever since.  He had ten league boots to fill in replacing the masterful singing of Khan, but Tommy pulled it of, and  now reigns as front man (and heart throb) of Kamelot with his own charm and grace. Silverthorn is an excellent rebirth of one of the best power and symphonic metal bands around.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Please note date of my review. I am using a Fire HD (previous gen) 16Gb.<br />As of this date the criticisms of the Kindle edition collection (mostly from a year and a half ago) have been corrected. X Ray works perfectly, covers of each individual book can be viewed, The maps can be enlarged by double tapping or expanding the distance of your fingers while touching the screen. and the TOC works perfectly for both individual books and chapters within the books using the GO TO function.I'm not sure when others purchased the collection mentioning the &#34;high&#34; cost but the current price is great and is cheaper than buying separately (either Kindle edition, or paperbacks) I too was introduced to G.O.T. through the HBO series. These books are better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and have enjoyed all of its episodes. Season 3 was by far the most intriguing, sad, traumatic, uplifting of all. So much happens and in it all the theme of tragedy and redemption. I laughed, I cried and enjoyed every minute of it.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Very funny. If you tend not to get British humor this may still like this.They have made an American adaptation which I have not seen.  My husband doesn't tend to like the British things I watch but he did find this hilarious. This movie starts out fairly comical and it just builds with every scene until you are laughing nonstop.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|A captivating book that is not too heavy on the legalese. Somewhat predictable, however, the characters are interesting as is the historical setting.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|This review contains hints at SPOILERS, but not direct spoilers–I can only advise that you read at your own risk . . .<br /><br />If I seem to not make as much sense as I normally do, know that I have just within the past ten minutes set this book down, and I’m still going through a little shock/trauma/grief over it. I feel this book, this ending so deep within me that I don’t know if I’ll be able to properly separate myself from it to type clearly, so please bear with me.<br /><br />Now, let me start off my own thoughts by telling you that I know it has raised some rather harsh reviews from readers, and I understand why in only one aspect–that the ending is not what anyone wanted. But I think that was part of the point that was being made. Life isn’t fair, and people have to die. When I read a book and ultimately suffer the loss of a character–a person within the story that I am close to, a person I identify with and spend the entire series growing alongside, a friend–that has a tendency to invoke a complete and utter devastation to my psyche. So yeah, the series didn’t end how I wanted it to because I would NEVER actually want to lose that friend. But you know what? It made sense. It really did, which is why I can accept it–as slowly and painstakingly as my heart feels like it’s been ripped out and boiled in acid, I can accept it.<br /><br />There were times when reading through the story I was getting so frustrated–at Tris, at Tobias, at EVERYONE–I was sighing and groaning and nearly pulling my hair out, pausing to cover my eyes like I couldn’t believe what was happening. But there were those times when I was so happy for Tris & Tobias, so excited for the next piece of the plot to come and then BAM! The next moment I’d be reeling from death and action. So much feels in this one book that left me analyzing myself, and how I would feel and how I would react, and who/what is right or wrong? What would I do? A true roller coaster of emotion that I will return to read again and again. And that’s part of what I like to judge a book on–the ability the story has to make that connection with me on more than just a reader-story level. When there’s no disconnect, when there’s a bond that ties me personally to the lives within the book and I genuinely feel attached to the characters, I know the story is worth it–to me, at least.<br /><br />I really do realize that there are a lot of people who are upset with this book out there, and I’m not just here to pledge my blind allegiance (see what I did there?) to this series because of the books that came before–I truly love this story and was so wrapped up in it that I felt akin to what the characters themselves were feeling. I know that in my personal experience, every book I have ever read that has tied me irrevocably to its story forever has been one that has lost integral characters in the ultimate struggle, in the end. It keeps me feeling human, because it’s rare that everything you want will work out perfectly, tied up like a pretty package with a little red bow on it.<br /><br />Sorry if this review seemed a bit preachy–remember when I warned you at the start about my working to process what happened? It may all still be . . . processing. But I firmly and without any regret–having used about fifteen Kleenex to wipe up all my tears–give Allegiant one of the most deserving 5/5 stars I’ve yet to commit ;)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a wonderful twist of Bejeweled. The concept is very similar but the developers managed to add different elements so although the game may be repetitive in concept; yet it provide different challenges. Highly recommended.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|An amazing and addictive game and way to pass time! The only problem with it for me is that it seems too EASY, I wish that as you go along the game would become harder and harder but it just didn't. It's still a FANTASTIC game but a bit simple at times.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My favorite book of all time.  I am revisiting the Ender Quintet 30 years after I fell in love with the story, and still love Orson Scott Card as a remarkable storyteller.<br /><br />This is such an accessible story for all ages, but particularly good for middle school kids and a great way to introduce them to science fiction.<br /><br />You can't help but relate to Ender, and wonder at the imaginative world that Orson Scot Card built thirty years ago that is still so appropriate today.<br /><br />Although I have aged, the story has not.  A &#34;must read&#34; quintet that should go on any &#34;must read&#34; list of books.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Is pretty cool, because it lets you know how much time is left on your battery. Plus it also shows you battery usage.

B00F031WKE|2.0|Another Hendrix release on poor quality vinyl, side 1 would not play. On closer inspection I notice a small scratch in the record. I returned the album and Amazon replaced it with a second copy, it also skips! After looking closer the record appears to have dimples. This is not the first Hendrix release I have purchased that was defective, I just wish the company that press's the vinyl would take a little more pride in their work. As for the music it is a great concert, maybe a 200 gram pressing was overkill for a concert from 1968. It's worth the price for a nice stereo recording from Hendrix in the era.

B00F1W1S1M|4.0|Live at Luna park includes the Blu-ray, 2 DVDs and 3 CDs in one release with the CDs only available in this deluxe edition.<br /><br />This live concert is a 160 minute main show -- with bonus material.

Bonus features include a documentary, the trailer for the cinema release of the film, a &#34;behind-the-scenes&#34; feature and the cartoon intro that ran on big screens prior to the band taking to the stage in Buenos Aires. The Blu-ray additionally features six multi-angle options on &#34;Outcry&#34;.<br /><br />I will qualify my review by saying I am a big fan of the band and have been since Images and Words. Since then I have managed to get every release that has come out and even hunted down their first album prior to Labrie and even their Majesty stuff.<br /><br />DT is one of the few bands that I have seen in concert that sound as good live if not better than their albums. They always bring a musical majesty to their concerts that leave you blown away and always add something new to their music when they play live. So anytime they put out a live DVD/CD, it is always worthwhile to get this and enjoy what they do when they transform their songs to live versions.<br /><br />Live at Luna Park does a great job at bringing the concert to you on DVD and CD. For those that haven't had an opportunity to see them live, then this is the next best thing as this gives you a great selection of their music and shows off the musical prowess of each band member. For full effect, watch the DVD in full surround sound and you will almost feel like you are there live. Is this my favorite live album from DT, no, my favorite as far as live albums is probably &#34;Score&#34; or &#34;Budokan&#34; but this is a good live package and worth watching. DT fans like me will definitely enjoy the Blu Ray presentation.atch the DVD in full surround sound and you will almost feel like you are there live.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game has so much potential, but the sad truth is, you can't get past the first little video - the servers are always unavailable. I've tried installing and uninstalling multiple times, but much to the disappointment of my preschooler, I can NEVER get past the first little video. If they fix this issue (which, I found out online, has been going on for at least 5 months), the game will likely be very fun. The opening scene is definitely engaging...
076115678X|4.0|I had no clue how to maintain and style my curly hair. I have type 2a curly and it's always been so frizzy! I've been pulling it back for years now because I just didn't like the way it looked. After reading the book, I found out that I've been using the wrong type of shampoo/conditioner/styling products. I went and purchased sulfate/silicone/paraben free products and HOLY COW. I did not realize my hair could look like this. I even used her tips on cutting your own hair and I was surprised at how easy it was. No wonder I always cringe whenever I go to a salon to have my hair cut. They always cut my hair like straight hair and one time I ended up with a mullet that had me in tears. Now I can wear my hair curly and not be embarrassed about it. Yay! :)<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars because of the \\"Curl Confessions\\". They eventually got boring to read and seemed like the same stories over and over. Other than that, the book has already helped me tremendously.

B009APMNB0|4.0|I purchased this product to color calibrate my system which dual boots OSX Mavericks and Windows 7 x64.  My system has three Viewsonic VG2427WM LCD monitors, which try as I may manually, I could not get close enough to perfect color calibration myself, so i ordered this product as it touts Windows/OSX along with multiple monitor support.<br /><br />First off - OSX Mavericks.  Installation, program use extremely easy.  When it's done, it creates a color profile automatically based on your display name.  My display is a VG2427WM, so it made VG2427WM_D65.icc.  Great, it did calibrate that display.  But when you go and calibrate a second or third monitor, because it's the same monitor and name, it creates the same named .icc file, which overwrites the ones you previously made.  This is a simple software problem that X-Rite needs to fix.  All it has to do is at the end of the profiling, ask you for a profile name or check for profile overwriting and give you a chance to name is something different.  You have to jump through some hoops to make it all work.  Profile the first display, rename the profile to something else, like VG2427WM_Center.icc (or left/right, etc.) and then use the Applescript Editor to rename the profile's metadata.  Once you do all of this for each display, everything works as advertised.<br /><br />Next is Windows 7 64-bit.  The only reason I boot into Windows at all is to play games, and obviously with multiple displays I want to play games across all three displays if the games allow it.  The problem is Nvidia and their Nvidia Surround feature treats the three displays as one, and there is no way to color calibrate them separately.  I've contacted manufacturers, I'm being told I'm SOL if I want to use both Nvidia Surround and color profile separate displays at the same time.  Un-frikkin-believable!  Sure, if you run the monitors in Windows in extended mode, you can color calibrate them, but what good is that if I can't game with the profile's attached?  Major problem.  Now this isn't X-Rite's fault or really even Microsoft's fault, it rests squarely on Nvidia with their hardware/software implementation.  So in Windows with Nvidia Surround, they are close enough, nothing I can do about it anyway.<br /><br />So, did the product fix all of my issues, no.  But based on my needs with Nvidia Surround, nothing else will either.  Don't buy this or any other color calibrator if you plan on running Nvidia Surround - period.  In OSX, after jumping through the hoops based on X-Rite's file naming problem, the product does work, and they displays look exactly the same.  One thing this model doesn't have that some of the more expensive ones do is monitor brightness calibration.  This is an easy fix - use a digital camera, spot meter or some sort of light meter app on your smartphone to read the light level coming off of each monitor, and adjust the brightness on your monitor's menu until they all match.  I do like that X-Rite doesn't limit you in any way on how many system's/displays you can use it on, unlike the low-end Spyder products.hed?  Major problem.

B00DHHWXYY|4.0|The DVD gets an extra star because there is an entire extra DVD of extras! The stuff on there is all pretty good but you also realize how much Baz Luhrmann has lost the plot when you hear him talk about the movie. Basically, the guy is in dire need of someone (such as a good editor) to reign him in. The background on how he melded modern music with the music of the Jazz Age is interesting until you realize here's a guy from Australia (where bands he should know being about the right age to have come of musical age post-New Wave such as the Hoodoo Gurus, Crystal Set, Celibate Rifles, Porcelain Bus came from) has far too lamestream tastes as beyond The XX, the stuff he thinks is cutting edge is basically for the hipster college radio crew at best and the Jay-Z types at worst.<br /><br />That out of the way, I almost fast-forwarded the entire movie as it fell into two big traps--voiceover narration (the lazy person's way to tell a story onscreen) and had Tobey Maguire on far too long before Leonardo DiCaprio showed up and the thing finally came to life. (In the extras, check out the PBS doc and the still of F. Scott Fitzgerald in side portrait and Tobey looks like a dead ringer from the side).<br /><br />The colors in this movie are an assault on the eyes and only after reading it was released in 3-D did I figure out why all the fast zooms across bays or down roads were going on. Now it makes sense--it was for 3-D effect.<br /><br />Then in the extras you learn it was all pretty much shot on green screen. It does shows in a very odd unnatural setting especially to the party scenes in the Gatsby mansion. Everything just looks that much off.<br /><br />Then the B-team has been rolled out in the bit parts. We get a B-list Michelle Williams in Carey Mulligan, an B version of Amy Adams in Isla Fisher and a younger Kristin Scott Thomas B version in Elizabeth Debicki. Have a look on imdb at their pics. I swear they are all doppelgangers for those A-list actresses. OK, Debicki is a bit of a stretch but go with me on that.<br /><br />It's an entertaining movie but once the car accident happens I grew incredibly bored and started fast-forwarding as it just seemed to lose any momentum. Look, The Great Gatsby has been done to death onscreen and off-, did we really need another version? Plus Baz Luhrmann? Seriously? He is a musical dance guy. Last I looked The Great Gatsby is a novel not a musical play (yes, Broadway has had its claws in it as such and well, sorry, not a fan of the stage or musicals in any form).<br /><br />Honestly, I'd like to challenge Baz to do a movie involving no music or dance. Let's see him show off his directing chops because he falls back on this way too much.<br /><br />Having said all this and stated that it is entertaining for much of it, I will say that without DiCaprio this thing would have been a farce. He's the only thing in it worth watching. So hats off to The Aviator.is a bit of a stretch but go with me on that.<br /><br />It's an entertaining movie but once the car accident happens I grew incredibly bored and started fast-forwarding as it just seemed to lose any momentum.

B005LAIIMG|5.0|The best zombie movie that I have ever seen.  Excellent cast and special effects.  The story line is as original as you can get.  GREAT JOB to writer, cast, directors and all others involved
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|This is a very good bond movie even when comparing with those from Connery's golden age production.  It has a story line relevant to today's world and it also presents a not-so-invincible bond character.  In doing so it really re-invents James Bond.  However without going into details of the film, the ending is too long.  The final fight scene in Skyfall could have been shortened by 15 minutes easily without losing any important details.  Unfortunately it becomes too self-important at the end, hence I cannot say this is the the best bond movie ever but it is close.  Casino Royale and Goldfinger are still among the best Bond films ever made.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|AWESOME EFFECTS and story line.  This is absolutely the best Star Trek ever.  Definitely worth watching over and over again.

B008S80OU2|5.0|Great job on the re-masters, the live stuff, and the extra never before rarities are great.  But the great part is the 4 concerts that can be downloaded with the internet keys they give you.  What a great value this is.  I have most of the BOC cd's in my collection, but still had to have this great collection.  For the hard core BOC fan it is true gold, and for anyone else into classic rock and great guitar playing, this is a must have.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Could not be more proud and thankful to the men of easy company for their selflessness and heroics in the greatest war ever fought. What an amazing read and I cannot wait to watch band of brothers to bring it all together!
1935251740|1.0|Robert Lanza is a Darwinist in Consciousness clothing. He has hijacked quantum physics to explain away spirituality. Since quantum physics opened up a new world where consciousness played a role, Darwinist's had to regroup to battle against the new data. People like Richard Dawkins and Robert Lanza still feel there is still nothing beyond our experience, even if we learn that the observer plays a role in it. What Mr Lanza avoids, as he did in his interview with Deepak Chopra, is where does consciousness come from. Mr Lanza states from the interview ' Yea well we were actually evolved as monkeys in the forest trees that collect fruit and berries. We were never really designed to understand the universe.' He still pushes the Darwin mantra at the same time hijacking quantum physics. The fact is experiments that proved matter is affected by the observer Darwinist's have avoided for a long time. Only now they've decided they have to get on board to start a new spin to prevent people from opening up their own consciousness and spirituality and convince you SCIENCE has all the answers.
B00CH3DBNQ|3.0|I always poo-poo the odd man out on book reviews... and I'm hardly ever one of them.  This time I do not concur with the masses.  I don't know what kind of book I was expecting, but it was like reading a term paper about the history of the region's woes, coupled with her extended family's history, that I had a hard time keeping straight.  So many people gave it rave reviews that I forced myself to read it to the half-way point....  but I just couldn't continue.<br /><br />I've read a number of books relating to the region and I am over the shock of how women were/are treated in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Maybe this book opens people's eyes to this for the first time and accounts for the high ratings.  For me, I suppose I was expecting to learn more about Malala instead of everything and everybody else.  Disappointed.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|Even though I'm a Green Lantern fan from the silver age of comics, I sat and listened to all of the negative reviews and stayed far away from this movie during it's original theatrical release!<br /><br />Still, since a used copy of this  movie was like 2 bucks now, I was curious to see just how really \\"awful\\" it was....Going into this movie beforehand and realizing that no movie adaptation of any iconic comic book series is ever truly 100% perfect, imagine my shocking surprise as I laughed and cheered and had a great time watching a \\"Hollywood\\" 2011 \\"updated\\" take on the classic silver-age version of Green Lantern.<br /><br />Sure, of course, there were a few things in the movie that sort of bothered me as I watched: like Carol Ferris being an ace fighter pilot that's good enough to be Hal Jordan's wing-man.(In the comics, Carol Ferris only ran her father's airplane manufacturing company and didn't fly planes at all.) Also puzzling was that if one Oan Guardian became totally corrupted by the power of \\"yellow fear\\" power source and became cosmically evil, now the other remaining Guardians of Oa are going to make yellow rings based off the same corruptible yellow power source for it's Lantern Corps to fight the renegade Guardian with? Yeah, I know, a total recipe for disaster on a super cosmic scale. Also, if Abin Sur, Hal Jordan's legendary predecessor,  defeated Parallax all by himself, shouldn't the intimate details of that case be within the Green Lantern Corps records on the planet Oa and shouldn't it therefore be common knowledge throughout the entire Green Lantern Corps?.....Yeah, whoever wrote the script for this movie failed to cover some serious ground on this one.<br /><br />Plus,like the other comic book fans of Green Lantern, I also really wanted to see the film focus more about Hal Jordan being right here on earth as Green Lantern fighting some terrorists, or maybe saving a crumbling freeway bridge during rush hour traffic, or preventing some defenseless towns from being swept away from a bursting hydro-dam's billions gallons of raging water.<br /><br />However, Green Lantern: the movie, does do a lot right, though...Like Ryan Reynolds giving  a charming and very entertaining take on Hal Jordan. The actor playing Sinestro is dead on in his performance and a perfect casting choice for the part! Also, the actress playing Carol Ferris was smoking hot! Her and Ryan Reynolds looked very good on screen together and some real smoldering chemistry! The special effects were cool,too.<br /><br />While I do wish that the final fight between Green Lantern and the fear-based monster, Parallax , while they were both still on earth, would've been way longer and a bit more epic in scale. Yet, again, what's here is still very cool.I got a really big kick out of watching Green Lantern defiantly saying his legendary Green Lantern oath while Parallax had G.L. on the ground and was talking all kinds of crazy smack about devouring the earth like a small $1 apple. ..LOL..<br /><br />Man, I've watched Green Lantern over and over again and it brings a big smile to this DC comics fan's heart.<br /><br />Trust me, after sitting in the movie theaters and wasting 20 bucks on a truly horrible IRON MAN 3 movie, having a soft spot in my fan-boy heart for this Green Lantern movie for just 2 bucks is an absolute  bargain.<br /><br />Plus, I'm really hoping that DC comics and Warner Brothers studios totally  ignores all of the haters and plans on making another cool Green Lantern movie with Ryan Reynolds very soon!...If so, I'm so on board!
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|ok, I'm not the best reviewer on here, by far. I usually only review albums I really like. I didn't go out and buy this album right away. I waited about 9 months after it's release. Now that I have it I really like it. It wasn't until I heard the song Not Running Anymore, that is only on the extended version that I began to see how good Jon's songwriting is becoming. The first three songs are really poppy and catchy Because We Can is ok.. and the rest of the album begins to bore me. This is way better than the Circle album that I actually hated except for  maybe two songs. But if you put those songs and this album together you have a great sounding cd. Well that's all I have for now. Merry Christmas folks.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Enjoy game not just this one but several other games by you guys...wish I had more time to spend playing. But every chance I get I play

1451627297|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  Tried to start by reading 30 minutes a night.  Did that for 2 nights, then proceeded to read 4 hours the next night, and 6 hours the next finishing the book.<br /><br />One of the more engaging books that I've read of his as of late.  Very good character development, and good pacing.  I must confess I was not pleased with the way parts went, but just because I was hoping it would be different!<br /><br />After reflection though, I think it was just the way it should be.  Highly recommended.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|A reminder of when I was young and read this story.  A true to life story.  Family life and tests and trials.

B0045EJY90|5.0|This is the first CD player with a iPod interface. I now have more music on my iPod than I do CD's. So this works great for me.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|For me this was the greatest part of the story.  Faced with great evil both as a German and as a soldier, the honor in these men shone all the more brightly.  Luetzow, the once charismatic man who turned \\"Ice Man\\" once he understood the great evil he was faced with, especially stole my heart.  Galland was larger than life.  Franz, was a great man who lived true to his beliefs and was very much his own person.  For me, these Germans were even greater heroes than the Americans as it took them so much more to stand a moral ground throughout the war; they had to withstand belittling from their superiors (Goering called them \\"cowards\\") as they flew 3,4, 5 missions everyday, and were despised by their own countrymen after the war.  The story between Charlie and Franz was touching, but by all means humane encounters between Allies and Germans weren't that rare even as described in this book.

B00335EQ0E|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a child.  As an adult it has a special place in my heart.  Which is why I got this for my movie collection.  It's entertaining to watch even as an adult and the special features were interesting too.  This movie has to been seen at least once!  For first time viewing, would suggest renting it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great Device, useful for more things than you could possibly realise. Students especially its great for group projects when you need to get something on the big screen.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Deeply engrossing read. Loved it. Extremely thought-provoking for a YA novel. Both leads - especially Augustus Waters - were excellently written. I hope that the movie does justice to the awesomeness that is the book.
B00EKQ3YZI|5.0|Before I read anyone's reviews or even editorial review or product review, let me just say, after first seeing poster in famous West Hollywood gay club recently that existed in the late 70s, I was excited about remixes. I know after my experience enjoying Patrick Cowley's mega extension of I Feel Love, there was alot of creative openness to her beloved material. I actually imagined this set of remixes to sound basically how it sounds although there are a few surprises like Sunset People done to a slower strength.<br />All in all, I am pleased with the collection, and I think Donna would be flabbergasted if she weren't the muse for this already.
B0049985XW|5.0|THIS WAS PROBABLY BOGART'S BEST, A SEAMY , DOWN AND OUT LOOK AT LIFE AND HOW IT CAN CHANGE A MAN TO COME UPON SUDDEN WEALTH . THE END OF HIS IDEALS  , MORALS, AND HUMANITY .

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very challenging as you move up the trail. Would be better if it was free to continue unlimited play.<br />The wait time is annoying and it could become costly to continue play overtime.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This games represents a shark in life and is a very popular game and has a lot of missions and details to it there is so much things I could talk about for it, I highly very suggest getting this game SO ADDICTING!

A classic in every sense of the word.<br />For me, the &#34;Halloween Season&#34; isn't complete without watching Halloween at least once.<br />Somehow I misplaced my copy so had to order a replacement immediately. It got here in time  : = )

B006M4F67A|3.0|I like this game! The graphics are superb and the sounds are so cute, but can be turned off if you like. You have many choices of configurations and levels of play. You can pause and start over.

B00BRUQ3PS|2.0|Clearly, I'm in a small minority here, but I was utterly disappointed by MaddAddam. It's not only a limp conclusion to the trilogy; it's a sequel that is so badly conceived--so slipshod in its plotting, such a betrayal of the characterization of the first two works, and so much a boring retread of themes more cleverly presented the first two times around--that it actually diminishes the achievement of the earlier novels. It may, in fact, be the worst follow-up to a successful novel that I've ever read. If Oryx & Crake is Star Wars, then this novel is The Phantom Menace.<br /><br />*SPOILERS ALERT*<br /><br />There's simply no way to talk about the novel's failures without referring to specific plot points, so read no further if you intend to read MaddAddam but haven't read it yet.<br /><br />The first problem is, having contrived to have Snowman and the Crakers meet up with the survivors of the MaddAddam / God's Gardener's group at the end of both of the previous novels, Atwood was, very clearly, at a total loss as to what to do with them next, how to move the story forward. Therefore, the \\"forward\\" plot movement of the novel only starts in earnest after p. 261, when it is (very implausibly) revealed that the Crakers (the genetically-modified humans) can communicate with the pigoons (the genetically-modified pigs) and the latter want the the normal Homo Sapiens's help with killing the two \\"painballers\\" captured at the end of Year of the Flood, but who were allowed to escape at the very beginning of this novel (another feeble implausibility). This, despite the fact that the MaddAddamites themselves have also been killing and eating the pigoons all along. So, the remaining humans, relying on the pigoons' sense of smell and a Craker translator, track the two killers down, but not before Snowman and Adam One are allowed to die comically melodramatic, self-sacrificing deaths, worthy of the most sentimentally piffling of Dickens's endings.<br /><br />Atwood does understand that this wee episode--\\"bad guys escape; good guys hang around doing nothing in particular for several months; good guys track down bad guys\\"--isn't nearly enough of a plot to construct an entire novel around. So, most of the novel has nothing to do with that. Instead, it's backstory--yet more backstory, in a series of novels that has already consisted largely of flashbacks--this time about the previously peripheral character of Zeb.<br /><br />Alas, this new backstory must rank as some of the very worst writing Atwood has ever done. It is completely haphazard, un-thought-out, driveling, and trivial. It reads, for all the world, like a very bad parody of Thomas Pynchon. Zeb steals millions of dollars from his father, a corrupt fraud of a fundamentalist preacher, and goes on the lam, spending hundreds of pages flitting from one nonsensical disguise to another: a pilot for an environmental group aiding polar bears, a burger flipper, a professional hacker, a magician's assistant, a toilet cleaner, a bouncer, a gardener, a data-entry drone...and probably others I'm forgetting. Not a single one of these incarnations is well-developed...or even lasts long enough long enough for me to begin to be interested in the new environment where Atwood has randomly inserted Zeb, always for only a single chapter, with no rhyme or reason. Whether working the most menial of jobs or more middle-class covers there's *never* actually a compelling reason for Zeb to be where he finds himself, especially since he supposedly has millions in the bank. It's all a chaotic, vapid shaggy dog story with no punchline at the end, told largely in annoyingly ersatz Raymond Chandler-eque \\"tough guy\\" speak.<br /><br />Worse than the unnecessariness of Zeb's story, though, is the sheer sloppiness of its plotting. At one point, for instance, Zeb is assigned the important task of smuggling some dangerous new bio-engineered pills out of the HelthWyzer West compound where he has been working. The description of this goes on for pages and pages: the precautions Zeb takes when leaving the compound; the precautions taken hiding them at his new place of employ; how careful they are not to reveal the hiding place. Then, on a whim, he uses half of the pills in an act of revenge, and mayhem ensues. Following this, the person who asked him to smuggle the pills in the first place, Pilar, decides it might just be a good idea to find out what's actually in them. But then that plan to analyze the pills is casually abandoned, and the mysterious pills are simply retained by Pilar. And then, equally casually, after some years, they are sent to the young Crake as a legacy after Pilar's demise. And then Crake (it is presumed) uses them as the basis for his own BlyssPlus pills that destroy humanity.<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />What a muddle. All these cloak-and-dagger peregrinations and machinations...but then Crake gets the keys to destroying humanity almost as an afterthought? Or did the saintly Pilar of YOTF actually intend that he use them in precisely that way? Atwood's intentions here are entirely opaque. It's especially frustrating, as the long-hinted-at connection between the God's Gardeners and Crake otherwise never comes to full fruition. Likewise, Zeb and Adam have to live in hiding for years and years, but then end up living together openly in the same community using their real names? It hardly makes any sense.<br /><br />In all, MaddAddam reads like a first draft that nobody dared question or revise--an improvisation in which loose ends, instead of being tied up, are multiplied exponentially.<br /><br />Also, as a scant handful of insightful reviewers here have pointed out, the characters of Toby, Ren, Amanda, and Snowman (irritatingly referred to here mostly as \\"Snowman-the-Jimmy\\") bear only a passing resemblance to the major characters of the same name in the earlier novels. Tough, self-reliant Toby of YOTF has become a simpering and pathetically insecure helpmate to Zeb--forever girlishly worried that he's eyeing one of the younger surviving women. Ren is a virtual non-entity, relegated to one or two unmemorable lines every 50 pages or so. And Snowman spends most of the book in a coma...and when he finally wakes up, he's without a scintilla of the self-awareness or irony that animated the narrative voice of Oryx & Crake. The \\"continuity\\" failure in relation to the previous novels is almost complete. And the brief reappearance of Adam as a hostage at the end of novel proves to be pointless as well as being utterly beyond belief.<br /><br />Being Atwood, the novel is, of course, not 100% bad. There's a good deal of wit in Toby's attempts to render Zeb's stories about his life into a form the innocent Crakers can comprehend and use as the basis for a newly-minted bible / creation myth of their own. And some of the details about day-to-day life in a post-Apocalyptic world are cleverly worked out.<br /><br />On the whole, however, this is a very sorry misstep from an author I've previously admired very much. I rather wish I hadn't read it and had spared myself this saccharine and third-rate chaser to the enjoyable Oryx & Crake and Year of the Flood.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I really liked this book. I thought that it was cool how it ended. I am now reading the last book in the series.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This is a concept that at first blush appears almost impossible to be able to do without being repetitive or boring. The author manages to walk this obstacle course brilliantly through the journal of the amnesiac main character, Christine.<br /><br />The reader senses right from the get-go that something is &#34;off&#34; in Christine's life, and it becomes instantly clear how manipulated she could be if she weren't able  to remember anything a day after it happened.  She wakes each morning beside a man she doesn't know who appears to be her husband, and has regular secret visits with her doctor, but how did she get like this and where is she headed and....who ARE these people, really?<br /><br />It isn't quite clear what is &#34;off&#34; or who is &#34;real&#34; in Christine's forgetful world, although there are strong undertones of unplaced feelings of &#34;wrongness&#34; in the story. As the story unfolds, we begin to get pulled hard into the unraveling of Christine's world piece by piece as she learns about what is happening through her own writings from previous days in a private journal.<br /><br />The story has a powerful, unforgettable climax with its surprising ending. The last 20% or so of the book elevated to 5 stars as I gasped while waiting to hear what was going to happen next.<br /><br />A brilliant concept, deftly managed by the author....with an ending that leaves the reader thinking....
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Who agrees that this game is awesome I mean you get to make your own viruse that killes the world
B0015AARJI|1.0|Hate to write a bad review but I bought two and one stopped working with less than 2 weeks of use.  The other physically broke down after 3 months of use.  I need to buy another!  Will have to chose another vendor or a non-Amazon source
B00E9ZATJO|3.0|I liked the croods better, if I have to si through an animated film, I want it to make me laugh, this did not, however, it might be good for 7-12 YO'S
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Love it! Maybe my favorite of all!<br />Not sure how he comes up with so many profiles for each book!
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|I'm not downing Paul and I am a longtime fan but his songs are starting to sound all the same. I hear strains that sound a lot like many of his tunes from Vanilla sky. Where are those new innovative songs from his Wings and Beatles days?
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It is the best book in the whole world because it teaches you anything in the whole world that you have always wanted to know. I hope you enjoy the same book as I did.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  Happy when I found out it was on Kindle fire.  I usually play candy crush on my phone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers Halloween is really cool!It has all the same things in it bit ITT os Halloween theme
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really thought it would be just another mystery novel, but the way the book gives away the secrets is just great. I really liked it
B009LDD1X0|4.0|Of course this was purchased for a huge BBT fan.  Heard that some of the &#34;Extras&#34; were lacking compared to earlier seasons.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|This is simply the best television series you may ever see.  Superb acting (Ian Richardson is incredible), marvelous casting, great directing, and first-class writing make these films unforgettable.  Still I have two caveats.  The sex scenes in the third series are wholly unnecessary and degrade the final product.  Above all, the script is politically correct.  Conservatives are monsters, their opponents saints.  Good guys and bad guys.  Still, this is a series you won't want to miss.  The remastering in Blu-ray is of the highest quality.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I don't think this season was as good as the first one but it was still ok. The paranormal aspect of Season 1 is missing in Asylum but the real life situations can be more horrifying because they are being committed by real living people.
B007JZGIMS|1.0|Can't get you money back from Amazon. Junk. Do not buy. waste of money. I wanted it for the right left balance which does not work.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|If you hesitate to read the book because you've seen the movie Blade Runner don't worry because, apart from some of the characters there is very little resemblance between the movie and the book. Normally if I've read the book I won't bother with the movie (been disgusted or disappointed too many times). This is a case where the opposite occurred; I saw the movie Blade Runner years ago. I was not disappointed in the book. While the book and movie have the same overall plot the book is a much more focused on what constitutes life.
B0044WQHYI|4.0|This one has actually gotten better with age.  More explicit violence than John Carpenter's Halloween (which IMHO could have been rated PG in 1978 if not for P.J. Soles' nudity), to be sure, but also more intriguing because of the back story and some excellent performances by Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie before i read this book. I must say it's a very good read. Very pleased and can't wait to read more.
B00COCY67A|5.0|Amazing collection of music from the King.  What a great voice and great feel when these recordings were made at STAX.  Highly recommend to any music fan.  The only downfall of this album is the awful album cover.  It looks like the King has been enveloped by some awful insect.  Whoever designed this album art should find another line of work.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does what it's supposed to. Wish it had more alarm sounds. I like that you can have more than.two alarms.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The only issue with this headset is that it loses connection when the base is plugged into the PC. unplug the base and plug the little &#34;thumb drive&#34; into your computer. I did that and i haven't had any disconnections at all. All programs are up to date. You can use your micro charger for your phone to charger quicker. Great headset!
B00915G6MG|5.0|I AM A LONGTIME FAN OF THIS SERIES.  I CONTINUE TO ENJOY THE STORIES AND THE INTERACTION OF THE CHARACTERS OF NCIS.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Told in clear and very readable words, this is a fascinating story of a doctor's near death experience. Because it's told by a scientist, it is self validating. Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Need to update app. Kindle version only goes up to level 440. I am on level 438. I hate to play on my phone.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I enjoyed the other one and I bought this one before I finished the first one..I like the story and the different ways to play in the game..they both have hidden objects and spot the difference and mixed words that need to be put in order.great game and worth the price.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun. I am playing this game way to much and to long . Totally addictive.
006202406X|1.0|I'm suprised that this book was written by the same person who wrote Divergent and Insurgent. This book had so many plots and climax's I was confused half the when I was reading. Roth had a lot of opportunities to make something happen in this book , and she just took every idea she had and crammed them all into 500 pages of boring dialogue. She also introduced way too many characters and never bothered to develop any of them. If you loved Divergent and Insurgent just pretend that this book never happened.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Love this movie was such a good story have to live weird awkward kids makes me want to be in high school again
B003LQMZS0|5.0|Kiddo loves it (6 mo old), well made. I think she will enjoy it for months more. Great to use in the car.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy playing the Candy Crush Saga Game!  I am still learning as there are so many features facets to the game.  It is fast pace and really makes you look and think!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing and you should click the free button! You can do all kinds of tricks on train/subway and get surf boards! It is not like anyother game!!!!!
B008MM9630|4.0|Cool game. I like it, is very entertaining and different.  My daughter likes it also.Hours of fun<br />The only thing about it is I think you have to have Facebook to play with others.  If there is another way to play with friends I haven't found it yet but a good game
B0042GIRYE|5.0|I have all his cd's.  They are all great.<br /> I really dont categorize the band. Major musical talent and vocals.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was awesome! Beautiful graphics and awesome puzzles! Looking forward to number 2!! I hope it comes out soon!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Stays connected, and USB 3 - without power assist.  Lean, small and tidy, I need another one.  Is backward comatible for USB 2.0 but if that is all you have this an upgrade for the future.  I've tried others even with power that didn't work as well.  This is USB 3.0 so don't think it's just an overpriced USB 2.0 hub.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|This game is awesome it was worth spending $7.99 for kindle fire tablet than paying $59.00  for xbox360 and ps3
B004MC8CA2|4.0|very interactive and offers many versions of the bible, also very easy to switch between different versions without losing the chapter or verse
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, I MUST PLAY A FEW HOURS A DAY . I THINK THE GAME FLOWS Very WELL. VERY ADDICTIVE.
1401938906|4.0|Very good reading, however very few of the experiments worked for me.  I plan to reread it and keep trying.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|When i played asphalt 7 it worked and it was awesome and i knew that asphalt 8 would be even better but after i downloaded the extra data it didnt work. Help please<br />Give me some advice or help
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this very addictive, sometimes challenging, awesome matching game. Each level has a new and even more challenging puzzle. The only thing I don't like is that you only have 5 lives then have to wait for more or pay.
B004YAS9M8|5.0|This music is absolutely beautiful. The mix is relaxing and inspiring. You will want to see Ludovico live after you listened.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Fun, intellectual, and challenging. You can learn a little while playing. Something to teach kids with, etc. Fun to toy with.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Great album for dans of Elvis or Questlove. Good sound quality and great material. Not what you would imagine it is at all, much better.
B00008G7UF|5.0|Love this movie, great acting and lovely story of love lost and love found. You'll love it! Really you will!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great, a promising future, I look forward applications because I live in France and the store is not very rich
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great fun! I love all the power ups and what they can do for the minions!  Keeps me busy for hours!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very good, works like a charm! However, lack of apps made me give only 4 stars. Definitely needs more support from apps. General display sharing from mobile phone would be really useful.
B000I8HIR2|5.0|This movie was really good. It follows the video game pretty closely, and the way they did the CG made it feel very much like a video game world. A lot of the scary scenes were horrifying and at the same time artistic in a twisted way. The main character is maddeningly stupid, but despite that, the story has a crazy twist and a satisfying ending. Definitely a good movie to watch during Halloween time.
0525478183|5.0|The teenagers seem to really really like this author.........My grand daughter asked me to order this book so she could do a book report on it and she said it was Awesome.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|I good game.  It was a little easy and not very long, but visually it was very appealing.  I think the puzzles could be a more challenging.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Good movie for my oldest child (8) and loved ordering on my PC and watching on my tv. Very simple to do with Amazon.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|Does not seal all the way and my wipes dry out. The red slider does not slide very well either.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A simple and honest story of true heroism and the path a man took to find life's supreme truths!  The most remarkable story of WW II's air war you will ever read.  It's an essay on the absolute human waste that wars are.
0062255657|5.0|I've never read anything by Neil Gaiman before, but now I am hooked. Not only is the story itself wonderful and imaginative, but his *writing* is so, well, good! It's so rare to read a book that is so perfectly succinct and where the author makes a completely unreal idea become crystal clear, and in only a few words. I look forward to reading his other novels now.<br /><br />I haven't read the other reviews yet, but I'm curious to see whether others see this an allegory of the triune God. ;-)
1451666179|5.0|This book, just like the blog, was absolutely hilarious! It makes me love Allie Brosh even more than just reading her blog did. Definitely a recommended read!
B00G32OER4|3.0|I'm a horror movie fan, and this one isn't too bad.  It's creepy(ish) and the characters are likable.  The plot is just meh though.  The story had so much potential, but instead sideplots interrupt and never resolve.  There isn't enough to really chill your bones and the tension never really delivers.  Still fun though, give it a chance.
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|I enjoy repeat title sometimes. Many blu - ray discs do not allow that option.  Most standard dvds did allow &#34;repeat title&#34; option. Fortunatley this disc supports that function.
B00003CXBK|5.0|this was my first anime movie to wver watch and i will always love this movie. plus my daughter likes it too
B003YGSLDA|5.0|I enjoy repeat title sometimes. Many blu - ray discs do not allow that option even though most standard dvds do. I am happy this one does repeat so i can have it play over and over in the background while i do things.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Such a funny read! Kept me entertained from start to end, although at times I felt frustrated for the newly weds!
B00AEBB8PQ|3.0|I enjoy repeat title with some of my favorite films. Many blu-ray titles do not allow that option even though most standard dvds do. Please studios enable blu-ray to be as user friendly as the standard dvds. The film itself i think is great.
1934030554|5.0|I got a plenty information about powermeter and trainings. It requiers some base knowledge, because it goes really deep in training.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|We've been extremely blessed this year with having several bands put out amazing albums.  That said, none have been as unique, energetically and emotionally charged as Bastille's album.  I love that they put Pompeii as the first song because it sets the mood for the beauty and the unique nature of the rest of the album.  This music is electronic at points, percussive at other points, and full of unique notes and instrumental combinations--sometimes sounding almost tribal, and other times modern and new.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It's a great app and I use it all the time. But the ads are right in the middle of the video. I go to pause to look at something closer and then the ads are right there.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|User friendly and you can check on any location That you are traveling through very easily! It's pretty accurate too
B008FRFN7A|2.0|NOT IMPRESSED! I wanted to print a superman coloring page for my four year old and the app won't open.  Sorry son.
B008220BP2|5.0|We saw this opening weekend and I pre ordered as soon as I could. Extremely well adapted from the book- I read the book after enjoying the movie. Make sure to watch all the extras! Lots of fun insight as to how they decided to change things up.
B00CZ7OC46|1.0|Much as I enjoyed Rework I did not enjoy this. I found it just plain boring and uninteresting. Nothing new here
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I love this show! Been watching for years- all the things Dean and Sam go through are crazy! Fun balance of serious and silly.
B00EVW04PE|1.0|Let's not even bother to make comparisons between \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\" and \\"White House Down\\", even though their obviously similar story lines make it difficult to do so. \\"Olympus\\" was silly, but in a serious way. \\"White House Down\\" is just plain silly.<br /><br />So, turning our focus to \\"White House\\"...<br /><br />First, the so-called \\"security\\" shown in this film is laughably inaccurate. There are long stretches featuring bad mercenary guys (or rather, cardboard cutout bad mercenary guys - \\"BMGs\\" hereinafter)wandering, at will, through a deserted White House, chasing down the President and assorted cardboard cutout good guys. Not possible. If the White House crashes, and goes into lockdown, there is NO free access to discrete parts of the building. People, good or bad, cannot wander around at will. A further example involves the BMGs accessing the rooftop defensive measures command/control center: guess what? They just take a ride up to the roof in an elevator that contains no security measures - not even a Key Card reader. The fact that all this occurs when the building is in full lockdown simply takes the unbelievable and makes it laughable.<br /><br />And yet... other elevators in the building are fully modernized and electronic. The old clunker that gets taken to the rooftop, rattles and creaks, and threatens to give out under too much weight. I suspect that this old thing, perhaps a gift from Elisha Otis himself, would have been junked by Harry Truman when he tore the White House apart in 1948 - yet there it is, as a lame, predictable plot device. Ouch.<br /><br />The crew of BMGs that gets into the White House on the thinnest of pretexts, ostensibly to install equipment in the Residence, simply would not pass the obsessively thorough security checks, particularly since their real identities, once the crisis is underway, are easily obtained with a few strokes of a keyboard and some vaguely defined facial-recognition software. If they're that easily identified as questionable types, they wouldn't get past the street entrances. And... firearms inside the White House? Let's be charitable and call that detail \\"doubtful\\". Besides... the White House already has a private theater in the East Wing.<br /><br />OK, then. Let's just overlook those pesky details. Let's forget, for a moment, that \\"details\\" are where the devil sets up residence. If security were portrayed with any degree of accuracy, the lame plot would collapse from lack of credibility. Let's go ahead, then, and suspend disbelief for a moment: The plot elements used to justify the attack on the President and the White House are extremely thin, and never explained. There's some fuss about the son of the White House Secret Service AIC and an illness affecting the man's judgment. I hate to harp on this, but if the senior Secret Service Agent in the White House were diagnosed with terminal cancer, the President and senior staff would be aware of it before the man left his doctor's office. In the film, they're not. The evil things visited upon the son are referred to several times, but never clarified.<br /><br />One of the larger problems is the casting of Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer. He's simply not believable: he's not, for lack of a better word, \\"presidential\\". A scene where he chooses to wear a pair of high end kicks to get around the besieged residence is, bluntly, ridiculous. However, Foxx's casting is perhaps no more ludicrous than James Woods in the role of the angry, cancer-ridden Secret Service Chief. It's a shame to see an actor of Woods' calibre reduced to this kind of role. I think I preferred him in \\"My Name is Bill W.\\"... as awful as that was.<br /><br />And then, of course, there's Channing Tatum, the \\"hunk du jour\\" who appears to have been cast simply in order to have his name on the project. It certainly wasn't for his acting skills. Perhaps it helped with the financing. Of course, the impossible plot elements that lead to his being at the White House when the attack begins don't help. In fact, they strain credulity to the breaking point: right... a loose cannon Capitol Policeman, with a GED and a few college courses is called to the White House for an interview for a job on the President's Secret Service Security detail. That's exactly how they do it.<br /><br />I could go on for some time loading up on the film's idiotic omissions and inconsistencies... but why bother. This thing ain't worth the trouble, ain't worth the rental fee, ain't worth the energy required to operate the remote control to turn it off.<br /><br />This dog appears to have been written by a committee of screenwriters. Unfortunately, it also appears that they never talked to each other until the day they all had to sit down and hand in their assignments. The only consistency throughout is... the utter lack of consistency, coupled with non-existent believability. The simple fact that so many details rang false meant I was constantly saying to myself, \\"that couldn't happen...\\". Once that pattern develops, any chance of relaxing and enjoying the film as a vacant action thriller disappears.<br /><br />Maybe, if you're 14 years old and don't know any better, it might be a fun two hours. But guys, watch out. Even the bang bang shoot shoot stuff is pretty soft-core. There's hardly any blood, and definitely, no boobage.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Enjoyed it at the theater and now at home! The story was very well balanced. Now we can watch it anytime!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Awesome Movie. Can't wait for Thor , The Dark World to come out . Fantastic special effects and a pretty good storyline ....
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I wish it didn't cost so much to play....... lotz and lotz of fun to play! Very, very, very, very,  very,  very, very, very, very, very, addictive!!! Careful don't spend too much...... $0.99 addz up &amp; up &amp; up &amp; up  &amp; up &amp; up!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Been looking for this so glad it's on kindle.. I was just saying yo myself I wish they came out with another one.. gladly I found out they did.. about to buy the kingdom rush frontiers.. epicness!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|&lt;3 this game! It is so fantastically wonderful! I litterally play it all the time... no other game holds my interest quite like this one.
B005544V6A|3.0|I had heard so many good things about this highly rated show, but upon viewing I quickly concluded that the only thing new about it is the cast. Suits is a very clever mash-up of the legal drama genre, full of cliches and unabashedly absurd twists and turns that would derail any profit-making enterprise in the real world. The glass ceiling, &#34;right and wrong&#34;, and workplace dynamics get topical, not to say maudlin treatments (nothing near the Good Wife, which is actually intelligent, albeit dreary), and the emphasis is on caricature: I didn't find one character with real depth or mystery. Still, the show is very well put-together and will keep you entertained after a hard day's work at a real Law firm.<br />I do love the actual suits by the way, and the overly sexy dresses the power-hungry women flaunt ever so inappropriately at the office.<br />My guess for season four: Suits writers will be tempted to throw in a vampire, a werewolf, and a meth-cooking single mom gone psycho for new kicks. You could also stop watching Suits and focus on Castle which has the extraordinary merit of not taking itself seriously - ever.
B000006FL8|5.0|This was hard to find in VHS but my father in law enjoyed the original production. He enjoyed seeing this again with friends.  JJ
B000X2H8G4|5.0|Bought it for my Mom, but of course I had to try it out first. Let me tell you, I can't whisper anymore thinking she won't hear me. Great for home use...
0618477977|5.0|Great book that went well with the Polar Express train  that we gave to our grand children for Christmas.  JJ
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Even though Amazon warned me about the possibilty of a lesser experience in Europe, I love my ChromeCast. Easy setup and it performs just like I expected.
B0009VNHVE|5.0|This was hard  to find but my father in law enjoyed the original production and that was what he requested.  JJ
B00F2J2LRE|3.0|Once you get past that cover photo that it must have taken the makers of Jurassic Park 3 years to process the CGI for (c'mon Cher, you are beautiful, you don't need it!), this album is not bad. It's pretty much what you would have expected from modern Cher. Great vocal with minimal processing (she's still got it) some ballads, and some knob-twiddling dance workouts. It's really not bad, but I'd prefer to see her take some risks before her 'Farewell to the Farewell to the Farewell' album. Put her with someone like the Pet Shop Boys, and write some songs with feeling.<br />A solid 'like' for this one.
0679882820|5.0|Awesome and must have for any child.  There is nothing more memorable that reading a Dr Seuss book to a child.JJ
B005721W9O|4.0|A brilliant comedy homage to Star Trek, created with love. Gently teases (well not always gently), us fans and contains enough references to Trek and laughs to make this a great watch. Someone should also market Ms. Weavers push-up bra. I'm gay, and still had 'feelings' :-)
B00F880BWG|5.0|The best horror survival show there is. Last episode started to pick up the momentum for the last few episodes left.
B000J4OYRW|5.0|Detailed, and definitive retrospective of the boys career. Lots of talking heads, but for once, interesting talking heads. I found it absolutely fascinating and Chris even manages to speak a bit! The DVD also contains some great, rarely seen videos and performances. Essential for fans and an interesting watch for others too.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|The writing was so fluid adding an extra and surprising punch to an very intriguing story.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get lost in a great read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love this one detail storyline it's all worth the time I couldn't put it down.  It's in my top five.  Try it!
0316204366|1.0|I have read his three other books and found them interesting and enjoyable. In David and Goliath, the case for underdogs is weak at best.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I kept getting requests from friends to try this addictive new game.  I finally gave it a try, and I have to admit that I enjoy it and play  often!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|My husband and I play this game all the time!  We both have it on Kindle Fire devices and it works great.  We have moved to where we play the Stationery mode the most.  A great alternative if you like Mahjong type games.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I had the app for a while and it worked then the update came up I don't know why people say there are porn ads I having seen any but I am worried it may shut down my kindle I don't know if it's true or not but I'm afraid if I delete it it takes most of my downloaded vids and music and if I don't my kindle will probably be ruined
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This is an excellent tower defense game.  The game play is very smooth.  There is in app purchasing, but you certainly don't need to buy any of the extras to enjoy the game.  I enjoyed the first kingdom rush, and this one is also very well done.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|In the absence of a significant alternatives, Sonnet Firewire 400 to 800 Adapter gets the job done. Highly recommended to anyone in need.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is attractive and full featured. It has mem, %, last function and most importantly for me is the large display feature. I am hard of seeing and can easily spot the numbers and function keys easily. Much more professional in the graphics and functions. Intuitive to operate. I give it 5 stars because it meets all the points I most like it a calculator I use day to day.
B008EL25LE|4.0|yeah,, its only a match 3 game, but there are elements that have kept me interested enough to complete the storyline part of the game, and then go back for the timed and medal sections.  The different powerups make different levels interesting.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Character chemistry is amazing.  The stories are always intriguing and funny at the same time.  Nathan Fillion is the luckiest guy in the world to be working opposite Stana Katic!
B009RX85N0|5.0|This show has managed to keep me interested, the introduction of Captain Hook was great, I think that was some fantastic casting.  In the first season I loved trying to figure out who people were based on their names (Regina = Queen, Hopper = Cricket, etc).  This season the addition of the twisted family ties has kept me wishing I could watch more than an episode in an evening.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Kindness to other - seeing the soul and not the outside of people requires not just an open mind but a giving spirit. This book is inspirational in that way.
B00EXVZW6E|3.0|very basic, standard, getting boring hidden object game, looks the same as other hidden object games by this programmer.  Only difference is the background tones.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It's not bad, but there was just nothing to it to really set it apart. Don't get me wrong, it's enjoyable and will entertain you, but there's nothing in it that makes me want to watch it again or buy it. I wish there was just more to it. More suspense, more emotional draw. I was hoping to see a deeper look at the drain on humanity in such a scenario.<br /><br />It does have an interesting take and perspective on Zombies though, so it does keep it a little fresh (hah!) without trying to rewrite the genre (zombie love, anyone?).
B006WXHJNU|3.0|I slept through the middle part of the movie, and my boyfriend didn't make me rewatch it before the next &#34;Avengers&#34; movie.  He always makes me rewatch things when I sleep through them, so I know it can't have been all that great..
B00821OX98|5.0|It's a pretty good series. I'm well entertained by it. I like that despite its series, it's not quite so intense. It has its moments that will keep you gripped, but it doesn't take itself so seriously as to leave you emotionally drained after you're done watching it.
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|When the 'double jeopardy' law is relaxed, the Solicitor General asks Malcolm Fox to reinvestigate a case from the '80s, one involving a young DC Rebus. It had been thought at the time that the officers of Summerhall had tampered with the evidence to allow a murderer to go free - a murderer who also happened to be an informer to the head of the Summerhall team. Meantime, in the present day, Siobhan Clarke and Rebus are back working as a team. With the new rules on retirement age, Rebus has been taken back into CID but has had to take a downgrading to Detective Sergeant, meaning Siobhan now outranks him. They are called out to what looks at first like a straightforward road accident, but a couple of things about the scene make them suspect there may be more to it than that.<br /><br />When I try to pin down why Rankin is head and shoulders above most crime writers, it really comes down to two things. Firstly, the quality of his writing never wavers - he knows how to tell a good story, his pacing is superb and his plots are always both complex and believable. His characterisation is second to none - Rebus and Clarke have been real people to us for years now, people we feel we know, and Fox is rapidly joining them as just as important a character. They don't perform superhuman feats, nor does every book end with them being saved from hideous danger. There is a realism that makes us believe this is how the police really work - we've even seen Rebus over the years learning to toe the line as the Police Force has tightened up on mavericks and corruption in real life.<br /><br />Secondly, Rankin has his finger on the political pulse of Scotland - his books always relate to the main concerns of the day, without ever obsessing about them and without ever taking a stance. In this book, there are three parts of the plot that could only be written about at this point in time - the change to 'double jeopardy', the reorganisation of the various regional police forces in Scotland into one national force and, most of all, the campaign for the Scottish Independence referendum. Rankin doesn't beat us about the head with these; he just works them through the plot, as they are worked through Scottish society. So as well as telling a first-rate crime story, Rankin also reflects our society back to us - again, total realism.<br /><br />I admit it - Rankin always gets five stars from me. When I pick up one of his books, it's in the comfortable knowledge that it will be great. So when I say that this one is the best of his that I've read in years, how can I convince you? I could tell you that we're beginning to get a nostalgic, elegiac strain running through Rebus' story; that we're seeing Siobhan blossom into the fine senior officer we, like Rebus, have always known she would be; that Fox, now moving out of Complaints into CID, is learning to appreciate the basic integrity that underpins Rebus' sometimes casual disregard for the rules. I could say that reading this book will let you understand how the City of Edinburgh is changing now it's a political capital; how the upcoming referendum is filtering through every aspect of Scottish life; how policing methods are changing in this new millennium. Or I could just say this is a well-written enjoyable police procedural with a complex plot that will keep you guessing throughout. But, in short, what I will say is - read the book.

B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Excellent movie....would recommend  it to anyone.  We even watched it on a Kindle and still enjoyed it.  Many &#34;on the edge of your seat&#34; moments, but yet had such sweet tender parts.
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would. It came recommended by a successful business man who's ideas I respect so I read it. Now that doesn't mean you won't like. I think I was just looking for something else.<br /><br />It was a very easy short read so it's good for a long air plane ride or something like that. If you are already in business and you feel like something isn't going right you may find some of the ideas useful. If you are starting a business you can learn a few things about thinking big by doing small things.<br /><br />Take it for what it is. You can always find a few golden nuggets in any informational book.<br /><br />Kine Corder, Author of the book, The Art of Starting Over (available on Amazon.com)

B004J4WN0I|3.0|I'm used to reading things of the caliber of Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind and Jacqueline Carey for my fantasy fix. While after reading Hounded I would never put Kevin Hearne in this category, I have to give credit where credit is due.  He took a pantheon/mythological race that's been done before and put a interesting, if not wholly pleasing spin on it.<br /><br />I had to tell myself within the first 20 pages something I often tell myself when confronted with arguments about how the ancient gods and goddesses are portrayed in pop culture - they are what they are, and we are not, thus simply by being human we have to put them in a \\"box\\" of sorts. This is where the interesting spin came from, as Hearne managed a fictional take that I would consider almost believable. There simply is no such thing as  a perfect god or goddess.<br /><br />I do have an issue with how he portrays the witches.  Hearne demonstrated enough chef knowledge of witchcraft, of both the Wiccan and less \\"traditional\\" variety that it made me wonder if it was simple creative license or a personal... delusion that caused him to paint them as little more than monsters in human skins.<br /><br />As to the overall story itself, taking the book as a whole, I simply can't say it was remarkably good or bad. It had its moments of both. I can say that I will pick up the next book in this series and continue reading, but I will give it only one more book to win me over.

B00D6DVSAE|3.0|Sting has fallen prey to what many senior citizen's have fallen prey to--complacency. The aging rock star scenario is filled with potholes to fall into, and one of them is abandoning rock music. Sting is no stranger to adding jazz or classical music to his rock and pop. Just look at the middle section of 1981's \\"Ghost In The Machine\\" with it's horns (which ruins an otherwise solid album). Look no further than 1985's \\"The Dream Of The Blue Turtles\\" which is heavily jazz influenced. And somewhere around 2003's \\"Secret Love\\" album Sting began the descent into rest-home oblivion. \\"Secret Love\\" is the last album where Sting showed signs of rock music experimentation. And even then, \\"Secret Love\\" had the whiff off repeating 1999's \\"Brand New Day\\" motif with \\"Send Your Love\\" sounding dangerously close to ripping off \\"Desert Rose\\". While the rhythm and blues didn't quite suit Sting, you can still argue that he seemed to be pushing the limits of his rock music career. Then the wheels came off.<br /><br />In 2006 Sting began a decade long trend of recycling masquerading as 'experimentation'. Doing John Dowland for a whole album on \\"Songs From The Labyrinth\\", doing 'holiday' music on 2009's \\"If On A Winter's Night...\\", and finally recycling himself by turning his catalog into a 'symphony' on 2010's \\"Symphonicities\\". It appeared that Sting had thrown in the towel.<br /><br />And now here comes a revisiting of 1991's \\"The Soul Cages\\" in the form of a Broadway musical a la \\"Les Miserables\\" about his Newcastle shipyard roots with \\"The Last Ship\\" (let's see those JAZZ HANDS! JAZZ HANDS!) Again, masquerading as something 'new' and 'innovative'. Well, I'm sorry, but Robert Plant, Lindsey Buckingham, Paul Simon, Johnny Cash, Lou Reed, and heck, even Neil Diamond, just to name a few, have all successfully continued to find ways to stay relevant without foregoing their rock and roll roots.<br /><br />Ah, but Sting has always held a certain level of conceit throughout his career--an air of narcissistic superiority over other artists--and this has been his downfall. At least musically, as no one can argue that as a poet, Sting is a good writer, even on \\"The Last Ship\\".<br /><br />But the problem remains: How will fans react to Sting's abandoning of his rock roots for a decade now? Well, look no further than the opinions set forth here on Amazon by the fans. Plenty of one star and two star reviews, and yet...and yet...just as many five star reviews, too. A conundrum.<br /><br />For me, I grew up on The Police and Sting's early solo material. I have done musical theater, and I am pretty open to a wide range of music. But, I still find fault with Sting's decision to advance into the realm of easy listening music off-putting. I see both sides of the argument here with Sting wanting to try things beyond the confines of rock music, and I see the self-immolation of abandoning his rock music roots as well. I fall into the camp of still waiting for Sting to return to his rock roots.<br /><br />That being said, \\"The Last Ship\\", just like his last three albums, has moments of brilliance with an overall feel of something average. If \\"Songs From The Labyrinth\\" grew tiresome at 23 tracks, and \\"If On A Winter's Night...\\" put you to sleep with it's 15 tracks, and \\"Symphonicities\\" lulled you into symphonic submission with a running time of almost an hour, so then is \\"The Last Ship\\" with it's 20 sprawling music theater tracks totaling near 65 minutes. \\"The Last Ship\\" has songs that stand out, and those songs will depend on what you find enjoyable. For me, songs like \\"Dead Man's Boots\\", \\"Practical Arrangement\\", \\"What Have We Got?\\"  and a few others captured the spirit of musical theater. At 20 songs though, the thrill subsides quickly. I don't really want to hear Sting do musical theater (or for that matter reinvent his own material as a symphony, or hear him do holiday music, or hear him do lute music either).<br /><br />\\"The Last Ship\\" is another divisive work fromSting. I went back to the beginning of Sting's career with The Police's 1978 album \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\" and listened to each successive album leading up to \\"The Last Ship\\". There are so many great songs back there that it is obvious Sting's late career works demonstrate a lack of originality and experimentation beginning with \\"Songs From The Labyrinth\\". As I've noted, Sting has moved in a different musical direction without offering something innovative. \\"The Last Ship\\" may be an original work, but it feels recycled. It's just okay. Maybe Sting can finally be wheeled into the nursing home he seems to be angling for here. Oh, I'm sorry, Sting, am I upsetting you? Good. Let's hear some rock music then, shall we?<br /><br />Here's how \\"The Last Ship\\" compares to Sting's previous works:<br /><br />The Police:<br /><br />1978 Outlandos D'Amour: Three Stars<br />1979 Regatta De Blanc: Four Stars<br />1980 Zenyatta Mondatta: Four Stars<br />1981 Ghost In The Machine: Three Stars<br />1983 Synchronicity: Five Stars<br /><br />Sting solo:<br /><br />1985 The Dream Of The Blue Turtles: Four Stars<br />1987 ...Nothing Like The Sun: Five Stars<br />1991 The Soul Cages: Four Stars<br />1993 Ten Summoner's Tales: Five Stars<br />1996 Mercury Falling: Four Stars<br />1999 Brand New Day: Three and a Half Stars<br />2003 Secret Love: Three Stars<br />2006 Songs From The Labyrinth: Three Stars<br />2009 If On A Winter's Night...: Two and a Half Stars<br />2010 Symphonicities: (I boycotted this abomination)<br />2013 The Last Ship: Three StarsSting.

It might be awhile.

B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A Higher Call does an excellent job of giving us a glimpse into the lives and minds of a small group of WWII pilots and their comrades in arms.  The story of a chance encounter in the skies over France is interwoven with the personal stories of the men involved both before and after the incident that provides some amazing insights - particularly into what the German pilots experienced as the war wound down.  The book is well written, not too technical and focuses more on the people than on tactics and troop movements (which is a big plus in my eyes).

1781162646|5.0|I will start by saying that I am not a big Stephen King fan.  He is certainly a wonderful writer but I find most of the horror literature juvenile.  I was also not as enthusiastic as others about his book 11/22/63 (although I did enjoy it).  Joyland however is a wonderful book.  The central part of the plot is a coming of age story of a 21 year old named Devin Jones who spends a summer in a somewhat old fashion amusement park.  The characters are wonderfully rich and the colorful description of the park staff’s inner language and the different rides they run for the “Rubes” (everyone else) is priceless.  There is a bit of a ghost story and although it plays an important role in the narrative, it does not overwhelm the story.  King is a great story teller and I was completely engaged throughout.  I heard this as an audiobook and Michael Kelly was an outstanding narrator.  I highly recommend this book.

B006WMILQU|4.0|Fortunately for me, I did not read the novel prior to watching the movie, I could therefore watch the movie without having the burden to compare the two formats. Its an almost established fact a movie based on book will fall short  of transferring the full essence of the book to the screen. The best advice is not to read a book prior to watching the movie, its much better to do the reverse. I found the movie very entertaining.Fannie remain true to her inner feelings by not not accepting Henry Crawford hand in marriage, though even the most romantic would have urged her to do so just to avoid the roach infested home of her family. Tom Bertram's sketch book though disturbing serves to explain his aversion to Antiqua.

B00BG23LYS|5.0|This is one of my favorite bands, and this is in my opinion their best album. It's much calmer than their first album, but still has the mystical aspect, and while the second album, Blood Lust, was sort of dark and evil, this maintains the sort of evil sound while still achieving the mysticism of Volume One. Nearly every track is a masterpiece, though I can't say I much enjoy Poison Apple.

They are of a high-quality construction that provides confidence when trekking, and the lacing system gives them an adjustable custom and secure fit. I only wish I had bought them sooner.
B000QE9ERK|1.0|This is an incredibly poorly acted movie. It wanted to be an Alfred HItchcock/Jimmy Stewart movie, but couldn't quite pull it off. Johnny Depp's performance was flat; the fight scenes weren't; the story line was pitiful; the casting was abysmal. It reminded me of occult movies from the 1970's it was so bad. Don't waste your time.
006202406X|2.0|This book was a let down after the amazing first two in the series.  It didn't seem to have a clear purpose and there was too much dialogue and not enough action.  The ending left me feeling depressed not excited or hopeful.  Now I'm having mixed feelings about the movie, which I was so excited about, because I will know that it will inevitably end in doom.

B000002P5W|5.0|This is Jimi Hendrix's second album, however it came out quick on the heels of his debut &#34;Are You Experienced&#34; which was released earlier the same year. &#34;Axis Bold As Love&#34; is a great record but I still prefer &#34;Are You Experienced&#34; which to me sounds more bluesy. &#34;Axis&#34; sounds more rock, with some mind blowing guitar work. Jimi's guitar work isn't the only highlight here the song are well written, well thought out pieces of art, Jimi also brings his U.F.O. interest onto this record which is fun. There are many standouts here including &#34;Castles Made Of Sand&#34; &#34;Little Miss Lover&#34; and &#34;Spanish Castle Magic&#34; to name a few.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The ending was sad and depressing. It ruined the entire series in my opinion. Why have our brave hero and heroine end up sad and dead. Why couldn't their love and bravery conquer all?

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was captivated by the story. I liked the way the author wove 3 stories together. At the end of each chapter was a type of cliff hanger but in a more subtle yet profound way. I had to keep reading through the next chapter so I could find out what happened to the characters but would get caught up in the story of the current character's story. The lives of these women were ordinary but intriguing, I kept reminding myself that this story's setting was Australia.  I thought the ending was brilliantly conceived. I will definitely read more books by Ms Moriarty.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is sooooooo cute I love it to peices get this game or suck every body I'm for real stop reading and get this game losers NOW and look me up I'm cane c ya in the game
B00FKAA3MA|4.0|Overall, this was an amazing, well crafted album. While it isn't everything I was expecting, it is still one of Eminem's best albums. The only things didn't please me was the lack of slim shady on an album that revives slim shady. I felt like most the songs sounded like a mix between \\"Encore\\" and \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\", none of which truly sounded like Slim Shady. That said, I still enjoyed the album very much, but it could have been better.
B004TLM284|1.0|I really enjoyed this tune at the tale end of summer 2011.  It's on the &#34;Femme Fatale&#34; album, along with &#34;Til the World Ends&#34; which I also enjoy off this album. I'm sure by &#34;Womanizer&#34;  her critics began taking her seriously as an artist. &#34;I Wanna Go&#34; is a fast paced tune.  There's noticeable whistling in it.  However, the other instrumentals in this song are more noticeable than the whistling.  My fav part obviously is &#34;lably, lably,.....&#34;  This part reminds you of Haviland Morris, who played the 'stuck-up' captain of the cheerleading team from &#34;Sixteen Candles&#34; you know the one with...Molly Ringwald.  A lot of people like &#34;Legally Blonde,&#34; too!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Tricky ending. I like movies like this. Didn't see it coming. Had to watch again to try and see what I might have missed in the beginning.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Don't Listin to the bad commits<br />Because they don't understand or they are stupid it's a fun game worth the money
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Truely amazing. Excellent. A twist that keeps you entertained. Can watch this over & over. Would recommend this for buying as well as to watch individual time.
B00177YA1K|4.0|Replacing my VHS copy, I like the MIB franchise first one being the best. Filmed in New York this series brings back fond memories especially the Queens scenes in Flushing Meadow Park and the old Worlds Fair pavilions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I REALLY WONDER WHEN UPDATE0.8.0 IS COMING OUT.I REALLY REALLY WANNA KNOW BECAUSE I HEARD THERE IS GONNA BE DIFFRENT COLERED WOOD AND SIDEWAYS WOOD LOGS!!!!!!!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|No other words but: amazing! Edge of your seat suspense, mind bending, twisted plot, superb characters; 5 out of 5 stars for sure.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This is my new way of cleaning up my Kindle the freedom of information and instructions are tremendous and very affordable and easy
B005BOHYW2|2.0|Not really my sort of book.  It is a &#34;soft&#34; book and I wouldd recommend it for a bookclub read
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Really, I don't understand why more people play this splendid game. It's not too much like Minecraft (though, it seems almost akin to it). It can be a challenge when starting a new world, there's no doubt about that, but I believe that you will &quot;Get the hang of it&quot; I daresay!
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Always been a batman fan but I never heard of this book I think it is absolutely incredible about to buy the next
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to use and it streams content so well and the setup was so easy for a non tech guy
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|Some parts are really challenging. A real point and click adventure game. There's no hint button. There's a hint option but it's a definite spoiler alert. Some parts I had to go to the Internet for the walkthrough. Don't let the beginning full you it gets harder. Overall great game and can't wait for the sequel.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was an incredible book. I highly recommend everyone read this book; it is one of those stories that stays with you. I suggested this book for our little book group and look forward to discussing it over dinner!
1439102449|4.0|One of Reich's best. Kept my interest. A great addition to the ongoing series. Tempe is in good form here.
B0044R3X72|1.0|Never got to watch this because it wouldn't download. Watched it on Apple TV which never fails to deliver content. Please don't charge my account for this Amazon!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book captured me and I couldn't put it down. There was a little confusion with the narration but what really got me was the ending. I am in shock that she had her book end that way. I hope she writes more because well she is an amazing author who can really capture YOU in her words an  you won't want to put the book down.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|The original horror novel!  It's great- and it's by a woman, despite horror being male dominated these days!  It's a great read, I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy this app. nice puzzle fun. the music is nice and ambient ...calming. nice to play before bed. recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The Chromecast doesn't yet work with Chrome for Android which was one of my main use cases. I want to be able to push content from a tablet when surfing the web and want to share with other people in the room.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|GREAT CLASSIC!! left me with warm fuzzies. The character is strong willed, but humble. She chooses to follow her convictions, even when those convictions involve leaving the man she loves. It is a great novel, with a great ending. I simply love Jane Eyre!
B00DH7P6WU|5.0|These seem to be the next thing to monster high fans, they are children of fairy tales, and I gave 4 stars for educational,  because story book are just that! These dolls are very well made,  they are very cute, and they come with their own stories, for monster high fans,  an extension to the world of fantasy!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This is what I have been waiting for since his first album when I was 13.  It grew with me, it grew with culture, and it grew with maturity and life.
B00EMAGCJM|3.0|It is a good album... there are no horribly bad songs on here, i actually like most of the songs. She is obviously trying to break her Disney Channel Image, but its a pretty good song. My favorite songs are Drive and FU. She has a very unique mix of country, pop, and hip-hop.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Jgb . CHER, NXNCNZBXKC. JSBOAXJKJGK CNN HI UHH H UK KM IN I'M IN I'M UGJG  IF I'M G UHH
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I love this album so much. Lana really has an addictive voice and I could listen to her all day. If she had an album about toast, I would listen to it just to hear her voice.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I must say the book starts as a bit of a drag... BUT IN THE END I'M IN LOVE!! This book could only be described by saying James Dashner has a big imagination and I thank him for that. Please read this book I'm about to buy the second!
B009LA1QW6|5.0|She has such an addictive voice! I love all of her songs, some are very similar to each other (in beat etc) but I still love her.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Lol Love this game!! It is cool awesome love it totally awesome ha ha ha lol omg smiley face lol
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|paid for the game and it won't install. what a waste. had great reviews, my son was looking forward to it
B0056C6XIA|4.0|I have had two of theese wonderful tools. Te reason I bought a second one was that I used up the firesteel. You can not buy them separate.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Only 3 Stars because it doesn't work with the most Apps in Germany now.we are waiting for Updates  this time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|IT'S A GREAT GAME TO PLAY. IT O<br />is so much FUN I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH ITS SO MUCH FUN
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play. Only problem I see is cherries and nuts don't come down in a timely manner. Don't know how much longer to play the game.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|This movie is less of a horror film to me and more of a shocker film mean to freak and gross people out and this movie does it perfectly if you ask me.
0061122416|5.0|A must read!  Beautiful, insightful and thought provoking read.  I've bought several copies for gifts.  One of my my favorite books of all time.  My husband reads it every year...so much wisdom lies within this precious story.
076781326X|4.0|This movie from my youth was a birthday present for mom.  I think I'll get one for my own shelf for christmas.
1476727651|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas Present I am sure my sister-in-law will love it. She is a Stephen King fan. Thanks
B000BB1MHS|5.0|Jonny Depp edged out the four star Gene Wilder with the new ommpa-loompas.  Gene Wilder's version thoe classic was kinda dorkey.
B000URWYTS|5.0|This was a great book.  It was chosen as a bookclub read, and I was not very enthusiastic about the subject.  Turns out, this was a wonderful book, with probably the most shocking end I've ever encountered.  Would hate to ruin it for anyone that does not know much personel history about Frank Lloyd Wright.  You will be quite surprised.
0439023521|5.0|It is a very interesting novel. The book is really good. I really like it~~ Could not stop reading it~
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|One of the best Eminem work, eminem is back on top, i got this album on repeat, i highly recommend it
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Very rarely can one deem a product flawless but if this were to take place it would have to be with this Blu Ray collection. Containing everything for the casual fan to the religious fanatic, this collection transcends expectations of what is possible in home entertainment. If I had a grouse it would be with the fact that there were no interviews with the director for Alien 3, but this was beyond the control of 20th Century Fox. If you have 30 bucks to spend on entertainment there is no better way on this planet.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Fun value: 5 stars<br />Quality of toy: 2 stars<br /><br />Overall, I am enjoying my purchase.<br /><br />Pros: I love the sounds it makes, the UV light, and the ability to write &#34;invisible&#34; messages with the UV pen. It also has a regular pen attachment (but who would want to use that while the UV pen still has ink?!?)<br /><br />Cons: For $20, I wasn't expecting something that felt like a $5 plastic kids toy. I suppose it's expensive due to whatever licensing fees that they had to pay, but would have gladly paid more for a sturdier toy (given that I'm an adult).
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I liked the book a lot up until the last chapter. The ending was totally predictable and such a disappointment that all the loose ends were tied up with a sugary bow. I really felt the author ran out of steam at the end and put a lot less effort into the final pages.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|HighlyThis has been a great tool to budget my<br /> money.  very easy to set up and edit as needed.  Would highly reccomend this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very entertaining! Fun to play.  If you love Ice Age, you will never get tired of playing this game.  outstanding!!!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Every world requires that you either pay $.99 or wait 3 days to move on. With about 30 different worlds that means that you would have to spend at least $30 if you did not want to wait. Advancing through the game is very slow due to the limitations that are designed to make you spend money.  You could easily spend hundreds of dollars if you're not careful.  Wish there was an option to purchase the game without any in game purchasing.  Deleting from my phone
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I got this game thinking I could play and bypass some friends that are well into the game. Disappointed when I got through the first level and you have to buy coins.
B002JWD6AS|2.0|It just wasn't how I expected it to be. It was basically a bad retelling of twillight in a more immature way, although I did think the twillight series wasn't that bad maybe a 3 or a 3.5. But as someone who is an avid reader this book isn't worth the time neither are the other 2 which were even worse. Maybe my hopes were too high since I thought it would be less clich&eacute;. But maybe it isn't for me and is something others will enjoy reading. If you want a good book and  tend to read a lot this isn't for you.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I like stephen king's warped mind and how he can write on the simple things and his sense for detail.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Thought his story was very interesting.Definitely makes you think (which I like about books).If it's not true,he has one heckuva imagination.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Really well done . You can fall in love with all characters and their individual needs. Of course Maggie Smith is outstanding. She always is top notch . I love it when she gives advice and has that little smirk.  I got hooked quite quickly on this series and anyone who wants good entertainment should watch this series.
B000FA675C|5.0|It is was a good read.  Well written and kept me from doing other activities because i wanted to know what was going to happen next!
B00065GX64|5.0|Germany suffered a small epidemic of monstrous serial killers in the years before Lang made this film, and their notoriety may have inspired him. In any case, he created one of his best films in M (short for \\"Moerder,\\" meaning \\"Murderer,\\" chalked on the back of the culprit by non-murdering criminals because this killer of helpless children is bringing heat down on the rest of them, and they want him stopped as much as the general population does). Shocking, suspenseful, surprising, believable, M is not for every taste, but it is undeniably a superb work of art. I wonder if Peter Lorre left Germany to restart his career in Hollywood because he had wrecked it by playing such a foul character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter got me hooked and now I can't stop playing. Too much fun and the characters are awesome. A+++
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|game+game=awesome because it is a grate game.I love this game because i like boxing because some people like boxing so you should try it out
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The game has the most realistic gun simulation app in the whole app store. I have both apps and weaphones is number one
B00ESY827C|5.0|Great movie!  I preferred the original with Robert Redford, but for a remake this is cinematically beautiful!  Really enjoyed it!
B0064W67IM|5.0|Sandman is Gaiman at the height of his creative genius. A pure classic which bridged the gap between Vertigo and DC universes. Every fan of great fantasy/horror and comics needs to read this omnibus at least once. An absolutely brilliant journey from beginning to end.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I can't wait for the II death star update I still wonder why moon of endor only has 30 levels and all the rest have 40. It took a LONG time to finally 3 star all levels there are nine characters Luke, ben, han, rebels, chewbacca, C3-P0, R2-D2, leia, and lando. my favorite levels are the lord I mean lard vader boss's.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love that it has a military time option, and a choice of backgrounds &amp; alarm sounds. Not crazy about them wanting a 5-star rating to access more features, although I probably would give it 5 anyway.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Omg you cannot even search a word!!! IPods are better at dictionaries! I am so glad I have a laptop to look up words.
B0042UEU8M|3.0|I didn't realize Netflix had this. Yes, I wasted money and time. I guess I should have read the reviews before watching it.
B00A2H9PLG|2.0|Seriously, everything that happened in this movie was a clich&eacute;. Virtually everything that happened reminded me of something that happened in some other movie. I gave it 2 stars for the two things I thought note-worthy, otherwise it was crap.<br /><br />Also, Channing Tatum is a terrible actor imo. They should've picked someone else for that role.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the challenges presented. I would recommend this as a fun diversion for others. So I rate it a 5.
1452126607|5.0|great product! my daughter will love it! It's going to be a surprise for Christmas or her birthday! It arrived quickly!
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|Using sort by protected, it's the first tool I've tried that makes it easy to make a list of the dozen or so apps I've paid for, out of the hundreds I have installed.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I loved this book & almost died reading it because I was laughing too hard to take in air. The hot sauce story is worth the price alone. If you love her blog, you'll love this book... period.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Celine's music is just so filled with energy that will just brighten your day ! i purchased this new album as soon as it was released and it just turned it up! Great looking cover on the DVD case. This lady is so talented and she knows it and is so humble about her gift. A lot of todays young singers could learn a lot from her. Celine's new CD was played through out our cook out and everyone enjoyed it ! Turn it up ! You are missing out if you don't buy this album. DO IT NOW!
B005MMZR72|5.0|It is awesome, I can't understand why so many people gave this mediocre reviews! I wish there was a second season!! Such an great twist on the classic tale. LOVED IT!
161655164X|5.0|Excellent book! Lots of illustrations, wonderful quality of print, low price. I definitely recommend this book for all fans of this epic game
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Casting from my mobile is OK, but from my laptop the quality is poor, sometimes videos totally freeze after a few minutes.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I rater pay for the game instead off paying to get to different levels.  If I have to pay every time you get to have higher level, then this  is not the game for me.  I 'm going to take the game off my kindle.  DON'T DOWN LOW IT<br />1111
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|it was a very interesting reading even though I haven't read any of the other books it didn't make you feel as if you had to go back and read them.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I totally agree. I don't understand why this app doesn't update and takes you to the Google play store. I was so excited when I got my kindle for my birthday until I found it didn't have google play store.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that candy crush saga is finally a free app for the kindle fire.  I am addicted and happy that it syncs with my account on facebook.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|In Asphalt 8, the newest mobile racing game, everything has been upgraded. The graphics look great and this is definitely a must-have for Kindle Fire HDX users. It also has an excellent lineup of cars and many of them. I love the multiplayer mode and how the Facebook connectivity was done. The achievement system is amazing with Amazon GameCircle. There is also a fantastic career mode. Finally, it has the best price of any other game of its kind...free.<br /><br />Gameplay 10/10<br />Asphalt 8: Airborne has been updated with more high-flying stunts, making the game so much more addicting and unpredictable, especially for multiplayer mode. Even though this game doesn't have much physics to it, I love the ability to jump off all kinds of ramps to do barrel rolls and flat spins, adding points and making it feel as though I'm number one. You can knock down other opponents to make the race crazy and exhilarating. The music in the background is the best bass, electronic, and rock music I have heard for a game such as this. Nitrous can really speed you up and make you jump higher off ramps. There are many cars to unlock, but it may take awhile to get them because you must earn these points to buy them, or you could just pay real money. (This game is not freemium.) I love all the game modes you can play. I am currently in Season 2 of the career, and have already had fun playing through an all-new mode called \\"Infected\\" in which the player in last place is infected at regular intervals and has unlimited nitrous and gains time by knocking into other opponents. Basically, everyone is infected soon and you never know who is going to win those races. There is also a great elimination mode where the player in last place is eliminated after 20 seconds, so you better catch up! There's still more improved features and astounding new ones. I definitely will play this a lot and never get bored.<br /><br />Graphics 10/10<br />This is yet another great part of the game. While it takes so much space, it looks clear and it plays smoothly. While in the air, you can see down below and it still is amazing. If you're getting the new Kindle Fire HDX, I highly recommend this for racing gamers because the graphics are well done.<br /><br />Multiplayer 9/10<br />I like Facebook connectivity because you can race against your friends' ghosts, but here's the problem: I don't have friends that play this. Also they don't have Gameloft connectivity. I want to play on my Gameloft account to earn more achievements in my profile and that's where I play all my Gameloft games. Gameloft, don't take your own profile features out of this awesome game. The good thing is this has Amazon GameCircle. When you hit the Multiplayer Mode button, you will connect to a worldwide online mode and have to wait a minute or so for people to connect. Meanwhile, you can vote on tracks and modes. You have classic, infected, and elimination. It works great playing online and makes it more exhilarating, as it usually does with Gameloft games. I experienced no lag or connection problems.

B00E5C3AJM|5.0|Fun game and very addictive! Vote for me and I'll vote for you. My user ID is 2a84d. Thank you and good luck!
B007JWKLMO|5.0|First off it was a gift for someone who, like me is a huge Beatles fan. George especally. She loved it!! There were a lot of footage, pictures, and interviews neither of us had ever seen. Excellent!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent read, couldn't put it down. Love the characters, the excitement and Katnis is the absolute best. Can't wait to read part 3.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Since I'm the 11,000 review, I 'll just comment on the need to revolt against the Capitol,. Again sending Katniss and Peeta back to the arena because of the President's hatred of Katniss and the danger she could possibly cause to the decadent empire. President Snow is hated by the 12 districts for its butchery, among many other things, this is transferred to the reader in this mesmerizing tale by Suzanne Collins. Ms. Collins story telling ability is superior to almost any book you will read, this story will draw readers in right from page 1. This series of 3 books will all be made into very successful movies, and will be known as one of the best series of books ever written. It's the #1 book right now for a reason, so go on and treat yourself, you won't regret it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|App wastes space when you can just go to facebook through the Internet app already on device. It's basically obsolete on most devices.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|My local news apps always seem to fall behind in severe weather, the map on this app is better.  Recommend for travelers as well, nice to know what type of clothing to take.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is what it says it is, a free calculator. If your device doesn't have one already, this will work fine for you.
1603425381|3.0|Wanted a crochet book that had some ideas for borders on a baby blanket when the pattern I chose was too cryptic to decipher and crochet.  Bit of a disappointment though.  The book is heavy and is cumbersome to use  - ended up photocopying the page I needed.  Very basic instructions and there's an assumption that any crocheter can understand and work out the more complicated patters instructions.  I wish Amazon.com would show a little more of the content online even if it's just the pages with the pictures. Had I really known what the book was like I probably would not have bought it.
B009C7JS14|4.0|This app is your all around forecast giant .It automatically will find your location then give you both. Short and long range forecast,with.great clock for accurate time management
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game his a huge time waster but fun. For those over 40 don't even start this game it is a stress reliever but hard to stop.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game I play it everyday  it is so much fun. The only one thing is I don't love is the spike does not walk around
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Had heard this movie wasn't very good but my husband and I thought it was great!  The story was unique and very thoughtful with profound life lessons about fear.
B00A7Z8KAU|2.0|Okay. So I ordered this app for my kindle fire because my friend uses it and creates some really beautiful art with it! So I thought, hey, maybe I should give it a try! So I purchased it using the free 500 coins I got when I bought my kindle and it subtracted the 499 coins that the app costs, but it is nowhere to be found? I was charged for it and never received it! I will change my rating once I actually get the app... -_-
193700788X|3.0|It took forever to arrive, I purchased deadlocked and dead ever after at the same time. deadlocked arrived in a few days, this one took  almost two weeks . And, worse part was, I could not track the package, I was beginning to think it was lost.<br />Arrived in good condition and its a good read, just like all the other Sookie novels.
B00FKAA3MA|1.0|What is so great about this album?  Eminem is nothing but a whining little baby.  Grow up already.  No wonder the millenials are such a messed up generation.  It's because they listen to crap like this.  They have no respect for anyone--including themselves!
B008MX7Z32|2.0|I ordered it on March 29th 2013. It then stayed in my bag most of the times and I used it only 5 or 6 times. Now it stops working for no obvious reason.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I must say this is not  nighttime reading. I was confused at first, but soon realized what the story was all about. Very compelling, especially in light of the recent news out of Cleveland
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|see above.  ihate writting reviews but like this game. can be played without paying money butit does make it more challenging.
B007THA4FI|2.0|As an avid reader, I was excited to read her new book. Unfortunately, it is not well written and really was a waste of time. Wish I has stopped reading it, but as an optimist, I hoped it would get better. It did not!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I know we all waited impatiently for this book to finally make its debut and it's here! I had to physically stop myself from reading the whole thing in one sitting. I loved it and also ordered the beautifully printed and bound full-color hardback edition. Allie's hilarious and witty stories and drawings always make my day. If you're undecided, check out her blog, Hyperbole and a Half, but you'll be hooked as well.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great suspense novel although it's not The Shining, you wont be having many nightmares.  I read the bulk of that great novel while doing door duty in my dorm, only the oldsters will remember doing that.  We all had to take turns opening the locked dorm door for our late returning dorm-mates.  As I lived in a seven story dorm on Va Tech's campus in the late 1970's, it was a long, scary night.  Not sure what possessed me to read The Shining at 3am while the dorm elevator ran by itself, those who have read the book will certainly understand.  Now to this book.  It isn't the nail-biting book it's predecessor was, not really all that scary.  It is however an excellent story, characters were likable(except the True members of course).  You find yourself getting quite attached to them and worrying that they might not make it.  Would love to see the movie.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|Classic like the movie. A must have for anyone who loves this movie. I was really surprised by the wonderful goodies you get with this box set.<br />- Movie poster. I'm not sure of the size but it's actually pretty big, especially compared to the tiny ones that usually come with box sets.<br />-A leather pouch with 4 casablanca coasters. The leather case is actually really well made. The stitching even looks expensive.<br />- A bts book that is so nice it can sell on its own<br />- Two disc of the movie. One is blu-ray and the other DVD. Then there is a special features disc.<br />There was a lot of thought put into this box set for the fans and I am very pleased with it. The only negative I would say is that the box that holds all the items has gaps when closed. I wish the box set case was a little more stable in terms of the way it closes. Maybe a latch to be sure all the content stays in. So does the folding of the BR/DVD case. It does not fold together very well. That's not off putting enough for me to send back or anything.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Casablanca, this is set you need to get.
141659521X|5.0|Flynn was a great story teller. The best writer of spy and action in memory. RIP Vince. Gone too soon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun and keeps me busy when I want to be. I also like competing with my husband when I play. Although he is way more advanced.
B008JFUO72|1.0|Sucked! That says it all. Stark spends most of his time out of the armor playing spy/action hero. There are too many things wrong with this piece of trash to list here. Daredevil-level awful. Ghost Rider 2 level bad. Google ' Iron Man 3 sucks ' and see all the articles that show up.
B000VI12ZS|1.0|Clearly, hollywood used our brave fighting men, Navajo code talker veterans of the Pacific Theatre to peddle yet another hollywood agenda.  Utilizing the prejudices of some Americans against Native Americans, hollywood goes past racism to take jabs at the Catholic Church.  When the main actor unleashes his angry monologue against the Catholic Church we are supposed to come away with \\"the Church is evil\\" message that hollywood is so fond of delivering.  If you want a good source about our brave fighting men of the Pacific Theatre read \\"Strong Men Armed\\" or \\"Utmost Savagery\\".
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I  JUST  DID  NOT  LIKED  THIS  RIPOFF  UNINSTALLED  AS  SOON  AS  I  SAW  THE  BUGS  MY  DAUGHTER  LIKED  THE  ACTUAL  MINECRAFT  POCKET  BETTER
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|Once again, reading a Rebus novel is like settling down with an old friend; you know you're in good company. This latest outing is a series of complex contrasts with a number of diverse threads to the plot. There's an immediate role reversal with Rebus back in CID, full time but as a Sgt. to Inspector Siobhan Clarke. They still spark off one another and despite Clarke's best efforts, Rebus has his own take and style.<br /><br />Malcolm Fox from Complaints is working his final case in his 'rubber heel mob' role, conscious that he'll soon be working alongside officers he's investigated. He's looking into a 30 year old murder case where Rebus was a young DC working in a team which knew no boundaries other than those they made. Old style policing where any means was justified and the team swore allegiance on the Bible of the title. Who are the Saints and who are the Sinners? Which way does the moral compass point and how long should allegiances last? Events from the past once again spill over to the present. Fox needs Rebus onside and the relationship between the two differs from their earlier encounters.<br /><br />An investigation into an unexplained car crash is the initial backdrop for a lively paced story which weaves a complex and highly satisfying mix of past and present, black and white, right and wrong. Set in Edinburgh in the context of current issues around Scottish independence, the whole book has a real time feel.<br /><br />To fully appreciate some of the relationships and nuances, it would certainly help to have read other Rebus books. The backfill is cursory. But it would work as a stand alone. Once again, this story was worth the wait and I'm only sorry that the next one is likely to be a while longer. A cracking story proving Rankin is still heads above many others in the crime genre and Rebus has got what it takes. A big 5 stars from me.<br /><br />Copy of my Amazon .uk review.
0399159347|4.0|This was an easy read.  You didn't want to put it down, because you were interested in finding out the secret!  It gave you a view into the life of a marriage,children, friendships, and how one &#34;secret&#34; can alter the state of things as you have known them.  I did enjoy this book, because it  pertains to real life which makes it easier to identify with the characters.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Everything that I would expect and then some. Very impressed as always. His talent cannot be challenged. Would love to see this one get as many sales as the original Marshall mathers lp.
0143124544|5.0|This was one of my favorite reads.  I read this book several weeks ago and I still am talking about it.  It is about a situation that any one of us could find ourselves in.  One day you are a good looking, very ambitious, person with so much to live for and suddenly one accident takes it all away.  Here is a story of two people that find each other and try to make this situation work.  It definitely holds your interest to the very end.  It is a book that will leave you thinking.........At least I did!!!!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A definite read.  I completely enjoyed the book and learned a lot about the what women experience in the middle east. What an amazing book.
0553565915|5.0|This is an inspiring book that gives US hope for the afterlife.  Second time i buy it And after reading it i give it to someone else.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great game if u like a challenge and it's change of boards each step keeps it interesting. Can be quite addicting!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book blew me away. Even better than Ender's Game, it holds a story that hijacks your mind and holds it captive. I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to start the next one. Orson Scott Card has become my new favorite author.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great device for it's cheap price but would be great if Google updated it to mirror devices like Apple's airplay.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|Great adventure game. It's awesome, fun, and time-eating. I recommend this game for anyone looking for something that requires good strategy or that has a slight challenge to it while not being too difficult. Overall I love it and would pay up to $7 for it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was excellent!!  I simply could not put it down. The writer cleverly and expertly weaves the stories of three main women in Australia. The stories are so compelling and engrossing that you can't wait to read more, but fear it will end all too soon. The subject matters covered in this novel are all too real and consuming, infidelity, insecurity, guilt, trust, and most importantly secrets!!!!!  Secrets that take up a lifetime.  Excellent read!!!  I definitely have a new author to add to my list!!!
0061733199|5.0|Very informative.  Exactly what I was looking for as far as survival information. Definitely worth reading and adding to the book shelf for reference
1885167776|4.0|What is the one thing I can do such by doing it everything else will be easier of unnecessary? Gary Keller and Jay Papasan's book addresses the quintessential question which answer's seems to elude most of us. This is the \\"focus\\" question we have heard under different forms and disguises but that we frequently fail to grasp. The One Thing!<br /><br />This book is an invitation to reflect on our lack of effectiveness, our inability to achieve our goals, to focus on \\"the one thing\\". Success, the authors say, is an inside job. It is the result on living a life where we are accountable to ourselves. To focus on the important things, is not rocket science but it is a matter of committing ourselves to develop the habits that are necessary to concentrate effectively our creative energy. At the end, it is a matter of awakening to the responsibility we have towards ourselves and taking an action. Without doubt, this is an act of courage.<br /><br />Keller and Papasan describe on simple and concise terms many wrong premises under which we operate day after day. He also provides a clear set of steps towards being able to focus on what is important. Although beautifully presented, none of this is new. What is new is the smart way on which these ideas are put forward and, maybe, this is all we need to tip over into a world of success.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this book was one of the most best books in this series but it could not had more details
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|It is a great game for gun lovers and history geeks alike. Though it sometimes freezes, it is a game I'd recommend to my friends.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|Good, no thinking read, if you haven`t read any of his previous books. He writes in an easy, to follow predictable manner.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I think it's great to have this app for the kindle fire. It gives the time along with the weather. I also love the alarms.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad it's finally on kindle fire. Love this game can't get enough of it!!!  Much better to play on tablet than on mobile device.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Bit of a slow start and the story was somewhat wordy at times, making it hard for the reader to anticipate where the author was going with certain things, but overall, a good read. I especially enjoyed the ending, which felt like several endings in one, given the unpredictable twists. Great legal thriller.

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's really fun, makes you feel like you are in a fairy tale. The graphics are ok. The quests are straight forward and engaging. The game is relaxing which is a plus in my book.
160459201X|4.0|A great book.  I highly recomend this book to any one that is interested in improving their quality of life.  It was recieved in a timely fashion and packaging was more than adequate.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Can't put it down. It's driving me crazy! That's ok. My husband and I both play and compete with each other. I'm winning of course.
1476734941|4.0|Interesting ideas, easy to read, as with any diet I'm sure it works if you follow it and not just read the book
B0092C2X7U|5.0|At first it was hard to control but once you get it down its a really good game<br />I just wish they have more levels
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala Yousafzai is right up there with Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela and she is still a teenager. I cannot wait to see what else she accomplishes in her lifetime. Her story is incredibly brave, her faith is amazing and her determination and love for her homeland is an inspiration.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Every time I try to play the game where you clean up the puke on this app, I get almost all of it changed up but I still can't pass that one! Help!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King, you have done it again!! Couldn't put this book down. I don't usually like sequels, they never really meet my expectations. But Doctor Sleep went above and beyond! Thank you Stephen King!!
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|I'm a huge fan of star trek so when I saw this I thought this is gonna be amazing. Sure enough I play it and it is amazing. The story line is great and I love how after you beat the story you can continue to explore. If your a space lover then this is for you.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I love sci fi, but everyone that has reviewed this movie has put a true statement and that is Will Smith is trying to promote his son way to much in his own movies.  His sons need to be able to get movie roles on their own.  Will Smith and neither does his son do a very good job of acting in this movie.  This review by the way is coming from a big Will Smith fan.  I would not recommend this movie.  It is very long and boring.  I do not recommend even wasting your time renting it.  If it wasn't for the special effects their would really be no point in watching this movie at all.  That is the only thing that is any good.  The story itself is not very good.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I rate this 5 Stars. This is awesome ! You can build a bunch of vehicles ! Just awesome . And so addicting. And so worth it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the bedroom playroom and everywhere in between love seens! Laters baby! Give us more E L James &#34;MORE MORE MORE&#34;!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game. It is so awesome and addicting. I think everyone should play this game. I am going to keep on playing this game until I die.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game has a great &#34;arcade&#34; feeling to it. It runs smoothly and is fun to play when you have a few boring minutes to get through.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I've played many other td games and this is the best it has all sorts of boss battles and levels I recommend that you get this game
B00AB7HESI|2.0|This is like a watered down version of the scribblenauts game. I fet the controls were kinda clunky an unresponsive, and honestly the game was not that fun. I wish I would have saved my money.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|A excellent vinyl. sound great. the cover is awesome and the colors, simply perfect. No doubt i made a perfect choice.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I thought this book started out very slowly, but then picked up pace and interest.  However, the ending was quite unsatisfactory and &#34;inconclusive.&#34;
B00C2ISGRC|4.0|Bought it for my husband, who said he really liked it. It also was his first blu-ray video, so that heightened it too.
B005DNPJKU|5.0|Anthony Hopkins is elegant in this movie and it made such an impact on my early life.  30 years later, it still affected me and moved me to cry for this poor unfortunate man.  The cruelty he suffered from people was so hateful.  Unfortunately, people are more cruel now just to be part of the mob mentality.  Even in death, the elephant man could not rest in peace as Michael Jackson sought after his bones for his insane  and macabre curiosity.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy I can play candy crush from my kindle!  I play every day!<br />Even better it connects with my game on Facebook.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book is a life changer and extremely inspirational. If you feel lost or just need positive reinforcement about following your dreams, this will do the trick! ;)
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|If you ever wondered if there was true evil in this world, read this book.  The Kim regime in North Korea is truly evil, and hopefully the good people of this world will put enough pressure on our leaders to deal with North Korea before these camps and their prisoners are bull dozed to hide their atrocities.  Modern day concentration camps that have been around for 50 years (Auschwitz was around for 3) where thousands of political prisoners are bred into captivity and are killed for stealing kernels of corn.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun<br />I have enjoyed it for a year and i still enjoy it today<br />Great for anyone<br />There is no ads and you can buy coins but you dont have to
1844488748|5.0|Many new techniques, fine illustrations make the instructions easier, author very sharing about all her &#34;insider&#34; skills so we can learn to excel. This book is very inspiring to a person with clear instruction on  authors techniques step by step, but also by spurring the imagination to use her techniques for your own ideas. Money well spent, in the top 3 for any hand sewing library.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|I played the first one and it was really fun I told my friend about it and he searched it on his i pad then this one came up  so I searched it here nothing so I waited a ling time then eventually I saw it and bought it better towers fun new levels and enemys cool new heroes and all of it is simply asome
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|There is good instruction as you move through the first few tasks then the game is very easy to manage. The graphics are great and gameplay is efficient with the option to speed things along. If you liked the original Warcraft, you will like this game.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This.game is so fun even though I'm kinda old but who cares there is always something to do if you don't download it your weird just kidding we'll kinda B-)
B00DKY4LBW|1.0|What!!!!.....This is not the Arctic Monkeys.  Sure I get that bands mature and morph over time, but typically most bands evolve into something more than.............garbage.  These boys stole, yes stole, every single melody and riff from the classics and slapped a shine &#34;ee&#34; new cover on it and called it &#34;NEW&#34;.  Critics say, Do I Wanna Know? is &#34;Brilliant!&#34; Really?  It is best as fodder for the trash bin along with every song on this album. Do I wanna know how bad this album is? I am telling you, save your coin and move back to the old AM's and enjoy what they once were.  Oh the agony of such a travesty.  Why ask, WHY! I pray the day that Alex wakes up form the delusional state he wafers in and writes what we all know is sitting beneath the covers to be expressed.  Hope......that is what I am left with after listening to this album.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|Excellent presentation as with the Blu-ray edition, with the edition of the &#34;treasures of the vault&#34; which only<br />came with this Complete Collection.
0802407692|5.0|This was a request by Major for his troops who are having much difficulty due to being separated from their families so I was so happy to find a book specifically written for military which will hopefully benefit both wives and husbands.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have always enjoyed this game even before I purchased it on my kindle. NOW that I have it on my kindle I REALLY LOVE IT! The picture quality is amazing. The sound is better than all iPad products. I would recommend this app to anyone.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|My husband and I won tickets to see 21 Pilots from a radio station and before we went I had only heard Holding on to You. We listened to a few tracks on the way to the show are were both quite excited to see them. Needless to say, the show was fantastic and this album is truly amazing. I haven't found new music in quite some time and I'm so glad we won those tickets or I may have never known the awesomness that is this band and this album.<br /><br />I'm positive I will be listening to this one for years. It's almost impossible to chose a favorite song as they are all great but I would say I'm tied up for Guns for Hands, Migraine and Ode to Sleep. I completely agree with the other reviewers that the right song was picked for this album opener and it only gets better from there. If you are on the fence about buying this one, jump off and click purchase, it's more than worth it.
B00D0Z2JQK|5.0|its the dbz battle of gods movie but in japanese, and even though i cant understand it its a really great collectors item for fans of the series, i recomend it for any dbz fan
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I saw them in Sept and they are all I have listened to for 2 months. Song after song on this album, the more you listen the more you find the hidden gem in each song.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is sooo addictive. I was disappointed when they didn't have emoji pop, but this game is just as fun!
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|Although not as much depth as Up From Below and the new album this is still great.  This band is a 'must see' live.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|a fun movie that plays with the idea of time travel and the consequences. quite imaginative and interesting. engrossing from beginning to the end.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|The game is great and all but when I updated every time I tried to change levels it went straight back to a mother board. Frustrating. But other wise great game.
B000SW4DLM|3.0|very stylish movie. an interesting take on the near future.It is interesting to see some of our stars in their early film career.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is so much fun! Would recommend to any one who likes a little brain teaser. Buy buy buy! Please!
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Interesting documentary about an almost star in the U.S. whose career was redeemed in South Africa due to a number of interesting collisions of fate.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is such a long book, yet George Martin is such a great writer that you dont even notice. I flew throught this book. Its everything ypu want from the gender. Love, war, reveange, dragons!! But most of all ypu don't expect half the things that happen.  If you are here, you have read the other two and you will read this one. You have to.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A good story involving many threads, well told. at times I felt that the intertwining of the threads were stretched a little but this is really a minor quibble. Interesting characters who responded to a variety of motivations. Another glimpse into the conundrum that is Afghanistan.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Fun filled nonstop series of monsters giant robots and explosions.  Thing is, over my hispeed (?) internet, it was anything but HD.  It was blocky, where the bandwidth couldn't keep up with the streaming rate, so it was like listening to an old 45 RPM single.  Would have been rollicking silliness except I couldn't see it.<br /><br />As for the movie - it's obviously an homage to all the scifi monster movies he ever saw and loved, all packed into one.  Must have been a lot of fun to make.  You have to be in the mood for it, though, since the cliches come fast and thick (\\"Today, we are canceling the apocalypse!\\")
B00CL68NOG|2.0|an ok movie. sorta tired of the pushy mother (father, parents) trying to recapture a relationship with son (child). also sick of the man/child character.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This app has beautiful  graphics and a fascinating  puzzle to unravel. I loved losing myself in the mystery of solving the box in all its intricacies.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|Awesome documentation of a great recording event…American Songbook well presented.<br /><br />Dianna Krall (and her band) and John Pizzarelli make this even better.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Starting today, every time I start up the app, I have to listen to some commercial. How is that for a paid app?!!
1439181780|5.0|This is the much better sequel to The Secret in that this book offers lots of practical tips and suggestions that can be implemented daily in order to manifest desires, prosperity, or anything else the reader wants to attract. I highly recommend this book, and have it as part of my permanent collection of favorites. Review submitted by Eddie Coronado, author of the Amazon.com book titled \\"Manifest Your Millions: A Lottery Winner Shares his Law of Attraction Secrets\\"
B007R11DKQ|3.0|I would give it 3.5.  The characters were played well.  I enjoyed the story and I like this type of movie.
B000ZN802W|5.0|True story - still think about the ending now and then. Easy read better for adult readers.
B004NELBPC|2.0|I added this app to my kindle because the 'do you want to tweet this' popup that would not close on EVERY story ....but it's a condensed version of their site. Not all stories. No categories to choose. Just a long scroll list of stories chosen by Huff.<br />Worthless when the videos Don't load. I removed it.
0545128285|5.0|My  daughter, who loves the Harry Potter series I am not sure is aware this little gem exists! It will be a surprise for her Christmas this year!
B008X8RSTM|4.0|This worked well for us on Barcelona.  Although a big map to spread out would have given us a better perspective, it was there when we needed it and that was definitely a plus.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in this series and could not wait for the finale. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to my expectations. The story was disjointed and difficult to follow when flipping between characters. Without the beginning of each chapter telling whose thoughts and views you were reading it would be difficult to distinguish which character's point of view was being presented. In addition, the characters were stagnant with no real growth or development. As if these issues did not make it bad enough, it read as though it was quickly cobbled together to wrap up any outstanding items from the first two books. While I also had issues with the end of the book I was disenchanted long before then. If I had not paid for the book I most likely would not have gotten far enough to dislike the ending. It is not that I believe everything should be rainbows and butterflies and happy elves but endings should make sense and pay tribute to the story as a whole.
B00BM1AJIO|3.0|THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT I'm stuck in chapter 6 dark world castle in the study my key will not work &amp; I can't move the books no matter what I do. I contacted G5 last week still no reply, I'm using kindle fire HD.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Its ok , but limited to few applications like Youtube etc. Tab view only on google chrome and not full HD :(
B00BD99JMW|4.0|**SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!**<br /><br />So I definitely have mixed feelings about this third book. I think that it was interesting to find out all the information about the genetic damage situation and That everything was a government ploy (mostly because this is supposed to be a dystopian novel) and it also felt more relatable to me because i live in the US. I also enjoyed the point of view switching; and yes it could have used a bit more tonal/ personality difference. But mostly, I think people are failing to see that this is the end to a trilogy.<br /><br />Not only did Ms. Roth give the characters some depth, she allowed us to see that society can begin again even through tragedy. That people can forgive, move forward, and lend strength to others when they don't have any left within themselves. I was devastated when Tris died (I mean snot running down my face on the bus) but it forced Tobias to change and develop into the man we all knew he could be.<br /><br />So kudos to Ms. Roth for giving a bittersweet but fitting ending to this story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this easy fun read. Almost made you want to be Max and Vanessa. My only complaint is I never wanted it to end
B000024A70|4.0|I bought this for &#34;Bohemian Rhapsody&#34; and acquired twenty years of Queen's essential hits<br />in the bargain. Clean sounding compilation and the most economical way to own Queen's<br />best offerings.<br /><br />Queen is undoubtedly the most interesting and theatrical band in all of late period<br />UK rock history and these four guys prove to be great performers and highly original writers.<br />Highly recommended.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|Has a very comfortable handling, made from high quality materials, very spacious and lightweight. A nikon d5000 fits perfectly with 2 additional flash memory, filters and even a small flash.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game! I love it on Facebook and I am so excited to play it on my kindle! I hope they are going to create more like this! Well done!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is awesome. cool cars and stages. I have hand broken and I can still play it has super simple controls but very good physics. Bravo
1451666179|5.0|What a treasure, Thank you Allie Brosh!! Truly a masterpiece.  (great price btw, lists for $18 on the back :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm not one of those people that's a stickler for details when it comes to sequels especially when they are years apart.  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed Doctor Sleep.  It's a nice package.. a tear jerker for me, that's for sure.  I read the interview that King did with Entertainment Tonight that gave me that impression that some readers are nit-pickers about story lines... I have no idea if he got something wrong or not but I loved the book.  The first couple of chapters were choppy but hey, keep reading -- it's well worth the trip.<br /><br />King remains adamant about not liking The Shining movie.  I liked that movie and loved the book.  I wish King was more adamant about the Under The Dome series -- people living normal lives under a dome:  ridiculous.
B00005QB42|5.0|Deva Premal has a wonderful voice for chanting-she brings me inner peace and a feeling of harmony within my being whenever I listen to her CD, The Essence. I would love to see her in person again.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Very good story. The problem was that I had already read it and forgotten the title. I do enjoy Lee Childs's books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|SUPER fun! Love to play it with my girls, ages 9 &amp; 4. Great graphics and cool runs. Can't get enough!
0061733199|5.0|Whether you're a &#34;prepper&#34; or just looking to keep your family safe, this book is loaded with great information.<br />I highly recommend this book!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Boy did this book take a long time to get going. I honestly had a difficult time reading it (and caring about reading it) until exactly the half-way point. In a book that's 500 pages long, reading 250 pages before anything good happens is just too long in my opinion. Close to nothing happens in the first half, and then almost too much happens too fast in the last 250 pages. The end climax was especially frenetic and confusing. I'm not 100% sure I understand what exactly happened. People kept popping up where they shouldn't have been and everything was twisted and turned upside down. People who were dead really aren't dead, people who were dark really aren't dark, and no one is sure of anything. Least of all me.<br /><br />Book #2 really suffered from lack of the Lena-Ethan story. In fact, I didn't like Lena at all in this book. She was whiny and mopey and boring, and I couldn't find it in me to care what happened to her. Thankfully the characters of Ethan and Link are more interesting; this book was more about Ethan's journey than Lena anyway. I really like Link, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story Dream Dark, which takes place between this book and book #3.<br /><br />I think this book also suffers from the difficulty of having two authors. It's just hard for two people to write one story, and it showed in this one. I felt there were continuity issues throughout, little things that weren't consistent and that jarred me from the story.<br /><br />I thought the characters of John Breed and Olivia (Liv) were kind of pointless distractions. What is their purpose? If Lena and Ethan's love is so strong and so real, why was there a distraction in Liv and John? The fact that both Lena and Ethan were so easily drawn away from each other and to the characters of John and Liv made it seem that their love really wasn't all that strong to begin with. So why have a story? And what happened to Liv in the end? Both characters just seemed unnecessary to me. The sameaction could have happened completely without them.<br /><br />I loved Link, Ethan, Lucille Ball the cat, Macon, Marian, Lila, Ridley, and the sisters. They were the only things that saved this book from two stars for me. I will read Link's short story, but beyond that, I'm not sure I care to read on.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Even if you're an experienced fitness person or brand new to the game, you can benefit from this book. It puts a newer spin on some techniques that were tried and true back in the day and also explains some things a beginner may not know.  Everything that's claimed in the book is back by research and an explanation is given on why or why not he recommends certain things. I've been on the program 3 weeks now and I've dropped 10 lbs, 2.5% Bodyfat, while still getting stronger each week!  Definitely worth the 6 bucks!
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Whew! What an intense story! Abby Abernathy has moved from her home state of Kansas with her best friend, America, trying to outrun her past and get a fresh start. She starts college at smallish Eastern University (Is this meant to be the private Christian university in PA, or just some nondescript random school?) and immediately meets Travis Maddox, whom she's immediately and inexplicably attracted to. Their relationship is wild, stormy, dysfunctional, and intense. They love each other, but together they seem to be a disaster...a beautiful disaster.<br /><br />The up and down of this story started to get tiresome; I felt like it should have been about 150 pages shorter. Abby's \\"I love him/I hate him/I love him but can't be with him/I hate him but I miss him\\" thing just about drove me insane. And Travis's stalker behavior bordered on creepy. But I did feel that the development of their characters was well-done. I understood their conflicts and bought into it for the most part. I liked Travis and his family. Abby, though annoying some of the time, was a pretty likable character. America seemed thin and flaky, but she was a secondary character so it wasn't too distracting. I liked Shep, but I didn't understand why the author made him to be Travis's cousin. Their familial relationship was only referred to a few times in the beginning, and then never again. It didn't seem to matter that they were cousins, and when it was break time/holidays from school, there was never any mention of Shep and Travis having anything to do with each other. If they were such close buddies - and cousins - wouldn't there be some sort of relationship outside of school, especially at holidays?<br /><br />I thought the whole Vegas thing with the mob boss was ridiculous. In fact, the entire set-up of the strained relationship between Abby and her dad was ridiculous. Flimsy. I didn't buy it. I think the whole book would have been fine - and much more believable a story - if all that was just taken out. Why couldn't it have just been a story about a girl going to college in another state and meeting a bad boy? The mob and her dad and all that was just clutter.<br /><br />In the end, this was an entertaining, quick read that could have been even quicker sans about 150 pages.<br /><br />Oh, I have one more question. The book description reads, \\"Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn't drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe.\\" What?! She certainly DOES drink and swear; she even came to college with her own professionally faked ID...just so she could drink. She drinks at every possible opportunity, and on her 19th birthday a point is made that she is used to downing shots that would send a normal person to the hospital. Where did that book description come from?
B000F8O35U|5.0|Loved it! Brand new, even had the DVD seal on case! My daughter loves it just like I did when I was a little girl. It's all she wants to watch. Very fast shipping, it came days sooner than expected!!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable works with my quick charger and is a convenient length that doesn't intrude on my space for times that I want to charge my KIndle while I read, shop, or play games. It is a great replacement for the shorter original one that finally wore out.

B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Every time I use that spray it keeps spraying,spraying,and spraying and it's very annoying  sometimes it annoys me so much I want to throw my kindle out the window that's why I gave it three stars<br /><br />P.S:get minecraft instead!:)

B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|A really good port, i highly recommend buying it if you are into rpgs and crafting and exploration. Well worth the price even though it doesnt have hard mode
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Eminem has very few songs that I do not like , every song on this cd is in its on place and that alone makes this cd great
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you know where the term &quot;YASSSSSS&quot; was originated from you should know that it's a VERY good thing !!
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Charming movie.  It won't knock your socks off, but it's fresh and.. charming.  Sort of like a good glass of wine or a hot chocolate (depending on your preference).
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|I hate how when I brought the game, I clicked on it and it took me to the detail page. why does that happen?
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should play it. It's like your own world well it is. On creative you build and decorate stuff , on survival you have to find blocks  and at night there are creepers skeletons and zombies and spiders. So if you get it just saying it's fun fun fun!
B00007FOMP|3.0|I really like the Cd but the case was broken.  I am still ok with the purchase,  I thank you.
B008MX7Z32|2.0|Works great, is a great idea but be very carefull not to bend the light back beyond 90 degrees or the very, very small plastic piece attaching it will shatter and you $30 will be trashed.  Mine snapped after 1 wrong movement and the light fell to pieces. I hated to go to batter operated but I now own a more durable OttLite.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging and fun...looking forward to more!! The hidden objects and puzzles are well done...and well conceived...and the art work is very nicely created. Great job!!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The movie will do this justice. I really have enjoyed this story. SO an sure there we'll come a time  when I read it again.
B00AHDXTIK|3.0|Cable is useful and works perfectly. The only downside is that is VERY thick and quite inflexible. This makes it a bit difficult to route when in use.  I like it overall but would definitely look for a thinner cable if I had to buy another one.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I used to listen nearly 24/7 for years.  Loved it.  Had to do a hard re-boot on my Samsung Galaxy Transform, went to Install the TuneIn App and heck, it doesn't appear in the Ap Market at all!  When I try to use Play Google, I tap and tap and tap INSTALL and absolutely nothing happens.  Huge disappointment.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Pocket Editor is definitely an overachiever. It gives you not only what you can get it Pocket Edition, but more. They'll give you iron doors, burnt obsidian, chainmail armor, and much more. It also helps me blow up my friends with TNT :p
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This store relates to my life strike.. I was abused once for 3 yrs. But now I've found a good man who treats me kindly... n loves everything about me. Thank u for this experience in reading this book. Just might be one of my favorites.

B008EL25LE|5.0|I got this and the first game as a free app of the day. Both are worth the purchase price.  Lots of fun!
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Denzel Washington plays an alcoholic pilot that is, as another character says, an arrogant scumbag. From the first scene we are dumped into his sleazy, depressing world and we don't really raise our heads until the end. Everyone in this movie is to some extent a scumbag, from the slick lawyer, to the union rep, to the airline president, all of whom conspire to hide the fact that the hero pilot was drunk while piloting the plane. This is a dark, dark film and if you watch it you may never fly again.<br /><br />Washington pulls out all the stops here, but after the suspenseful plane crash segment, the film turns into every Hollywood movie about alcoholism you've ever seen. The climactic moment is telegraphed way, way in advance, and the flourishes during the hearing at the end, designed to increase the suspense (will he or won't he throw her to the wolves?), become almost comical, especially the actor's trademark overacted stuttering. If you've ever seen a movie before, the ending is never in doubt.<br /><br />This movie earns its \\"R\\" with nudity, language, and drug use.
1250038820|5.0|I discovered those photos and the comments with each of them of FB. I liked very much the 'life peeks' of all those people. The stories were always meaningful to me. A work of humanity
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A realistic , well acted and instructive version of an important political leader, active in the American Revolutionary war  and a founder of our the policies of our country's early years.
B000GM4X0A|4.0|This book is about emphasizing your personal strengths to be more successful in life, rather than wasting effort focusing on weaknesses. A quick read, and an interesting assessment. The last part of the book was most helpful, it focused me on what is most effective for me personally, and also made me aware of these strengths in others, and how to manage others based on their strengths.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|Funny, funny, funny. One of the very best, along with &#34;Fargo&#34; by  by the Coen brothers. It;s' a goala see moib vie. Excellent actin g and a hilarious story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have not connected with Facebook and have only played as a guest but I find it entertaining.  If you like Bejeweled then you will probably like this game; it is the same concept.
0451205766|5.0|By far the very best of Puzo's works about the Mafia family, its crimes and murders. Certainly worthy of the film series and Puzo's works.
0763644765|5.0|Anything that will explain, in pictures, how a toddler uses the potty is a good thing.  This one is simplistic and helpful.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins is the currently leading advocate of atheism now prominent. I found his arguments very impelling and authoritative. He is a true expert on the subject.
B00ADMYN9E|2.0|The author claims to having spent much of his time hiding the 'truth' about Roswell artifacts (he personally handled) from the public and his own colleagues and countrymen. His description of artifacts is vague to say the least and none of the artifacts he refers to can be proven to exist because he did such a good job burying them, how convenient and self serving!  (And I wanted to believe it).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great graphics, fun locations and even a bit challenging at times. Can't stop playing... need more bananas and feeling a bit despicable!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I normally would not deign to watch a zombie movie, but I forgot that that's what the &#34;Z&#34; stood for, and it was only a buck to rent, so I clicked pay without thinking about it. Amazingly, it's not a bad film, not bad at all. Casting Brad Pitt for the lead role is undoubtedly one reason the film works. The promo poster was what attracted me to it.  The older Brad has lost most of his &#34;cuteness&#34; appeal, but his expressive face and acting ability enable him to pull off a role that could have been very campy in the hands of a lesser star. (Tom Cruise probably could have made it work, but Pitt was the less obvious, and in my opinion, better choice.) I thought all of the characters were well-cast. No one looks like a fashion model. The acting  is very serious, there are no moments of comic relief, and the movie never descends into campiness, despite the ridiculous premise. The Zombies are decidedly silly, bug-eyed and snapping, but chilling nonetheless.  I was especially impressed by the zombie hordes, and there are plenty of zombie hordes. They have the horrific appeal of an ant swarm.<br /><br />I watched the slightly cut version available on Amazon, which is alledgedly a bit less bloody that the uncut film. That's fine with me; I have a low tolerance for pink jello, dripping wax, and fountains of  blood. In &#34;World War Z&#34; here is very little gore, but lots of action and suspense, and a great central character. If you can't resist the impulse to make a Zombie film, but want it to appeal to the largest audience, this is the way to do it. It wasn't perfect, but it was entertaining, and mild enough not to give the adult viewer a stomach ache and nightmares for the next month.  It's rated PG13, but I would have loved it at age 9 or 10.
B0090SI582|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie - 4.5 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br />great video and audio throughout this blu ray, exciting action flick.<br /><br />recommended.

B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Mix of old content and newer skills he refined with Relapse and Recovery.  Darker, shady-esque style with a deeper meaning/emotion than most other chump rappers offer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I kept putting off reading this book because I knew I wanted to be fully invested in it when I started it. I regret that I didn't read it sooner. John Green's stories are always so good, I should have known better. This book brought tears to my ears, made me laugh aloud and left me feeling content by the end. Though the subject matter of cancer is slightly depressing, it doesn't make you sad in the way you can't finish it, like some other books. The whit the Green has his character portray is too good to resist. This book is insightful and extremely worth it. IF you haven't read it yet, you should. I recommend this book for anyone between late middle school to elders. Everyone can benefit from this novel.
B00AJER3SE|3.0|the movie itself is great, the bluray I received from Amazon(sold by Amazon) was NOT!, the case has 3 stickers on the back and a cut on the front where it seems something was removed, as I can still see the outline of a square shape, this was supposedly new, the only thing that seemed new was the shrink wrap!  Very disappointed.
B003QS67F0|5.0|Incredible suspense.  Big-name actors.  Really amazing plot.  Didn't know what to think of it until after we saw it.  My whole family was blown away.  This would qualify as both a rental AND a purchase!

1616202416|5.0|Adichie is incredible. She's one of my all-time favorite writers. She's a master storyteller and my guess is that you'll become completely lost inside the book. The story line is fascinating and the character development truly impressive.

B00BUKZ4HI|5.0|This is my 2 year old sons favorite movie and it has become a favorite of mine as well. We can't wait for Despicable Me 2 to come out on dvd.
B00F4386PY|4.0|This, to me, is Pearl Jam's weakest album.  It still has some great songs, but doesn't quite match up to their others.  Certainly, it's worth owning and don't skip out on it.  Just for fun:<br /><br />Pearl Jam's most under-rated albums:<br />Binaural (simply an awesome, atmospheric album) and Riot Act (don't know this is overlooked, but one of my favorites of theirs)<br /><br />Pearl Jam's most over-rated albums:<br />Backspacer (again, good but not great) and Ten (yes, Ten.  A very excellent album and starting point to a career, but these guys were just learning to play together and right songs at this time.)<br /><br />Album rankings:<br />Vitalogy (10)<br />Vs (9.9)<br />Yield (9.8)<br />Binaural (9.5)<br />Riot Act (9)<br />No Code (8.5)<br />Ten (8)<br />Lightning Bolt (might end up higher in retrospect) (8)<br />Avocado (8)<br />Backspacer (7.5)
B0030IIZ4M|4.0|Bought this for my 2 year old son. He already had Toy Story 2  which he really likes, so we wanted to gbet the other Toy Stories for him. this was the best deal for this dvd that I could find anywhere.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|My 2 year old son absolutely loves this film.  No matter what age you are, you will enjoy the world of Mike and Sully, and the older you are...the more familiar the voices of Billy Crystal, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi will be.  My husband and I have actually looked up on IMDB.COM multiple times to find out the cast behind the voices on both the original Monsters INC. and this flick.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I loved this movie, best zombie movie I have seen in awhile. The time frame for delivery was very quick. The packaging was very good. Not too big and not to small.

B004GHNIRK|3.0|couldnt finish it. Great book but so long winded I didnt finish. Call me a pleb I agree. The movie is Ok but the book better as far as I progressed that is
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Would rate at zero stars if possible.  Very poorly written, poor character development, disjointed. What happened to V Roth?  Hard to believe it is the same author.  I really enjoyed Divergent, Insurgent was disappointing but I felt it would all be made clear in Allegiant because there were some solid, interesting plot points.  Alas, none of this was present in the final novel.  I would have been fine with a controversial ending if it had made sense, unfortunately nothing in the text made sense.  I am sorry that I purchased this book and wasted my time reading it. Unfortunately I had pre-ordered in advance-never again.  I doubt I will ever purchase another book by this author (unless I read a few months worth of glowing reviews and if another series is planned I will wait until the final book is released and reviewed before purchasing any).  I will not watch the upcoming movie because I do not want to become invested in the characters/plot.  So disappointing.  Potential buyers beware, you have been warned.  If you want to read a great series I highly recommend the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; series by S. Collins.
1250038820|5.0|Amazing book! It makes you feel like you have an unexpected access to another Universe and in the same time opens the door to the every single person captured in the book.

086571701X|5.0|I bought this book to help understand and explore the idea of setting up an aquaponic garden in my back yard. I have also read the idiot's version of aquaponics, and have read extensively through online forums. I currently have most of the materials to build my own system, and hope to do so in the next few months. Given that I've never done anything like this before, and how likely it is that I could easily kill my fish and plants, I've been going through as much information as I can.<br /><br />I found this book to be extremely helpful and clear, especially in comparison to the idiot's book. Sylvia Bernstein focuses on the design issues that really matter, such as the capacity of your system in terms of fish and the volume of water and plants, as well as the pros and cons of various layouts. Probably the most valuable chapter in the book is the one in which she presents all the different kinds of systems, along with detailed diagrams. These diagrams alone are worth the price of the book, and don't seem to appear anywhere else.<br /><br />The organization of the book is clear, concise, and logical. I started my research with this book, and now after several months of study, I'm finding that it offers the best guide to aquaponic gardening available. I highly recommend it. I hope to add to this review in a year or so after I've had my system up and running too.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I cannot believe there is going to be a 4th and 5th book to this series. The story line is already stretched waaaay too thin. Though I was glad to be reading about Gideon and Eva, Entwined with you starts off really slowly with very little substance. The book barely starts to pick up, finally giving us something to chew on and then Day ends her third installment with yet another cliffhanger...I only give it a second star because I managed to keep reading until the end. Now I am torn between wanting to find out what happens with these characters and paying for another watered down, weak plot with no ending. Its a shame, I really did enjoy the first two books in this series.
B008PWUYVA|5.0|Offers great protection, especially considering my Kindle has also become a favorite toy for my three year-old. So far, it's survived both of us.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|I finally watched this movie two nights ago after ordering it on blu ray, and I honestly love it. I dont know why it took me so long to see it. A gripping tale of angst and the notion of great power becoming corruptive, \\"Chronicle\\" tells the story of Andrew, Matt and Steve. Andrew is the teenage outcast who has no friends, lives with an abusive, out of work father who drinks excessively, and his mother is dying of a terminal illness. He takes to recording his miserable life with a video camera. Matt is his cousin, a cool kid who drives him back and forth to school and tries to look out for him. Steve is the popular kid running for class president. The three bond at a teenage rave, and soon discover a mysterious crater in the middle of a field one night. They explore the crater, go deep underneath it, and find a bizarre, crystallized object of unknown (possibly alien) origin.<br /><br />Later, to their surprise, they realize the object has bestowed upon them strange superhuman abilities, chiefly telekinesis and the power to fly. At first, of course being teenagers, they use their powers to play pranks (Using leaf blowers to lift girls' skirts, move unsuspecting peoples' cars around in parking lots, etc), but Andrew, the most emotionally put-upon of the three, becomes reckless and Matt tries to convince him they need to use their power responsibly and secretly. Over time, Andrew exercises his power to the point where it becomes stronger and stronger. So does his inner rage. He lashes out at his father, and even Steve! With his mother increasingly sicker by the day, he decides to use his power for selfish, potentially criminal reasons, with tragic results. It all accumulates in a very well directed and acted destructive battle across the city between a now out of control, psychopathic Andrew and Matt, who must do all he can to rein him in and stop this tragic menace.<br /><br />A great, even thought provoking screenplay by Max Landis and director Josh Trank, very strong performances by the three leads (Dane DaHaan as Andrew, Alex Russell as Matt and Michael B. Jordan as Steve), and amazing cinematography add to a fantastic film. Sometimes it's true what they say, \\"Power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely\\".g performances by the three leads (Dane DaHaan as Andrew, Alex Russell as Matt and Michael B.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's love Candy Crush Saga. I looked for it when I first got my Kindle Fire HD, only it was not available yet!<br />Now I can play anytime I want to.<br />I give this game a 5 Star rating....:)
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I take a lot of video with my GoPro camera when it is not mounted on my head. Especially when I take photos underwater, it is great to see what I am filming. It is also a lot easier to navigate through the menu. I recommended it to anyone, who wishes to see what they are recording, while holding it :)

B005BZQS1E|1.0|To much cussing, and inappropriate... Did not even get through five minutes of the movie, and I had to turn it off...
B008JFUS0U|4.0|Personally, I agree with all the positive comments lauded upon this production.<br /><br />The main problem that I see for Thor is...\\"Where does he go next?\\"<br /><br />I wish those in charge of bringing Thor's story to the screen...\\"Good Luck\\"<br /><br />I rate \\"Thor: The Dark World\\"...Four stars! (Mjolnir, his enchanted hammer...gets 10 stars!  That magical mallet is unlike any weapon I have ever seen...and, to be clear - what we have seen is NOTHING compared to what it is truly capable of...anybody out there remember the story of RAGNAROK (in Thor: Issue 200/1972) - or the INDESTRUCABLE?  Those that do, know EXACTLY what I mean!)
B000PXUA5W|5.0|Good quality and just right for a younger child. It seems sturdy so it will not get broken easily. My grandson loves it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Nice way to spend some mindless time waiting in doctors offices or on the train. i enjoy this game quite s bit.
B00015YVD6|5.0|A movie that is not only a great comedy for all time but a great movie about relationships. Not only a chick flick but also a guy flick as well.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Really loved the book. Now will need to go and read the others. This really needs to be made into a movie! Seriously!
B005J4VV28|3.0|Purchased this as a total nostalgic indulgence. I am of an age group where this was my first exposure to Beatles' music, and I just wanted to see if it was anything like I remember it.<br /><br />The cartoons are the usual uber-cheap knockoffs typical of the times.  Don't expect any fancy animation here.  Likewise, the voices bear no similarity to the actual Beatles.  In fact, at least one of the voices involves an actor who must have been in every cartoon made in the 60's.  It's enjoyable in a nostalgic, laughable kind of way.<br /><br />The reason I gave this a somewhat low rating is that the video looks as though it was recorded off the TV to a VCR, and then transferred to DVD.  The image is generally soft and fuzzy throughout.  Of course, the cartoons are so lame they hardly rate an extensive remastering process.<br /><br />All in all, this is an acceptable product if you just want a stroll down memory lane. But I recommend trying 1 season before buying more.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this game is for the lulz I recommend u play if u have humorous for the pain and suffering of others ouch wow and ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
B00F91G5BS|1.0|What a lost opportunity. WWZ was such a great book, it could have been a great movie or mini-series.<br /><br />Instead, Brad Pitt purchased the rights and made a vanity vehicle out of it, thereby ruining it for all of us.  WWZ was a serious approach to horror literature, and made the most of the zombie genre. I was so looking forward to a great film adaptation.<br /><br />If 'The Walking Dead' is an example of the right way to treat this genre, then 'WWZ' is exactly the opposite.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|this game is so addicting and so fun.  can not put it down once i started playing it. a must have

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Curses to you King.com!!!  This game is so addictive.  Can't put it down.  Would like to see a day of unlimited play. Hint hint
0345803485|1.0|It is written in first person - I hate reading first person.<br />Please do not confuse this with a real review of the book, as I threw it across the room after reading the first sentence.<br />the synopsis sounded really intriguing, and I could not wait to receive it.<br />So, this is just a WARNING for other poor slobs who also can't stand reading anything written in first person.<br />Amazon should include reviews or descriptions that include a flag or something that reveals the writing style.<br />It's my own fault for not doing the Look Inside, but that takes extra time and I was in a hurry being almost out of books to read.<br />To the author:  If you ever convert these books to third person, I will definitely jump on that series.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|funny as hell watchable over and over again. extras aren't much for new insight, that's disappointing.  Sheldon rules, and Penny is gorgeous
B00992CF6W|4.0|The app is great but can you please make it so my brother and I can play multiplayer. We both have the same versions of kindle fires. We can play with our cousins who have the same version of iPad minis. Please make it so we can play multiplayer!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004RJ71|5.0|This movie was really good too, but I think that American Me told the story a little more real too me and the acting was a lot better in American Me...But like I said in my review with American Me, you can't get one without the other...lol...so enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I played this game on Facebook, and I loved it then. Now I can play it on my kindle! I am so excited and if you don't sign into Facebook you don't have to wait for help from friends you can just keep playing! This game plays wonderfully on my kindle no problems. I would recommend it! and its free!
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|Love the movie and it came in perfect condition and right on time. The best version of the movie by far, and definitely the closest to the book.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I have am a musician and have been a huge stryper fan for over 25 years.  I actually learned how to play drums by listening to Robert Sweet on Soldiers Under Command.  This CD actually rivals the mid-80s releases of Soldiers and To Hell with the Devil.  The production of this CD is incredible.  The vocals are crisp and clean, the guitars are excellent, and this drum mix is by far my favorite.  I can tell this is Robert Sweet playing.  He has a very distinct style.  The cymbals are super heavy as are the hi-hats.  The snare has a great tone to it and the toms will rattle your guts.  Something that a lot of people do not know is that Kenny Aronof played drums on one of Stryper's other studio releases.  I never really understood that unless it was for some personal reasons that I am not aware of.  THIS CD is the real deal Stryper that I grew to love.  This CD is quickly becoming one of my favorites in my collection.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Like a time to kill, this book has all the elements needed to keep my attention. Great job! I would recommend it!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|A very interesting story. I downloaded the preview and was hooked. I am 65% done and am already looking forward to the rest of the trilogy.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Anytime I am down or feeling confused about what I'm feeling period I almost always find the answers at the amazing Hyperbole and a Half blog. Allies stories have an amazing ability to both articulate what I am feeling in almost any situation, and there is something magical and holy about knowing there is someone out there who has not only felt what you have felt, but a lot of people, and better yet she is able to show it so beautifully. Thats what is so great about Hyperbole and A Half;  i can and have given people the blog and said &#34;this is me. This is how i feel.&#34; That's the power of works like Allies, because she lets me know that I am not alone, that yes I am weird, but hey we're all a little weird sometimes, and then to turn around and share it with others who might not understand what is going on.<br />This book has my personal favorite story, Why I'll Never Be An Adult, as well as the truest, clearest depiction of depression I have ever seen, and some new stories just for the book like the origins of the Helper Dog. I am so glad to give Allie money and to now be able to share these stories with others in book form.

B00C1TOTK0|5.0|This is one of the great films of all time regardless of genre.  The secret lies in its brevity.  There is nothing wasted on screen.  The right amount of tension, drama and conflict needed for the story to work is present – nothing more, nothing less.  The plot?  A gunslinger-turned-farmer and his friends are harassed by a ruthless cattle baron determined to scare homesteaders away from his land.  Now then, director George Stevens brought to this project an authentic depiction of violence that had seldom been seen before.  He felt that he could no longer show death in the contemporary tame manner after his service in World War II.  This change in approach is evident in two ways.  First, actors with hidden wires attached were pulled back when struck by gunfire.  Second, the sound of a canon being fired into a garbage can replaced the actual sound of a pistol shot.  On the technical side, the cinematography by Loyal Griggs is handsome and breathtaking.  Also noteworthy, Stevens assembled a solid veteran cast with terrific chemistry.  Actor Alan Ladd is marvelous here with his calm charm and repressed demeanor.  Furthermore, “Shane” is a towering achievement in minimalism and remains an ageless classic Western.<br /><br />BLU-RAY:  This 2013 blu-ray release is somewhat disappointing.  The video gets a C grade since there is lots of room for improvement, especially the night scenes which are artificially pitched too dark.  I had to turn up my brightness on my TV by 50% just to be able to enjoy those day-for-night shots.  I am fine with the original aspect ratio being available here, but there are enough fans of the 16 X 9 version that including both would have been the wise move.  This was a bare bones disc (like the DVD), so there was plenty of room for two versions of the film as well as some film retrospectives.  Unfortunately, this release is identical to the DVD release, so most consumers may want to think twice about upgrading for so little gain.  The audiogets a B grade, by the way.  I would love to see a studio give this film a lavish restoration like the recent blu-ray for &#34;The Ten Commandments&#34; (1956).  But for now, this disappointing release is all that's available.

B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Bill Bryson and I'll definitely read more. One Summer is a fantastic account of many events in our history.  I had heard of most, but didn't know how interwoven they were. Bryson has a wonderful style-very efficient with words but not too dense to get through. I love his sense of humor. Enjoyed this very much.

Fascinating information about the biology of bacteria and fermentation, the &#34;umami&#34; flavor, the evolution of flour, among many other subjects. Honestly researched with great suggestions for furthering your knowledge on the subjects written about.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|I wasn't sure what to think about this game, but it quickly became fum for passing the time. There's not a huge amount of technique to it (pretty much punch and block), and can get repetitive. But it is still fun.

B004FN1T3A|5.0|Could probably not have had such a smooth natural delivery without reading this book and taking a course on hypnobirthing with my husband. I love how it starts at the basics and educates you on how your body works. It's so empowering to learn all that your body does to prepare for labor and the process itself! Without this knowledge, and learning to relax, I would have not made it through my whole labor at home so seamlessly before leaving to birth at the hospital (11hrs total) .

0307271609|1.0|Not much to see with historical facts. Jung Chang has written a 'long love letter to a mass murderess.'<br /><br />Cixi mistakes did cost millions of death to China, and China is still paying the price today. Contrary to what Jung Chang might thinks the Communist love her, it is thank to her shortcomings that they are in power today.<br /><br />I found the blog below really helpful in understand this book, most of the other reviews seem to have been written by people who have not read the book, or who don't know much about XX century Chinese history.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Jung Chang sports a sort of twisted morality, just look at the episode of the murder of the Pearl Concubine, Jung Chang do not say openly that Cixi murdered her in an awful way - she was thrown head-down in a well - but only that on returning to the Forbidden city in 1902 Cixi felt sorry and wanted to make amends...<br /><br />In her book there are basically no notes - readers must blindly trust Jung Chang on everything -  and the many positive assessments on Cixi have no reference at all. Yes, the book is well written and fluid, but remember: this is a work of fantasy and wishful thinking with few connections to reality.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think that this game is very good at some moments other might be a little bit more of a challenge for you to escape from the room lots of people should enjoy this game for every level you get stuck and confused on I loved every level of this game.

0785152466|3.0|For a Kick ass book I was expecting something more epic. But it was still alright. The art and story are really nice and there are a great number of really cool scenes.
B004OBZMBS|5.0|This movie is just plain fun! Low budget, well shot, well acted, decent CG, lovely scenery, and great folklore. Its the opposite of an American super budget blockbuster, which is why I love it. And if you read the one star reviews, keep in mind the type of person who can't 'waist' their time on this flick, or wish they 'would of' not bothered. LOL. If you are intelligent enough to read subtitles, ENJOY. I've watched it too many times on Netflix, need my own copy.
1492879347|5.0|I came in contact with Walter through a discussion concerning cycling and found out that he had written a book himself. Out of curiosity I purchased a copy even though I am not a cross country skier but was interested to read into the scene. Walt's book was immediately engaging as he covers the background to the \\"Birkie\\" and then takes us into his own personal journey through the race. The book is well written, witty and interesting. I know that as I finished it within a week, drawn back into the text each evening by the easy going style. At the end of the book Walter urges the reader to come and try the Birkie for themselves, he returns to the book's title \\"Birkie Fever\\" and lays out his call to action with:-<br /><br />\\"I think of the fun involved, the festivities, the traveling<br />and the joy that exists in no other place than at the finish<br />line of that magical event as thousands of people come<br />together and celebrate the fact that they've all done<br />something silly and magnificent and wonderful.\\"<br /><br />As a cyclist I wholly identify with these words. I'm not sure that Walt has converted me to a love of cross country skiing, equally I've not added the Birkie to my own personal bucket list....yet. But I have finished the book with a real understanding and empathy with those that return to the event year after year. Walter's own obsession comes through in spades. This is a self published offering and as such contains the odd grammatical and literal flaw. But I ceased to care about those as I remained entrapped in Walter's own excitement around the event. Therefore he gets a good solid five stars for an excellent text that will no doubt inspire many to join the legions of those already infected with the Birkie fever. Maybe, just maybe I'll join them as well one year

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is easy to read and practice. Pam offers simple and direct guidance and experiments to test out her theories in every day practices. While I have been practicing many of the principles in this book for over a decade (in my own ways), I found this book to be the definitive, how-to guide to bridging my belief system and grounding it into practical reality. It's just a great \\"workbook\\" for the spiritual seeker who wants to power up her practice...can't wait for Pam's next book!
B00BWQW73E|4.0|I generally enjoy this type of book, and this one was no exception. The book is easy to read and allows a good pace.  I did become a bit confused due to the large number of people introduced and the fact that the time line seems to jump around.

B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Movies like this really tick me off. Great idea that, with a few minor changes, could have been incredible.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a screw-up. He fathered a son he hasn't seen in years. He has a robot he drives around the country picking up gigs for chump change. His son's mother dies and he's happy to let boy's aunt take custody of him....for a price. Through a fluke he ends up with the boy for a few weeks. They come across an old robot which they fix up and take on tour where they proceed to climb the bot-fight ladder to the ultimate match.<br /><br />This is a nifty flick, but it could have been so much more with only a few minor changes. First off the is the script. I don't know that I'd change anything there. I liked it just fine. What I would change is Hugh Jackman. I just don't think he's that good. I did see him recently in &#34;The Prisoners&#34; and he was really good, but generally he has nowhere near the gravity to pull this off. I'd put in someone like Russ Crowe, Michael Fassbender or maybe Ryan Gosling. I'd also put in a different director. If you look at Shawn Levy's history, he's done all cutesy, light weight stuff. Put in Pete Travis or Alfonso Cuaron and this could have been a true powerhouse of a film. Now, being based on a kids toy from the early 60's, maybe light and cute is what the producers were going for, but I saw so much potential in making this, not just an entertaining flick, but a truly great film.<br /><br />Now, with over 500 reviews already logged for this movie, I'd be really surprised if anyone even reads this. But I just saw it for the third time and it frustrated me as much as it entertained me so i had to speak my piece.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Gameloft has done it again with another addictive game that I cannot stop playing.  I love the random animals that run suddenly pop out.  I hate waiting for the bar to refill, but I love the fishing part.

B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Addictive and fun to play.  I can't count how many hours I've spent playing this game, it's easy to follow even if you haven't seen the movie, and the characters are really cute and fun.
B008JFUS0U|3.0|The quality of the first \\"Thor\\" entry is often a point of contention among a good deal of people and myself. Personally, I found Branagh's film to be energetic and lively, with a fantastic cast bolstered by solid direction and an entertainingly cheesy plot. Many people don't share that viewpoint in the slightest, I came to find out. Regardless, that didn't damper my excitement for the follow-up, which has a different director but the same writers. It's a shame, then, that after seeing this on opening night, the first phrase that came out of my mouth was, \\"Well, that kind of sucked.\\" Because despite all of its best efforts, \\"Thor: The Dark World\\" suffers from a sophomore slump that undercuts any of the film's strong points.<br /><br />After the events of \\"The Avengers,\\" Thor has been patrolling the nine realms in an attempt to keep interdimensional peace. Loki has been locked in away in a cell, and Jane Foster has been... well, apparently trying to step up her dating game, despite still pining for her pretty-boy Asgardian prince. But all of this is threatened by the introduction of the Dark Elves, an ancient race of warriors whom Odin presumed to be dead after he ravaged their world with the restraint of a crazed elephant. In a predictable twist, the Dark Elves invade Asgard, kill a lot of people, and severely anger Thor and Loki to the point where they end up working together. Also, Jane gets possessed by some ancient parasitic weapon, the laws of physics start failing in London, and the Earth is on the verge of getting destroyed.<br /><br />As you can probably tell from my less than excited tone about the plot, this movie's narrative is a complete snore-fest when held in comparison to the first one. The writers have simply tried to tackle way too much in way too short of a running time, which results in a film that feels simultaneously plodding and rushed. Casualties of this flawed narrative include entire subplots that get introduced, then dropped with no abandon. We're supposed to be led that there's an elaborate love triangle, that Loki has some sinister plan being carefully plotted out, that physics going berserk is because of a certain reason. But when the credits begin to roll, it feels like we've only seen about 1/4 of the story. Altogether, this film feels incredibly unfocused and incomplete, and for the second time in the Marvel Universe films (the first being the \\"Captain America\\"), it felt like I was watching a two hour trailer for the next \\"Avengers\\" film.<br /><br />The other problem with this film is the absolutely unbelievable love story. Despite both being great actors in their own right, Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman simply have no chemistry together as the lovers from other worlds. When they kiss, it feels forced, and their \\"romantic\\" dialogue made me feel as if I was being forcefed sugar from a funnel. It's almost unbearable to watch them interact at times, which is a bit saddening when their chemistry in the first film was pretty convincing.<br /><br />At least the acting and fighting keep things moving along. Tom Hiddleston is especially wonderful as Loki, finally showing a commitment to the role that I quite frankly didn't know he had. The energy between him and Hemsworth is dynamic, and honestly, it feels like they have more chemistry together than Portman and Hemsworth. Other actors, including Rene Russo and Anthony Hopkins, are also top-notch here, and the inclusion of reliable Chris O'Dowd is also welcome. Aside from the acting, we have some pretty entertaining fights bolstered by lavish special effects, the best of which is the admittedly enthralling final brawl in London. What undercuts this, however, is when the film tries to be a low-rent \\"Star Wars\\" and implement downright stupid aircraft battles in Asgard, complete with faceless warriors carrying lasers, laser-blasting cannons, and laser turrets. Oh, and the main villain can essentially use the Force. I wish I was making this stuff up, but I'm not. It was if the writers didn't know what genre movie was, and artificially tried to appeal to as many demographics as possible.<br /><br />The result of this is a film that falls flat on its face harder than Thor's Mjolnir. Some parts of this movie are genuinely entertaining and fun, but not enough to merit the ticket price, and certainly not enough to merit owning it on home video. \\"Thor: The Dark World\\" is not an awful movie, but simply a very dull one, one that is nowhere nearly as engaging and fun as its predecessor. With a rushed plot, forced romance, and an ending that feels like a cheap ripoff, there are a lot better things you could spend your money on going to see this month.<br /><br />Overall: Ct I'm not.

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is like having a really organized library right on my kindle.  I like how you can label the books as you want and they are neatly organized like on a real desk.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It is fun at first but then u have to do the same thing over and over and that is when It gets annoying
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Kids love this! Easy for the children I babysit to play. They love it and helps to keep them busy .
B007N3GZ9C|5.0|I heard Jill Bolte Taylor on NPR a few years ago, talking about this book.  I was immediately fascinated by her miracle of life and recovery.  I read the book right away enjoyed every page.  I think the best thing is that since I have read this I have had  the opportunity to share it twice with friends who have had either a stroke or brain surgery.  It sings of possibilities of total recovery after any type of  brain attack or brain injury.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. I can't wait to see the movie. I have a feeling that the third one will be amazing. I think it is my favorite one so far. I'm going to see the movie the 22, can't wait. Suzanne Collins, you are my favorite author. Just going to by the third one now!!!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I love this book. I love Allie Brosh. I may be lying to myself but know if Allie ever met me she would love me too and we'd talk all the time on Facebook and she would Like all my witty status updates.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|While the ending is not entirely unexpected it is very satisfying.  The series is a must read for science fiction fans.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Game is fast. It loads quickly, once you tap the cursor the cards go to the appropriate column. I had downloaded another spider solitaire game to my Kindle, this game is far superior. I'm going to delete the other spider game. Mobilityware card games are great and have an added bonus of being free! What more could you ask for?
B003THHIEM|4.0|I like the show, it is a slow start but it gets better every episod and season! Love to watch it!
B00D2CYU2W|1.0|What a disservice to an entertainer that was the worlds greatest.  His private life was his own.  Why do movie makers  have to put out such films.  The actors should be embarrased that they took such roles to dishonor Liberace. One can see it is for the money.  I guess the book-writer just can't be satisfied with what was given to him.  He could have walked away anytime but did'nt.  One can say his rap sheet says it all.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Not sure I agree with all of his conclusions but Gladwell is very good at identifying interesting issues and leaving room for discussion.  My book club read it and we had a very lively discussion about it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this book! Loved them all. First time ever I literally could not put it down. I read all three books in 3 weeks.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I was ten when Alien was released and my parents would not let me see \\"R\\" movies. So it wasn't until the early '8o's when a neighbor of mine who was a musician and a member of the Oregon symphony let me see Alien on Laser Disc (with large screen projection tv and sub woofer). It was love at first sight. Then seeing Aliens on the big screen brought it to a new level. I purchased the first Alien box set on DVD way back in the late 90's... This Blu-Ray set puts that set to shame. Alien is my favorite, Aliens is my second, Alien 3 is my third and Alien Resurrection is my fourth (and Prometheus... well, let's not go there.). I strongly suggest buying this set!
0385537131|3.0|Have read all of Grisham's books.  His earlier books were cannot-put-them-down reads but then he hit a period where it seemed he was just writing to meet a schedule.  This one is better but still not a grabber.  It's ok but do not expect to be drawn into this story.
B00CLT31D6|4.0|I liked this very true .. probably about a third of the book is about luxury cars .. which I am not into anyway but the bottom line of save dont spend comes across loud and clear - I would say buy it worth reading
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|The movie is fantasic, really calls back to the days of campy action movies, with great laughs and over the top action it's hard not to love this movie.
0393327655|2.0|So, I'm reading Sam Harris's The End of Faith, a typical Enlightenment critique of religion. Religious people are dingbats because they believe in stuff for which there is just no evidence or proof. The interesting twist of Sam Harris's book is his full frontal attack on the religious liberals who by his lights want to have it both ways: They want to be both religiously devout and good, reasonable, and tolerant sons and daughters of the Enlightenment. Well, you can't, thunders Harris. Religion is the dark abyss of irrationality, the Enlightenment is sweetness and light. The two clash and necessarily clash. You've got to choose one or the other, and if you choose religion, Harris will hold you complicit in Faith's attempt to nullify the hard won triumphs of Reason.<br /><br />And if the religion you choose happens to be Islam, well, he might even kill you. See, all religion is insane, but Islam is the worst. Harris has read the Koran and has concluded that there is a direct line from it to suicide bombings. Islam trains people to destroy themselves for the sake of paradise, and should Islamic countries ever acquire long-range nuclear weaponry, they may choose destruction of the whole world as the quickest route to Koranic Paradise. This is a very real possibility. What's to be done if these whacko Muslims don't see the reasonableness of the Western Enlightenment? What if they stubbornly persist in their nihilistic beliefs that the value of this world is nothing compared to the glories of the next? Harris answers:<br /><br />&#34;In such a situation, the only thing likely to ensure our survival may be a nuclear first strike of our own. Needless to say, this would be an unthinkable crime--as it would kill tens of millions of innocent civilians in a single day--but it may be the only course of action available to us, given what Islamists believe. (p. 129 of the Norton Paperback Edition)&#34;<br /><br />Now, Harris does stress that &#34;[a]ll of this is perfectly insane.&#34; And he makes clear that he conjures up just such a scenario only to illustrate that the beliefs of Islam are so serious that they could very well force us to into a genocidal war. Harris is by no means advocating the realization of the horrific hypothetical. Harris would, of course, much prefer for Muslims to moderate their beliefs, which means to admit that the Koran is as fictional as Batman Comic Books and to accept the Good Sense of the Godless Enlightenment. And as much Mr. Harris hates to say this, it's either that or all out nuclear genocide.<br /><br />Oh, if only we were all as reasonable as you, Mr. Harris! But because over one sixth of the world's population are not and stubbornly refuse to be, I guess nuclear genocide is the only way for the legacy of the Enlightenment to endure. Too bad.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I finally finished Sam Harris's The End of Faith. Religion is bad because it is irrational. It is irrational because it demands beliefs for which there can be no empirical evidence of any kind. One wonders if Sam Harris has ever read David Hume. The Humean Argument shows that belief in causality is irrational (in Harris's sense) because there can never be an empirical expression of causation. There can be such an expression of conjunction, of course, but not of causation. So, are scientists who mistake mere conjunction for causation irrational by Harris's lights?<br /><br />Harris would perhaps counter with the argument that the confusion of conjunction and causation (if it is indeed a confusion) has not led to such patent atrocities as inquisitions, witch hunts, bloody religious wars, and suicide bombings. Religion has led to such things and will continue to lead to such things as long as enlightened atheists are unwilling to say outright what has been obvious for centuries now, that religion in putting all value in a beyond for which there is no shred of proof necessarily devalues the world we all can see and, hence, much wreck havoc wi&#34; And he makes clear that he conjures up just such a scenario only to illustrate that the beliefs of Islam are so serious that they could very well force us to into a genocidal war.

Why not blow yourself up and take dozens of innocents with you if the glories of this world are just filthy feces when compared to those of the next? No, the civilized world cannot tolerate such nihilistic irrationalities, and atheists must say this with pressing urgency. Else the world is doomed to be destroyed in an orgy of irrational religious piety.<br /><br />Okay, so, how do we convince billions of whackoes to be rational, forget about the at best dubious rewards of the beyond, and focus on creating global harmony for the here and now? By the promotion of Buddhist meditation. Yes, folks, we must spread the gospel of Buddhist meditation throughout the world. See, in the last pages of Harris's book, we discover that religion, as pernicious as it is, is not the basic problem. No, the subject-object duality is. The fact that we understand ourselves as individuated selves over and against this world of the here and now makes us hostile to it and to eachother. Duality means opposition, opposition means strife. To get rid of strife, we must get rid of the opposition, to get rid of opposition we must do away with duality. To do away with duality, we must get rid of the sense of the self. And if we don't want a religious whacko to do that for us by triggering thermonuclear war, then we better start promoting Buddhist meditation.<br /><br />The goal of the Buddhist meditation is the extinction of the self and the contemplation of the nothingness behind the illusion that we call this world. Buddhism devalues the world of the here and now as much as, if not more than, any of the irrational religions do. But Buddhism does not offer a better world, only a blissful nothingness. It is easy to imagine someone going on a suicide mission for the sake of an orgy with seventy dark-eyed virgins. It's kinda stupid to go kamikaze for the sake of a contemplative dissolution into the non-empty emptiness.<br /><br />But, then again, it's kinda stupid to do anything for the sake of nothingness. I mean, perhaps, I am too caught in the straitjacket of occidental binary thinking, but if you succeed in this Buddhist meditation and wipe out your sense of self and become one with the emptiness (which is somehow non-empty), then why the hell would you give a turd about some religious whacko wanting to take Armageddon into his own hands?<br /><br />I don't really believe Sam Harris is serious with his suggestion that the Gospel of Buddhism will save the civilized world. Harris has fallen into Huntingtonite despair about the Islamic Hordes chomping at the bit to impose Sharia upon their enlightened betters. He thinks that only a pre-emptive genocidal first strike will prevent it but really doesn't have the cahones for such a bloody solution. So, the only option left short of getting blotto drunk or your brain completely fried is to curl up into the Lotus Position and tell yourself over and over that nothingness isn't so bad and suffering is just an illusion, and if you can convince yourself of this, then you'll be able to endure either the imposition of the Koranic Law or the nuclear/genocidal clash of civilizations. Nihilistic contemplation is the only reasonable solution to murderous nihilism, I suppose.
B00FKAA3MA|3.0|Creating a sequel album is always going to be tricky business. For one, there's a certain level of expectation from fans, and sequels very rarely live up to the original. Because of this, Eminem already had a lot going against him with his latest effort, but he made it worse by making a sequel to an album that's over a decade old. That's not to say it's impossible, of course--Raekwon made that apparent four years ago when he released his sequel to the critically acclaimed Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... However, it is very rare. You could sugarcoat it and call it a &#34;re-visitation,&#34; but we all know that's a cop out. This is a sequel that tries to recapture the same vibe with a slight shift in lyrical content, and it winds up being unfocused and unenjoyable.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, some of these songs have a lot of potential to be legendary, but the execution was questionable, at best. For example, there are three songs in particular that would have enveloped my body with chills, had they been written 10 years ago. The album's opener, &#34;Bad Guy,&#34; has us following Stan's little brother 13 years after the incident; track 11, &#34;Stronger Than I Was,&#34; has Marshall showing Kim's perspective of their relationship; and track 15, &#34;Headlights,&#34; has Marshall formally apologizing to his mother. Conceptually, these songs are amazing, but he never made me feel anything. Most of this was a result of Em's lyrics, but in the case of &#34;Bad Guy&#34; I didn't understand why it was made.<br /><br />If you recall, &#34;Stan&#34; was about an over-obsessed fan who kills himself, his girlfriend, and his unborn child because Eminem didn't respond to his letters. However, once we reach the final verse Em apologizes by saying he's been really busy lately and didn't have time to answer his fan mail. So my question is this: why is his little brother mad at Marshall? He literally did nothing wrong. Stan was obviously suffering with some mental issues, and Em being busy at the time of the letters just pushed him over the edge. The whole concept made no sense to me, and I think that's why I wasn't able to connect with it on a deeper level.<br /><br />Most of the complaints I've seen up to this point have been about the album's production--something I will discuss later. However, what really ruined this album for me was Eminem's lyricism. There's no arguing that he's always been a flamboyant emcee. Over the years he's said some wild things, but he was always straightforward with his lyrics. He said what he meant, and--with the exception of Recovery--he never smothered his verses with an overabundance of similes and metaphors. Instead, he told stories. He painted pictures through the use of multisyllable rhymes and complex rhyme schemes. Although that's still a big part of his arsenal on here, there are also a lot of similes and metaphors, and it weighs his verses down.<br /><br />That's not to say I'm against this form of writing if it's productive for the music, but it's not. There's a fine line between &#34;creative&#34; and &#34;corny,&#34; and Eminem crossed it multiple times during this album's 78 minutes. It reached a point where I couldn't even remember them all, so I took out a piece of paper and jotted down every cringe-inducing punchline. You wanna know the result? I filled up an entire page. Here are a few of my favorites:<br /><br />&#34;Toilets clogged, yeah, cause I’m talking a lot of s*** but I’m backing it all up.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The Sound of my hussle says don't knock.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;0 to 60 hop in and gun it like G-Unit without the hyphen.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;So now my cup is runneth over and I'm about to set it on you like a motherf***ing coaster!&#34;<br /><br />&#34;But if I can't batter the women, how the f*** am I supposed to bake them a cake then?&#34;<br /><br />&#34;I'm 'bout to clean house yo. I'm Lysol.&#34;<br /><br />It should be noted that it's not all bad, though. On the contrary, there a few moments on this album that imitate just how crazy Eminem used to be. For example, the &#34;Parking Lot (Skit)&#34; takes place after the robbery on &#34;Criminal,&#34; and it feels like a classic Eminem skit--that chuckle of his is iconic. In addition, his last verse on &#34;Love Game&#34; is very reminiscent of his story telling ability on The Slim Shady LP. His insane imagery is unparalleled by any of today's mainstream Hip Hop acts. Also, on &#34;Rap God&#34; he makes a reference to his Columbine line on &#34;I'm Back,&#34; and it was satisfying beyond belief. Unfortunately, in his arrogance he claims he can get away with it today because he's not as big as he used to be. When the truth is, at the time, the wound was still too fresh for the families of those involved. Lastly, there were also a handful of bars that felt like vintage Eminem. Here are some of my favorites:<br /><br />&#34;But I still am a CRIMINAL! Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my GENITALS!&#34;<br /><br />&#34;I got 99 problems and the b**** ain't one. She's all 99 of 'em I need a ma-chine gun!&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Case of tourettes. F***, f***, f***! Can't take the stress.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;They can't even spin back the curse words. Cause they're worse when they're reversed. MOTHERF***ER! (Rape your mother, kill your parents!)&#34;<br /><br />Finally, the production on the album definitely didn't help negate my overall distaste for the record. With production from Rick Rubin, Alex da Kid, and Luis Restro, among others, the beats on The Marshall Mathers LP 2 are about as mixed as a bag can get. There's no consistency as we go from the Beastie Boys-inspired &#34;Berzerk&#34; and grimy &#34;Brainless,&#34; to the Justin Bieber-ish &#34;The Monster&#34; and Western-influenced &#34;So Far...&#34; There's no focus or direction, and this is easily the most chaotic album Em has put out. There's a lot of experimenting with different forms of production, and some of them work, but most of them wind up falling flat.<br /><br />Standout Songs: &#34;Legacy,&#34; &#34;Brainless&#34; & &#34;Evil Twin&#34;<br /><br />Overall Score: 5.3/10 - Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much from Em's eighth solo effort. I wanted to be proven wrong, but I was ready for the inevitable disappointment. I've slowly felt my bond with his new music deteriorating over the past few years, and I had a gut feeling that I was going to be let down again. Still, I gave it a dozen solid, and honest, listens, but it just didn't do it for me. A lot of the more emotional material felt extremely fabricated, and his lyrics sounded forced and unnatural. While I do feel every Eminem fan should at least give it a chance, I urge everyone to really listen to the music instead of just accepting it because his name is on the cover.

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|What keeps me from giving this movie a fifth star is that in the original graphic novel, who is hero and who is the villain is not so black and white.  The graphic novel writer Alan Moore was not even credited in the movie. But if you love your tragic heroes seeking revenge and stories of victims who have everything they hold dear taken from them, definitely check it out!

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Being a fan of the band since '91, I fully support the self titled decision. Yes, the bands lineup has changed over the years, very slowly, but this has led to a very thorough evolution to this point. There are bits and pieces of almost every previous album scattered - from an orchestral Six Degrees-like overture (False Awakening Suite - though a little bit more Symphony X sounding) to a familiar feeling ballad from Scenes (Along for the Ride), from the almost always present mid tempo Rush-esq sounds (The Looking Glass) to a new denominated musical rem(a)inder of the whole fraction that was 8/8 (see to the Liquid Tension-esq instrumental Enigma Machine, and Illumination Theory). Not so much from the heavy reverb days, but I'd say you'll enjoy a similar shift of harsh/heaviness as Awake and Train of Thought appeared (condensed into specifically The Enemy Inside). All in all, I'm very pleased with this musical journey and highly recommend to even the partialest of listeners.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|OK, JUST GOT THIS GAME. It's AMAZING!!!!!! Cannot tell u how enjoyable this game was. Let's make it as simple as pros and cons.  Pros- AMAZING graphics<br />Super fun activities that can earn you coins and health points and experience for your horse.<br />You can do like seven jobs at once<br />Unlike other games (star girl) you have 100 energy right from the beginning and jobs usually cost u 10<br />Plus, the energy comes back really fast and you can buy food to give it energy too<br /><br />Cons- I'll try to think of one. The only con I know is that the game lags sometimes, but its not so slow as to annoy me<br /><br />But I think what I love most about this game is u don't need internet to play it!!! Sure, you need internet to see friends and stuff but unlike other games, you can do other activities that don't require internet.<br /><br />U have gems, but u only need them if you want to buy extra things for the game like a rainbow unicorn.<br /><br />All in all I'm amazed this game is free and great!!(and I'm amazed you read through my whole review :))
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is freaking AWESOME for $35!  I spent more on my LG 'Smart' TV and the Netflix/Hulu apps are rarely stable and constantly force me to re-sign back in.  Same goes for my Panasonic Blu-Ray surround sound (which sounds great otherwise).  This thing is far more stable, loads faster and overall has been much more used than the TV or Blu-Ray apps since I got it a few weeks ago.  Sure I'd like a few more applications to work on it (PLEX PLEASE!!!) but so far it's exceeded my expectations, ESPECIALLY FOR $35!!!  The only thing I don't like is Pandora doesn't do the screensaver thing that Google Play does (but that's not anything to do with the CC itself).<br /><br />If you have issues with your current hardware like me you'll absolutely love CC.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is super addicting, lots of fun. Like the integration with Facebook, cool concept. Interested to see what other games this company will release.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love the detail and zoom feature..the graphics are crisp and colorful so you can actually find hidden objects without going blind..interesting story line..a good game!
B00D7JGL36|4.0|The music performed was great, Vince gill could sing the phone book and I would buy it.  Wish he would do a second with a few more Buck Owens songs I think he could sing so well
B00ARPMIJE|4.0|I liked it enough to buy the second book. Doesn't that tell you something!!  A good read when I needed something to escape with. The book kept my interest and made me want to learn more about Maude.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|Great product! It was brand new but the price wasn't. One of my favorite movies. There were no scratches. The movie was great.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Even as an adult, I am a fan of young adult fiction because I really enjoy watching how younger minds are being shaped by what they read. This dystopian trend is actually very useful in exposing young minds to the idea that they are powerful and capable of shaping their own worlds. It allows them to explore philosophy, sociology, and political science in a carefully constructed framework. It should, in it's best forms, empower young people to recognize their ability to bring about great change. The Divergent series opened with fantastic potential. And then it failed spectacularly to carry through.<br /><br />While the first two books showed promise from having created an original and interesting culture, this book brings it all to a very unsatisfying resolution. It also brings to focus some of the problems in the earlier books that were easier to overlook amidst all the action.<br /><br />The first book creates a fabulous, unique and interesting microculture. It's beautifully thought out and opens the door to all types of fabulous exploration of that world and how it came to be.<br /><br />I wish there had been subsequent books about the other factions before we went to the eminent collapse story, but we moved straight into that in book two. It was very action-laden and didn't pay enough service to the amazing world Ms. Roth created. So much missed opportunity, but my attention remained riveted, and I really looked forward to book three and it's promise of explanations. However, while explanations of a sort did present themselves, they were threadbare and surrounded by so much teen angst and superficial emotional wallowing that there was little satisfaction to be had.<br /><br />These characters are all, regardless of age, extremely childish and one-dimensional. Their emotional development doesn't even seem to reach adolescence. There is an obsession with forgiveness on a very elementary-school level, written by someone who seems to have struggled with their own issues of forgiveness via a simplistic morality-based philosophy instead of through the eyes of a mature adult who has developed empathy and wisdom. Everyone is a foot-stomping, fit-throwing child who needs to find sacrifice and proper humility in order to grant forgiveness. Long explanations about nonsensical differences between &#34;confession and admission&#34; compounded with flat and uncomplicated descriptions of the personalities of abusive parents reveal an author who has a long way to go in exorcising the demons of her own childhood. And, of course, all of this detracts from any narration that might exist in the story. Our characters spend the majority of the book mad at each other, mad at their families, mad at authority figures, mad at the past, and just mad in general. They are angry young people who spend more time narcissistically struggling with their own anger than dealing with the very real problems surrounding them. Whenever they do get around to DOING anything, it is often just a bunch of reactive flailing with very little thought to consequence. The fact that anything is ever successful seems to be more of an accident than anything else. And, of course, they come out of each experience angry with everyone else involved. Resolution to this anger is painfully immature. Yes, I realize the protagonists are mostly young, but even the adults involved seem to react to the world as if they were 13. Having even one mature mentor might have helped a lot, but I'm not sure Ms. Roth would be capable of writing such a character.<br /><br />I wish we could have moved away from the sophomoric existential struggles of childhood morality and really explored the deeper philosophical potential of this world. The best young adult fiction gives the reader an opportunity to expand their thinking. This one gives them an excuse to continue being mad at mean parents, mean authority figures, meany-meanersons everywhere. Complete with foot-stomping.<br /><br />What a shame.ues of forgiveness via a simplistic morality-based philosophy instead of through the eyes of a mature adult who has developed empathy and wisdom.

B003TSEL7S|4.0|This was a great book reading the net one I really wish percy was in this book because he is one of my favorite characters
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Loved the first three.  This one was a bit of a chore to read...I felt like I had to read it though, since I had invested so much into the series already.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Good acting but I don't really like movies where the main character is drinking and using drugs.  Also being in the FAA this was very concerning that the crew knew this and did nothing.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|Dreadful, boring movie. I almost felt bad for Downey, Jr. and Paltrow, until I remembered that they got paid a bunch of money for sleep-walking their way through this.<br /><br />When you're halfway through a movie, and you realize you don't give a dang about any of the characters, you know you're watching a bad movie.<br /><br />This is a truly crummy movie. Please, don't make any more like this, okay guys?
B00DVPN30A|3.0|lovely tunes from a guy who know knows how to write a tune. not as great as his other records but good.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I do quite enjoy this game however on the samsung galaxy s4 I cannot place objects after typing then up and pressing enter
6302293553|5.0|great movie. i watch it like every 5 years. I found getting into a gitty sort of mood prior amplifies it's intent.
1603427244|3.0|This books shows many cast on, bind off methods, but not really great in directions. After looking at the methods I feel a need to look further for exact instructions. I am not the only person who looked at this book and had the same impression of it.
0547366205|5.0|As a former kindergarten teacher, I love giving this book as a new baby gift--rhythm, rhyme, and perfect theme. Delightful!
B003L77GRO|5.0|Awesome.  I love Dexter and when you own the seasons you can watch each episode. Can't wait to receive the finale season!
B004I744AS|2.0|I will more than likely uninstall this app.  Too much to look at for one word.  Not what I thought I wanted.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like the challenge of looking for clues and items. I can't wait for more levels so that I can continue the fun.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|It's a cute little movie. My sister rented it one night from Redbox, and I decided to buy it. It's been over-watched in my house, though, and I got tired of it pretty quickly.
1426308469|5.0|my grandson is the best judge of the book and he loves dinosaurs ... great book for a 3 year old and its a book that he can grow into over the next couple of years.
B0001I561E|3.0|Great movie, but since this did not come directly from Amazon the case wasn't in the best of shape! The movie works fine, it is just the case that was damaged.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I have read a lot of Brandon Sanderson's books and I found this one to be one of the funnest reads yet. His characters have a lot of personality and the story keeps up the action the entire time. I figured out quite a few of the twists, but I still missed a few big ones. It will entertain even the older more experienced reader along with the YA crowd.<br /><br />If you are like me, you will probably read this book in a couple of days. It is that good.
B003YUC2FE|4.0|The storage box is very weak and does not protect the discs well. Everything else is great, but I wished they had made it more durable. I feel like I cannot use the storage and so the presentation suffers because I have the empty box now and the DVDs in a case.
0385523912|5.0|As painful as it is to read some of the stories in this well written book, we all need to know what our neighbors in it N. Korea (and other countries) have gone through and are currently going through.  God made us free, so why do some have the need to enslave others?  Pray for North Korea.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|this is a great movie. saw it with my 3 year old niece and 4 year old nephew and even they love it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a great read. I really enjoyed the fiction and the history. It lets you indulge a bit on what it would be like to live in a different time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game. There are lots of activities. I highly recommend it. I love all the different options for your horse's tack!
1439148953|2.0|Totally uninteresting. Goes nowhere. Author gives reader no hook or excitement. Read the 1st third and nothing significant happened. I had to quit wasting my time.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|If finding meaning is the goal of life, then the journey must involve investing in the lives of others. The dramatic experiences Frankl endured seem to have served to inform his soul of the fundamental truths that emerged from his theories. Beyond surviving as a Jew in the Nazi concentration camps, he lived to become meaning in its highest form, to live to serve others.
B00000427L|5.0|Vladimir Ashkenazy playing my favorite contemporary classic — Great! Andre Previn conducting the London Philharmonic is a real plus. You won't be disappointed!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with a hunting game being played on my Kindle Fire. This game surprised me. It has good graphics and easy controls. The load time is a little slow. The weapons are fun to choose and upgrade. I am sure this game will kill some of my spare time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  I interface with my friends on Facebook, get/give extra lives. It's fun to see how far ahead of me they are in the game. lol
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great book. Not just for young readers, but also for the young of heart.  Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Amy Tan's book is amazing and the movie really stays close to her storyline.  The actors are amazing!  I love that there is still plenty of figurative language and such a great movie about cultural differences!
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Entertaining film with historical  context that is important for people to see who did not live in that time period of American history.  It is an accurate portrayal of the American cultural environment during the cold war era of the late 1950's and early 1960's.  The changes of that history, society, and of the city where the film is set are interesting to see.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Got hooked on this game on my Windows 8. Love that I can get it on my new Kindle fire HDX. Very challenging.I take it with me and play while sitting in waiting rooms. Great game. Get it.
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|Good album with lots of songs. Can be a little dark and depressing when you listen straight through. I know he's had a rough struggle with his life, but I'm sure there's been SOME positive things to happen. Listening to a couple songs here and there, or putting the songs on shuffle with a big playlist, makes for great listening!! Eminem proves once again he is an innovative lyricist and he has the smooth chops to spit what he writes.
B002HNAAZ8|1.0|holy bad worst cd i ever heard i mix of reo and boton dont buy this one i will give it away
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very good game. It has many different games that are hard or easy. many games are very gun
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Brilliant. Could not be easier to set to and works so well. The quality of Netflix through it is a bit too good.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Excellent insight. Thought provoking story.  A great read! Read it aloud with my spouse and enjoyed every minute of the book.  Mitch Albom has a wonderful vocabulary and look at life without apparent compromise of his own world.
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|Best movie in years, we even went and watched it twice in the theater. Never did that before. Great both times.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time this great game has come to kindle. Stay away from it, if you don't have a lot of time to kill. It is highly addictive, but oh so much fun.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a great game. I wish after the time was up it would show you where hidden objects were located.  Just for my peace of mind  I have enjoyed it great job
B007ZTN07O|1.0|it doesn't work. I thought it could be a good work, but it didnt. I hope you can do something about it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My tablet was running dog slow. After spending fifteen minutes waiting for the app to install, in two clicks I was back up to my original speed. Thank you Ks Mobile!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|From the minute I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  I loved all the characters, the many twists and turns, the surprises, the humor, and I especially loved the way it made me think even long after I finished the last page.  I now have a new favorite author!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|A wonderful series that is fun to watch.  With all of the violent programs on tv and the ones simply filled with so much profanity that the plot gets lost, I enjoy many of the older programs.<br />This series has a lot of fun and silliness...but sometimes, that is just what I need...after watching the news of the day!!!
B00DEFW8YY|5.0|I love the clarity and balance between soloist and orchestra. A truly impassioned performance! This was a great surprise in the execution of these warhorses of the piano literature.
098478280X|5.0|Best book for doing the best for technical internship interviews. Strongly recommended. I got this book yo practice for my internship interview at Google and its really helped.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Product works as expected, perfect for casting YouTube videos and chrome tabs directly on the tv screen! Very good product !
B00CX7OX6U|5.0|I LOVED this movie for two main reasons. . . Javier Bardem's spanish monologue towards the end of the film and the cinematography throughout it. Malick is the master at capturing real life and still making it cinematic. Every bit of dialogue, every subtle facial expression, and every beautifully shot scene made this movie a masterpiece in my book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The love story even with all the problems they had seemed real.<br />The storyline keeps you wanting more and turning the pages
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy playing the game. Either on my computer or my kindel either way can't get enough of the game!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Awesome game. So much fun to play waiting for the dragons to hatch is the hardest part. But fun to play.
B00CFA227C|4.0|This movie could have easily been botched, but the producers, writers, and director pulled it off, making for a very entertaining, modernized telling of one of the most classic fairy tales. The person who deserves the most credit is whomever did the casting, because every character in this movie is full to the brim with wonderful personality and charisma - and that goes a long way. I really wanted the characters to succeed because I liked them so much. The subject matter is still a bit terrifying (as was the original fairy tale), so I believe many younger children may be horrified by the sight of these ghoulish giants feasting upon the bones of men, so use your judgment when deciding if your kids can handle this (it's rated PG-13 for a reason, and I personally feel 13 is the perfect age for this movie, maybe 12 or 11 for more mature children).<br /><br />What's really cool is that the story, while vastly elaborated upon (resulting in the two hour run time of the movie), remains true to original, as far as the core elements go. The writers did a nice job of taking the sparse elements of the fairy tale and tastefully enhancing it into a feature length film. The pacing is excellent, making for an entertaining, fun filled ride with plenty of humor and suspense. I also very much appreciated the care with which the fantasy world was created, especially the airborne realm of the giants. As far as the actual behemoths themselves, their CGI rendering is very well done, and their animations and facial expressions are very convincing.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is pretty much perfect, as far as I can tell, with vibrant colors, immaculate detail, and fantastic sound.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game<br />Love it always play it<br />Play it every day<br />You can use monuments<br />You should get this game
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|At last a podcast player that works as I hoped it would. I have tried several players for the Kindle Fire before and this is the first time I haven't been disappoint.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great example of the room escape/puzzle game style.  You are presented a mystery and a box for which the solution to this mystery is enclosed.  You find clues, in, on, and around the box.  With each level you get closer to the center of the box.  The game is very well executed and I've been enjoying playing it (on and off) for a couple weeks now so it's a nice addition to my game library.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great 3D graphics<br />Good story<br />Interesting puzzles - Good level of challenge without being impossible.<br />Automatic save points<br /><br />Cons:<br />Runs slow and crashes on a Kindle Fire (1st Gen), works well on my Fire HDX (though it did crash once but I was able to start again from the save points it automatically takes)<br /><br />Age: I'd recommend this for teenagers and up.  Some of the puzzle difficulty, intense music, and themes might not make younger children enjoy the app as much.
0470913029|4.0|Super easy description of the diet as well as the reasons behind it being the perfect diet. There is also a mostly interesting DVD on paleo called &#34;The Perfect Human Diet.&#34; Revealing scientific evidence. It's slow going if you're attempting to lose weight though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 3 year old has been having a blast playing this game and even my older kids ages 8 &amp; 11 love it.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Excellent !  Highly recommend! Celine is never disappointing. This definitely needs to be in your Celine Dion collection to round it off!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Fun to play with, but I can't figure out how to delete pictures. I still recommend it over the basic camera that comes in the kindle
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Of the dozens of discs these guys have put out, I own about 8 (so far) so I am far away from a self-proclaimed expert on their stuff.  Of what I own, and what I have listened to, this is my favorite.  (I try not to write a review with my feeble opinions right after I buy an album to prevent the &#34;newness factor&#34;.  I've been giving this heavy on and off play for about six weeks now.)  If you are a fan you already own this.  If you're not a fan, this one will fix that in short order.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As usual John tells the tale in wonderful detail and suspense. Jake, the consummate lawyer, I'd put him on my lifetime retainer! I'm sure his hair s now white, with all he's experienced! Loved every page!  Thank you John Grisham!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is an awesome app.  It sync my phone, tablet and computer and has all my list readily available!! I use it every day!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Game of thrones season one.<br />At first viewing I saw some of the actors as too old for their parts. People described as black haired being reddish brown. This bothered me for exactly one episode. I was carried away and living with each of them as I had in the books . I feel as if I know them even more intimately than I did before these are splendid renditions of George Martins books. I can not wait for the next seasons and his next book.
0553801473|5.0|This hardcover copy is very nice, I enjoyed it more than the paper back versions I had previously read.<br />And the books content overall is very, perhaps the best in the series so far to me.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Amazing app I could ever have its really great for kindle fire!!!!!! I LOVE THIS AND Y'ALL GOTTA BELIEVE ME
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The blocks in place that ask for payments are quite annoying.<br />The charges are very frustrating.  Game is fun, but locked after each section.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|A good film subject.  Acting is fair but handles subject matter rather well.  Good insight into our emotions and what makes us love
B001NLL93W|1.0|I didnt read this book yet; im still reading the first one.<br />But the first book is ok to read
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is challenging and fun. If you like candy crush and games like bubble blast, this is definitely for you. I like the many levels and being able to dress the progress of my Facebook friends add I go through each level. Tons of fun!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show. Starts out a little slow but as the season goes on it gets more interesting. You just won't believe the twist and turns the episodes take.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|It's an OEM waste toner replacement tray. It fits and it does what it's supposed to. What more can be said about it?
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Sometimes it causes u too much crashes and it doesn't have car damage and traffics and its hard to save money for a new car and too much storage well at least it's a good game
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was just a great movie!  Better than the previous episode.  Shipment was quick and the price was very good.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It is interesting how he weaves this story back and forth.  I like that the person who is the main character is narrating it instead of someone just telling the story.  There is suspense, laughs, love and sadness.  All combine to make this book one in which you hate to put it down.
B000002ETI|5.0|What's NOT to like about this guy?  He's only the greatest singer that ever lived.  Even the songs in Spanish transcend language.  He was born in Spain and sings the purest form of the language.  You name anyone, across the board, -- Sinatra, Williams, Martino, Humperdinck, Elvis, the blind guy, Steve Perry, Freddy Mercury, Mario Lanza, Tony Bennett, Bobby Darin, Dean Martin, Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Bryn Terfel;  nobody, but nobody even comes close to this guy.  Everyone else pales by comparison.  The Latin Legend lives.  Long live Julio Iglesias.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|I cannot say this strongly enough: this is one man's personal viewpoint of film history. It is NOT an historical, linear account. You'll need to look elsewhere for that. This will make any serious cinephiles choke. Move along...
B00003CXA2|5.0|Bought as a gift. Everyone should see this movie. I can't imagine that anyone could play Forrest better than Tom
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child's spooky preternatural detective returns with a vengeance. A fast moving frolic into the world of eugenics. Exactly what you expect from these authors - very satisfying.
B00008G8LM|5.0|Tom Hanks Rocks! Loved this movie and laughed as much the second time. Bought a second copy for my Grandson
B008JFUNHI|5.0|I've seen a lot of complaints that this movie didn't cover every scene, plot twist, character development, etc. in the book. It seems like many reviewers still don't understand just how different novels and movies are as creative media. For movies, time is precious - most movies have only around 2 hours to tell their story - whereas books generally don't face a hard limit on the page count. Moreover, movie are expensive to make whereas books are cheap (basically the author's living expenses and and market campaign).<br /><br />Looking at Ender's Game as a movie and not just as an adaptation of the book, it actually holds up very well. Asa Butterfield manages to subtly portray both a ruthless and compassionate side to Ender. The rest of the actors generally do a good job bringing their characters to life, which is no small accomplishment give that most of them are kids. Even though the kids are older than their counterparts in the book, they still look, feel, and act like kids. Ender's voice even cracks a bit, like a kid going through puberty. While Ender and Petra do have quite a few scenes together, I was very pleased to see that Hollywood didn't try to insert romance into their relationship.<br /><br />Gavin Hood, the director, obviously realized that he wasn't filming the book and the script makes some significant but smart changes. The arc of Ender's siblings - Peter and Valentine - is drastically curtailed (even in the book, it was only peripheral to the main plot). More importantly, Ender's character arc isn't quite as exhaustive or exhausted as in the book. I appreciate that Hood implicitly acknowledges that movie Ender hasn't been at Battle School nearly as long as book Ender and the movie doesn't try to cheat and shortcut that experience. Ender's arc feels appropriate for what we see in the movie and going further probably wouldn't have been possible in 2 hours.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, I was also impressed that they spent at least some time onthe denouement. Not since Lord of the Rings: Return of the King have I felt so glad that a movie took time to give its characters at least some room to experience the fallout of events. Again, it's not the book, but the the essentials of the store are there.<br /><br />That said, I kept finding myself frustrated that the movie wasn't longer than 2 hours. There were parts that felt rushed or condensed. The beginning in particular has an odd way of introducing Ender's universe to audiences, most of who are not familiar with the book. The first 10-15 minutes are probably more confusing as the movie really throws you into the story pretty quickly. I thought overall the movie was better paced as it progressed, but even later scenes could have used more time to simmer. If anything, I thought the movie included too much from the book and tried to cover too much ground at the risk of not developing the main plot sufficiently. Some important characters, such as Mazer Rackham, just don't leave much of an impression because we don't spend enough time with them.<br /><br />I almost got the sense that Gavin Hood was forced by the studio to do some last minute editing to shorten the film. I would have thought that Good could have convinced the studio to allow a longer movie given the popularity of the novel, but that extra half hour probably would mean at least one less showing per day in most cinemas. I can only hope we'll see an extended version on DVD.<br /><br />Overall, this is a well done, if condensed, version of the Ender's Game novel. It's probably much more faithful to the book than most movie adaptations of novels (certainly more so than say the Hobbit). If you go into the movie with an appreciation for the realities of filmmaking, I suspect most fans of the book will enjoy seeing their favorite characters come to life. Rating: 4.5 stars.
B00F0N7JUG|3.0|I really enjoyed this check your brain at the door action tribute to Japanese monster films like Gamera and Godzilla, however, the limited edition packaging isn't what I thought it would be based on the description.<br /><br />I thought the set included a statue but in fact the statue is a case, the discs are housed in the back and stacked on top of one another. I would have gone with the regular edition if I realised as I now need to purchase a case and photocopy a cover to store the discs in my collection to avoid damaging the discs in this packaging. Imagine the Dark Knight Rises and Tron Legacy limited edition packages but not super cool like those title's limited packages are. I'm wondering about the limited Man of Steel packaging now...
B000FC13Y0|5.0|There's an easy way to tell if you'll like this book. If you liked the movie Stardust, get it. If you like Neil Gaiman's writing style, with whimsical prose and vivid descriptions, get it.<br /><br />I was actually surprised how closely the 2007 movie followed the plot of this book. The biggest change is the ending, which I won't spoil. I do think the movie manages to provide a more satisfying arc of Tristran's character. And, of course, the memorable Captain Shakespeare was a creation of the movies and appears nowhere in the book (there is a pirate captain in the book, but he only has a brief scene).<br /><br />What the book does offer is rich, vivid language describing the world of Stardust. The Kindle and audiobook editions also contain a short story which Gaiman wrote as a prologue to a Stardust prequel but never finished. Even better, the audiobook is read by Gaiman himself, who reads with a wonderfully charming, sweet voice. Gaiman also provides a short introduction and an interview with Audible about his work.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I got some hooked  on this game as soon as I started playing it and I am not a gamer!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|AWESOME....JUST AWESOME!!!  Being a fan of the series, it is a must watch.  For the people they have seen the original anime it is basically the same so far in HD and with a slightly different story at the end.  I can't wait until all of the other ones come out in English
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Simple addictive game that is finally on Kindle.  My wife has been playing this on her ipad for awhile and now I can try to catch up.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am impressed by the performance over my wifi network.  I have tried the chromecast browser extension on both my chromebook and macbook.  Some services like youtube, hulu plus and netflix offer direct support that is high quality.  I have tried youtube and could see the difference. (I don't have netflix or hulu plus at this time.)  I have also tried casting a full screen browser window of an Amazon Prime video. Amazon Prime videos streaming doesn't directly support the chromecast (yet), but the chromecast browser plugin works well.  The color is a bit different and there is some latency between my computer's screen and the chromecast.  But the quality is still decent and I have seen no stuttering.  If and when amazon prime offers native support for the chromecast, I am sure it will be much better.  One limitation to be aware of is that audio from video sources that require plugins like silverlight does not come through.  So far this is not a big deal for me.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|How can we go about our lives as if nothing has happened? This story explores the way we all do that? It touched me in the most profound way. I actually understand the keeping of secrets. The feeling if hatred that almost feels delicious.<br /><br />The characters in this story are believable, endearing, and real. Read this book if you read no other this year!
B009T8XBBO|1.0|On my PC I have this game installed and I loved it... however I purchased it for my kindle and it won't install... just gives me a message that says cannot install... I am very disappointed that I purchased this app and cannot install it... I don't recommend it to anyone
B00F031X62|4.0|This is a very good show of Jimi's, from Spring 1968, that was professionally recorded by Jimi's Engineer, Eddie Kramer, and mixed for this CD by Kramer. Why we had to wait 45 years for this to be released is anyone's guess-- clocking in at about 60 minutes  this would have fit on a single LP. The sound is superior, comparing with \\"Band of Gypsies\\". The performance is solid if not inspired, there's a few technical and mike problems.<br /><br />Although this is mixed as sounding like a single show, it actually contains all songs performed in the 1st *and* 2nd shows that day. The two \\"bonus\\" tracks were those numbers repeated in both sets. Why the record company couldn't have left them in their original running order is beyond me.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|Unfortunately, didn't get a chance to play this game very long. It made my Kindle Fire H.D. 2nd gen get really hot so I uninstalled immediately. This game is probably best played on tabs that can more readily accomodate the intense graphic load for prolonged periods of time. Still looked beautiful on my Kindle!
B0042JSMV4|5.0|I have had this book for less than a week, and it's already my &#34;go to&#34; book for border ideas. Each of the 150 borders provides detailed instructions for handling the corners. I am making crocheted facecloths for holiday gift baskets, and I have managed to find twelve different, beautiful and appropriate borders in this single book. Each corner has been turned perfectly. The instructions are provided both in written and charted form, and there are clear line drawings and photographs for each border. Any special stitches are described at the beginning of each piece.<br /><br />If you're searching for borders, whatever your application, pick up this book first.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have always been a Star Trek fan. My father and mother were huge science fiction fans, and I was hooked at an early age. I love the updated story line and characters. The action is great and the story is certainly interesting. This is just the beginning for this series, and I would recommend this film if you like sci-fi.
B00F031WB8|5.0|Awesome loved every minute of it !!!! Hardcore Hendrix fans this is a must have you will not be disapointed.
B005LAII3A|3.0|I liked the updated story line, and the special effects were cool. However, I was not really interested in the film from beginning to end. The film lost my interest several times, and it could have benefited from new material. I don't know why they keep re-making movies. Where's the originality?
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Awesome movies. They don't make action movies like this anymore. Mel Gibson does an outstanding job playing the lunatic cop and Glover is your typical family man. Except they always run into trouble.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|This is one of the great rock bands of all time. I believe that this was probably the most universally accepted albums the band made. The music tells a story from beginning to end, and it requires the listener to listen to the whole record.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I found this in the app store!  fantastic!  I have so much room for things I want.  also alerted me. when to delete files or other. things.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves the film.<br /> I enjoy it as well and watch with her.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I'd like to see how women in Downton Abbey evolves with current economic and social issues with hands on attitude rather than taking the back seats and enjoying high society life style. Be realistic with dealing the household finance and daily chores.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|SOME SAY THAT Martinez is over taking Grisham, not a chance real page turner stayed up late to finish this master piece
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. Original plot and the characters seem alive. Many times throughout the series I laughed out loud, cried and gasped. I never read books twice, but I think I will read this one again and recommend to my children when they are teens. It is violent, however.
B00E9E4EC8|3.0|Glad he did a bluegrass project.  I would quibble a little with the producer.  Instruments too far in the background.<br />Bluegrass is a team sport.  Too many slow tempos to be a favorite listened to again and again.
B00846F1YW|4.0|If you're looking for something to fill time with just a touch of challenge, this would be a game for you. It would be nice if they had the player try solve the mystery (which is not very well written but I suppose that is not the purpose of game ;). Overall enjoyable for the several hours of play.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down. I read it every opportunity I had. Amazing, definitely amazing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've played it on Facebook and love it there so I know I will love having it on my Kindle so I can play more often.
B00FOF8W8I|5.0|This wonderful short story is about a couple who meet after 45 years and come together for a date. Their story is sensitively told with all the worries you would expect from such an unexpected reunion with rose-tinted memories, mixing with the harsh reality of old age.<br /><br />The story is well-written with a good mix of humour and sensitivity. The characters are very believable. Totally enjoyable.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|There has never been anything like Bond. Since the character was created in 1953.<br />Bond fans watch over & over, it's on all the time!<br />Anyway, Skyfall is great! A little different than<br />the action packed Quantum of Solace, my favorite<br />of the Craig films. But for actual diehard Bond fans.<br />It's excellent.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|great movie, gently used - one part where it skips but overall great value.gently used but quality meets medium expectations
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|this is an amazing show. I JUST caught onto the walking dead and boy how lame am I, I have been missing so much how did that happen. I just started when season 4 got started and l love it. I know it's about zombies and fighting but this isn't cheesy at all, lots of action and gore and I love it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|If only Zynga came up with the regular Castleville for mobile devices it would be awesome. No Castleville for mobile devices but this will do the trick.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|amazing! I have been missing a good show since breaking bad went off the air and this has really filled my time up. I got the first season from iTunes and I have to say I love it. While I am a horror fan I am not a zombie movie fan but this show has totally renewed my interest, and I love it. All I can say is watch it and prepare to be pleasantly surprised!
B000XUBFE2|3.0|This unusual story kept me reading. I have mixed feelings as to how to rate it.  Very different and compelling story.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|A little more complicated than the other big fish games.  Actually scared me a few times too!  Good stuff, worth the small fee.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am always on my Kindle playing this game.  I love the touch screen abilities, makes it so easy to move the cards.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A wonderful book for all dog lovers who believe their dog is a little bit human. I Couldn't put it down .
B00G32OER4|5.0|I haven't seen a good scary movie in a long time. I heard good things about this movie, and thought I'd give it a shot. Perfect movie for a date night if you want your partner to snuggle up to you. :)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works flawlessly. With more support it would have got a 5.<br />Wish it would just work with windows media player.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun app for my Kindle fire......pictures are lovely and user interface is great. Have not purchased any new puzzles yet but will probably do so. Enjoy all you jigsaw addicts!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is brilliant.  I read it twice and enjoyed it more the second time. I think I'll read it again.
006202406X|1.0|I wish I would have never read the final book in this series. I would have preferred to just imagine the ending. The switching viewpoints was also unsatisfactory. This was a very gimmicky book.
B00DPUB56U|4.0|When I say fangless your not gonna get the Hammer Productions 3 inch fangs from their days of glory of good vampire movies. What you will get{if you have a cup off coffee cause the 1st hr is a tad slow)is a 1st class,well acted,stylish vampire movie that gets better and better as the movie goes along. The 1st 45 mins to a hr, explain how mother and daughter became vampires and how they survive in the modern times(mom is a prostitute). After that it picks up...I won't spoil it..if your a vampire fan..I AM..then rent this one,you won't be sorry.A real good movie.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a simple but very fun game.  Controls are easy to learn.  And the tutorials are very helpful. Just too short. Needs more levels.
B00A3T5CGU|4.0|I've loaded this app onto my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 GTP-5100 and Galaxy Note. Once installed, you have the option of downloading maps for any country you plan to visit. I've loaded all of the maps of the 50 states of the U.S. and all of Europe. Make sure you have a decent size SD card, if your device takes one. My maps take up over 6 Gb of space on each of my devices. If you have a cap on your data, you will probably want to download the maps over a Wifi signal. I'm not sure how useful this app would be if your phone or tablet was not GPS equipped. On my phone and tablet it works very well.
B00991TCOG|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this. She has pure talent. I mean this one girl can dance and play the violin on top of it all, she has every single song beautifully played perfectly. I can't wait to hear from her more.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I love this book based on a true story about what went on in the city of Jackson, Mississippi. The movie is an instant classic The pie story is hilarious.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|Well, this album has not disappointed at all. I love it, completely. They have a more grown up sound, but don't be mistaken, they still send the same message. I love the new sound. So, all in all, it's awesome.
B00E9A656K|1.0|Just drag racing....wahoo. I bought this thinking it would be a course racing game and was quite disappointed that it was not. When did the cars involved become known as drag racers?
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|While this app is fun to play, you have to earn....err buy these star thingies to unlock different characters, levels, or to even move between levels.  Game is fun like I said, but it fizzles out after a while....  Temple run 2 is more fun.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game but wish you could accept all of your gifts and it save them.  I did this a time or two before I realized it cleared them but didn't give them to me later.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|Excellent character development, sensational story, borderline main plot.  Mainly a coming-of-age novel about identical twins and their external relationships.  Don't miss this one if you like to love your \\"characters.\\"
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Mundane, not very exciting, This would be good if you had nothing to do and needed to spend some time waiting.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is the best. I absolutely love my little pony stuff but I wish that they start with Rainbow Dash she is awesome.
B00CN3U8TA|1.0|Thor has always been  a character I felt a deep connection to. My mother was an avid genealogist tracing our lineage back to Scotland where the Thor mythology began. Bringing this even closer to home, my dad only had one working eye and thus wore an eye patch. He lost his eye in a bonnet hair dryer fire at the beauty salon my mom worked at while they were dating. Although his Afro was too wet when he put it inside, the faulty circuitry was too blame for the fire. His settlement with the insurance company allowed him to start his own Rent-A-Center store next to my mom's beauty salon. After my younger brother was born our parents were married.<br />I was grateful for the healthy and normal childhood my brother and I had together. Often times, we would go in the back yard to fight a giant sea monster like Thor and Loki did for a few minutes, then spend hours brushing one another's hair. I wanted to be pretty like Thor. It was a charmed life, but all things must come to an end. Brother had turned to a different life by his sixteenth birthday and ran off with an old mariner from Poland he met online for an \\"exciting life at sea.\\"<br />I haven't seen him since.<br />Although, I would of preferred the Thor design from the better television movie with the Hulk, Daredevil and Thor in it, this version is sufficient for my needs as for why I purchased it. I do feel that the face is a little too shiny like the actor uses excessive product.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Great app is a really good app. This app is good for taking pictures. You can also take very very good video taking app
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|After a brief thought and trial of demo version, I finally Bought it for 99 Cents. And I think its a very good investment. Works flawlessly .Perfect thing for me. It allows you to transfer data between any wifi compatible device without need of internet. This was exact thing I was looking for. Moreover,It has a fantastic Graphical user Interface, both on my galaxy S4 and on my Laptop PC. Definitely go for it.<br />Thanks a lot to Developer.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Customer service is great but there are so many issues. I've had to restart 3 times. there was another upgrade this morning and now the game is stuck in a loop making it unable to play.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|i greatly enjoy this game. it's one of the better fighting games for tablets. of course it comes with some problems. signing the game on to Facebook is impossible. plus having only 5 bouts every 1 hour and 15 minutes can really be a bore. fix those, and the game will be perfect.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Challenging enough to be interesting but enough clues to keep going.  Some of puzzles will take some time. Good for puzzle lover's.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|I loved this book and I loved it because it was dramatic, it made you want to turn the next page and read on, not skim the book and not read it. I recommend this book to anyone 9-12. It started out as a poor girl then she transformed into a star! She had fights and doubts but every time you turn the page you find an exciting motive to make anyone wanna keep going! But don't keep my word for it ask anyone else who read the book and when you finally think you're ready read it for yourself. By the way this is my first review because I hardly ever review books so that means this is an awesome book!!! CYA!!! AND READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!
1881273156|5.0|A fabulous easy read...learn about yourself, your own childhood, your friends and family.  A book to make all relationships more honest and more loving.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|I've read Pride and Prejudice way too many times....just read Sense and Sensibility AGAIN, so I thought I would revisit Persuasion, which I've only read once, many years ago.  It must be said that Anne Elliot is not Elizabeth Bennet.  She's sweet and compliant, and so not quite as compelling and &#34;modern&#34; as the liveliness and assertiveness of Elizabeth.  But I really enjoyed Persuasion this time around.  All the better that I couldn't remember most of the plot!  It was almost like having a brand new Jane Austen book to read.  Persuasion really is one of her best.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|I'm a big fan of Gladwell's writing and was looking forward to his latest release. Interesting concept beginning with the age old biblical story but as I read further it was disjointed and the theme of underdogs didn't seem to flow well throughout remainder of book. When I got to final chapters they didn't seem to tie back to original intent and left me wanting a few more chapters to bring the theme back to relevance. I continue to refer back to his earlier writings for use as examples in current context of similar situations I've come across, however it's doubtful I'll return to this tome in the future.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works very nice for my Kindle books, but haven't figured out how to (or if it's even possible) to have the computer read it like it did on my Kindle Keyboard.  Doesn't come up often, but I've kind of wished I had it available a couple of times.  That's the only drawback I see.<br /><br />It is very easy to navigate, and easy to put items on or take item off your device.  Actually, it's easier than with my old Kindle!  Easy to download your books from the cloud.  Easy, easy, easy!<br /><br />Love it!
B00E3QJ7ZG|5.0|Finally a beautiful copy of this movie wonderful transfer! Highly recommended. I classic movie that it should be in everyone's collection
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|It is not only beautifully written but it gets to the core of you. One of the loveliest books I have read in my lifetime.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|A great movie and the bonus scenes are very very good for the plot. I'm Must have. But in the future I'm sure there will be a box set, but you have to have this one now.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Excellent portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, who was diagnosed with Altzheimer's disease late in life.  All the classic symptoms were displayed.  It was also a very good love story.
0891419063|5.0|This is an excellent true story of a man who lived and survived hell. It's a story which will inspire and fill with appreciation the sacrifices of the men who served in the Pacific war theater.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a really fun game I just can't stop playing it and it is not a waste of money this game seems perfect for everyone
B00005UKKF|3.0|A bit unfair to rate a disc a decade old but Britney puts on a good show but the omly song I really liked was I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.<br />However, a Las Vegas act is a Las Vegas act and worth seeing.<br /><br />Stan Chun<br />Wellington<br />New Zealand
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have an addition for this game. When I finish one I am excited to see what is next. Awesome!
B005Y9B5UG|3.0|This is the first time I have bought a Shakira disc.<br />It was enjoyable and she writhed like a snake thru the show.<br />I think younger persons would give a higher rating but I am an old Joni James fan that prefers quieter and more sentimental music.<br />Good to watch Shakira as she has great abs no doubt from all the writhing..!!<br /><br />Stan Chun<br />Wellington<br />New Zealand
B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|My two 6 year olds and 4 y/o loves this app. I downloaded it 2 or 3 days ago and this is the app they go to most out of all of them.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Finally, the Grisham I love!  Good characters and plot. WOULD like to read more about Jake and crew.  Maybe more about his family too
B00005JPCF|4.0|A good movie. This is a movie I think you will have fun watching in a family setting.. It has an environmental message as well. In my opinion, the music wasn't great, but it was enjoyable. If you liked. Happy Feet 2, you should like this movie too.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use the app on my iPhone and I have now downloaded it to my Kindle Fire. I like the fact that I can get a quick summary of the forecast for any location. This is particularly helpful for me when planning trips on my motorcycle. I don't care for all of the ads which can slow it down when used on my iPhone, but the information provided is worth the wait.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|We have been watching this series for sometime now.  We enjoy the characters and look forward to their next adventure.  The DVD set will allow us to watch any show at any time.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I loved this game! I was lost in it for days. The puzzles were great and the graphics are stunning. All the little details, like the falling leaves were great touches. Now I am off to find another adventure, maybe a Crimson Manor?
B005O64VH8|5.0|Another stunning album from Secret Garden.  Three songs have vocals and Christmas lyrics, and while the other tracks are instrumental, they could be absorbed as non-Christmas in scope, but yet are very pretty and beautifully written and performed. Very moving, tender, and emotional, and one of the best Christmas CD's in my music library! Splendid!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great app! Love the super fast updates. This is my primary email account so it is fitting. So far it's awesome.
B005ISZRES|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I had to read it for school, and I didn't have both  parts. Getting the whole thing on my kindle fire was awesome! I could make notes, highlight, and have words explained and translated.<br />I would recommend this book for everyone. Best of all, it was free! Way worth it getting it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|A page turner with great insights into early slavery. Some of the story lines seemed like a stretch, but overall I loved it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is fast. I never have trouble opening it. Getting all the coins is fun and having it go faster and faster each time is exilurating.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Downloaded the game to try out, no major disappointment s so far. No game freezes so far and gameplay is smooth, the in game help and recommendations are ok. Like the fact that I can play offline too. Try it out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|best game ever I play it on my phone all the time but I wanted it on my kindle yay I lobe this game
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a true Battle of the Wits!  It's a truly challenging game and gives a sense of accomplishment.  I have spent many enjoyable hours with Quell.  I highly recommend the Thinking game Quell for all those who like to solve puzzles and have fun doing so!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Back with insane play on words and that fire on the mic. Just plainly showing why he is legendary. Buy it!!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|There is not a single character in this book that is anything but flat, and the \\"instant friendships\\" between the main character and the people he meets are more then just a little unbelievable. This tags like a novel<br /><br /> written in a short period of time by an author that had no desire to revise or attempt to make things realistic. For example: at one point the main character finds a leopard cub in the woods and takes it home. Then he spends 0 time feeding it, carrying for it, getting it a baby sitter when he's of on adventures...the thing basically exists to lick his face and hands occasionally.  Similarly there are at least three other characters that only seem to exist to be friends and cheerleaders for the main character. Strangely, the most well rounded and believable character in this book is the evil Prince...the father I got into this book, the more I continued to roll my eyes.
