B000005H4H|5.0|This album was pretty much just a follow up to the previous year's \\"Empyrean Island\\" album that received warm reviews and sales. The only thing different with this album is the addition of George Coleman on Tenor Sax, which might have made the \\"Maiden Voyage\\" album more acceptable. Outside of George Coleman who is playing his buns off! The same goes for Freddie Hubbard, Ron Carter, Tony Williams, and of course our main man Herbie Hancock who all came together to do what they do best...And did they deliver! Not only a Top Selling album, but this album has since become a permanent staple in the Blue Note catalog! Key cuts: \\"Maiden Voyage\\", \\"The Eye Of The Hurricane\\" and \\"Dolphin Dance\\". Oh!, and for you first-timers this album is straight-ahead-jazz! To zoom in on Herbie Hancock's finger snappin' tracks from his Blue Note era you might want to buy the Compact Disc entitled \\"Cantaloupe Island-The Best Of Herbie Hancock\\". This collection focuses on his most memorable Blue Note recordings like: \\"Maiden Voyage\\", \\"Watermelon Man\\", and of course \\"Cantaloupe Island\\" along with 3 (Three) others, but if you are a Jazz Purist....This is a must have!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|A terrific, satirical commentary on the mindset of \\"The Bomb\\" in the early 1960's.  (A satiric answer to \\"Fail Safe\\" which was a deadly serious book & movie).I lived thru this time and this is a dead-on satire.  Peter Sellers is fantastic!! One of my favorite movies of all time.
0553284347|5.0|I just started reading this book...I just got done with the Introduction and I am like 'how did she know I was feeling this way'.  I hope that this book helps me on my journey to not only fogive my parent for the emotional trauma but also to let go of the hurt that was caused and is still with me today. Im so glad that I found this book thanks to:[...]
B001AQT11M|5.0|Watching the movies of my childhood beats most of the movies I see today.  Snow White was one that lasts forever in my memory as one that I can watch over and over again, and I'm sure not afraid to let the young ones watch them either as the content is wholesome.
B002UD56HW|5.0|I watch my PSP Umd of THIS IS IT everyday while on the treadmill at the gym and it never gets old.  It was a great buy!
B00004XPPE|5.0|A very somber, dark movie which captured the mood of the time with regard to a nuclear holocost.  America was very frightened that nuclear war was a real possiblity which was reflected in many of the movies and books of the time.
B002MXA7TC|5.0|This album is outstanding. I caught the song Sweet Disposition on 500 Hundred Days of Summer movie and had to find the cd. The album is amazing and Temper Trap did a hell of a job on it. Conditions offer very catchy songs to mellow ones. Stand out tracks are, Sweet Disposition, Fader, Down River, Ressurection, and Science of Fear. Buy it!
0743496736|5.0|Picoult brings to her readers a very real imagery of a bullying that triggers off a mass killing at an American High School. Bullies degrade Peter's dignity from his very first day at school.  This continues throughout his school years and stretches the very fabric of his being to breaking point.  The ending has a twist in the tale that is both unforeseen and earth shattering.  A brilliant play titled \\"The Laramie Project\\" was written on the Wyoming killing of gay Michael Shephard.  I would love to see \\"19 Minutes\\" brought to the screen and be compulsory viewing for all high school kids.  If it could make just one bully reflect soberly on his / her doings it would have done its job - if it could save a couple of lives out there it would have surpassed it.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I have already bought 2 sets of this green colored boxset, and returned both of them.    The shiny silver TNG 1-7 season set, is the only REAL OFFICIAL set. So are the individual shiny silver seasons boxes.    This green set absolutely reeks of Chinese knock off! The trays the discs are in are made of a brittle, green, cheap, plastic that pretty much disintegrates when touched or moved, and if tilted upright, most of the discs just fall out onto the ground. Both sets were missing the fold out printed card that is supposed to have the episode list... I have NEVER EVER seen a set of DVDs this badly packaged, EVER!    Personally, I wouldn't even pay $25 for this set.     I absolutely love Star Trek The Next Generation, and this box set does it a great dishonor!    I have tried playing it in the following players: 3 various DVD players and 1 upconverting DVD player, a PS2, an HP Laptop, and a high end gaming computer. The discs have NO scratches and the DVD players were all cleaned or new.     ...    In the 3 standard DVD players, NONE of the discs were able to play! Even after cleaning the lasers... They didnt even know there was a disc in the tray, they just said (NO DISC)... In the brand new upconverting phillips DVD player, the episodes would mostly play, but still would freeze up, skip, or stutter about half way through, though much less than the others. In the PS2, the discs were not recognized and didn't even show up. In the laptop, the discs would play for the most part until a short way into the episodes it would start freezing up, stuttering, or just stop responding all together! In the high end gaming computer, with top of the line Blu-ray and DVD drives, and vista x64, the discs would play all the way through on MOST episodes, but there was still obvious freezing and skipping enough to become annoying, also, a large amount of pixelation could be seen.    In my experience... When the above happens... It is a Knockoff/Bootleg/Chinese impostor.     Maybe this green set was once official and all well and good, but now it has an impostor.    So stick to the individual seasons or the shiny silver, individually packaged 1-7 series set.
B00127RAJY|5.0|30 days of Jillian Michael's 30-Day Shred later I'm reporting results.<br /><br />For the record, I did not follow any sort of diet or dieting rules and didn't go to her website. If I wanted something I pretty much ate or nibbled or shared it, including a small Blizzard and some boneless buffalo wings. Of course, on the flip side I often ate low-fat yogurt, oatmeal or Cheerios for supper or lunch. But that was because that's what I wanted at the time. Also, I didn't follow any other exercise program or add additional workouts to Shred. Any \\"success\\" is likely from doing Shred alone.<br /><br />Shred kicked my booty on several different levels. An exercise buddy and I committed to doing it all 30 days with each of the three levels lasting ten days. We just methodically did them and when it was time to move on, we did, whether we were afraid or ready or whatever.<br /><br />My buddy didn't do all the days so I'm just going to report my results. I lost 2 inches off my hips, 2 inches off my waist and an inch from my chest. Not only did the tape measure report that, I feel it in my clothes. Now. As I've discussed this with others and we laughed about Jillian's level 3 comment \\"You should be seeing that six-pack right about now.\\" we've decided that under the \\"bubble wrap\\" I've got hanging around, that there is definite change and toning in those abdominal muscles. I can feel them move. My core is much stronger and the moves have gotten easier to do. Definition and strength clearly happened in my arms, legs and behind as well.<br /><br />Overall I lost 3.3 pounds. Not significant, but not awful either. I'm not trying to break weight loss speed records, just get in better shape and working on becoming healthier. So I'm very pleased with that for 30 days of 20 minute work-outs.<br /><br />Now. Here's the nitty gritty.<br /><br />I hated listening to Jillian's explanation every day. You can't cut to the chase, you have to go through her 2-3 minute intro. Annoying. Sometimes the comments got a little annoying as well. The visual was nice because the camera hit mostly full body and traveled from the high-intensity model to the lower-intensity model during each move while Jillian explained what was going on and why. I loved that Jillian explained why some exercises were Level 3 and how they worked the muscles, and what was being accomplished etc. The music was a little annoying, too, but I was able to ignore it most of the time. I would've liked to see some different cool-downs because the warm-ups were different for each level.<br /><br />Many of the exercises are high intensity and I felt a lot of them in my knees both during and after. Level 3 is really high intensity with plyometrics (explosive movements, i.e. jumping) like jump squats, rock stars, sumo squats, jumping jacks with weights, mountain climbers, jumping lunges. In the 10 days we did this level I was not able to do the entire session at the higher level intensity. My body got used to it and my knees aren't barking anymore but be warned. I had a shoulder that yelled at me the first few days I did Level 1 but it hasn't bothered me since. I really felt the squats and other intense moves in my rear-end. So much so that the only relief I got in Day 3 of Level 3 was to do Shred for the day. The ab workouts were mostly painful and did their job, covering every stinking muscle (according to my complaining abs anyway).<br /><br />I loved, loved, loved that this is an intense 20 minute workout and it's a keeper. I can always put in 20 minutes. No excuses. I am going to give Jillian's Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism DVD a shot. It's 40 minutes and I'd like to see the difference in results.visual was nice because the camera hit mostly full body and traveled from the high-intensity model to the lower-intensity model during each move while Jillian explained what was going on and why.

0307588335|5.0|This book was very interesting. It was easy to understand even to those who have little knowledge of investment banking and general economics. McDonald uses his insider point of view and humor to illustrate how Lehman Brothers set itself up for failure and how it could have been prevented.
1596912863|4.0|Shannon Hale's AUSTENLAND is a light, entertaining look at a modern woman's experiences with Regency life in England, and I enjoyed it as that: a fun story. Did it change my life? No. But I didn't expect it to realign my thinking or shake up my world. At less than 200 pages, we go on a journey with Jane and watch as she unravels the mistakes she's made in the past in order to jump more fully into the future. Some of that requires letting go -- a tough lesson for anyone. And I was right there with her.<br /><br />AUSTENLAND appealed to me in the same way that Laurie Viera Rigler's contemporary Jane Austen tales do -- Hale's story is a fresh take on classic themes and characters, and a glimpse into a modern woman's confusion and befuddlement with the traditions of the past. As someone who clearly loves her Austen, when haven't I fantasized about donning a gorgeous gown of fine silk and arriving on the arm of a handsome Brit at an elegant ball? (Answer: pretty frequently.)<br /><br />Austen purists might scoff at the light examination of themes and contrivances in her books -- and wonder if Hale is spending too much time looking at Regency England with modern eyes, something which really can't be done. But if you're someone who's fantasized about your own Darcy and wonder what it would be like to wander through an English garden with a gentleman while wholly unescorted (gasp!), AUSTENLAND might just be your book.
1592289444|5.0|The book is captivating immediately.  There is much sadness.  I wanted to continue reading because the journey was so amply told, I was there with the travelers.  I could not put the book down.  It is a quick read.
B000QUCNOU|5.0|I saw this movie once and it scared me.  I don't scare easily.  Excellent job by Robert Downey Jr.!  Just a bit long, but for the price worth owning.  Leaves you asking \\"Was He The Zodiac?\\"
B001AVCFK6|4.0|In all honesty ,I was never much of a star trek fan.. every once in a while I may turn it on and watch a few minutes.. but my son and hubby rented it and I sat down to a movie I shockingly enjoyed.. Graphics were nice,storyline was decent, action was good.. just a nice balanced movie.. Id think most would enjoy this film.. I did and believe me, Im suprised lol.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|This movie is great it kept me glued to the tv the entire movie. That doesn't happen very much any more, because most of the movies made now are just plain stupid. Just look at half of the movies up for best picture Oscars. Just a very good, and entertaining movie.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Movie Review:<br />I'm not sure what it is about zombie movies but since I was young I've always enjoyed them.  Good or bad I'd watch them all.  Zombieland however, is actually a very good one.  Falling into the same comedic zombie genre as \\"Shawn of the Dead\\", Zombieland delivers plenty of the gore we expect while perfectly timing bellies of laughter.  This is an easy recommendation.<br /><br />Blu-ray Review:<br />The Zombieland Blu-ray is sure to please all who buy it.  It offers a near reference quality 1080p picture and has a wonderful balanced DTS-HD MA audio soundtrack.  The disk also contains a hefty dose of special features to complete the deal.  As far as Blu-ray's go, Zombieland stands towards the top making it a must have for any collection.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a fine rendition of this classic British story, well produced and directed, outstandingly well played.  It is at once an engaging social drama and a fascinating glimpse of English society at the time.  That is because the production is true to the original story and its historical context.  It's amazing and refreshing to see a superb production and a gripping story presented without reliance on cheap thrills:  no violence, no crudity, no nudity, no shouting, nothing criminal.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|I was surprised when this product arrived from Argentina! I'm studying globalization in my college political science classes, so this little fact amused me!  And now I have amazing stamps to prove it.  The CD arrived well before the estimated arrival date, and was in pristine condition.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I have listened to the Celtic Woman for about 3 years and I will say they have done it again.   To me they have the prettiest voices on this planet.  And the songs are very different, but they sound so, so amazing.  Speaking of amazing, \\"Amazing Grace\\", you will never ever here a better arrangement in this world.  And when I here anyone say Mariah Carrey's \\"When You Believe\\", I say its Chloe's now.  So if you like Celtic Woman, you really, really need to get this cd.
0743497465|5.0|Great plot that moves super fast and furious.  I honestly don't know why this one has not been adapted to a screen play, it is great ride!
B000784WMW|1.0|I bought Jane Eyre at the Amazon Marketplace from importcds. The item was defective. I emailed importcds and got no response.  I had to go through Amazon to ask for a refund and Amazon gave me one.  I bought the product a second time and this time from Amazon.  I love this show and I hope the second go around is not defective.  Amazon did the right thing issuing me a refund. I will continue to order from Amazon since they offered good customer service.
B001NESPHC|5.0|So I'm watching CBS Sunday Morning, and there's this incredible story about Melody Gardot.  Then they switched to her singing.  I have never rushed to Amazon faster in my life to make a purchase!  It was well worth it.  Melody has a way of reaching into your soul that few artists can.  This album is catchy, fun, soothing, and uplifting all at the same time.  I also puchased Worrisome Heart and enjoy that album just as much as My One and Only Thrill.
0312944926|3.0|After reading \\"The Davinci Code\\", \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"Deception Point\\", I felt this book did not keep the same frantic pace at the beginning.  But, it did pick up and once again Dan Brown pulled off a fun read.  Brown's books definitely have a common formula but I don't think it detracts from the plot.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|It was a great movie. Gerard Butler played Clyde Shelton with a passion that makes you believe in him and actually understand where he is coming from. People grieve in different ways and his way was to kill everybody that did not do \\"justice\\" to his wife and childs case. Shelton was a wonderfully planned out character and so were the others. The movie was an edge-of-the-seat thriller until the ending. He used methodical process throughout the whole movie and then all of a sudden he does not see this coming? Are you serious? This man thought out a damn-near perfect plan and then all of a sudden he just does not see them going to this place and finding him? The ending was very dissapointing almost to the fact that it brought down the whole movie. He could have been entered in with the likes of Saw and Hannibal Lecter. But the ending sucked. Badly done. Try that one again.
B00005S6K8|1.0|I don't see how anyone can enjoy this movie.  Harrison Ford is essential lifeless.  Well, a corpse might act a bit better.  And Julia Ormond looks like she is in a trance the whole time.  Now, I would submit that Humphrey Bogart was also unappealing to me in the original, but at least Audrey Hepburn could carry the film.  No such luck here.  I could not have been more disappointed.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|If you're old enough, you can't help but think Lady Gaga's style and sound is sort of like a reincarnation/update of the 1984/1985 Madonna, and that's a great thing !!!!!! . Both were/are incredibly original !!!                           eric alver
0517548232|5.0|If everyone simply read and understood this book, we'd be so much better off. Hazlitt explains economics in a way that anyone can understand, and I honestly have no idea what the 1-star reviewers are thinking. Hazlitt demolished Keynesianism in [[ASIN:1933550112 The Failure of the New Economics]], so read that if you want to know why this book doesn't follow Keynes' teachings.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is one of the most even handed reveiws of this topic I've read.  Ms. Skloot's style is in the best narrative tradition.  I literally hated to put the book down.  It provides good insights into the poor relations that the biomedical industry has particularly with the African-American community and the tragedy that a loose attitude toward patient confidentiality and wishes can have.  Yet her book is very even handed in discussing the damage that would occur if subject rights were asserted to the maximum.  I take from this that it is high time that the research community address this in a proactive manner and develop a binding policy and statutory framework that makes clear the ground rules.  I thank her for sharing such a powerful and touching story with all of us.    Dr. Timothy Drevyanko, MD, MS
B000000WG4|5.0|Ages ago, I heard of \\"Tubular Bells\\".  I even owned the music-video piece for the Commodore 64.  I had no idea what it was at the time.<br />Fast forward 20+ years and I discover this album.  AMAZING.<br />It's so fun to listen to - the light wonderful musical tones building up and simmering down - the creepy-cool spoken bits introducing the instruments \\"plus! Tubular, BELLS!\\" - the incredibly emotive gutteral screams of part two.  It's awesome.  It's like an audio movie for your ears.  I love it.  I love listening to this from start to finish - it's seamless.  It's hard to explain - listen for yourself!!!!
B000YAA68C|5.0|I think this movie was fantastic.  And the story itself is brilliant (kudos Ms Ahern). It is about a woman dealing with the death of her beloved husband.  However, she deals with it in a unique way...via letters from him.  The charm and mystery of the movie is watching her heal, move on, and wondering how she is getting the letters.  Hillary Swank and Gerard Butler are terrific.  I would also highly recommend buying the book.  There is more detail and some differences.....even better than the movie and I gave the movie five stars!
B000005DQR|5.0|I was looking for something - instrumental - to listen to while working and came across this album.<br /><br />INCREDIBLE.<br /><br />At first, I didn't know what to make of it - I had no idea who \\"DJ Shadow\\" was or what year this album was made.  If you had asked me then, I would have guessed the late 70s to early 80s.<br /><br />The \\"songs\\" are a mix of sampled tracks and speeches and lyrics from all other kinds of audio forms: TV, music, interviews, stories.  It's all put together to create music and songs that are hard to describe.  Sort of a retro-funk I guess.  It's wicked cool, though.  As an album, each song works perfectly with the song preceeding/proceeding it.  The \\"lyrics\\", if you can call them that - the \\"spoken parts\\" are all cool and creepy!  It really makes me wonder who these people were and where that original bit of audio came from.  It really adds to the deep vibe you get listening to this.  I've never heard anything else by DJ Shadow but I am hooked after hearing this gem.  One of my favorite albums now.
0385528752|5.0|I recently decided to start an online business, but so overwhelmed by everything from having my friends tell me I was wasting my time to having to learn how to set up an online shopping cart. I had read an interview with the authors of this book and felt what they had to say was exactly what I needed to help me move forward. This book, I can honestly say, helped me more than any other resource. It wasn't so much about completing a bunch of tasks as it is about changing the way I approach things--to let go of the way that has been branded in my brain for years and to open up to taking small steps to bigger change.    After reading this book, I feel free. I feel like I can not only move my business idea forward, but that I can do it on my own turns and find a create way around any obstacles that come up.    Thank you for writing this book.
0060578793|5.0|This is definitely a great book to have just in case you ever need to survive in an SHTF situation. Very well written and provides guidance for almost any situation where survival skills would be needed. I learned a lot just from paging through it. A definite must for any bug out bag or car glove box.
0066620996|5.0|This is a fascinating read, presenting 11 case-studies of companies who pulled themselves out of a pending quagmire, while also contrasting each with a 'sister' company in a similar industry that ended up drowning.  Note that this book was written way back in 2010, and at the time Circuit City was thriving and is one of the glowing examples in this book. So relevancy may come into question here.  Nonetheless, the illustrations of strong corporate cultures are vivid and show an unwavering commitment to productivity.  The emphasis on humility in the winning leaders is inspiring. There are accounts of new leaders taking over a sinking ship and executing huge rounds of layoffs based on the goal of 'getting the right people on the bus, and the wrong people off', and as result removing people who have worked at the company for decades and even people who are family members.  That takes guts.      I'm sure some of us readers really relish seeing a company like Bethlehem Steel, whose executives had private airplanes which they used even for taking their children to college, and golf club membership where executive rank determined shower priority (page 138), fail miserably.  Meanwhile a company like Nucor, which does away with job titles to eliminate the feel of class distinction, soars.  This is what the masses love (me included) and that is why this book is such a hit.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Bought for a niece who wanted to own it, but couldn't find a copy at any local store.  What a great movie ... hard to believe it was released 20 years ago.
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|No one warns you about the beginning of the movie... So SAD!! That is not how I normally want a movie to start out. Once past this, it starts to get better.  All in all, Cars is still number one for me for Pixar movies.
B002VPEA0S|5.0|Thank you for listing the product as a full size book and it actually BEING a full size book.<br />Great seller and fast delivery!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Let me say that I was fully prepared to hate this movie.  Every time I saw a preview, I changed the channel because they were so dumb.  I rented it anyhow since I try to see all the movies that get nominated for awards (and I usually do not agree with their reviewers' assessments.)  I cannot tell you how much I loved this movie.  The guy who plays the main bad guy (sorry, not good at remembering character names) was amazing; he deserves every award he wins.  I am buying this movie now so I can watch it again.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I loved it.    And this is saying something, because my ancestors were Huns.  :)    Mulan is a lovely character, the voice actors (Donny Osmond singing, Eddie Murphy speaking) do some of their best work ever. While I couldn't call it faithful to Asian traditions, they do try to observe some, such as the family name coming first in an introduction, \\"I'm looking for Fa Mulan.\\"    This is my favorite Disney movie.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Rick Riordan has done a fantastic job with this series. The characters are real and relatable and the plot grabs from the start. The lack of anachronisms just sweetens the deal. I cannot wait to see what this author will bring us in the coming years. Bravo, Mr. Riordan, bravo!
0596009208|5.0|I was a little confused about how to set up the Java compiler at first.  The instructions in the book were basic and unclear.  The author assumed you had some experience setting up compilers already and that you knew where to save your files and how to set up your command prompt.  I was lost at first, but Google told me where to get the Java Development Kit and NetBean (a Java text editor).<br /><br />I would take a star off, but the beginning says that the book is intended for people who have tried at least some basic programming before.  They weren't talking about HTML.<br /><br />Besides the initial set up, I have had no other trouble.  I've done some programming with Javascript, PHP, and just a bit of C++.  I know all about variables, operators and loops, but not enough to actually do anything useful.  For me, the pace of this book is perfect so far.  I try to do a chapter a day, and this text is entertaining enough that I'm not counting the pages until the chapter ends.<br /><br />If you want to learn Java, get this book.  But if you are completely new to programming you will want to spend more time in the first few chapters.  If you hit a confusing section, you can use Google and forums to clear things up.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Sade's long awaited album is carried by the strength of 3 songs that can hold their own with any other songs in Sade's whole repertoire. And they are (4)\\"Babyfather\\"  my personal favorite an upbeat soulful display by the band \\"Oh child don't you know your daddy love come with a lifetime guarantee\\" a little reggae overtone a very uplifting tune. (8) \\"In another time\\" This is the ultimate in a slow song. It makes you want to slow dance for maybe a half hour just loopin it. The violin, saxophone and piano arrangement par excellence, and of course Sade's smokey vocals the ultimate compliment to the music. Languid and sweet. Melancholy in a Blues kinda way. (9) \\"Skin\\" a reflective song upon past relationships but a bit more uptempo a definite head nodder to the 3rd degree. \\"Begin to wash you off my skin I'm going to feel you away because your are alright within\\". A solid CD with a few aforementioned instant classics. I have to savor this piece, for we do not Know when or if we'll see another.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Vendor was prompt and professional.  Item was clean and good value.  Side splittingly funny.
B002KQOCJ2|2.0|Much like Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\", over compression has ruined an anotherwise solid album.  I recieved the LP the other day. I opened the package and out comes this beautiful clear non colored vinyl.  I was so excited to give it a spin.  I place it on the the turntable, dropped the needle, and out comes this narrow, high volume, noisy, and fatiguing sound with no dynamic range.     I rate the music as four stars, but what good is the music if it is unlistenable on something other than an ipod?
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I purchased this book years ago only because I had finished my book and had a long plane ride in front of me.  I was incredibly wowed by this book - I am glad I had finished that other book.    I instantly adored the Jack Reacher character.  Even though sometimes it seems he gets out of situations that no other human could possibly survive, I still like the character and enjoy the books.  I've since read all of Lee Child's books but I think this is still my favorite.      This is a fast-paced thriller that starts off with immediate action on page 1, as in most of Child's novels.  The Killing Floor is definitely a page turner.    I liked the character, the action, and the ending that surprised me.  I always look forard to the next book in the Jack Reacher series.  It never disappoints!
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|My wife had been asking for an item that would help her lose some of the stretching done to her midsection by our beautiful baby girl :)  So, I tried a few in-store items and my wife couldn't get the right product.  Then we both did some research online and came across this product.  Put in an order and when we received the product it was all smiles until we realized it was not tight enough!  Another dollar wasted and one more item to add to the several other types!  Well, an idea came to mind!  Since this item has preset velcro straps, why not buy some additional velcro tape that can be sized to apply to the belt!  Worked like a charm with a quality glue!  Just wanted to share.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|I'm not a professional critic or anything. I buy movies with one idea in mind. Is this something i want my kid to watch when he is older? And the answer is Yes. This movie is a classic in many regards, it is something i can watch with my child in the room (no swearing or nudity) and it has a great story. If you don't have this movie in your collection then maybe it is time you should get it.
1416955070|4.0|I agree with many of the past reviewers.  This is a newish writer and there are some awkward moments, some frustrating over-illustration, and some things that don't quite add up.  BUT, the world the author creates was real enough and fascinating enough that I sat out in the desert and read all three books back to back in about as many days.  These books give great escape, which is what I am looking for when I buy a series like this.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and there is a ton of delicious tension and suspense.  I love that she was able to unify so much fantasy mythos together in one story and really make it work.  overall, I had a ball reading these and will read the last one when it comes out.
B00127RAJY|4.0|To be 20 minutes Jillian really allow us to work up a sweat. I appreciate three different workouts. I had my product for 30 days but I just started my 30 day challenge three days ago. I recommend this video but advise the owner not to slack off.
B00280LYIC|5.0|okay that is coming from an 11 year old, but this book is awesome no matter who reads it. i'm not even a mytholigy person (don't get me wrong mytholigy is great, but i'm more of an animal type of gal) a must read for anything that breathes...ok when i stop typing you must bye this book!!!
0061537969|4.0|I was very suspect of this at first. It was chosen for my book club but I really enjoyed it and recommend it...even to those non-dog lovers.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Saw a few episodes of seasons 5 and 6, and liked what I saw.  Bought season one and just fell in love with the show and characters... I'm def a Desperate Housewives fan now!
B00005Q66T|4.0|I love this music and it is a great set of tunes.<br />I second the motion of :you to only get this Limited Edition CD if your a true die hard fan\\". It is a great collecters item but other than tha I would stick with the original as it is much cheaper and missing very little besides the fancy packaging.<br /><br />This is just a re-release of the last stuff. But still worth listening to .
0453005071|5.0|I was very pleased with the condition of the book. It was exactly as represented. Seems you cannot go wrong with amazon. I have ordered several items through them and each time I have been very pleased. Everything is always as they claim it will be.
B001TD1XWG|1.0|He mentioned Andre 3000 so much in his last album that he thought he could become him.  This is quite possibly the worst \\"change of pace\\" album from an established mainstream artist in the history of music.  Seriously, it's that bad.  The singing isn't singing, the lyrics aren't lyrical, and the production can barely be considered a product.  Wayne essentially uses a bunch of half-baked cliches to form his idea of what rock is and then goes on to destroys every shred of musical credibility media outlets bestowed upon him after overwhelmingly successful \\"Carter 3\\".  Rap-star?  Of course.  Rock-star?  Learn to play the guitar and sing on key first.
B00168OIOE|5.0|this is a great disney add on for my bluray collection. came with bru-ray disc, digital copy and a dvd copy. great since the kids destroyed the original dvd we had. They cant keep there eyes off this movie. a must see for children
B0027DK206|5.0|i just read Sonja's review and all can say is that she has missed the point of Lomography.  it is not about crisp sharp images but about style,imagination, and serendipity.
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|I have had this since it came out--and have come to truly enjoy some of it.      First off, three songs never made it passed half a dozen listenings: Love is Blind and Ghosts in My Machine immediately struck me as pretentiously produced and sung in a way that strained Annie's delightful voice.  Their final effect was both strained and bland.  Lost?  Well, I found that to be too maudlin and mawkish by half.  So--my sense of what were duds are out of the way.      Dark Road is gorgeously sung and handsomely produced.  I find the interaction between Annie and the instrumentation to be well-nigh magical.  I like that she's singing about that universal issue of how does the human get beyond him or her self and find an emotional home with others.  Yes, I have something of a hard time identifying with her unrelenting depression, but this song works beautifully.  Colored Bedspread is likewise magical--setting and jewel-like vocalization creating a wonder-filled whole.  I'm a person who always has a song in his head, and of late it's been Through the Glass Darkly.  What an amazing melody!  Here too, the production supports her voice perfectly.  When she sings the chorus, the bell-like synths vaguely remind me of the bell-like sounds in Pink Floyd's song Time (when the rhythm of that song is being set at around 1:20).  This is a song about the experience of time, written to speak to  her depression.  I find it fascinating to hear a songwriter writing \\"to\\" their depression.  Smithereens would round out my favorite four; it seems sweet and somehow compassionate.  Big Sky is handsome--got some passion going on.    Sing is fine--not bad, not great.  Fingernail Moon is odd--a lyrical setting and subject with a depressing overcast--I feel it doesn't work.  Likewise, I feel her performance just doesn't work here.  Womankind is a perfectly fine pop song.  I was happy to hear Annie making that purr-bop sound that she made with Eurythmics.      This is a pop album--that's what Annie says she makes.  One of the goals of pop is to create songs that get stuck in your head.  If this album has created such songs for you, well then, it works as a pop album.  I find Annie's strong suit of late has been melody.  On Bare and here she does indeed dip into lyric clichés.  However, the ones on Bare are quite unforgivable--glass half-full or half-empty?  It STILL jars!  Here the cliches are mild enough to have their misfortune fade.  I wonder if she came into the studio with some worse ones, but Ballard confronted her on them.  Maybe Lipson had become lazy?  I found a lot of magic in Bare too, but this change of producer is most welcome as far as I'm concerned.   Because my play counts got reset by an iTunes crash in 2008, I can't compare how much I listened to Bare songs with this newer album.
0307716988|5.0|I had gotten the book as a Christmas present from my sister, however not from Amazon, since I'm sure she got it @ a bookstore & honestly, I just can't thank my sister enough for getting it for me.  As soon as I got it on Xmas Day, I ~IMMEDIATELY~ started reading it, however, I had to finish reading it when I got home from being out.  But anyways, I read the ENTIRE book all in ONE day & just could not put it down!  It's truly an AMAZING book & it's truly a MASTERPIECE(at least, in my opinion)    When you read this book, you really feel like as if you know the --REAL-- Michael Jackson, then compared to the trash that the media prints out.     Again, amazing book & I highly recommend this book for any Michael Jackson fan who has not read it.    I love you Michael! You're truly the best & always will be. <3
B002T921DE|5.0|George Michael has always been a good performer. The years haven't changed that, in fact he's getting more confident and stronger in his performances, the scenography, lights, musicians, etc seems to be perfect. The sound of this Blu-ray is phenomenal, my upstairs neighbor came down and knocked on my door because some of his stuff was falling from the table... if you have a good Home Theater capable of 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio the result will be a deep bass and amazing clear sounds.<br /><br />In top of the tremendous concert you will have some scenes from his car, talking with other people and warming up with the chorus ladies.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Blu-ray (or DVD) so you will have all the best of his long career. I was able to attend this tour concert when he performed at Bank Atlantic Center in Sunrise FL and when I saw the concert at home I was transported to that day...
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I LOVED Daria growing up!  I can't wait to see the episodes all over again from the beginning.    After MTV lost Daria, they went downhill.      For an awesome price of under $70, you get all 5 seasons and BOTH movies.  That's a deal you just can't beat.
B00006I53S|5.0|This lens is my standard lens I use 85% of the time for almost all photographic conditions.  My other lenses are specialty ones but this lens is the one I usually have on my camera for most of my shots.  The range is amazing on how one can use this lens for all the different situations one comes across when shooting pictures.  Both studio work and out in the wild, this lens is the perfect one for that usage.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!
0060578793|5.0|This is a great but not perfect survival guide. Read Mr. Driscoll's review I did and checked out his statements and found Mr Driscoll to be correct. However this is one of the best all around guides I have read. So far I have 10 wilderness survival guides in my library but this is about the best. If you can't attend a school with instructors to teach you, get some specialized instruction books. I would suggest at the very least this book and \\"Primitive Wilderness Living & Survival Skills\\" by John & Geri McPherson, \\"The Trappers Bible\\" by Dale Martin, \\"The everything Knots Book\\" by Randy Penn, and The Illustrated Guide To \\"Edible Wild Plants\\" by Department Of The Army and if you can some of the Ron Hood videos (he's real good). But this is a very good book you should read. I know a lot of the skills taught here you have read before, some you have not  but you will gain more insight if you read different ways of explaining skills by different people. Just remember there is no animal as the perfect survival guide that will teach you everything you need to know but this book is a very good start, just keep going and don't stop with just this one book. Best wishes to all.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Not a typical sci-fi flick.  This one has great characters that I love to watch over and over.  Okay, the world is nearly destroyed by aliens.  But, add a mix of a great cast and a great story, and you have a great movie.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I read this book on recommendation, and while it was well written and fun to read, and the mystery was intriguing, I really did not like the tone of the background of this book. For example, the main character is supposedly a man of high moral standards and integrity. He writes a book aimed at financial reporters, urging them to investigate the financial giants of the industry as if they were political candidates, and not take their lies as gospel. He also basically sacrifices himself in a trial for libel, theoretically for truth and integrity. However, he sees absolutely nothing wrong with a intensely physical relationship with his partner, spanning 20 years, including his failed marriage to another woman (because of this relationship) and hers (ongoing marriage, where the current husband doesn't seem to \\"mind\\"). What??? Granted, I may be old-fashioned, but to me, integrity and honesty span all aspects of one's life, not just professional career. So, the fact that these two don't hide their relationship, does that make it honest and honorable? I hope not.<br /><br />Although the protagonist seems charming and oh so likable, I find it disturbing that he sees his daughter maybe once a year. The author simply says that he leaves the meetings up to her (the daughter), but since the one or two meetings described in the book are not destructive and perfectly amicable, I find this explanation just too shallow. What kind of a man allows his marriage to fail because of adultery and then does not even make an effort to be a part of his child's life? Does that describe someone with honor and integrity? I doubt it.<br /><br />So, basically, I didn't like this book. Yes, the story is interesting. Yes, the mystery is clever. But, the character are shallow, one sided, and if you think about it, mostly despicable. There is no one in this story that makes the reader want to be a better human being. There is nothing in the book that educates or edifies. It's basically a story about mostly demoralized and base humans, who have no notion of true honor and integrity, thinking dirty thoughts and doing dirty deeds, while fooling themselves into thinking that they are basically \\"good\\". I was disappointed.ized and base humans, who have no notion of true honor and integrity, thinking dirty thoughts and doing dirty deeds, while fooling themselves into thinking that they are basically \\"good\\". I was disappointed.
0194325385|5.0|I work as a professional translator and editor and find that I use this book several times a day to find just the right word in English. For example, a German sentence might say that the writer was stuck in \\"strong traffic\\" (starker Verkehr), but in English we say \\"heavy traffic\\" (not \\"strong traffic\\"). This book helps you come up with the right adjective in English when you know that the literal translation of the foreign-language one doesn't sound right.    It is more complete than the \\"BBI\\" dictionary and comes with a free CD-ROM, which means that you can take it with you on your laptop without having to carry the book.
B00000IMTG|5.0|Catch the Rainbow by itself makes this a 5 star! What a powerful beautiful song and the band seems to be at the top of their game! Ritchie also puts on a show and burns my ears off with his solos and creativity.

B000002UB3|4.0|Without a doubt, this is the best The beatles ever sounded.  The songs were expertly crafted, the band sounded fantastic and that cover...   All together this could make for the perfect beatles album.  if you don't own this, why?
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Not much time for this review, but I want potential buyers to know that this turn table is more than worth the money.  It sounds very good and you'll thoroughly enjoy listening to your albums especially if they've been in storage for many years as ours have been.  I haven't tried the feature which enables you to transfer albums to digital files on your computer so I can't comment on that.  It does seem cheap with all the lightweight plastic components but it's still worth the money.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Yes, yes.  I know that this is a classic, but I'm sorry.  In all of my thirty plus years none of the clips I've seen of this movie even hinted to me that I might like this movie.  None.  And I do like some of Julie Andrews work: Mary Poppins, Victor/Victoria are two that comes to mind.  But a woman whirling around on a mountain top--not so much.  Then for some reason that I don't remember now, I sat down and watch it.  AND I LOOOOOOVVVVE IT.  What fun!  The music, the optimism and the theme of the importance of family. Beautiful.  I was smiling and singing as I watched this movie. I even found the ending suspenseful.  I now have to buy this soundtrack.  Just gotta.  High Recommended.
B001GZ6QBU|1.0|Maybe it is just my copy, but this product seems to be a poorly copied version. It doesn't run without very pregnant pauses between chapters. I realize it was a \\"used copy\\" and this one is either really used or just poorly copied. Should have paid full price for an original \\"new\\" copy. Sorry.
0812550706|5.0|I picked up Enders Game last month simply based on the premise alone-that someone could prepare for war by playing games. I thought it would be a simple, cute, quick read. Have I ever been more wrong? It was an incredible look into the psyche of someone snatched from their family and trained for battle from their childhood. Orson Scott Card captures the arrogance, humor and frailties of the defense structure with brilliance. I could not put Enders Game down and when I later learned that there were more books in the series (just finished [[ASIN:0812550757 Speaker for the Dead (Ender, Book 2)]]) it was like Christmas.<br /><br />The ending battle may have been a little predictable, but the Giant's game and Speaker for the Dead ending really let the reader escape a perhaps unsatisfying conclusion.<br /><br />As for Mr. Card's writing style, I found his American Plain Style captivating and straight forward which are two reason (along with the sensational plot) to keep me riveted turning pages. Bravo!<br /><br />Sam Hendricks, author of Fantasy Football Tips and Fantasy Football Guidebook
B001TZQITM|5.0|What I love about this camcorder case: it is designed for all these new smallhand held camcorders. Why, the last thing I need is something where my camcorder just rolls around it.  This case is wide and deep enough for most small hand held camcorders, and allow room for the charger.  Snug, comfortable and yet not squishy. It is a very well thoughtout bag: there is a strong velcrose component fabric floor that you could use as a floor hammock to allow the camcorder to sit on top: shock absorption.  There are a front pocket that I would place extra memory card (for those camcorders that do not have a built in hard drive) or loose change for those who have a built-in harddrive!  There are further side pockets, which really does not hold anything with mass. Also comes with a shoulder strap.  Neat and compact design.  The material is very durable with a flat and solid plastic external bottom, so you dont have to worry about it sitting on a bit of moisture.  You could use this for a carrying a camera as well!
0812550757|5.0|Hard to believe but I may like Speaker for the Dead even more than his brilliant first novel [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]]. Despite the slow start, this book has more depth of emotion and character development than Enders Game. I really liked his follow up the Buggers war and it appears that he had this book in mind when he wrote Enders Game. That explains much. And maybe solidifies why I liked this even more.<br /><br />There are many more books in the series ([[ASIN:0312861877 Xenocide (Ender, Book 3) (Ender Quartet)]] is next I think), I think I have stumbled on something wonderful. There will be more chances to learn of Ender Wiggin and Jane a computer entity that is like the Buggers/Piggies only without feel or touch through appendages. I do not want to give away too much. I will say this....Speaker for the Dead is a job that could be used in today's world as well. Someone who speaks about the dead and tells not what others want to hear but instead the truth no matter how painful or honest it is?<br /><br />Sam Hendricks, author of Fantasy Football Tips and Fantasy Football Guidebook
B001OQCV2O|1.0|Save the Politians/world leaders?  They will be the first to DIE because they caused the destruction of this world.
B0031ZWZR2|5.0|I purchased this set mainly to show my support of the show since entertainment talk says it is troubled. I absolutely love it, hence the five stars, and think it could replace LOST as my favorite once that is over. Last fall my DVR was always near capacity, but I was ALWAYS caught up on FF.    However, I also want to give my two cents regarding half season sets. The short answer is that I am ambivalent. I agree with reviewers who say part of it is greed because they know we will buy it (I'm talking to YOU, BSG and GLEE.) The producers of this set did include a link to download a $15 off coupon for FlashForward the Complete First Season. But I didn't pay $15, I paid $20. So that does NOT even out. I don't agree with putting out a half set and then putting out a complete set. That is BS, coupon or not. If they are going to do a vol. one, then the next needs to be vol. 2, not a complete set.    BUT this show has now been off the air for two months now (it is the end of Feb. 2010) and we are facing at least six more weeks before we get the second installment of episodes. Whereas I always get a little pissed at how studios seem to think we are all morons and can't remember past commercial breaks, but this IS A COMPLICATED SHOW. You think you remember it all, but I promise you don't. I've already watched episodes 1-5. They are definitely worth re-watching, and if you're like me the prospect of saving anything other than So You Think You Can Dance on the DVR for more than two months is laughable.     I am glad that I bought this set, and unless they totally screw up the rest of the season I will likely cash in the coupon for the complete series in August. (NOTE TO STUDIO: THERE HAD BETTER F'ING BE MORE EXTRAS AND COMMENTARIES, noteably ACTOR Lee Thompson Young in The Gift).    However, my advice to fans is that you watch those first 10 episodes online or rent these disks, as there is an \\"exclusive\\" preview of Vol. 2, and wait for the complete set in August.
6305388458|5.0|The Life of Brian seems to be an attack on the logic behind religions, governments, terrorism, and anything else you can think of.  It is crude, insulting, and as funny as heck.  A must for anybody who is a fan of Monty Python, loves comedy or is a fan of the Roman Empire.  Get it!<br />But I am kind of confused by the other reviews.  This is not a two-disc set.  This is not Blue Ray.  This is a simple DVD that they don't even produce anymore.  Just the film, a trailer, and bios.<br />I would also suggest buying [[ASIN:1405116846 Big Screen Rome]] which has a chapter on the movie.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I love this album. There isn't a song I don't like and I've heard them all on the radio.
B002R5V7MG|2.0|I received this DVD as a gift from a good friend and I look forward to listening/watching it with great expectations.  I am disappointed! Mr. Dudamel seems to have learnt all the theatrical elements  and gestures of Leonard Bernstein, but without holding the musical elements in shape or presenting the musical arguments  in a coherent manner. Bits and pieces, they may sound exciting and may at times shock and awe. Unfortunately,  the whole is much less than the sum of its parts. If this is what real Mahler would sound like, I would have abandoned  Mahler years ago. The most shame of it all is that the sound of the orchestra was excellent but the conductor  was not able to mold it into a convincing whole.  (One of my favorite versions is Rafael Kubelik's on DGG.) I am afraid this  young conductor is not an isolated case on the American classical music scene and this interpretation is typically what  the public is exposed to or listen to.
B00005JO9J|1.0|OK husbands- if you want to spend some time with your wife, chances are you've been in the room when this horrible, treacly, maudlin, melodramatic, pseudo-soap has been on the tube.  If so, I feel your pain.  Yes, it's predictable.  Yes, it's cheez whiz.  But what's worse is it pretends to be a serious show.  At least \\"Days of Our Lives\\" didn't pretend to be something it wasn't.  I was so glad when Ally McBeal finally went off the air, but now there's this.  McDreamy, McSteamy...last seven minutes of the show, cue some overwrought emo music, cue someone dying or crying or whatever.  Yuck.  Why is TV so terrible?
0307266303|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.<br />Because, just like anything that we love, it felt entirely about ME.<br /><br />The struggle with the pain, the desire to run but the impossibility to do it like I used to, the questioning about can-I-or-can't-I, the buzz inside that softly spoke to me (so many times) about how good I felt on the vegan diet (quickly dismissed by \\"modern-living\\"), even the question marks raised after a good barefoot run in the grass (why does it feel so good?). They all got the answer in this book.<br /><br />Great read precisely because, unlike most running books that are entirely about the authors' endeavors, this book felt about me.<br />Excellent read, worth buying. It may feel about YOU!
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown is searching for symbols that lead us to greater truths - he searched too hard and found to little truth that is new or unusual.  SPOILER - really  - as though we already don't realize we have untapped mental powers, that the grace of God is within us all -  that we have great potential we have not reached.  He took a bunch of symbols apparently placed around DC like a high school scavenger hunt that made our forefathers look like they had nothing better to do than act like an  elitiest boyscout secret society that hid secret messages in an attempt to make themselves feel more special and intelligent that the rest of us. And at the end of the night a man who had just been tortured and had his hand cut off and a woman who had a vein opened to bleed to death just hop around DC as though they just woke up from a nap.  I want the past few hours back.
0385504225|4.0|I read the The Da Vinci Code book first and that has turned into one of my favorite books of all time, then naturally I bought this one, because now I am a huge Dan Brown fan. So here is what I have to say about this book, DO NOT think that this book is fact, it's a fiction novel, if you want to learn more about the topics and history that are referenced in the book then do your own research. With that being said, this book is a great FICTION novel. Dan Browns writing is still average, but he still has the ability to grab your attention and just take you for a fun ride. He really should get a new editor though, because his descriptions of the environment that characters are in, is kind of bland for some reason, I don't know why. Other then that he is a good writer and this book is so worthy of buying and reading. His Da Vinci code book had a slightly better ending, but this one was awesome too. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the drag that it took to get there, and the extra dribble after the ending climax. Again, that shouldn't over shadow the overall pleasure I had reading this book!! So go read it now!! You will like it !
B0030BOCEG|5.0|First off, let me say that this album was a pleasant surprise.  I first got into HIM after they released Razorblade Romance and Love Metal and absolutely loved those albums.  I'll have to admit I was disappointed in Dark Light and Venus Doom.  Although they weren't terrible albums, they seemed to be lacking the original HIM sound that captivated so many fans and that many people on these reviews have referred to.  After so many bands in the genre seem to be slowly fading away (Alkaline Trio, Coheed & Cambria), I assumed that HIM was on the same path.      I was wrong.  This album brings that sound back with a new and refreshing energy.  It's the first album that Ville has written fully sober and reflects a man ready to make his comeback.  Standout tracks include the opener (In Venere Veritas), Katherine Wheel, and Shatter Me With Hope.
0307474275|4.0|The first point that I would like to point out is this, it took me so long to actually buy and read this book because of all the average reviews this book received and all I have to say is this.... IT'S A FICTION NOVEL PEOPLE!! C'MON!!! I am so happy that I decided to just take a chance and get the book and decide whether I would like it or not. Second point, Dan Brown is a good author, not a great author, but good. That is because his actual writing skills are average, but his imagination and historical research is very interesting. Based on that, you have to go into this book knowing that you bought it as a fiction novel, because you really don't want to assume that the historical information he writes is based on fact, even though you might actually think it is because of the descriptions and context he does so well in the book. Other then that, I am so glad I read this book, because it will go down as one of my favorites. Dan Brown has a talent of grabbing your attention with conspiracy type genre, and turns it into a face paced think twice story!! Do not listen to the reviews to make your decision to read this book, I would read it and then decide whether you like it or not, because it is a best selling book that you should judge on. To touch on what I was writing before about his writing as average is this, they way he describes the environment the characters are in is very to splurgy to the point that I couldn't quite get a good visual in my mind of it. But it might be because most of the time the escapades are taking place in France. Read the book you won't regret it!!!!
B00005YU1O|1.0|The movie did not reveal the truth. vety poor I thought. The author does not have a good understanding of light work and metaphysics, yet tries to come accross like he does. Actually I found alot of darkness in this movie  thanks, Debbie
0810979772|5.0|Great companion to the series.  My boys really enjoyed writing their own version.  My 11 year-old even decided this was his favorite Christmas gift this year!  That's amazing considering he also got a Nintendo DS.  As a parent, having my son prefer this over a video game was amazing!
B002NALPCM|5.0|These self-proclaimed bookworms know how to churn out some wonderful upbeat pop/folk music with tastefully darkish lyrics.  I highly recommend this album.  I saw these guys live at the El Rey in Los Angeles; they are even better live!  Just check 'em out.

0743298039|3.0|I felt this book had some good moments, and just some who cares moments. I liked some of the stories about Margaret and I thought the interaction between her and Miss Winters was rather funny but thats about all for the good moments. The bad moments in this book were defiantly the over describing of every little detail, I grew weary reading over and over description after description where nothing was happening. I guess thats why I called them who cares moments, because really... who cares? I guess the writer just thought that might be a good way to get you into her world by over describing every detail. I think personally if she would have spent more time with stories about the characters and less time describing inanimate objects I might have cared a little more for this book.
0525951113|5.0|Daemon is a great book which is the first of a series. The second book in the series is called Freedom. Both are super exciting action adventure/sci-fi books. They're scary because the author is in a position to know what is now technically possible and the way the books tie in occurances in the real world; i.e. \\"Too big to Fail,\\" joblessness and unemployment, large corporations running the world, etc. leads you to wonder if this story either is possible or it's really happening right now and we just don't know.    After I read Daemon I was so hooked on the story I wanted to read Freedom immediately if not sooner, so be prepared. These are stay up all night books. Even if you don't understand all the techno jargon, the story is still strong.
0385504225|3.0|This highly anticipated book was a slow and gradual let down. I was caught up in the excitment and drama all the way until the last few chapeters. The characters had me interested enough in the plot and having been to DC, it was fun to think about all the landmarks and hidden possibilites of the city. I thought the Noetic lab was interesting but we never fully understand the science and the \\"proven\\" research that is is often mentioned. Dan Brown had me all the way until the end, where the big secret was elusive and unfulfilling. I felt a bit preached to about religious beliefs, bringing the last few chapeters to an outdated and uninteresting ending. I actually forced myself to read the epilogue; at that point I just didn't care anymore and wanted to wrap up the Lost Symbol. If there was an actual point behind the drama and excitment of the book I know this would have been as successful as The Da Vinci Code.
B000071ZZI|5.0|I am a big fan of this series. Matt Damon is perfect as the \\"broken\\" assasin who is trying to find out his real identity after he short-circuits after a botched assasination attempt. I won't bother with a full review of the movie but the action sequences are captivating while Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne is very believable.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I found exactly what I was looking for on Amazon, ordering was easy and shipping was super fast.
B00000IMTE|5.0|You got to give it to Ritchie Blackmore. During a Deep Purple tour, Elf was the supporting band fronted than none other than Ronnie James Dio. Blackmore decided to take over Elf, fire their guitarist, add himself and change the name of the band to Rainbow. Talk about an ego! Axl Rose has nothig on this guy.<br /><br />However the music and end result is all that matters in the long run. This album may fall short of being a masterpiece, but not by much. The album opens up with can only be described as amazing. \\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\" is such a cool song because you can hear so many elements. The guitar riff is straight up classic Deep Purple and the lyrics and singing is a sign of things to come when Dio takes over Black Sabbath and continues with his band Dio. The song itself is worth the price of admission, but there so much more good material here.<br /><br />Black Sheep of the Family is a favorite of mine, as is Snake Charmer. Blackmore's Fender is all over this album and it blends in so nice with Ronnie's singing style at the time. And like I said, for Dio fans this is a must. It is an early look at Ronnie's writing style. All the sorcery, magic, rainbows, dragons, and sorcery type songs that Dio is famous for pretty much began with this record.

B0012U7QTU|4.0|At the beginning of The House at Riverton I needlessly worried that it would be persistently hinting at the dark secret to be revealed ahead. Instead I found myself pleasantly immersed in both timelines. Grace, a nursing home resident, begins to relive old memories when contacted by a filmmaker about a project at Riverton Manor where she once worked in domestic service. Although the film is about the suicide of poet R.S. Hunter witnessed by the two Hartford sisters of the estate during a grand society party, the past timeline actually chronicles Grace's time in service, a bygone era where duty and service held deep meaning for those downstairs. It is also a story of how war--the Great War--traumatizes even those who return. Morton does an admirable job weaving the present timeline with the past, creating strong female characters, and presenting the deep dark secret with impact. A recommended read if you wish to visit early twentieth century England.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|All of us who are fed up with TV and DVD trash, can resume hope that someone out there is making gold for viewers. The detailing, the acting, the real characters and the overall \\"magic\\" that's unveiled is excellent. I am so grateful to have found this series, and I hope they will continue to make more. The cost is so little for such fine entertainment. If I were rich, I'd see to it that ever household received what our hearts and souls yearn to have once more.

0316069906|4.0|I normally do not like arguments in favor of vegetarianism.  This one I liked.  In this book, Foer struggles with the question of whether or not to feed meat to his young son.  Foer has been an off again, on again vegetarian his whole life and debates which path to lead his son down.  He discusses the issue with farmers and activists, eventually coming to the conclusion that he does not want to feed his son meat.<br /><br />I am not a vegetarian, nor will I ever be one.  The world would have to run out of meat first.  What I liked about the book, however, were two things:<br /><br />  1. He did not try to force his views upon me.  He acknowledges that vegetarianism is a personal choice.<br />  2. He really advocates just eating less meat.  I can get behind that.<br /><br />He really made me think about my consumption and its effects on corporate farming.  I definitely recommend this book to those who like to consider the food they eat and where it comes from.

0061122416|4.0|This book took me completely off guard.  Paulo Coelho is an author that a friend recommended to me.  One day at the library I noticed this book and picked it up, not even paying attention to what it was about before I started reading the first chapter.  I liked it so much that I read the whole book in just a little over 24 hours.  It is a story of a shepard on a journey to find his personal treasure, set in Spain and Northern Africa.  A lesser writer would have put me off with the spiritual tone of the book but Coelho managed to strike the right balance between the mystical and the personal.  I would recommend this book to anyone and I am excited to read more of his books.
B002RBU4GA|5.0|This is a story narrated by a dog and listening to his \\"voice\\" is the best way to get his story.  I bought this CD for a long road trip, for which it was perfect.  I had tears in my eyes much of the time from either laughing at his hysterical antics or the sadness of some of what happened.  I will keep this one forever.
B002POMLHY|5.0|BB has stayed true to themselves with every album.  This one is no exception regardless of what a lot of people have said via reviews on here.  Sure it may be a little darker but that's what has made them better.  Adding more screams has made this album better than the last.  Seen them in concert last month and live is just as good as the album.  That is why I was a fan from the first time I heard them.  This band is staying around for a while.
B00308YN2U|3.0|I agree with Geoff. I love the Potter series and I love the movies... until this one. I was positively mortified and left hanging with a lifeless conclusion of an almost unrecognizable movie; butchered by Yates.<br /><br />While I realize things have to be omitted and trimmed for reasons of time and expense, there was no excuse for the butchering this Director Yates did to this movie. He didn't trim... he decided to rewrite the entire book to his own version... as if he thought he could do a better job than a billionaire author? It had nothing to do with saving money either. Did it not occur to him that hundreds of millions of fans had already read the book and were expecting some semblance of similarity between the movie and the book? Did they think they would win brownie points with ANY of us by butchering our story? We don't go to the Potter movies to see something different. We go to see a video version of the books we read because we enjoyed the books... not a hack job by some hack director trying to rewrite the series. Where the heck were the executive controls at WB who should have been watching what Yates was doing? And who did Yates blackmail to get the last 2 movies after what he did to this one? It certainly was not a case of talent on his part.<br /><br />I had to reread the book to make sure I didn't miss something. The things this director did to butcher this movie did nothing to improve the story or save money and were completely unnecessary. We have to wonder if Yates ever bothered to read the books. I shudder to think what this poor excuse for a director will do to the final two movies. We'll watch it because we have no choice... but I can guarantee, after the Potter films, I will never, ever watch another movie directed by Yates... ever again. I hope everyone else boycotts his future ambitions as well.<br /><br />Burning down the Weasley's home... what purpose did that serve except to upset all of the fans? It was disrespectful like having someone spit on your family heirlooms. It did nothing to improve the movie or \\"move along\\" the progress of the movie. It had no useful purpose whatsoever and certainly did not please any of the movie fans and wasted the original Christmas scene... which would not have required as many expensive CGI's as this distorted Yates version used.<br /><br />Same with the exclusion of the interaction with the Dursely's and Dumbledore... so instead this terrible director has Harry hanging out in the underground metro diner hitting on some waitress while reading the daily profit out in the open... while Dumbledore appears outside the metro station dressed in his usual Wizard robes for all the muggles to see.... Not only was this totally in contradiction with the book, it served no useful purpose except to leave the entire audience wondering if they were watching the right movie. A dud of an opener.<br /><br />The exclusion of Kreacher and Harry's inheriting Sirius's home made no sense whatsoever. Kreacher is a big part of the final book.<br />There is no semblance of a relationship between Harry and Ginny. That entire endeavor has fallen flat and nothing they can do will spark that part of the storyline now. There is zero magic between them. In fact, there is much more magic between Neville and Ginny than there is with Harry. Every relationship they have tried with Harry has been a dud. Hermione would have been the only one which might have worked.<br />The relationship with Lavender and Ron was just terrible. Talk about \\"over acting!\\" They could have cut that part out and none of us would have missed it.<br />Neville was almost nonexistent in the movie and that's a shame. He adds a lot to the stories.<br />Cutting out all of the storyline about Riddle's family was cutting out the heart of why Voldemort is so obsessed about hating muggles and the hypocrisy of it.<br /><br />Then there was this ridiculous Yates version of the potions book. Like others have commented... Snape didn't evenreact to Harry nearly killing Malfoy. He didn't even act upset as he calmly healed Malfoy's wounds... and unlike the book, Harry wasn't even punished. Part of that punishment would have given Harry an insight as to how cruel his own father had been toward Snape.<br /><br />Yet, Yates completely changed the story where Harry put the book in the room of requirement with the Tiara on top of it... which is critical for the ending of the final book. It is substituted with some ridiculous scene with Ginny hiding the book... ending with a flat moment of meaningless intimacy.<br /><br />The worst moment of the movie by Yates is where Harry remained quietly below, watching while Dumbledore was being accosted and killed... where in the book, he had been paralyzed by Dumbledore and covered with his cloak so he could not interfere. I can't see where changing this scene saved a single penny or a single moment of time. What it did was to be completely out of character for Harry to just stand there gaping while his mentor was killed. This was totally unpalatable for fans.<br /><br />Then, out of the blue, Snape declares himself to be the Half Blood Prince... when there wasn't any reason given in the movie as to why Snape would even be aware that Harry was familiar with that name or the book... other than the fact that he had used one of his own spells on him... but there was no connecting storyline in the film that made his statement make any sense. It was just blurted totally out of context.<br /><br />The big let down was the ending. There was no ending. It just faded away without any climax or closure. It ended with a dud.<br /><br />I don't know what WB is thinking... but they are allowing Yates to make enemies out of millions... hundreds of millions of fans. That is a huge fan base to upset just to protect some hack director who is butchering the most popular series of books ever published. I cannot imagine where their heads are... certainly not anywhere we can describe in public... Just like the idiots who cancelled Star Trek... a billion dollar franchise. Shallow thinking pitbulls who can't leave a good thing alone... and then blame everyone but themselves when they shoot themselves in the foot.<br /><br />Yes... we go to the Harry Potter movies expecting to see what we read in the book with the understanding that they don't have time to include everything. We do not go to the Harry Potter movies to see the story changed or rewritten.<br /><br />There is only one thing that all the fans would agree on having rewritten.... and that would be to use the resurrection stone to bring back Sirius, Dumbledore and everyone else who was killed in the series... including Harry's parents and Snape. If WB and Yates want to change something... then change that! That is the one change we would welcome... and it might be enough to salvage WB's reputation from this hack job they allowed to be perpetrated on our movie series.t as he calmly healed Malfoy's wounds... and unlike the book, Harry wasn't even punished.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|There are in this world mental institutions that are brightly lit, orderly and clean. These places are filled with disturbed patients, and an overworked, but determined, staff of orderlies, doctors and nurses who all do their best to help the people under their care. They are kind and do everything they can to improve the lives of their patients in the hope that some day these sad people might be released.<br /><br />You will never see one of these places in a movie.<br /><br />The asylum in Shutter Island, the latest film from famed director Martin Scorsese, is a dark, sullen place. It is filled with shadows and dripping water and fading light. The staff is occasionally helpful, but mostly obstructionist and occasionally downright dangerous. This is the movie asylum taken to the nth degree.<br /><br />To this asylum arrives Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), a US Marshall investigating a locked-room mystery where, somehow, a patient, who was in there for killing her three children, has managed to escape. With his newly-assigned partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), he meets the deputy warden (John Carrol Lynch), who, as usual in these pieces, explains the rules of the asylum, takes their guns and shows them inside.<br /><br />Once inside they meet Dr John Cawley (Ben Kingsley, in his best role in ages), as well as a German, one Dr Naehring (Max von Sydow). Daniels doesn't trust the German, and hasn't exactly had a warm spot in his heart for any Germans since he was part of the squad that liberated Dachau.<br /><br />From there things get strange. A storm lashes the island. The missing woman turns up. Someone else goes missing. Memories get confused and Teddy's ability to tell reality from fiction starts to fade rapidly, bringing up the question of how contagious insanity might be.<br /><br />This is a very good film. It's not Scorsese's best, but it's easily up there with The Aviator and is better than Gangs of New York. True, he's not at the top of his form, but his second-best is still better than most director's mangum opuses (opii?).<br /><br />The acting, especially by DiCaprio and Kingsley, is truly top notch. The cinematography and sets are nicely creepy without being too overwhelming. The ending is perhaps a bit muddled and might take a couple viewings to make sense, but this is a film that's worth seeing again and again. It is easily the best film of 2010, at least so far.<br /><br />From the trailer you'd think this was a creepy, nearly supernatural thriller, but it's much better than that. It's a voyage into the mind and to a place where you really, really hope that all your dreams don't ever come true.s mangum opuses (opii?).

1400032717|4.0|if you've ever wanted to peek inside the mind of an autistic child, this is the best opportunity you'll probably ever have. written from the perspective of a 15 year old boy with some serious social lapses who is a brilliant mathematical savant, you get to follow the thought processes and mental anguishes of the autistic mind. its beautifully written and well put together, considering the jumpy nature of his thoughts. a book of perspective and understanding, you are forced to look past conventional thinking and socially acceptable behavior and join this boy in his logic.<br /><br />being that my brother is autistic, i particularly enjoyed this, but i would recommend this for anyone who is looking to read something unconventional and interesting.
B002T09BPE|4.0|If you bought this album without listening to the samples first, shame on you.  If you expected Orianthi to make a record that appeals to your guitar hero worship mentality, oops!  This is not it.  Orianthi is hardly the first great guitarist to make a pop record that appeals to a pop music fan base close to her own age.  She wrote 4 of the songs, and I have to believe she made the record she wanted to make rather than the conspiracy theory of being somehow coerced into making a pop record against her will.  The guitar hero worshippers are asking, \\"Why couldn't she be more like Steve Vai and just make virtuosity and technically proficient guitar instrumentals?\\"  Well, have any of you ever heard of David Lee Roth?  Not the most sophisticated music in the world, some might even call it sophomoric. And Steve Vai is all over it.  I could cite the examples of Mr. Big/Paul Gilbert, Danger Danger/Andy Timmons, and dozens more.  So instead of dissing all over Orianthi for making a pop record and wasting her talent, maybe you should just admit you don't like pop music and you made a mistake buying this release, rather than pompously insiting that Orianthi made a mistake.  As far as wasting talent, I dunno, I can plainly hear her searing guitar riffs all over these tracks.  Sounds like Avril Lavigne with hot guitar, and I can dig that.  Purchase this with ears wide open and enjoy, or stay clear and save us the sob stories of your alleged victimization.
0307389839|4.0|i listened to the audio version of this book during my training sessions leading up to my first marathon. it was so great that i listened to the whole book during the marathon itself.<br /><br />the tales of running that murakami recounted touched me very personally and, as a novice runner who has been overwhelmed with the personal triumph of becoming a runner, i appreciated the humor and depth of emotion that both running and writing evoked in him.<br /><br />i would definitely recommend this book for anyone who is thinking about running, or has ever run. and this will definitely make a perfect gift for one friend of mine in particular who is both a runner and a writer.
1594488843|4.0|Dan Pink has written another insightful book, this time taking on the subject of motivation. In Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, Pink highlights the disconnect between typical management practices and scientific evidence about human biology and behavior. After presenting a scientific basis for his approach, he proposes that we upgrade ourselves and our workforces to autonomy, mastery and purpose. The outcome will be greater engagement. He also provides a toolkit with suggestions on what to do next to move in the direction he proposes. While many readers feel one's own intrinsic motivation, it can be hard in some workplaces to see movement away from a carrot and stick approach toward greater autonomy, mastery and purpose. Drive may help readers transform workplaces into environments that get more work done, better, by more satisfied workers.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
0143038419|3.0|this book left me conflicted and struggling to give an appropriate rating for the book as a whole. it felt as if i had just eavesdropped on rambling conversations of a divorcee and been alternatingly irritated and fascinated with the results.<br /><br />gilbert writes with a fluidity and modern style that is respectable, but fails to deliver her message without sounding contrived and self-indulgent (as many others have pointed out). yes, this is a memoir, so it is meant to be self-absorbed, but i don't think that means it should fail to reach the collective reader. more often than not, it felt as if gilbert were only talking about herself for her own benefit, and those were the times i felt uninterested and out of touch with the text. however, at a few points, notably during the `pray' segment (and keep in mind, i am not at all religious), she reached out to me and touched me personally. but, as a whole, i think the book fell short.<br /><br />the spirituality of the book is fascinating, but i think there are other books that would be much better served for that purpose.
B002HK9I04|5.0|Seriously LOVE this film!! One heck of a riot! Blu Ray again strikes with its AMAZING visuals and sound. But of Course, the main point why I bought it was for the Matt and Trey Commentaries, and seriously, just gave me more and more laughs.

159448385X|5.0|i read Hosseini's first book, The Kite Runner last year and really enjoyed it, so i was eager to pick this one up. it definitely didn't disappoint and i enjoyed this one even more than his first book. where Kite Runner portrays boys and men, Splendid Suns focuses on women in the Afghan culture. it is heartbreaking and beautiful, in all the good ways, and i laughed and cried along the way.<br /><br />it is the story of two Afghan women brought together through unforgiving circumstances by their marriage to the same man. based around historical events of the past 30 years, this story is intricately woven around political and societal changes in Afghanistan. it shows the strength and endurance of the soul despite the suffocating hand of an abusive husband and scornful view towards women from the Taliban regime.<br /><br />despite the fact that is a fictional story, there are lasting impressions made about both the horrible and wonderful aspects of the Afghan culture that i won't soon forget. i definitely recommend this book if you are interested in cultural perspectives or just a good story.
0061730327|4.0|A gripping book that really makes you appreciate what you have.  Many of us grew up trying to avoid school whenever possible, while young William is so desperate for education his family cannot afford that he tries to sneak into school.  Eventually, he turns items others have thrown away into a working windmill.    Inspiring as it is, what I took away from it is how dependent our achievements are on global connections and global supply lines.  How many Williams are there, who might be just as brilliant and determined, but have not caught the attention of reporters, or who may not have had even the limited access to books and materials that William had?  And while some people have pointed to this book as a solution to peak oil or the way to energy independence, I can't help thinking that if everyone was building windmills, parts would be in short supply.  And if the supply lines were cut off somehow, it would not be possible to maintain and build such windmills forever.      It's not a very long book, and still feels a bit padded with things that are unrelated to the main story.  Still...well worth a read.
0061120073|5.0|this was well worth the read, although it was not a book that i felt i could rush. there was no real story line, so to speak, almost written in the fashion of many short stories. it was much more of a character and culture development book, with a meandering connection that loosely carries the book throughout.<br /><br />through some very serious topics, such as war, poverty, love and death, this book follows a young girl through her childhood in a tragic, poetic and heartfelt tale of experience. i would definitely recommend this to anyone who has the patience to really settle back and enjoy the subtle depths of this modern classic.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|Ok, I'm not expert in hi-fi and other audiophile related areas, however, I do love music with all my heart! These are my first premium >$200 headphones. What can I say ? Compared to previous earbuds and Bose Around Ear headphones AKG K702 sounds a lot more cleaner and softer. Sounds which were too mechanical with previous headphones come alive with K702. One thing that blew me away is how nice K702 produce sounds without equalizers. This is the first time I can listen to music without boosting artificial highs and lows in order to enjoy the original (reference) creation. Recommended!
1591843162|5.0|Let me start by saying I am a \\"Raving Fan\\" of Seth Godin and his works. I am one of the lucky few who received an advance copy of the book. I did what I am telling you to do. I stopped what I was reading, picked up Linchpin and have not stopped talking about it yet. It is a book that will make you think and take stock of who you are and who you want to become. it is like the words in the song from Flashdance \\"Take your passion and make it happen\\". That is the driving force for me. And I would think, after you read it, you will understand more than just that. Seth makes you look at what you want to be and gives you the understanding that today's Social Media world of business will allow it to happen. But it is up to you to start the engine running and put your passion to work. Give it freely and you will be rewarded in the future in ways unknown to you today.   Read it twice as I did. Once for the content and then for the meaning as Seth speaks directly to you.  I have a clearer understanding of who I am, who I want to become and my driving passion- my \\"art\\" as a result of Linchpin. I am putting my \\"art\\" out there in this internet cloud for the world to have. You can too.    Edward Rosenbaum, The Rainmaker and Customer Service Guru
B001FBSMF8|4.0|Many people have given this album a negative review. Their reasoning is that this album doesn't sound like a Chris Cornell album. Although I will agree that the only thing that sounds like Chris Cornell in this album is Chris Cornell, that should not take away from the skill and creativity which this album exhibits.    What genre is this album? That's hard to answer. It most closely resembles R&B. If you take a close look this album is even produced on Timbaland's record label, not Cornell's.    This should be a sign to prospective buyers to consider their tastes in music before purchasing this album. If you are interested in this album only because Cornell's name is on it, be prepared to be disappointed. However, if you do have a diverse taste in music as I do I would highly recommend this album.
1400052173|4.0|This is a well-written book outlining the origins of the HeLa cell line.  The author challenges the reader to consider what \\"ownership\\" of biological material really means. Not quite a Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment level ethical issue, the author does a good job of outlining the ethical questions involved with an acceptable level of author bias. The book takes a critical, but realistic look at the business of biomedical science. The origins of the HeLa cell line were no secret. I was not only aware of how it was developed, but also knew the name of Ms. Lacks twenty years ago. That her family did not always know about Ms. Lacks \\"contribution,\\" and the effect of gaining this knowledge on them, adds a human perspective to an already informative and well-written book.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Saw the movie twice, once in 2D and then just had to go back for the 3D version.  I always am a bit of a curmudgeon about seeing/reading any movie or book that is wildly popular, there is a grumpy imp in me that thinks, \\"well if everyone loves it it can't be that good\\".  Well, sometimes I'm right but this time I was wrong!  From a purely technological point of view this is a masterpiece of a film, worth seeing for the visual effects alone.  And it is true that the story is incredibly simple, and predictably archetypal.  But so are most of the stories that endure and fascinate people through time.  I was drawn into the gorgeous world that Cameron created and found myself deeply touched by Jake Sully's character--the heartbreaking contrast between his life in his avatar and having to return daily to his \\"real life\\" in his damaged body, selling himself into service in the hope of being able to afford the medical treatment to repair his spine.  How many of our veterans now are facing such a cruel life with no hope of escape or healing?  I could not help but feel that pain in my own body and soul, I think Sam Worthington gave a wonderful, compelling performance.  The \\"tough lady scientist\\" role is such a natural for Sigourney Weaver that I  almost have a hard time seeing her play other characters now--yes it was predictable but wonderful nonetheless.  I couldn't help smiling at her remark that she'd die to get samples from the Tree of Souls--funny how we see into our futures without knowing it.      As other reviewers have noted, yes there is a \\"noble savage\\" romanticism to the film, but I find it forgivable in that this is not a  saccharine romanticization of some real group of people but a fictional creation.  Some reviewers have called this movie \\"Dances With Wolves/Pocahontas with Aliens\\", but I think there is a very big difference between a science fiction story that is entirely made up, and the distortion of actual historical facts and events that characterized those movies (gag retch).  One my favorite moments of the movie was when the Pandoran animals joined in the battle--my husband and I looked at each other and grinned and said, \\"The planet is fighting back!!\\"  Yes, we're tree-hugging environmentalists, and James Cameron was certainly preaching to the choir with us as far as the \\"message\\" of the film was concerned.  But I came away feeling an even deeper appreciation for our own planet and fellow creatures and a renewed commitment to our ideals and goals--it's very rare that a sci-fi epic does that for me, this film was much more than the yummy brain/eye-candy entertainment that movies like Star Wars provide.      I think this is a film that can be appreciated on a lot of different levels, I will definitely be buying the DVD.  I confess I haven't been a huge fan of James Cameron's in the past, I generally have found his films to be heavy on action and spectacle but the scripts wooden and forced despite the amazing cast's best efforts (think Titanic) but in this film I think he finally found the magic blend--truly beautiful!
B002YIHO7I|2.0|Like many folks, I purchased this because I've been a fan for years. This CD, sad to say, was a disappointment. The music is too mechanical. The voices are too muddied. As for the songs, when they ended I found myself thinking, \\"Is that it?\\" In summary, after giving this CD a fair number of listens I felt that, in the struggle between style and substance, style won decisively. It's not a style I care for & thus the 2 stars.<br /><br />But to each his/her own...
B002T9H2LA|4.0|The biggest spoiler about this movie isn't a spoiler.  It's by Quentin Tarantino.  Not much more really needs to be said.  My only real surprise was not experiencing something I've always liked,  his usual (if egotistical) habit of inserting himself into his movies in either bit parts or staring roles.<br /><br />The star of this is Brad Pitt.  Not that there aren't plenty of other stars, that is, lead actors and actresses, what with the number of main/major characters.  That would properly be Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and M&eacute;lanie Laurent.  But Pitt is the only \\"big star\\" (at least to most American viewers ) that is on screen for more than a couple of minutes.  There is a cameo appearance by Mike Myers, who actually behaves mostly like a normal person.<br /><br />Most of this movie is pretty unsurprising.  While a few things unfold not quite exactly in the way you'd expect, such as somebody getting grabbed you thought would be shot, or vice versa.  But when things do happen, pretty much what you'd think would happen is what happens. Or you \\"get it\\" very soon afterwards.<br /><br />So this Spaghetti Western that just happens to be in occupied France has Brad Pitt acting like some sort of amalgamated stereotypical caricature of a bunch of people and characters at once, but in a unique way that works.  Some of the film plays a little oddly, but that's what makes things so charming.  You hardly even notice the on-screen type pointing out the names of the high ranking officials for example.  The movie is exceptionally well put together, so much so that you don't really notice some of the highly improbably actions, reactions and behaviors.  Although you will wonder about the why some of the things the characters do, or are allowed to do.  For example,  killing another certain specific character in a certain way or walking about wherever they please doing mostly what they want to.<br /><br />There are only really two sticking points to this movie.  Although they by and large work out, and in many ways give the movie its flavor and charm, still.<br /><br />First, while most all of the characters are compelling in some way, some are nothing but cardboard cutouts, many are simply there, and none of the main ones are really much sympathetic.  Everyone does at least one thing that's not very nice, to say the least.<br /><br />Second, Tarantino once again proves that's he's a master at pacing.  An inconsistent excessive overload of rather annoying pacing.  The problem there is he can't quite decide when he's going far far far too slowly for far far far too long.  Couple this with the break after that, mostly breaks which are over far too quickly given the incredible buildup.  Not that we shouldn't expect such things; True Romance, Death Proof.....<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable film, one I might watch again some day.  It's a movie that won't disappoint very many people and will overjoy fans of Tarantino and his style of filmmaking.and in many ways give the movie its flavor and charm, still.

B000025H0Q|5.0|The one thing I've been admiring about Nick Drake the last five years I've been listening to him is his ability to really connect on a personal level with listeners.      I'm one of his fans.  No doubt about it.  Maybe not the biggest fan in the world, but a pretty big one nonetheless.  He writes lyrics where they feel so simple and complicated at the same time, but in a way you can really understand where he's coming from, and in a way where you connect with him immediately.  In some instances, that connection escalates to a very, very personal level.      So personal in fact, I highly recommend NEVER listening to one of his albums if you're feeling down.  Then again, listening to one of his three albums on a day where you're feeling good might have a reverse effect and make you feel depressed instead, haha.      I guess the best time to put on a Nick Drake album is a day where you're feeling somewhat in between.  When you're in one of those moods where you feel like appreciating a lot of honest songwriting passion.  This would be the perfect day.      Simply put, Nick Drake writes highly effective folk rock.    What's REALLY strange, and one thing I still have trouble believing, is that Nick Drake wasn't considered immensely popular back in the early 70's.  We're talking about a musician who was on the same level as someone like John Lennon and Cat Stevens are far as writing meaningful lyrics in a way where you can easily attach yourself to every word and vocal melody he wrote.  He was original and talented enough where he *should* have found a huge fanbase 40 years ago.  A fanbase shouldn't have been on hold for several decades.    In addition to that, it gets even more bizarre.    Even back in the early 70's most people were able to recognize greatness when they first heard it (such as with Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Neil Young and several other groundbreaking artists) and yet, Nick Drake flew under the radar almost completely for the most part (at least he did here in America- my parents never heard of him for instance, and they've heard quite a number of rock bands from the same time period Nick Drake was releasing his albums).    There's one more thing about Nick Drake I find absolutely amazing (even MORE amazing than his ability to connect with listeners through his honest lyrics and well-crafted songwriting).    It's the fact his songwriting skills just don't sound dated at ALL.  The music of Nick Drake does not sound like typical early 70's rock music.  You see, not only does Nick Drake sound completely different from most folk rock artists such as Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens, Gordon Lightfoot and Peter, Paul and Mary- his albums honestly don't sound dated in the least.  They sound like they could have been recorded using todays equipment.  These albums sound like they could have been made today.  How can this be?  How in the world did people not notice this distinctive style Nick Drake was going for back when he was new?    So you see, if you add up all these things (extremely popular fanbase nowadays- completely different from 40 years ago when most people never even heard of him, recording equipment that definitely made his music stand the test of time, the fact Nick Drake writes from such a personal point of view) it's hard to believe Nick Drake actually DID exist 40 years ago.  What an artist.      Honesty is the main word when it concerns connecting with peoples emotions, and that's what makes it so hard to believe people didn't pick up on these touching emotions back when Nick Drake was releasing these albums.  Why didn't he catch on?  No reason not to become extremely popular and be in the same league as other folk rockers.    Picking a favorite song off Bryter Layter is a very difficult task.  I guess the longer songs are my favorites, especially \\"Hazy Jane I\\" with lyrics written in a way I can almost exactly relate to, the brilliant saxophone jams in \\"Poor Boy\\", or the creepy piano playing in \\"One of These ThingsFirst\\".  His vocal melodies are just as good as on the previous and next (final) album.      I'm glad to see Nick Drake is getting the appreciation these days he rightfully deserves.  He deserved success back in the early 70's but unfortunately fortune and fame didn't catch on for him in the States the way it should have (for plenty of mysterious reasons listed above) but at least people are finally appreciating his meaningful music nowadays.  It may have taken a long time, but it finally happened.    If I was in heaven right now, I'd pat Nick Drake on the back and say \\"Well, it finally happened, but too bad it took several years\\" which I imagine he'd respond with a simple smile as we'd part ways.  That's the way I always picture it at least, heh.

B000059H98|3.0|This is a dumb movie but at least it's a fun one. Easily ranks as a cult classic and boasts set designs from 'Twilight' director Catherine Hardwicke and choreography by 'Hairspray' director Adam Shankman. It also has a mousy Naomi Watts in a crucial supporting role. And for better or worse Lori Petty.    The year is 2033 and two groups of resistance fighters are locked in a bloody battle with the maniacal Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell) who is on a mission to snatch up what's left of the world's water. After a meteor destroyed nearly everything H20 has become scarce and Kesslee is determined to control it all. He even kills his own men just for the water in their bodies. The first group of resistance fighters is led by a man who happens to be the boyfriend of one Tank Girl (Lori Petty). Along with his daughter and a few of their fellow soldiers him and Tank Girl live in a beach house with plenty of pot growing in the basement. When Kesslee learns of the group's hideout he has his men destroy the place and kill everyone in the process. Only Tank Girl and her boyfriend's daughter escape. Tank Girl is forced to work in Kesslee's mines after she refuses to help him wipe out the other resistance group: genetically engineered half man/half kangaroo soldiers called the Rippers. While working in the mines she befriends a shy pilot named Jet (Naomi Watts). Jet is in constant danger of being raped by one of the guards so Tank Girl steps in and protects her. The two bide their time while hatching an escape plan. When they see their opportunity they make off with a Jet piloted jet plane and Tank Girl in a mammoth tank of her own. The two wander the wasteland searching for water and their like minded allies the Rippers hoping to team up with the beasts so that they can wipe out Kesslee once and for all.      The film doesn't make things that easy for the girls. They find themselves in all kinds of bizarre situations that add to the film's eccentricity. Rather than limiting themselvesto being a sci-fi/action movie, the filmmakers throw in plenty of other genres as well. Petty's rapid fire banter wouldn't be out of place in a 30's screwball comedy, true to the story's comic book origin there are plenty of comic strip panels used instead of live action to further the story along and there is even an out of nowhere but delightful musical number set to Cole Porter in a futuristic brothel. Oh, there's also horny, sax playing kangaroos as well. The film packs a lot into an hour and a half. Not all of it is successful or even logical but what makes it such a fun film is that everyone involved plays by their own rules. The acting is good and manages to stand out which is all the more impressive considering the background chaos taking place. McDowell is menacing and amusing the way he usually is and Watts does a good job turning Jet from a shy girl into a tough hero. She steals plenty of scenes whenever she's next to Petty since it doesn't seem like Petty could comprehend Watt's restrained less is more performance. If Peter Travers of Rolling Stone can boldly claim, as he often does, that an actor gives a performance that \\"deserves to be legendary\\", then I'm gonna do the same here. Petty gives a performance that deserves to be legendary if only to show what happens when you get the opportunity to headline a big budget movie only to see the film and your career tank (no pun intended)  thanks to an over the top, often grating performance. But hey that's what makes the movie memorable  her all or nothing attitude. You just have to learn to take the good with the bad when it comes to 'Tank Girl'. It's definitely an experience.
B00005JLWN|5.0|What can I say. FH 451 with 1984 and A Brave New World all in one plot with a back drop that equals Blade Runner...How anyone could not love this movie is beyond me.
B000O78KW4|5.0|This is my all time favorite Die Hard. There is so much action in this movie it's crazy. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are at their finest. Most action movies get away from the action to add some type of love story. I don't know if this is just to get female viewership or what. I hate when movies do that. If you're looking for a tough guy movie with a lot of action and less romance, this is the movie for you. I truly believe this is probably the best Die Hard ever.

1416572287|4.0|Let me preface by mentioning that I love to read books that popularize science. So, when you see a book titled, \\"HOW TO TEACH PHYSICS TO YOUR DOG\\", shouldnt it follow that the info is about general Physics?  Well, this book is about a very specific slice of physics, Quantum Mechanics.  ORZEL book explores physics as quantum theory, as it applies to WAVEFUNCTIONS, ALLOWED STATES, PROBIBILITY, and MEASUREMENT. Let me make this clear....that is all you get from this book.  Most books bringing physics to the masses,  give a quick overview on Quantum Mechanics. Hawking's \\"Brief History of Time\\" (Illustrated version) has 14 pages on the subjects, including several illustrations to help explain the obtuse, counter intuitive concept. Don't expect much illustration in this book. (And really, there's nothing wrong with that, but sometimes a picture IS worth a thousand words. ) The author utilizes long explanations, and a few physics formulas, connected to the running joke (really, an overused analogy) about the dog wanting to chase bunnies and squirrels ,and eat treats, to make these Quantum Mechanical ideas clearer.  Because Orzel constantly changes what his \\"joke\\" refers to, it makes the explanations more difficult to grasp. Calling a wave crest a BUNNY, or a bouncing ball a wavefront a BALL, or polarized light  as squirrels jumping back and forth,  pushes the book's \\"witty analogies\\" towards the absurd, rather than the humorous.  Mixed metaphors become confusing. Now, I understand that he kept refering to the talking Dog as a way to keep interest in a dry subject. The explanations are well done. Its just the running joke gets annoying, confusing, and would have been made clearer with a few more illustrations. (ie, something more picturesque than sine waves and graphs.)<br /><br />Orzel's a professor teaching this subject in a university, where most his students had physics in high school, and probibly a 101 level physics class, before quantum mechanics is presented at this depth.  For example, if you are talking about the inability to pinpoint the posistion and velocity of a particle, but don't discuss how that fact creates electron clouds around a nucleus, maybe you're too pinpointed on photons, to understand the subject at hand. (Optics is this professor's strong suite, judging from his other book.) Most physics books at least discribe the different baryonic particles, or the four forces that govern the Universe.  But nearly the WHOLE BOOK explores quantum mechanic theories. He even throws the forumulas in there. The math isnt whats hard, its what the formulas are SAYING that's so strange. Even Einstein found this theory, with probibilities instead of steady states, distasteful. (God doesnt play dice with the Universe, refers to the probibilities instead of certainties.)<br /><br />THe book can't be faulted for being unfocused.  Virtual particles are covered for instance, in pretty deep detail.  But as for quarks, its apparently assumed you know all about them. Particle spin is covered, when he wants to cover quantum teleportation. But what this spin on quarks is, he spends literally two or three sentences explaining. He explores the teleportation of photons,  and the superposistion of states in unobserved particles, which may lead some day to quantum computers. OR, not.  It might lead to teleportation of information faster than light speed. OR, not. Quantum physics, unlike classical physics, has few practical applications at this point in the game. You can use Feyman diagrams (yeah, they're in here) to prove the existence of virtual particles. (Even particles unobserved in atom smashers.)  Maybe because this uncertainly principle at the heart of Quantum Mechanics delves into philosophical contingencies like Ontology, phenominology, and causality, causes most popular science writers to keep explanations minimal at best. If you're familiar with Roger Penrose's mammoth book THE ROAD TO REALITY, where he attempts to cover ALL of modern physics, Penrose just gives 30 odd pages on the quantum measurement paradox. (Its a 1000+ page book, so even Penrose avoids delving deeply into this subject for non-physicists.)<br /><br />My final point is this: If you are looking for some info about particle physics, black matter, relativity, Newtonian physics, M- theory  (strings), supersymetry, Unified Theories, Quantum Gravity waves, cosmology, singularities, branes, you will not get that information here. There's only a whisper about paralell universes ( as a way to consider all possiblities for a particle's path). However, if you want to hear, in precise detail, about Quantum tunneling, the Heisenburg uncertainty principle, quantum entanglement, Virtual particles, the Quantum Zeno Effect, Wave-particle duality, and the Copenhagen interpretation, you found your book! And, as far as explaining these ideas, he does do a stellar job. I have a nagging feeling tho, that it helps if you already have an idea what these concepts refer to.<br />Also, there's a glossery of terms in the back, but NO INDEX! (Which makes it hard to refer back to a page where some concept is previously explained.) I didnt rip off my eyelids to read this, and no doubt knowing a subject as bizarre as Quantum mechanics, is good for the mind, if not the soul. But this isn't a fun read, even WITH the dog jokes.  Maybe its best used as a refresher book, for physics students who already learned this info in college, but forgot it, and want a quick, thorough overview.ose just gives 30 odd pages on the quantum measurement paradox.

0312360266|4.0|I had finished reading the Twilight series and the Mortal Instruments series and was looking for a new book series that was along the same lines. I had seen this one in the store several times but passed it up everytime. Finally I looked it up online and it has some mixed reviews but as a pagan myself I was intrigued by the pagan/Goddess themes and decided to check it out.    First let me begin by saying I actually really enjoyed the idea of the story and that is probably why I am giving it 4 stars even though it quite possibly should be lower. It was a very creative idea and I actually got into the story and wanted to see what would happen.    Sadly though I think they fell a bit short. The entire time I was reading it I just got this feeling that it was a really good book that had been dumbed down. I am an adult (almost 28 lol) and I do enjoy the occasional YA novel. The good ones have an honest feeling to them. This one just felt like it was a rewritten pieced together idea made for a younger audience and it annoyed me a bit. Perhaps if I had read this when I was much younger I would have enjoyed it more but I still do not think it would have been my favorite.    Yet on the flip side (of being dumbed down) it does have alittle bit of a sexuality in it. I felt alittle strange since it was written by a mother and daughter. I am not a prude in the least. I have even written erotic stories but it felt very weird and out of place in the book. See the spoiler below for some more on that.    Anyways I did really enjoy the magic/Goddess themes within the book and I think that they actually handled almost all of it perfectly and made it even very beautiful and definitely something you could picture/feel.     I guess that just my biggest issue is that it just wasn't developed enough. Which I think is sad. And made it really no where near as good as it could have been.    I will check out the second book and see if it is any better and perhaps finish the series off even.***Mini Spoiler**  There was a scene near the front of the book that had attempted(?) oral sex in it. Part of the problem was that this one scene was brought up again and again throughout the book. The scene itself wasn't horrible but maybe if they had stopped talking about it and in such weird ways too lol    There was also quite a bit of references to drug and alcohol use. In the very first chapter the girl begins by talking about her alcoholic boyfriend. Every time you then see him he is drunk/high! It isn't that I have a problem with that in stories at all but it just felt strange to me.
0552152927|5.0|To claim that Rincewind is a great wizard is not really honoring the truth. He wears a pointy head, that's true,  and he knows some magic. That is to say: he knows exactly one spell. Even so he is not really cognizable of what would happen if he ever vocalized it. So, being a true coward and loving it, he never tries. No, he wants to stay out of the big spotlight of life. Because he generally feels that that is so much wiser. Alas, he seems to develop a long-term relationship with that spotlight when he meets Discworld's first tourist Twoflowers. And then I even fail to mention the ever loyal Luggage that follows his master everywhere. Coincidently that is also what trouble seems to do for Rincewind.<br /><br />Having read more than twenty Discworld novels already, I was a bit hesitant when starting to reread the novel that started it all. Terry Pratchett has evolved a lot since that book, and only for the better. I generally advice people to start off with Guards! Guards! if they haven't read any of those wonderful books yet. But then they would miss out on that wonderful coward, named Rincewind. And Luggage. And Twoflower. And those hero's. Nah. Although, Colour of Magic misses a truly exciting storyline -it jumps from over-the-top-situation to another even-more-over-the-top-situation- it still introduces a wonderfully crazy world that makes it all worth the hassle. If you want to read The Light Fantastic, then you must read this first, because it is the only real sequel to a Discworld novel.  Enjoy.

0743298039|1.0|A better use of your time could be spent on burning the book. After having to read this book for my reading class, I've never been full of more anger from reading a BOOK than reading this waist of paper. Pointless rambling of descriptions on every moment that's trying to be expressed to the reader made me want to pull my hair out. The sad part is there's no point at all in the detailed story that's being built and forced down your throat in every sentence. You would think that maybe this is all leading to an amazing moment or glorious point, but leads NOWHERE!    This book is harder to understand than rocket science.   Pointless and a waste of time, I highly recommend reading the manual guide to your toaster before waiting your time here.     A book put into society to gain recognition as a piece of work, that's really a piece of sh**. The power of Barns and Nobel was prostituted in the process of self recognition of the author to make people think this book is worth the while \\"because Barns and Nobel said so\\" is a waste of a power that could be used for good. It makes us reliable customers who rely on an honest place to go for recommendation for reading makes us feel cheep and lied to, like a bad boyfriend.

Eli is wandering around the place lugging a Bible that he reads from lovingly every night, as he listens to his IPod, not you understand, one of those crappy ones that break down after 5 minutes, but one that lasts for 30 years, before he has to recharge it, perhaps it is solar powered or something? Tom Waits was actually tasked with recharging it during the film, but presumably resisted the temptation to load any of his own tunes onto it.   The other thing that everyone has is a supply of cool sunglasses, which is great. I don't know how they do it; I lose mine all the time.     And the last thing you would probably want to see in the post apocalyptic world is some bloke with a Bible. I mean, thinking about all of the wars caused in the name of religion, the Inquisition, the Crusades, oppression of people and cleric abuse, an outbreak of organised religion would be the last thing I would like to see. And what is the big deal? The folk he meets in the town  could have the following conversation. Observe.    Townsman - \\"Howdee stranger, what have you got there?\\"  Eli \\"I have a Bible\\".  Townsman \\"What's that all about then? What happens at the end?\\"  Eli - \\"Why, Revelations, Armageddon, the end of the world!!!\\"  Townsman (expansively indicating the post apocalyptic landscape) \\"Seen it already.\\"     Anyhoo, Carnegie (Gary Oldman) decides that the bible represents a handbook to dominate and oppress and entirely new market segment, and he might well have been right. You see, the survivors of the apocalypse had destroyed every other copy of the Bible in America, so this is the last one.  Even those Gideon ones. Oldman lives in a town centre hotel, he might like to have checked his bedside table, which would have been ironic if there was one there all the time.     Oldman wants the Bible; Washington has a higher calling for it. Shenanigans ensue. There is some chopping, a bit of stabbing, some shooting.     In the end, there is an ironic and moderately unexpected twist, which frankly on first viewing is really outstandingly daft, I mean mega daft, but the point of the film is faith, and so you have to take the silly twist on faith as well, which sort of makes it more bearable.     I really rather liked the post apocalyptic setting of the film, its well done, the washed out colour and the utter devastation is nicely realised. Oldman and Washington are solid in their performances, the fight scenes are well realised without being graphic, for me, who loves the post apocalyptic genre, this was an enjoyable film, and recommended. Mad Max, it is not. More \\"Reasonable Max\\".
0061703257|1.0|Picked up the book in an airport bookshop. The setting is certainly great for this type of paranoia-driven novel. A lunatic asylum set on an island rendered inaccessible by a storm. Yet the setting resembles somewhat an Agatha Christie story which I once read, the inaccessible island, the seemingly lunatic murderer...., the paranoia does not develope but is predictable (the evil psychiatrist, is he a lunatic or a doctore) etc. etc. The characters are dimensionless and who has not guessed the end by the middle of the book - has truly deserved the poor writing and poor plot.
0425200469|4.0|I read AC's as a teenager 30 years ago. I revisited this one because we finally made it to Egypt. Always a good read with period English dialogue and lots of suspects to keep you guessing although I remembered the solution.  Makes me want to find excuses to sit and read during the day instead of waiting till bedtime.  Some may find it a little politically incorrect for our time.

B000LQJS4W|5.0|Pollyanna is about a girl, her aunt Polly and Dr. Chilton.  Pollyanna went to get medicine for aunt Polly and right when she ran across the street a speeding car came rushing around the corner and hit Pollyanna hard enough to knock he out. Then, she went to the hostpital and found out that she was paralized and that she could never walk again. But then Dr. Chilton walked in and said he knew a doctor that could help her walk again. If you want to find out if she can walk again you'll have to read this book. ~ cookies N' cream
B002TVQ4GW|2.0|TRIANGLE is one of those movies I can take or leave.  It tries very hard to be original in plot but ultimately fails to really impress me.  The \\"time paradox\\" or \\"time loop\\" is decent enough, but the film really does not scare or move me.  I have to lump it into that group of films which I'm not sure I'm glad to have seen or not.  I will give the film credit for all the reflection shots of the main character.  Seeing her as double or even triple images really foreshadows the film.  The acting was reasonably solid for the most part, but the story itself seemed to hopelessly grind on to the end.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I love this show. I could not ever get close up like in the video if I was to ever get a chance to see any of her concerts. My girl friends love it too.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Filmed at time at night, the director capture the frightening situations inBagdad and the horror of war in a great  journey.  I thought this movie was one of the most accurate depictions of the war in Iraq. No big stars in the film made it seem almost documentary in it presentation.  One of the best films I've ever seen.
B0030BOCEG|4.0|For as much criticism as HIM have been receiving on their latest effort, I think it's important to remain objective. I have always taken HIM at face value. I don't delve too much into their lyrics nor sound stylings. I think of  them as a purely escapist-melody driven rock band. They are not goth- like Bauhaus or Sisters of Mercy. They're not industrial-like Skinny Puppy or Frontline Assembly. And they're certainly not Depeche Mode or New Order. I think they're heavily influenced by the eighties and assimilate different elements from all genres of that decade and moreover; the seventies hard rock like: Sabath, Zepplin, and Neil Diamond. They're a weird amalgamation of several of Ville's influences. With that being said, it would be unfair to compare them to one particular artist or genre.   Yes, some of Ville's lyrics are cheesy and repetitive (if I had a nickel for every time Ville says \\"love\\" or \\"death\\").  I think they are a thoroughly enjoyable and great band if you listen to them on their own merits, not what other people say they are suppose to be or sound like. Ville often pokes fun of himself for the cheesiness of some of his songs..and that's what I like! Why isn't okay to have a guilty pleasure? Why does everyone take HIM so seriously!   I don't mind that their albums are different from one to the next. They can't recreate Love Metal or Razorblade over and over again, that would be boring. Venus Doom and Screamworks are totally different and that's good...but they have always been kind of cheesy bubble gum pop, especially when you consider that they are labeled Goth...they were never goth and they are never going to be. To call them goth would be to compare them to likes of Mortiis or any other true scandinavian darkwave band. Their old stuff was truly never that heavy, nor goth, nor metal. They have never really departed from what made them HIM. You can find what made HIM, \\"HIM\\", in all their albums and they haven't really diverged to a truly unique and awe-inspiring sound; but then again never has Radiohead or Coldplay done that for all their ridiculous hype and posturing.   I think you have to truly accept these guys as being just an entertaining retro metal band, with several different influences crafting their work, to truly appreciate their music.
1400052173|5.0|I'd like to start by saying thank you Henrietta for your strength, courage and sacrifice; and thank you Rebecca and Deborah and the entire Lacks family for telling us your heartwarming, heartbreaking, captivating and just plain wonderful story. Reading Rebecca's book was like reading an adventure/comedy/tragedy novel all rolled into one -- with one exception: it was a true story! Oh how I never wanted this book to end. I had recently finished reading The Help and was looking for something else that I would enjoy as much and that would make me laugh and cry at the same time; and then I read an article about Rebecca's new book and was instantly determined to know more about this fascinating, heroic woman named Henrietta Lacks. I won't go into detail about the story of Henrietta and her family's life -- that is something everyone should discover for themselves by reading this amazing book. I will just say that I think the author did a terrific job not only in bringing her readers the story of Henrietta and her family, but also in making the science surrounding HeLa and cell research so accessible, easy to comprehend, and enjoyable to read for the everyday person; a job well done indeed and something to be extremely proud of. I wish I could have met Henrietta and her incredible, funny, eccentric, strong and fascinating daughter Deborah; and I would love to meet Rebecca at one of her lectures and thank her in person for this book. I cannot wait to read her next one -- and if she decides to write a novel, well what a treat that will be.
0764207407|5.0|I personally can't imagine anyone NOT loving Sense and Sensibility!! It is a total classic and a wonderful read, no matter if it is your first or hundredth time reading it. The added insights given in this edition just make it all the more enjoyable. I absolutely loved reading those extra bits of information! I especially loved the \\"insights\\" that made me laugh like this one on page 96:<br /><br />  \\"Ranking our dislike: 1. Fanny; 2. John; 3. Marianne- we're growing weary of her sulking.\\"<br /><br />or this one on page 224<br /><br />  \\"We'd kind of forgotten how unpleasant Fanny could be.\\" (with an unhappy smiley face to emphasize the point.)<br /><br />It almost made it feel like I was reading the book with a friend and we were chatting about it and laughing as we went.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed all the extra information about Jane Austen and her life and writing. The insights made a work of art even more beautiful. I highly recommend this edition of Sense and Sensibility - no matter who you are you can't help but love Jane Austen's books!
B000MRAAJM|3.0|The case arrived broken (the little central tongs used to hold a cd/dvd/blu-ray disc in place were snapped).  The disc was loose inside the box but undamaged.  It plays just fine.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with this purchase.  I saved a lot of money buying it online versus in a retail store.  I may switch the case out to prevent future damage to the dvd.
B00127RAJY|5.0|An effective workout.  Saw results after only a week of daily workouts- I'm not in bad shape, but this really kicks my tail.  Jillian Michaels style is motivationg- more fitness mentor than drill-instructor, and the fact that the workouts are short makes it easier to jump in and do it.  Do wear good shoes, though.  Lots of jumping, squats and lunges.  You'll kill your knees if you wear junk shoes for this.
B001KZI2WW|5.0|My husband owns the Santa Cruz canvas shoe as well as the Santa Cruz corduroy shoe and there is a HUGE difference in fit.  There is NO ARCH SUPPORT in the corduroy pair and the corduroy pair seems to fit tighter.  Not as comfortable as the canvas pair at all.  I am not sure why this is.  We are returning the corduroy pair and searching for the fabulous arch support and comfort the canvas pair offers.  He loves his original canvas pair so much, he's worn them out.  I love them too, but they're about four sizes too big for me.  I can't find a men's pair small enough for me and I haven't found them in a women's shoe yet.
B0000640S1|5.0|First Blood was Sylvester Stallone's first entry into the Vietnam War vet genre. It was note worthy for many reasons. Championing the need to address Vietnam vet problems in a return to society, reducing the intro to the heroes character & leaving the body of the film for the confrontations, scenes well done such as the escape, the hideaway, the sheriff's station & the shooting done around the town of Hope not to mention the great scenes filmed of the Canadian wilderness.<br /><br />John Rambo is a Vietnam vet that can't find a decent job & isn't sure why (as he states \\"in the field I was in charge of millions of dollars worth of equipment). Traveling into the northwest to visit an old army buddy he discovers the buddy died from Cancer (Agent Orange here). Wondering through Hope, Oregon Rambo meets the local Sheriff. He & his office do not like long hair & outta work bums. In other words if you look incompetent, smell incompetent & get tagged incompetent by this power fed country boy. You are open game. He is after all the law & the law overrules all.<br /><br />The target here though is a Green Beret. One of the most highly decorated Green Berets from the Vietnam War. He didn't work as a team. His job was to operate as a lone wolf. Searching for & removing Vietcong leaders wherever they could be found. His survival skills are immense. His reaction to attack is lethal.<br /><br />Green Berets are made & used by the US Government. That's Col. Trautman's entry for this show. Col. Trautman comes out to do damage control on one of the army's rampaging beasts according to the Sheriff. You get to make up your own mind on why Trautman's there though. A strong Vietnam era statement was made by this movie. I remember the talk on the street afterwards. The storyline in the movie is so well handled. I hear stuff like \\"I read the book & it's not like the movie\\". So- this is a movie review. The plot is good even if there is 6 books or no book.<br /><br />The acting in this show is what put it up for 5 stars from me. Stallone plays the brooding, physically dominant, pool of deep anger that is somehow bewildered & almost innocent so well. Brian Dennehy & Jack Starrett as a Sheriff Office tag team are unequalled. Richard Crenna who was a last second replacement plays the role of the Devil's henchman as he did in Body Heat. He was a great late arrival. You even get a part out of David Caruso who is a lot more famous now. Bill McKinney as the State Police Capt. had little to do here but performed well in what he was given to do.<br /><br />5 STARS for a 1982 film!s from me.

1401302378|5.0|This book, The Long Tail, is absolutely fascinating!  With an ample supply of charts, graphs, facts and statistics, it explains and confirms the transformation of the marketplace that has been taking place around us.  Although we all are no doubt already aware of this phenomenon in a general sense (hey, I'm typing this on Amazon, aren't I?), this book brilliantly and concretely articulates the full effect of this across a number of markets/industries/cultures.  Also amazing is how readable this book is; the author's style is such that you just have to open the book and gaze on the pages; the words jump off the page, enter your eyes and hit your brain with full effect.  There does seem to be a bit of repetition and redundancy here and there throughout the book, but it's probably necessary to achieve the full effect.  Most business books are dry; this one is not.  Before finishing the book, I found myself already quoting its facts to others (Hey, did you know... / Guess how many...).  At other times, I was so stricken by a passage in the book, that I had to put it down and pace the floor thinking about the implications (Hey, is it just me?).  The ironic thing is that by giving this review, I have now become part of the phenomenon! Five Stars!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'm late getting my opinion about last year's \\"Trek\\" film out there, but having watched the DVD last night for the second time, I had to admit it. This re-boot, as I've seen it called, accomplishes an amazing feat. It takes an almost fifty year old show that's suffered diminishing returns and reviews over the years at the hands of Paramount bean-counters and cheesy actors (and sets) and somehow makes it all fresh again. We have to take a brief trip back to see just how big this leap forward was...    To me, \\"Star Trek V\\" was the movie's body slam to the whole franchise, and all I can say for the sixth film is that at least it gave the crew a more noble chance to sign off with some grace. Then anything resembling the sense of wonder and exploration and camaraderie was lost amid the \\"Next Generation\\" political correctness, with ham came from Ryker, and cheese from Jordi's glasses and the nauseating Wil Wheaton.. The Trek I knew as a wide eyed six year old was gone. Dead. While \\"Voyager\\" could be amazing in it's fusion of intellect and last-seasons action under the terrific Mulgrew, \\"Enterprise\\" seemed to be playing to an empty living room. Fans had moved outside into the sunlight and fresh air.    Until now. \\"Star Trek 2009\\" needed some new blood and fresh meat. It proves to us that the characters themselves, while associated with the original actors, are not irreversibly tied after all. Think of them as coloring book characters-- all another actor has to do is stay within the lines, and they can still work. Zoe Saldana gives Uhura the moxie and charm that Nichols rarely got the opportunity to showcase, and Pine reeks of swagger and passion that Shatner long ago abandoned. Quinto brings new life to the inner conflict that once defined Spock, and Urban should have received some kind of award nomination...somewhere De Kelley is smiling. As much as Pegg brought a smile with Scotty's familiar brogue, his character was more comedic, and was overwritten, as if to make up for not being introduced with the others.    The plot almost has to involve time-travel, and I won't put spoilers here just because it's been out for a while. There are a couple of holes you could drive a truck through but thats the peril of time travel stories, and it still proves a powerful enough- if flawed- tool to move the 60's idealism into today's post-Bush hopefulness.    My feelings for this movie can be summed up in one scene..Cho, as Sulu, is navigating the Enterprise to a tricky post-warp vantage point within the clouds of Titan near Saturn. We see, in an almost \\"Ten Commandments\\" worthy moment of music and effects, the ship rise from the clouds, strong and capable and ready to carry out its mission. I admit it-- I got a chill of giddiness and second childhood, and something else. Pride? How can one be proud of a fictional vessel, a computer-generated image? That's when I knew....Abrams did the impossible. \\"Trek\\", and all the lofty things it represented under all that plywood and polyester, was alive again. We're later treated to seeing her again in something she peculiarly has been denied until now; true full-throttle battle kickass.    I guess all I can say after all that is thanks, Mr. Abrams. I loved \\"Trek\\" as much as I hate \\"Lost\\", And that says a lot.
0307269981|5.0|This book is such a great and entertaining read. Having read the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo first, this book was a faster read for me. There are not as many charactors to keep up with so the story takes over.
0312370849|2.0|The historical part of the novel is interesting and when history is writing the novel it is at its best.  In the early part of the novel the super short choppy chapters are distracting, but the story and characters are interesting enough to overcome it.  You can even overlook the obvious problem of Zoe who is supposedly 11 but is written with the maturity of an adult.  But when the main character turns maniacally obsessive about a person she never met that died over 30 years ago the book turns into a sloppy, wandering mess.  I could barely get through the last couple (again, irritatingly super short) chapters.  The characters at the end were pathetic and I was irritated because this could have been a great novel, instead it was just a waste of time.
0545123267|5.0|This book is one of my favorites! Right after I finished it I wanted more from the author but the next book hasn't come out yet so, I reread Shiver. I even did a paper on this book (I'm in college) and my professor and some of my fellow classmates said that they now wanted to read this book. First, the cover is absolutely gorgeous. Maggie Stiefvater creates two teenage characters that are both very relatable and humorous, and their love story is a step above normal teen romance. If your tired of all the Edward and Bella hype then let Grace and Sam take you into their golden woods because Shiver will NOT disappoint!
B0000027K7|5.0|Among the many fantastic shows I was fortunate enough to attend at New York's Fillmore East was a great double bill, Jack Bruce & Friends and Leslie West/Mountain. For those who never had the super fantasmagloria experience of attending The Fillmore East, I can only offer my sincere condolances. The place was pure magic. The show I'm referring to took place on a bitter cold and snowy Saturday night in early 1970. The scene in and around the theater was electric, or maybe it was something we injested on our way there that made it so. Either way I'll never forget seeing all the very young street urchins mingling about, ragged clothes and dirty faces, begging for spare tickets. The cabs jockeying for position along Second Ave and the sounds of The Rolling Stones singing \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" on The PA system. It all made for a fanciful almost \\"Dickinsonian\\" like atmosphere.   Jack Bruce and Friends was made up of Bruce on bass and vocals, Larry Coryell on electric lead guitar, Mitch Mitchell on drums and Fleix Pappalardi on various string instuments and percussion. The set consisted of mostly jazz instumentals with a few selections from Bruce's debut solo album, \\"Songs For A Tailor\\". Great stuff throughout and a most appropriate opening for the \\"shock & awe\\" electric thunder to follow with Mountain.  Mountain's second album \\"Climbing\\" was released about three weeks prior to the Fillmore concert. The big hit single \\"Mississippi Queen\\" was climbing the charts and the beautiful Jack Bruce/Pete Brown ballard \\"Theme For An Imaginary Western\\" was also getting some airplay. Mountain was playing before a hometown audience, (he being a native of Long Island. Remember The Vagrants?) and having a ball with the crowd. The set was super high energy and thunderously loud....My ears are still ringing.    All in all I still find \\"Climbing\\" to be Mountain's most satisfying recording. Perhaps I'm a bit prejudice as a result of having seen them perform most of the materiallive on that wonderful evening at The Fillmore East. I still get chills hearing \\"Imaginary Western\\", \\"Never In My Life\\", \\"Boys In The Band\\" and the great acoustic guitar tour de force, \\"The Laird\\". When I hear this stuff it takes me back to that surreal wintery night on New York's lower East-Side. Those were the days my friend...Now if only my ears would stop ringing!
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|I am a male software developer who has no sense of fashion whatsoever.  Yet, regardless of how remote the milieu of this documentary is from my own world, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and highly recommend it to anyone who has any passion for what they do.<br /><br />\\"The September Issue\\" is a story about two people with a passion for the creation of beauty, Anna and Grace.  They tustle with one another, and the outcome is an utterly satisfying one.<br /><br />It is very subtly told, though.  There is no Michael Moore, here, bashing one over the head with the message.  The denoument is accomplished with one observation that a participant makes in the closing minutes of the film.<br /><br />One review made a comment about Anna's lack of personality based on the lady's interview with David Letterman.  I did not see that interview, but Anna's depth of feeling behind her reserve is readily apparent in the documentary, especially in a scene featuring her daughter.

B002L5810I|5.0|I had been searching for this DVD for some time and found it at a reasonable price from the seller in the Philippines.  I was worried the DVD might be a poor quality copy, but I was completely wrong.  The sound and the picture were excellent on my HD television.  It looks like it was made yesterday.  I mainly wanted this DVD because it has what I believe is the only full length version of Smooth Criminal, one of my favorite MJ songs and videos.  I was not disappointed and the other scenes are fun as well.  If you are an MJ fan, definitely add this to your collection.
B002WCLG3O|2.0|Im giving this a 2-star rating not because I hate it, or think its worthless, but because I think it was less than average and did not live up to the standard set with Halo productions.    To begin with, I enjoyed Origins I & II and how they went back to cover the far history of the Haloverse.  Some things I wondered about the accuracy on, but comforted myself saying \\"Frank O'Conner was here to look over everything so im sure everything holds with cannon\\".  I believed this up until I noticed things like, they killed something like 8 or 9 Spartans over the course of the shows.  When you start out with only 75 to begin with, and almost all are accounted for, I believe they took liberties with the bodycount.  I will go back and look into it, and if im wrong i will revise and post that.  But then you had things like Spartan 23 and Spartan 1337, it doesnt mesh.  Not to mention (maybe entirely explained by its title) Odd One Out is almost a parody of all things Halo, dropping a Spartan on a planet of dinosaurs and kids and writing it as if its a Dragonball spin off.  After playing all the games (many times), reading the books, trying to fill in pieces that arent cleary stated, (ive read all the 'marathon man' scripts in Halo 3 and such), I was hoping that at least one of these animated shorts would be more story driven and deep and revealing. Instead the majority of the stories were just about racking up the highest body count and having the most flashing lights.  Also little things like animating 50 foot tall hunters or 20 foot tall brutes was just absurd.    After taking the time to point all this out ill say that Im only covering its shortcomings because if you like Halo you will want to see it, and it doesnt have any outstanding \\"awesome\\" points to focus on.  Im not saying its horrible, just be prepared to be let down in several places while enjoying others.  I do hope this trend (and ill quote from one of the shows)  \\"Less talking, More action!\\" isnt the direction the franchise takes now that it has been moved over to Microsofts hands.  After watching the entire thing, I would still buy it again if I had it to, I just feel they could have done a much better job with the project.
B001QBXFTA|5.0|I first listened to these performances on LPs in the 1970's.The Haydn quartets from Opus 20 on are just one gem after another. I have enjoyed them so much that eleven years ago I started learning the cello. It is a wonderful experience to play along with these quartets. If you are looking for a almost complete collection of the Haydn string quartets, the price of this box is superb. The music is well recorded. Excellent musicians.
B002NV9AH8|1.0|Another pompous prog rocker with nothing to say, but doesn't mind saying it! this one is the least of all with no real playing skill , no improvisational ability, and an ear for saccharine melody almost as bad as band mate phil collins, I would call this album second hand smoke, or absbestos, : avoid exposure to all !

B000001FBW|5.0|You just can't deny Kiss their due. If a progressive rock and jazz guy like me can love Kiss, anyone can.<br /><br />Sure, part of this is mistique: the make up and pumping guitars and fire blowing define Kiss as part of 1970s specticle rock, when the music blasted full out of every arena in every America city almost every night, and kids still rounded the cornor to by the latest hard rock albums<br /><br />But all the early--and best--hits of Kiss are on this album. What strikes me hearing it is how good even showbiz rock was in the 1970s. This is before bands like Loverboy and Bon Jovi synthed power pop up. The songs on here are not going to compete with King Crimson, but in a world of digitally compressed guitars and fifty bands that you can't tell from one another, these Kiss rock sides sound fantastic.

B00116FT6M|5.0|I loved this movie so much more than I expected. I was reluctant to see it in the theater, but I took a chance with it here and was pleasantly surprised. The humor is great, the music stays with you and the characters are lovable. At first I simply rented the video, but I nearly had a hear attack when I went to rent it a second time and it was unavailable. When it became available again I bought it.     This is simply a good time, mood lifting movie that will definitely have you singing the songs at work the next day (I know I found myself singing \\"Without Love\\" at a meeting the next morning--a meeting where everybody was in a crappy mood; I was still on the high from the movie).

I watched the video with the alternate ending and I will say that the ending was too graphic and not necessary. She could have just sat there and I would have been seriously freaked out.

B000001ESF|5.0|2112...what an album.  Released in 1976, this progressive hard rock album by Rush just plain rocks all around.  With an epic-length seven-part title track and five other normal-length songs, this album seems to have a little of everything rolled into one.  The title track is so varied from part to part.  You'll hear some heavy metal, some softer and slower rock, and a huge hard rocking grande finale appropriately titled \\"Grand Finale\\".  Besides the title track, my other favorites on this album are The Twilight Zone, Lessons, and Something For Nothing.  The song Tears is extremely mellow and good.  Rush is known for throwing fans a change-up once in a while (think Rivendell off the Fly By Night album).<br /><br />Very simply, if you wanna rock, buy this classic Rush album.  Bassist and singer Gary Weinrib (aka Geddy Lee) is at his best on vocals.  This is when Lee's voice sounded the best, in my opinion - the mid to late '70s.
020530902X|3.0|I bought this book as one of the textbooks for a class. It is a pocket size book, and as an international graduate student I find it very useful, specially because English is not my mother language and I have to write many papers for different classes and scientific articles.

B00337KMAA|5.0|People will call Avatar and Inglourious Basterds the purest entertainment of 2009. Those are my other 2 favorite films of the year, behind \\"Up In The Air\\". I walked into this film with relatively low expectations, thinking it was going to be the big overrated Oscar sensation of the year, and was hugely wrong on that prediction. Instead, I was given a film with a flawless balance of comedy and drama. That's right, absolutely flawless. This is one of those rare films in which the characters are the ones running the movie, and not the story line. Although the story is fascinating in every way, it's the chemistry between the films ensemble that makes this film work so well that it's placed in an atmosphere of respect I give to very few current films. If you can say that the characters are honestly the most interesting thing about the entire movie, then you are one step in the right direction of making an excellent film because most characters and their dialogue is strictly filler in most films nowadays. \\"Up In The Air\\" feels wonderfully authentic and the story's entire execution is as sharp as any other. It's just as hysterical as it is tragic, which is a difficult task that's almost impossible to accomplish. The film sets up about every contrived dramedy cliche imaginable and then completely side steps every single one, giving you one of the most enjoyable and clever films you've seen in a while. Simply put, this is a smart film about smart people- for smart people.
B000002P7R|2.0|2 1/2    Considering the fact that solo enthusiasts could probably listen to this man's bathroom ruminations with baited breath makes many of these throwaways severely good trash, even on one of his more cheaply exploited compilations devoid of fresh content.
0930289234|5.0|Read this a few years ago. First graphic novel I read for pleasure (read Maus for a history class). Terrific story and images. Highly recommend. The movie did some justice to the story but do yourself a favor and read the novel.
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|one of there best albums by far, everysong is great. great riffs, drums & vocals. this band is gonna keep setting the bar for metal to come.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I can't believe it.  Why the low marks?  Was the movie too disturbing for some of you \\"reviewers?\\"  Couldn't face the stuff that hurt, could you?  Or did you want an updated smart-ass Star Wars?  What I couldn't believe or even imagine is that lead actor Sharlto Copley improvised all of his dialogue in the movie!!  Pure brilliance.  He developed his character from a worm of a human being into a surprising and well-earned hero of the very first magnitude.  The lead protaganists' pure hate, evidenced by their constant pursuit to the death, if need be, of the lead character, is a perfect portrayal of the hate that exists on this planet in reality, not in just a fantasy situation.  You guys just wanted to be entertained and hopefully scared out of your wits, or to see some great special effects .... boring boring boring.  However, when a film is multi-layered, and, yes whether or not we like it ... political, our usual 12-year-old mind set turns off and we cry because we didn't see enough bad aliens doing bad things to good earth people.  I'm learning the longer I live that there are a lot of bad earth people who are greedy, relentlessly evil and openly despicable.  You don't need to go far to see ugliness on other planets when you have it right in your own backyard. Great film.

B001R0KH3W|5.0|I own this show on DVD. The show is wonderful and Stevie Wonder sings all the time. In some songs, the audience participate so much that I think that to an artist it should be the best of the worlds, I mean, when their songs are singed by the audience. GREAT SHOW!

B001GCUO5M|5.0|Martin Scorscese's \\"Shutter Island\\" recieves Masterpiece Rating. One star means don't bother, two stars means wait till it comes out in pan and scan on HBO. Three stars means see it at the theater and rent the dvd. Four stars means  see it twice at theater and buy dvd. Five stars means the film transcends it's genre, ( in this case it is important to note this is an ADAPTATION of a novel. see it more than twice, buy the blu ray and immediately listen to the directors commentary upon first viewing. (smiling)  Only a Director of Scorscese's stature could command the resources to adapt Dennis Lahane's novel. Dubbed alternately \\"speculative\\" fiction, or \\"meta\\" fiction, the film captures the elusive gravity of the original prosaic presentation.  Make this movie with ten directors, and of course, you would have ten versions. I can only comment on the Scorscese version, NOT the one that film critics or Lahane fans wanted to be made.  In another directors hands, the films style, aided by long time Scorscese collaborators in Production, Casting, Art Direction, Director of Photography, Musical Score, and Costumes, would border on parody. In the master's hands, it becomes the finest adaptation of a novel into a \\"Thriller\\" yet made.  If one were to name the 20th century, in particular, the first half of the 20th century, my nomination would be \\"Century of the Psyche\\". Medical Science faced and empirically proved the validity, and reality of the soul, the psyche. It was also the American Century  It is fitting then, that the film takes place in the 1950's in America.   The story centers around a Federal Marshall, Teddy Daniels, and a new partner \\"from the Seattle office\\", Chuck, journeying on a prison ferry, to an island 11 miles off the coast of Massachusets.  Investigating the disappearance of a female prisoner, we soon learn that Daniels lobbied for the assignment, and that he has an agenda of his own, involving the arson death of his beloved wife.  The late Doors frontman and singer, Jim Morrison, in a paper he wrote while attending UCLA film school, remarked that film attempted two basic things. To present Dreams as \\"real\\" life, or to portray \\"real\\" life in a dreamlike quality. \\"Shutter Island\\" acheives the rarified status of fusing the two categories.   Disappointingly, after a week of so-so reviews nonetheless not having the slightest effect on a 40 million dollar plus opening, a marketing blitz mentioning \\" a twist \\" causes the slightly more than normal intelligent viewer to arm themselves with guesses and hunches that distract from the artistic genius of the film.   Regardless, the film delivers in every category.   English, it is said, was a gift to the world in that the language, fluid and protean, ever changing, describes more accurately than all others, emotion. It is in the emotional expression of that language that Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar worthy performance outdoes any other in this, the fourth collaboration with Scorscese.  A note: the symbol of the Monster arising from the collective Psyche of the human race has a simple origin. It is simply the soul's snapshot of its own \\"unfinished Self\\". Searching for, finding, and coming to terms and integrating the Monster, is a Hero's Journey, and Teddy Daniels is heroic.   Left guessing between real and fantasy, dream and reality, hallucination and actual, we accompany Teddy on his journey.  At the end of our journey, we are left with our own unfinished Self. Asking the same question Daniels does to his partner Chuck. \\"Is it better to die a Monster, or to live as an Honest Man?\\"  Owing to Scorscese's and DiCaprio's Stellar efforts, and Lahane's genius in donating a container to hold and answer the 20th century's greatest question, those affected by this film, will ask it of themselves each time they view the film, and each day as well.  Note; The films final credits roll to a hybrid song combining Dinah Washington's \\"This Bitter World\\" and classical string music. This haunting song presented by Robbie Robertson perfectly encapsulates the journey as well, letting the viewer down gently to go and meditate on the lesson's learned.  A work of unqualified beauty and power, wholly unique in the history of Hollywood Thrillers,it is, I repeat, a Masterpiece.

B001F7MSG6|4.0|The movie revolves around an ancient story of how the human world and the elf/magic world were at war. The Elf king builds a golden menchanical army to ward off the humans. Upon seeing this destruction the king makes a pact with them. He breaks his crown that controls the army into 3 pieces, giving 1 to the humans. His son disagrees and goes into exile. Fast forward to the present, the magic world is dying and man is thriving. Prince Nuada vows to restore his people by claiming all 3 pieces and reigniting the golden army. It's up to Hellboy and the rest of the BPRD to prevent the destruction of man!<br /><br />Del Toro's sequel is rich in detail, amazing sets and strange creatures. Unfortunately, it doesn't surpass the sequel because it is alittle too campy at times. The visuals are stunning and the story compelling. The campiness doesn't hurt the movie and is a must own for Hellboy fans.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: I can't rave enough about how beautiful this transfer is! Universal does it again. The golds, ambers, reds and blues are wonderful. The sound is rich and robust. All special features are ported over. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY!

B000SEI230|5.0|I had to watch the movie for Confirmation and decided to pick up the book as I love to read. I must say I was not expecting the book and movie to be so similar. All in all it was predictable as other reviews have noted but I still enjoyed reading it and would recommend to  anyone.
0439023491|5.0|All I can say is, this book is a \\"cannot put down\\".  I didn't think the second book could be better than the first one in the series, but YES it is better.  Suzanne Collins is an excellent storyteller with an easy writing style that does not take away the depth of emotion the story somehow wraps around you.  I love the book, the story and the characters.
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|I am a huge fan of PT's material (at least their post-[[ASIN:B001O8C5EQ Signify]] albums but The Incident was a great letdown. My main complaint is not the oh-so-proggy concept of an album-long song, but the sections of the song themselves. Steven Wilson was writing sophisticated, beautiful music on their previous album, [[ASIN:B000O75F7C Fear of a Blank Planet]], but the Incident feels stale and dull in comparison to that previous \\"masterpiece\\". Although Mr. Wilson's lyrics have gotten much more eloquent in such a short amount of time, it seems as if this was more of the focus of this album than the music was...and the MUSIC is PT's strength, always has been, always will be.    GRADE: C (75%)

B00319KS7C|3.0|Just a tech problem with the film, but a problematic one since I rented this to watch with friend & didn't have decent external speakers available: the sound was MUCH lower than in most Amazon rentals on my MacBook Pro. Annoying glitch that I will be careful about in the future.<br /><br />The film itself is a Soderbergh 3 star. If you like his work the unreliable narrator trope will delight you-and Matt Damon is just fun & convincing. Many of the supporting cast turn in amusing performances as well.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|This is a great movie. I was wanting to have a copy. The great thing about Amazon is that you can buy these movies for a fraction of the cost of a new one. They are just as good as buying a new one. Thanks Amazon.

0307266303|5.0|This is such a great book on so many levels. I love it when someone turns 'common knowledge' upside down. Similar to Freakonomics. Well written, funny, motivating...and it gets you thinking. I went right to my treadmill and ran barefoot...it felt great!
0307387178|4.0|This book has actually sat on my shelf for over two years.  I purchased it before the movie was released.  I tend to do that around Oscar season.  I visit Ammy-mart (hope you don't mind me using your term Beany) and stock up on all the potential `Best Adapted Screenplay' nominees so that I can get my full of the Oscar race.  I was so busily engorged in `Atonement' and `No Country for Old Men' (and struggling to make it through `Oil', which I wound up giving up on after my daughter pulled out my bookmark and I forgot where I was) that I totally missed getting into `Into the Wild'.  I then saw the movie and, while I enjoyed it, I found it strangely empty in parts and not as poignant as I would have wanted it to be.<br /><br />So, this past week, after rummaging through the 20+ books on my shelf I have yet to read, I decided to engage in some breezy reading before my trip next week (vacation, where I generally tackle some heavier reading), and since this book is just over the 200pg mark it seemed to fit the bill.<br /><br />It sure was breezy, but it was far more poignant and meaningful than I expected!<br /><br />For those of you who are familiar, this is the story of Chris McCandless, who, in 1992, was found dead in an abandoned van in the Alaskan wilderness.  What Jon Krakauer does in this thoughtfully constructed biography is detail not only Chris's two year adventure into solitude, but the reasons behind his segregation from society.  One thing I must say is that this paints a different picture for me than the film did.  While watching the film I found Chris to be a purely selfish and arrogant young man, and his foolishness tended to take center stage for me.  I found the rushed attempt in the films final frames to add a layer of redemption to Chris to be far too little too late and highly unbelievable.  When reading this book I was floored as to how much of a fuller picture I received.  To anyone who saw the film and perceived Chris as a joke, I urge you to take the time to read this book.  By understanding the different sides to Chris, one can get a fuller appreciation for what he attempted to do with his life.<br /><br />Yes, he was still very foolish and made some grave mistakes (and he was very stubborn) but he was an extremely smart, funny, sensitive young man who was aggravated by society and almost incensed at the hopelessness one feels, trapped in this cage.<br /><br />His story can be richly rewarding.<br /><br />I loved that Jon makes this a personal thing.  You can feel the connection between the author and the subject.  I will say that the structure of the book (constantly jumping back and forth in time) as well as the insertion of personal accounts and back history of similar situations can be a tad distracting and can take the reader out of Chris's story, but I do understand how they were necessary in lengthening the book (as some have noted, there isn't a LOT of meat to Chris's story) as well as shedding some light on the person Chris was.  Maybe if the book was constructed a little differently it wouldn't have been such a distraction.<br /><br />That said, I still highly recommend this book.  I am not a fan of biographies.  It's funny, because biopics are pretty much my favorite film genre, but I've never enjoyed reading a biography.  They all feel so, factual, but Jon's writing is engrossing and almost novelesque, which adds layers of adventure to Chris's story.<br /><br />My heart goes out to this man's family.  He was a rare soul, and I know he is greatly missed.ok.  By understanding the different sides to Chris, one can get a fuller appreciation for what he attempted to do with his life.

B003629IPW|5.0|I love \\"This Is It.\\" Michael was awesome at 50. He moved better than some of the dancers that were clearly half his age. He can still sing too. I have seen Michael in person with his brothers and as a solo artist. You had to be there and gotten caught up in Michael's web. He knew how to work his audience. I have seen him at his best. This show was going to be hot, no doubt. Check out the stage props they were planning. The sad part is what Michael did to his beautiful face. He was gorgeous back in the day and he ruined it all because he did not love the man in the mirror. That is so sad. He was a tortured sole in all of his brilliance. I will always love you, Michael.

1594488878|5.0|Once again, Hornby has been reading my mind, in this breezy and humorous tale of a man fixated on an obscure singer-songwriter in exile.  My wife surprised me with this book as a gift, and but for the fact she bought it solely based on the author, I'd swear she was trying to tell me something is seriously wrong with our relationship.<br /><br />If you enjoyed High Fidelity or Fever Pitch, or if you're a guy still hanging on to his rock & roll shoes (Springsteen, anyone?, this book is for you. .. and the ending was perfect!!<br /><br />(By the way Nick, the singer is Dirk Hamilton, not Tucker Crowe, and he's alive and well and touring Italy right now.)
B002ZG98J6|4.0|The 'Thief' enters a tough market: expectations have been set by a series of truly outstanding fantasy movies over the last few years, including others that focus on the education of the teenaged protagonist. Few movies from any era can hold their own against some of those modern classics. So, in fairness to this movie, I address it in its own terms only.<br /><br />On the whole, those are pretty good terms. It delivers a wicked stepfather we love to hate, a chaste bit of teen romance with a decidedly un-wimpy female character, good effects (esp. faun and centaur), and exciting adventure. Things have been toned down a bit, for example around the bloodlessness of the fight scenes. I read that as an appeal to a younger, more skittish viewing audience than as real weakness, however. And, although I'm not up on the Greek myths to which it refers, I'm told that it stays close to the classics even when they aren't referenced explicitly. My brother, who had the old stories more freshly in mind, said that the movie's faithfulness to the classics actually made it predictable in a few places. My own objections tend to the more mundane, like wouldn't it raise a few eyebrows to see vast stone sculptures appear overnight in public places? Well, part of the appeal of teen movies lies in the stupidity of the adults involved.<br /><br />Hardly the epic that some viewers seem to expect, this is still a fine bit of popcorn entertainment. It treats the old stories with reasonable respect while rising to high standards of modern moviemaking. Even if it's not one to remember ten years from now (or even one, maybe), it's easy to enjoy in itself.<br /><br /> - wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Why don't the haters stay with movies that are suitable to them, like maybe the powderpuff girls? If your source gave you brains they must have slipped out somewhere along your journey. If you don't have anything nice to say keep your pie hole shut. This movie rocked! Great acting and special effects. Maybe people are narcotized by the average garbage that is spewed out and failed to recognize sheer genius and sensitivity. Gory ..yes. No gratuitous sex...bummer. Decapitations, yes. Maybe they will like the new bruce willis cop comedy instead, that looks really good.
0972169504|5.0|If you're the cash crop in a cube farm, then [[ASIN:0740777351 Scott Adams]] has you covered. But, if you live the life of a grad student, foraging for free food and teetering daily between discovery and despair, then Jorge Cham narrates your life. His academics, both incipient (students) and entrenched (professors) ring true. So does the bizarrely accelerated career of a student, going from a cute little baby Master's student to a grizzled Ph.D. in just a few short years.<br /><br />I don't know whether humanities students will recognize themselves and their culture, but those of us in or from hard science studies will understand just about everything. A few Stanford specifics bring this up short of a truly universal experience - but they bring to mind the specifics of my school, so maybe they aren't so far off the mark.<br /><br />The only problem with reading this book is that I now have to go get the others. Darn you, Dr. Cham, for making me spend my money that way!<br /><br />- wiredweird

B0000074CU|2.0|This is an embarrassing disc in the fine Rory G. canon. He's out of tune on almost every cut, and the poor playing of the other two guys in the band shows you why Rory dumped them for better players. The lengthy blues numbers have every bad cliche of that era. Fans of Rory are directed to Irish Tour '74 as a superior example of Rory at his best.....

I mean, in this special edition, the cover is the same of Thriller: Just Michael. This photo, with the little tiger is inside. The extra tracks are great and the photos inside too.
B0026P3G12|5.0|a great cd. I would recommend it to anyone.I have been thrilled with susan ever since she beggan on tv.  hoping for more recordings.
0385736002|4.0|A friend recommended this series to me as \\"the next Harry Potter\\". I don't think these books are quite as good but I did enjoy them. I think part of what was missing for me was the quaint \\"English-ness\\" of the Potter books - the characters of Josh and Sophie Newman are a little too...modern or American or...something. It might also be that I am not actually a young adult and thus not the primary target audience. But I liked the Nicholas Flamel character and I loved the introduction of so much actual mythology and history - it was fun to wikipedia the various characters and get more of their backstory.    Overall I recommend this book - it's a fast and satisfying read.
B00154GEFU|3.0|After suffering and eventually selling Silent Nation, I decided that I was through with Asia.  But wait!  The original members are back together!  Could this be the effort that wins me back?  Mmmmmmmmmnot really.  Gone is the annoying at times vocals of John Payne and John Wetton is back, but with disappointing results.  Is it better than Silent Nation?  Yes.  Does it deliver that old Asia smell?  Sort of.  Musically, the music shows the flashes of brilliance but is mostly bland.  What kind of bothered me were the overly idealistic lyrics.  Granted, I grew up as an idealistic teenager and Asia's first 3 albums were easy for me identify with and I just couldn't get enough.  Even today I still listen to their early work with a sense of nostalgia and I find myself enjoying both the music and the song.  Apparently I grew up but Asia didn't.  If the music was more adroit then I might forgive the juvenile lyrics, but since the former isn't, then I can't do the latter.  If this album were released when I was 12 or 13 years old, then I would be proclaiming it as one of my favorite albums of all time. Unfortunately listening to it now, I just couldn't connect with what I was hearing.  Don't get me wrong, there is some good stuff on this album, but instead of a trip back to the good old days I was hoping for, it left me feeling old.  Maybe I'm jaded and my musical tastes have matured, but after listening to this album the first couple of times straight through I was ready to write another bad review, however the shuffle function on my MP3 player saved it from that.  Recomended for Asia fans only.

B0026P3G12|2.0|This woman has a beautiful voice and is a sheer joy to listen to. But after several cuts the album becomes a durge, almost depressing. She really needs to put some life and excitement into future recordings and give us songs that are up-beat and fun to listen to. If not, she'll be like so many others - that woman who sang that nice song on stage once upon a time, you know, what's her name.

031606792X|5.0|I realize the over-exposure of these books and movies, and people love to hate that. And I agree, they are pretty cheesy at times. But they are wonderful. If you want to escape to another world.....if you want to live in a fairy tale....the Twilight books will take you there. I don't know what it is....I can't say that the writing is the best from a critical point of view.....but it does what it needs to. Sometimes we just need a book or series that has no intellectual purpose except that it will take us away from reality and into a world we would only dream about. It is good for the soul!!! My own mother hasn't read a book in probably 25 years and I FORCED her to pick up twilight.....and she's now read all for books in less than a month. She has finally turned off the tv and now has her nose in a book every night. That's the kind of thing it will do for you. It's NOT just for teens or sappy women! I am giving this book 5 stars because I believe it really does something magical to you when read it.......it taps into something that women's souls have been yearning for.......and I urge you, if you are on the fence, to just let go of everything and get lost in this old-fashioned fairy tale love story. If you love to use your imagination.....you will love it. : )

0385528752|5.0|I'm trying to become a reformed self-help book junkie; I've read a lot of great books but without putting them to practice, so... Switch is great at addressing exactly that - how to step out and make changes that we know we need to make. The writing is down to earth enough to not sound preachy or condescending. The actual processes that are laid out to truly make change, even when those changes are like climbing barbed wire, an attainable and desirable event. I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs some great, reliable, straight forward means to break out of their barriers and boundaries and finally make those changes!

0393312836|5.0|I'll preface this review by saying that before I read the book I had seen the movie, so I did have some prior knowledge disposing me as I delved into this fine piece of literature.    The movie is a wonderful interpretation of the book, but, like most instances when a book is converted into a movie, the movie does not fully capture the book's raw, unbridled brutality nor the intensity of its incisive criticism of totalitarianism, profligate consumerism, and youth culture, nor does it raise quite the same questions regarding the ethics of controlling morality.     The book is narrated through the eyes of Alex - recalcitrant youth extraordinare. He and his gangs he tenderly calls \\"Droogs\\" galivant around, inciting chaos, creating mayhem, and carrying out heinous acts of violence that they convey through a rather facetious slang called nasdat. The slang itself is indicative of their situation - it's ironic, brutal, and a bit unsensical and serves to mitigate the overt cruelty of their acts, which, until part two, range from beatings, theft, and even rape which they execute with a disturbing enjoyment. However, a deeper examination of Alex's character reveals perhaps Burgess' intended assertion: Modern youth culture is defined by its meaningless shenanigans (in this case amplified to the extremes of violence, however the droogs do not see it as such), a shallow morality, an egocentric personality, and a seemingly meaningless purpose in life. Burgess only intenifies such a culture through the book's autocratic government. Each adult is forced to work, life has little to no significance in the grand scheme of things. Indeed, Alex's morality is implied to be corrupted via his vapid future.     Alex's fortunes shift after he is arrested and convicted of murder following a raid of an affluent old woman. However, he finds his niche in prison, and endears himself to the prison's chaplain, and is afforded utilities that other prisoners are not. Ironically, Alex's prison settingis almost idyllic for him - a stark contrast to the gritty streets in which he ruled. Yet, a new prisoner is implemented into Alex's cell, and a subsequent brawl leads to another indictment of murder for Alex.     His following punishment serves as Burgess primary form of commentary on the totalitarian state. Alex is subjected to psychological conditioning by association. By pairing savage scenes with a nausea inducing serum, Alex is inculcated to have an averse biological reaction when he thinks of violence - and tangentially, classical music which he adores. The novel's central theme is henceforth revealed - Is it ethical to restrict the free impulses of man if it benefits society as a whole?     Without revealing too much of the rest for those of you who have not read it yet, Alex's apparent cure is not all that it seems.     All in all this was a tremendous book to read, and I quite enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys dystopic type settings and novels whose themes deal with broader social issues. Be warned however, it is not for the squeamish nor the faint of heart. A Clockwork Orange is one brutal, yet satisfactory read.

0670021652|5.0|Elizabteh Gilbert's book, Committed, is one of the best books I have read. I couldn't put it down! She really dives into the history of marriage and what makes for a healthy relationship. If you are thinking about getting engaged, married or already married - this is a great book to reflect on your relationship. It's funny, informative, personal and all around a great read. Enjoy!
0786915749|4.0|This book is reviting.  It brings you into the adventure from the first page, giving you the history along the way.  The mystery of the travelers destination, the depth of each character, and the detailed description of the scenery are amazing.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|This is a great set of original music- I heard her first on an NPR interview, and I've purchased and given away 5 disc's to my friends. A very seductive voice coupled with great backup. Cuts 2,3,5,8 and 12 are my favorites, but they're all strong and instantly identifiable.
B0030B621W|5.0|Great move for those who are sick of the shallow plot standard Hollywood fare.  Witty, smart, fun.  See it now.
B00005QXXO|5.0|I feel that this really is a great live album.  It is especially great for the value that it is selling for, $1-$2 before shipping.  There are only 8 songs on this album, but the album is just over 40 minutes.  All of the songs are just as good or better than their album versions.      The highlights of this album are definitely I Might Be Wrong, The National Anthem, and Idioteque. That said, all of the songs are great, and I would say even the songs that aren't my favorite from the Amnesiac album are reworked for the live version and sound great.    I definitely recommend this album for fans of the Kid A/Amnesiac era of Radiohead.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The same great PS3 controller now with the return of the rumble force feedback that wasn't included in the first PS3 controller. A must have for any game that supports force feedback.

0446567329|5.0|Bought this book for my 16 year old daughter and she couldn't stop talking about it.  It sent her through all sorts of emotions and even triggered a few tears.  She said it was a lot better than the movie, so now I may just have to give it a read as well.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I was a bit of a skeptic when it came to this story and this film.  I have a 4 year old daughter and she LOVES Princesses.  I was absolutely thrilled to see an African American girl as the main character of this ilm and that it was set in the burgeoning period of jazz in New Orleans.  The GREAT things about this film are too numerous to mention; the songs are ALL fantastic (they get stuck in your head and my daughter's head); the animation is absolutely beautiful and, for someone who likes to spare his kid from nightmares, I found the evil Dr. Facilier to be one of the better bad guys Disney has ever created.  The shadows are a bit scary for the young ones, but no more scary than Ursula from Little Mermaid or the old hag from Snow White.      The thing about this film is that it is infectious through and through.  The characters are hilarious and wonderfully rich, the music is full of New Orleans flavor, and the message is one that Disney has been lacking for years...wishing upon a star only gets you half way to your dreams, you have to work hard to get what you want.  Tiana is a spectacular role model for young girls while Naveen, Louis and the Cajun firefly, Ray, are thoroughly entertaining.      Your kids will LOVE it!
B00005K9QP|5.0|Despite Mayall's tortured singing, there is a lot of great stuff on this album, but \\"Stepping Out\\" is in a class by itself. An instrumental (and therefore not marred by Mayall's vocals), it is simply one of the most brilliantly conceived and executed electric guitar solos ever recorded. Period. If Clapton had never played another note, this recording of \\"Stepping Out\\" alone would have established him as one of the all-time greats. After listening to this track for more than 40 years, I still get a chill every time I crank it up on my stereo.

B00288KNL8|2.0|I turned this off two thirds through.<br />OK I admit the special affects were great.<br />The story line is what got me. The lousy<br />bored family who were too concerned with work to pay attention to<br />Coraline were turning out to be the good guys. Too bad because initially<br />the parallel universe family that seemed great morphed into the family from<br />hell. Call me naive but that was working for me: finally a family<br />that took the time to be there. I don't need movies to justify<br />lousy families with imaginative style.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|note: Ok first off let me say i dont use many or really know that many big words.............English was my worst subject in school so my grammer is pretty poor even though im of average intelligence.....So if i miss spell some words or miss some commas then cut me some slack.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          Alright where do i start? OK, first off this album has restored a little bit of my faith in new music.Not since 2003 have I bought a new band's album(Yeah Rooney's self titled album left a bad taste in my mouth when their awesome beach boys good vibrations era sounding song \\"Blue Side\\" was the only good track on their self titled album with the rest just being Teeny Bopper snit) and The Radio plus Rooney cauzed me to throw in the towel on new music.......UP UNTIL NOW!!!!!!!!!!    Oracular Spectacular is like a kalidescope of sounds.........With alot of keyboards,synths,distorted guitars,and 60's type cult psychedilia. The music reminds me of mid-career ween,flaming lips,and 60's era psychedilia mixed in a blender with a pinch of originality. Literally 2 songs off this album sound like they were taking off The Flaming Lips - In A Priest Driven Ambulance.Sure this album has some pop elements but pop doesn't control it, MGMT controls the pop (get it?).......So if you like any of the bands i just mentioned or if you just like weird,eccentric,trippy music with a hint of pop BUY THIS ALBUM or atleast give it a try    Excuse My Poor Grammer  Robert Keith

1400063736|5.0|This book is the very rare sort of novel that touches one so very deeply that one is not quite certain which world is more real, the world of the book or one's own world.  Indeed, the line between the two worlds becomes a bit blurred.    Those of us who are old enough might remember the incident when a tightrope walker strung a wire between the two buildings of the World Trade Center and walked out onto it.  This book takes place on that day, but instead of focusing on the man on the wire, who is so far above the bustling streets of the city, it focuses on those who are down in the dirt of New York, as it were.  It is a book of everyman characters who are so extremely sympathetic, compelling and likable that, when conflicts arise, it is sometimes difficult to determine for whom we are supposed to be cheering.  Perhaps the author does not want us to cheer.  Perhaps he only wants to give us a window into their hearts, to see what drives them, what challenges them and to understand their successes and downfalls.  This he does with vivid colors.    The book moves from one seemingly unconnected situation to another, but the author always manages to interweave the lives of the people in the story, such as to give the reader an amazing feeling for this incredible organism called New York.  The lives of the people in the city and in the novel are connected, almost as if with tightropes, sending vibrations back and forth down the wire, while working to maintain one's balance, or, at times, giving up and allowing oneself to fall.    The tightrope walker may be at the apex of it all, but he is almost like the top of a pendulum.  He is steady, angelic, above it all and around him there is so much more movement.  All around him there is chaos, but out of this chaos emerges a kind of equilibrium.    This is one of the finest novels I have ever read.  It is worth every second that one invests into it and is worth even a second or third read.  For those who love New York, the 1970s, historical fiction or just a tremendous story, this one is a must.  Get a copy.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|This is the best watch i have ever had.   I have seen this watch in Europe, but it was too expensive, then, when I search in Amazon I found it in fair price.  It is large and heavy, and it doesnt scratch. It is perfect for social events and with a nice suit.  All of my friends are asking me where I bought it and how much was it, all of then want to buy it too.  Im thinking to buy the model with leather band too!
006621131X|5.0|With Just Kids, Smith has dissected her heart and, like Mapplethorpe's installations, arranged the pieces over 279 pages. Her writing is like a mushroom in the rain. It expands ever larger, ever more dazzling, driving out all thoughts other than the desire to turn the page. In her luminous elegy, she also tells the story of the music, literary, and art world of late 60s and 70s New York.     Smith's words are woven together like the black and silver threads of the Persian necklace Mapplethorpe gave her early in their relationship. This is a book to read slowly and savor.
067144901X|5.0|5 more stars for Moo, Baa, La La La! That's nothing new, so let me share a couple of insights:<br /><br />Although parents may not realize at first, one of the most important things this short book teaches very young children is _humor_. Why would three singing pigs say, \\"La La La!\\" after all.<br /><br />Also, giving the child a chance to provide his or her own (hopefully humorous) suggestion--as the animals all look on expectantly in the final 2-page spread--is a great way to finish the book.<br /><br />The animals are classic Sandra Boynton. This is an early (1982) book, although I believe the artwork was redrawn for this edition (1995).

1594488843|5.0|As a psychologist who has lectured and written extensively about the concept of motivation, I was very impressed with Daniel Pink's book Drive.  Not only has he done an excellent job of summarizing key research related to extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, but he does so in a very refreshing easy-to-read style.  The insights he shares have major relevance for the home, school, and work environment, especially as we consider how best to create \\"motivating environments\\"  I highly recommend this book, a book that will generate much thought and dialogue about a very important topic.

B002W24E0G|4.0|I have all of Curran's previous work.  Having said that, this is a bit more of a 50's style album than the others.  In this day and age people like Nick Curran are very refreshing and rare.  This is real music!!!  If you have open ears and like the raw stuff, this is for you.  His voice and guitar work rule.  I look forward to more of his music in the future.  I just hope I don't have to wait as long next time.    Great work Nick!
B000AARKW6|5.0|Carlito's Way is somewhat similar to Scarface. Both are directed by Brian De Palma, both star Al Pacino as a latino character, and both have a love interest. But the similarities end there as Carlito's Way is much less violent, and much more poignant. Carlito Brigante is the exact opposite of Tony Montana: he is a changed man who wants to do away with the dangerous business that he was a part of before being imprisoned. But, of course, you wouldn't have a solid story without any obstacles that this man (and the people around him) must face. Like Scarface, this movie is very stylish. It's filled with some dazzling cinematography and some classic songs from start to finish. It also has a well-written screenplay by David Koepp, and captivating performances by Pacino, Penelope Ann Miller, and especially Sean Penn.<br /><br />I knew I was going to love this movie after the first half hour. This movie really drew me in not only with Pacino's character, but with the story as well. It's a dramatic tale about moving away from the past and starting a new life; blood, mayhem, drugs, guns, and corruption aplenty. I do love both Scarface & Carlito's Way (both are very awesome films), but I am slightly for the latter.
B001TZQITM|5.0|I have been looking for the perfect sized camera bag for a long time and this Caselogic one is just right.  It has enough space to fit our Canon Power Shot plus some extras like USB / video cords, batteries, SD cards and then some.  It also will fit our Sanyo HD underwater camcorder with ease, as well as the camcorder AND the Canon power shot camera.  This is a perfect small carry-on for an airplane or a day trip to fit your camera, cell phone and iPod, or a larger camera and components.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Hard shell bottom - nice and rugged<br />\\"Component floor\\" section for charging cords, etc. (separate section with velcro and fabric separator<br />Bright orange interior makes finding items easier<br />Comfortable padded carrying handle<br />3 exterior pockets for quick access to SD cards, batteries...<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The only con I can come up with is the strap itself is not very heavy duty, however considering the contents should be pretty light a padded strap would not be necessary.
0545140315|5.0|There is a lot to like in the debut YA novel. Penny has had her heart broken by her childhood sweetheart and forms a club called The Lonely Hearts Club because she is determined not to date -- that all the boys at her HS are losers. Gradually, her friends join up including her childhood friend Diane who has recently broken up with the boyfriend she'd had since 7th grade. The boyfriend -- Ryan -- was a good friend of Penny's and maybe more. But the timing couldn't be worse, Penny has just given up boys and the other club members are looking to her to be their example. This was a light, fun read that would appeal to romantic MS and HS kids.
0783240236|5.0|Spoiled socialite and notorious practical joker Melanie Daniels is shopping in a San Francisco pet store when she meets Mitch Brenner. Mitch is looking to buy a pair of love birds for his young sister's birthday; he recognizes Melanie but pretends to mistake her for an assistant. She decides to get her own back by buying the birds and driving up to the quiet coastal town of Bodega Bay, where Mitch spends his weekends with his sister and mother. Shortly after she arrives, Melanie is attacked by a gull, but this is just the start of a series of attacks by an increasing number of birds. Hitchcock has made many great movies, and this certainly stands up as one of them. Here, Hitchcock gives a lesson in film directing and creates a truly masterpiece of work in the process. A highly innovative horror.
B003102JDM|5.0|This movie is no less than an examination of faith. The repeated message is \\"embrace the mystery\\" and the ending will leave most everyone confounded. It offers many questions, but no answers...indeed, many scenes embrace just this sort of quandary: too many questions in life, not enough answers. The movie is an examination of that mystery: what is life? What is purpose? It is told from the perspective of a Jewish family man, a Physics professor seeking tenure, in 1967 America. The themes, however, are universal. The movie is nothing less than the most important question a person can ever ask: Why am I here? Embrace the mystery.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is a great movie. I saw it years ago and just recently bought it on DVD. This is based on a true story, which always makes it better in my opinion. The extra features on the two disc set are very interesting, as they document how an actual group of native peoples in South America where used in making this movie. My DVD had an error on it on the main feature about half way through the movie, and it was brand new with no scratches, so I don't know if there was a bad batch of DVDs or if it was just mine. It was nothing I couldn't fast forward through, but I did miss a couple of lines of dialogue. Other reviews break down what the movie was about, so I'm not going to get into that here. I think this movie is somewhat of a hidden treasure, especially for fans of Robert DeNiro or Jeremey Irons. And there are some good moral lessons in the film as well. Highly recommended.
B002N5KVDG|5.0|This album rocks! Jello's got a renewed fire burning or something because this album is just full of energy & attitude. Great music, Lyrics, etc but it's a \\"fun\\" sounding record too, I read a review somewhere that said this album's got some of that old school punk rock Detroit sleaze sound to it and that's exactly what it is and it works. It's also nice to hear something new from Jello in 2010, There seems to be less & less sincerity in music (especially punk) this last decade but this cd has me jumping around singing along and I'm happy for that. While I don't agree with a lot of Jello's views it's a breath of fresh air to have him come out with a record like this. Now that it's 2010 I realize how badly needed people like Jello are in this world today, Along with a lot of the other punk rock pioneers of the 1970's/1980's. Nobody else calls people out on their crap anymore, Unless it's fake mainstream tough guy bs. If you're a Dead Kennedys fan you'll love this record and if you're curious to hear what Jello's up to musically these days you'll be gladly surprised. Pick this cd up and support the rabble rousers that are still around raising hell and making us think & laugh. There aren't too many to pick from anymore

1594837929|3.0|My review refers to the audio version of DEAR JOHN.    I decided to give this one by Nicholas Sparks a try after my daughter (14-years-old) came home from the movie theater and sighed, \\"This is my new favorite movie. I cried at the end. Everybody in the theater cried.\\" Rather than spend a small fortune to see the movie, I went to my local library looking for the book. All copies were checked out, so I picked up the audiobook and listened to it on my way to and from work, the store, running errands, and once while sitting in my driveway just to get to the end of a particular CD. I am not a fan of Nicholas Sparks, though I have read a couple of his other books and saw two movie adaptations. I knew before listening to it what I was in for.    Initially, I liked the story about John and Savannah. I could imagine both of them meeting and wanting to get to know each other better in the usual \\"Boy Meets Girl\\" storyline. As the story progressed, I became more sympathetic to the character of John as he became emotionally mature and responsible. He grew up significantly after joining the Army. Savannah, on the other hand, seemed to regress and become more selfish and one dimensional as time went by. Ultimately, I ended up not caring for her and wondered why John remained in awe of her and in love with her, and seemingly would feel that way forever.    Others here have remarked about John's relationship with his father and how the coin collection that initially kept them apart eventually brought them together, so I won't add to what's been written. Sparks used John's father's mental condition, along with another minor character's mental difficulty, as the glue bonding John and Savannah together.      By the end of the book, I had had it with John and Savannah and wished I hadn't spent so much of my time listening to another one of Spark's formulaic, somewhat disappointing works. 2.5 Stars
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Set in 2027, when no child has been born for 18 years and science is at loss to explain the reason, African and East European societies collapse and their dwindling populations migrate to England and other wealthy nations. In a climate of nationalistic violence, a London peace activist turned bureaucrat Theo Faron, joins forces with his revolutionary ex-wife Julian in order to save mankind by protecting a woman who has mysteriously became pregnant. This movie grabbed my attention right from the start, and never let go. Initially, it's the differences of this future world that intrigue. \\"Children of Men\\" is a cinematic milestone. Great special effects and an effective soundtrack accompany this heartfelt, moving and thought-provoking movie.
B002I6X8N0|4.0|So this isn't an epic, classic novel. It's definitely a book for a casual reader looking for some simple entertainment. It doesn't really tackle any major themes like love or the meaning of life. However, it does take its reader into a hidden world created by Rick Riordan. Reading it, you can tell the audience it was written for. It has a lot of middle school humor and refers to things middle school boys are interested in, and focuses on young adult audiences. The best way to describe the book is \\"Harry Potter meets Greek mythology.\\" Its plot follows the adventures of a 12-year-old boy, Percy Jackson, who discovers that he's actually *spoiler alert* a son of the Greek god Poseidon and must uncover, with the help of some friends, the mystery behind Zeus' stolen thunderbolt. In Riordan's novel, all the stories and characters from Greek Mythology that we learned about in middle school still exist in Riodan's world. I think that is one reason Riordan targeted his book at younger teenage boys, because most American middle schoolers learn about Greek mythology at some point. So even though this isn't a challenging read, it effectively plunges you into the novel. It's one of those books where you genuinely care whether the characters survive the depths of Hades and ultimately find the true \\"lightning thief.\\" Riordan also presents the reader with loads of imagery and description to help you clearly see his tale in your mind. If you're into science fiction and like books like Harry Potter and Eragon, this is a book you should check out, but don't expect anything earth-shattering.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|I bought my first Cold Steel Voyager over 15 years ago and I still have it, still use it, and it still keeps and edge. A lot has changed over the years at Cold Steel but not their ability to make some word class production knives at attractive prices. The SRK in VG-1 San Mai III is one such knife.    First the steel. VG-1 San Mai III is a great balance between hardness and flexibility. You want your knife blade to be as hard as possible, right? Well, yes and no. A hard edge stays sharper but is more easily damaged by activities like hacking through cinder block (a common camping activity). Cold Steel addresses this by taking a very high carbon (hard) piece of steel and sandwiching it between two softer pieces of steel. This allows the knife to keep a very sharp edge while increasing its overall strength and resistance to damage. This is my second Cold Steel San Mai III knife and both have come out of the box razor sharp. You can literally shave the hair right off your arm, or anywhere else you see fit.    Second is the overall blade. The size and shape are well-suited for a range of activities, which is what you're looking for in a survival type knife. The blade is thick enough to withstand heavy use, but the weight of the knife is very reasonable at only 8.1 oz. This is a plus when you're loaded down with all of your other hiking and camping gear.    The handle is the often-used Kraton, which is similar to beaded rubber. If there is one aspect of this knife I would improve it would be in the handle material. A G-10 or Micarta would be nice, but you'd be paying a lot more too. I think Kraton is a reasonable compromise, and it provides a good grip even when wet.    Bottom line: if you are looking for a mid-sized combat/survival/camping knife you can't go wrong with the SRK in San Mai III.
B002TYZKIM|3.0|Having a lot of good, international memories of Michael Jackson, I bought this with the assumption that I would get some full videos of his past performances.  This did not happen....only sketches.  That disappointed me.  However, this is a good video for those who wish to go into the entertainment field to discover how a good performer gets that way...by practice, good ideas, precision, and in MJ's case, kindness to all who supported his endeavors.  You don't have to be a monster of a boss to get results.  (Supervisors, managers, directors, ceo's - take note).
0446569895|5.0|Man, it is amazing that Ozzy is still alive.  I grew up in the 70s and 80s and saw Ozzy solo many times from clubs to amphitheaters and the Black Sabbath reunion.  I have always been a fan of Ozzy.  This book was entertaining to see what was actually happening with/to him at the time.  It is a quick enjoyable read.
1440468397|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.<br /><br />As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple.

0786856297|2.0|It wasn't Zeus's lightning author Rick Riordan tried to steal, it was J.K. Rowling's thunder!    Book one of five (So far) of the Percy Jackson & The Olympians series comes in with hardly a whimper. While other people are talking with nothing but good things to say about this young adult novel I find myself wondering what the hell it is they are thinking about? Perhaps the Mists have clouded their eyes too? (Joke that is explained if you read the book.)    The book is pretty much a basic coming of age hero quest, that as far as I am concerned copies Harry Potter in just about every way possible. Perhaps \\"rips off\\" would be a better word. Both stories boasts a three person main character team consisting of two boys, one a rather reluctant hero, the other his best friend, and a know it all girl side kick who stands to be the voice of feminism through out the story. In both stories the characters are aided by magical items such as an invisibility garment and try to outwit, dodge, and evade the presence of a dark lord whose name shouldn't be spoken all the while adventuring through a modern world that is blissfully ignorant of their true existence. If that's not enough, the author is overly vague about plot points that he should just come out and say, and he's incredibly pointed about things that don't matter that much. The main character is a complete Gary Sue, and at no point in the story do you ever feel concerned for his safety. Apparently that would be the only thing different between Riordan's work and Rowlings. Rowling was more than blood thirsty enough to kill off even the most beloved of characters, which leaves me to wonder if the Riordans story is as pre-pubescent as it's main cast.    While the book is certainly a difficult read, not that the way it was written is hard it's just like Twilight in that you are resisting the urge to pimp slap the author through time/space, if you can muscle past your gag reflex long enough to appreciate the bigger story being told here, the book becomes more manageable. There is something interesting about the aspect that Olympian gods survived into modern times. The book dances around any other theology which does leave a LOT to question should one assume that the mythology surrounding one religious source to be true and accurate. I give the book a 2 star rating, with a good chance that I may pick up the next one to see if it improves at all. Honestly, 2 stars isn't a bad rating for such an apparent Harry Potter Clone.    With the live action movie on the way out into theaters soon, I can only imagine how much better it will be. I certainly don't think the movie could be worse.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I have two of these cables in action at the moment.  One connects my TiVo HD to my Samsung LN52B550, and the other connects my Cisco Cable box to it.

0446569895|5.0|I love a biography that is a true depiction of a person. I Am Ozzy is true at least from Ozzy's point of view. There were times that I knew exactly what was going to happen and I laughed uncontrollably anyway. The incident of him riding the horse (in cowboy regalia) to the pub makes the whole book worthwhile. It could only happen to Ozzy.
B0011UF792|2.0|I wont review the movie plenty reviews here already. So you want to know about the Blu Ray, well having just watched it inspite of the good reviews before me, I dont quite agree. I dont know what the quality of the DVD is like but I didnt find the blu ray anything special. But what I did find annoying inspite of the fact its supposed to be a 5.1, I found the sound to be sub-standard. The dialogue was low and not crisp and had to up and down volume with the scene. Any action sound was over the top. I just found the sound annoying and no way to par to what it ought to be. Personally Id say just go with the DVD.<br /><br />PS. I went through the deleted scenes and you wont believe just how bad the quality of them was not even VHS quality. So Id say they didnt invest much if anything into this blu ray hence my suggestion to go for the DVD if half the price, this aint anything special at all. 2 Stars for the blu ray experience.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I loved this movie. I don't usually write reviews, I just read them,but when I read that some of the reviewers called the movie boring, I had to write. If your looking for sex and violance, this movie won't be for you,but if your looking for someone who made a diffferance in history as well as man kind. This movie is defanatly one you should watch. I found it very heart moving and inspirational.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|This movie is on the top ten list of ALL TIME worst movie.  Personally, I would put it in the top five worst of all time.    Oh, the movie destroys EVER other religion EXCEPT for the Muslim religion. The entire world is coming to an end and magically the muslim mosks are protected.  Give me a F'ing break!    Horrible movie, do not waste your time or money on this one.  Wait until it comes out on cable this way you won't shoot yourself for wasting your hard earned money.  The best part of watching this on cable is you will get great satisfaction when you change the channel to something else. :-)    0 STARS
0060012358|5.0|I had a high expectation for this book as i do of all Terry Pratchett's and i was not disappointed. I love it when he introduces us to new Discworld characters.     Pratchett's imagination is quite bizarre and consistently funny and entertaining - lots of action and events that can only happen in a fantasy world, but almost believable at the same time. Even the little * comments are hysterical. I was sorry to see it end.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|kay. first things first. i am officially and undeniably robin hobbs biggest and best fan, andont event hink about not believing me.  each book ive read at least four times, and i CANNOT BELIEVE how absolutely thrilling and intruiging this book is.  this book is by far the best and most well developed story i have ever read in my LIFE! it has a complicate plot, emotionally interesting characters, love, and the best traitorous plotter that i have ever seen.  and on top of all that, the main charactor is a strong axe-weilding, wolf loving, serving girl obsessing, herb smart, and totally insane assassin. how can it possibly get any better than that? and what else does this book have? great morals.  be loyal. listen to people that are wiser than you.  dont do anything you cant undo till you consider what you cant do once youve done it.  Read it, love it, and keep it forever.  some day it might be very valuable.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I was first introduced to this album in a college class when John Wayne Gacy Jr. was played in a discussion of media and meaning.  So masterfully crafted the listener is able to not only emotional identify with a serial killer and the frantic violent pleasure and guilt he felt, but also captured the horror and despair of the community.  The last line where he identifies with the killer I thought was redundant because he already succeeded in emotional tying me to the serial killer.    The album is a beast to be conquered.  Almost overwhelming in its scope I dropped probably 100 hours before I fully appreciated the album.  At first 'Chicago' stood out to me- the most pop-radio worthy song on the album, and soon was caught with the simply folksy banjo of Decature, Jackson, and especially the beauty and sadness of Casimir Pulaski Day.  After listing to the album a number of times the incredible structure of songs like \\"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades...\\" was so moving.  This may seem morbid, but Sufjan Stevens captures death more artfully and in a way that is emotionally present than any other musical artist out there.  His use of quiet instruments to show the dissonant, frantic helplessness in the midst of a sweet and smooth melody is entrancing.  Last I developed a real taste for his almost repetitive musical phrasing in the songs like Come on Feel the Illinoise.    On many songs his backup singers, the \\"Illinoise-makers\\" sing words that do not directly communicate storyline, but create atmosphere.  Like a Freudian ink-blot test the word salad they project brings out associations and emotional responses that create so much texture within his music.  He is a master story-teller and makes his stories emotionally eminent.  Many songs take a few times listening to before you understand the story but as it unfolds itself to you, you will probably shed a few tears along the way.    Beware, if you listen to much Sufjan Stevens, other music tends to look more blandand feel more emotionally flat.
0805091742|2.0|Long slog for little reward. Checklists are good. Keep them simple and useful. Involve people and communicate. Review and Update them regularly. There you go.     By page 190 it's heavy going through the self-aggrandisement, and my reflection was that this was a vanity project too far.    Buy 'Getting Things Done' with the money I just saved you.
B002WCLG3Y|2.0|I like the idea of bringing Halo's side stories out on DVD. But why anime?! It just doesn't fit Halo at all. The episode \\"The Package\\" was ok. I didn't like how it went into first person sometimes during the action. Can we please get away from the fact it's based on a video game?! The story of Halo and all the side stories are great enough to stand alone. We don't need to bring in the first person action, or the multiplayer terminology. That is what made the live action movie of \\"Doom\\" such a flop. The \\"Origin\\" episodes were actually good too. Pretty informative. \\"Babysitter\\" and \\"Prototype\\" weren't too terrible, but the others were just awful and nothing like Halo. \\"Odd One Out\\" should just be deleted from the DVD. It's just goofy and typical Japanese anime and doesn't do anything to help Halo's stories.    I gave it 2 stars for \\"Origins I and II\\" and \\"The Package\\". Other than that, the others weren't worth the money and just plain terrible. Please guys, make a series or DVD that really showcases Halo's intricate stories and really brings the best out of Halo. Many of the Halo games' cinematic scenes are incredible. If they could make a animated or CGI series like those, that'd be ideal. They should have made all the episodes like \\"Origins\\" or \\"The Package\\". I, like many others, would have rather had that. But these anime shorts with different animation and directors just jumbles Halo around and doesn't really do anything for it. Japanese anime and Halo just don't mix. This did nothing to help the Halo universe.
B0016MOWP0|4.0|This is a movie that, once you are committed to loving it, never gets old. Regardless of what the stars have done before or since, \\"Point Break\\" stands alone. The dialogue is what it is - critics will always point out the hokey or what they don't like. I don't care. The scenes that have always stood out for me are the on-foot pursuit and - of course - the sky dive into Lake Powell (or Mead, whichever). Blu-Ray amplifies all the good stuff: the colors, the close-ups, the details - what this technology does for water makes it worth the investment. I love it all over again!

031606792X|1.0|First, I like Twilight, New Moon ,and Eclipse.But the fourth one, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is horrible.English is my second language. But I still can tell how bad this book is.     I have never bothered to write a review. But I am willing to make  an exception this time so you know how strongly I feel about it.    After a few pages into the book, I got really impatient and at   the end I feel this book is probably written by someone else. The  story is inconsistent with all three others. The characters' personalities change. It does not feel like a \\"story.\\" It is more   like author and readers' chatting about the possible future of the  book. So many repetitions in there. I think this book can serve as  an example for me to show my son how to avoid unnecessary words/scenes in his writings. This series is meant for young adult. But \\"Breaking Dawn\\" do not seem to do it any more.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I purchased this series after reading all of the Sookie Stackhouse novels. I had to get to the third video in the box set before, I decided this was an okay series. After reading the book; I'm not really impressed with the TV series as I am with the book series. The characters are so different from the descriptions in the book, and the fake southern voices are awful. At times, some of Sookie's and Bill's acting is just horrible. I do want to watch seasons 2 and 3; however, I will rent them this time rather than buying.<br /><br />If you're reading the book series, just realize this TV series is totally different from the book series.
B000EHRA48|3.0|This adapter works, but after just a few days the cable started to tear away from the DVI end of the adapter. When I compared this to an adapter I bought from the Apple online store around the same time, it was obvious it was made cheaper and not authentic (even though it says \\"by Apple\\"). Not a real quality product just spend a little more and get a better product from Apple ($24 with shipping).

B001BKRL7I|5.0|I do believe that the Beatles made the most incredible and important music of the twentieth century. I believe the Stone's legacy will live on forever. I believe that Bob Dylan was and remains a genius. I also believe that the best album ever made was Younger Than Yesterday by the Byrds. The MP3's are right here. Take a listen and see if you fall into the same trance I did back in 1967.
B0012GMVQC|5.0|Jeff Becks amazing work \\"Guitar Shop\\" is a must for the hard core fan. Casual fans may like it for its more of a traditional rock album then the jazz fusion Beck is better known for. Becks guitar work is top notch, as always, being the perfectionist he is. This album won a Grammy in 1990.
B002ZG997C|4.0|The dialog is minimal, but this is very much a visual picture. Film students can probably appreciate the technical aspects of the movie. Excellent cinematography. Any religious overtones are sveltly built into the enviornment itself and not obviously sticking out.     Story is well told; definitely a lot of showing more than telling.     Minimalist but very strong concentration of the wasteland. Watch how people act around each other even in the simplest of situations. You really do get the sense of how untrusting society has become. The acting from all the characters is superb.    Well done movie.
0307269760|4.0|I generally enjoy reading Alice Munro's short stories, and Too Much Happiness is no exception. The best of the book for me was the variety of themes. From the deeply disturbing Dimensions, about domestic violence, and Free Radicals, an unsettling, edge of your seat sort of tale, to her more standard fare, Fiction, which shows the affects of a woman's actions on her ex-husband's stepdaughter, and Some Women, the interactions a dying man's caregivers, to the strange, Deep Holes, Wenlock Edge, and Face, all with unconventional relationships, there is probably something for everyone here. This time around, however, two stories didn't thrill me: Wood, the story of a man obsessed with the stuff, and the title tale, a brief, historical fiction look into the life of a famous female soviet mathematician of the late 1880s, Sophia Kovalevsky. Although it piqued my interest about the woman, I'd rather read the real thing and so plan to put Little Sparrow: A Portrait of Sophia Kovalevsky on my list. In summary, Alice Munro does not disappoint. Also good: The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, Half-Broke Horses by Jeanette Walls, and The Locust and the Bird by Hanan Al-Shaykh.
0440242401|3.0|Remember Me? is the newest standalone novel by Sophie Kinsella who is probably best know for her Shopaholic series. A series which has long since grown dull for me and so I've looked forward to these standalone novels that Kinsella has started to churn out.<br /><br />Remember Me? is told from the point of view of the main character, Lexi Smart, who wakes up one day to find herself in the hospital and that the last thing she remembers was a night out on the town with the girls. An event which happened over three years ago. Back in 2004, Lexi was a nothing special girl with scraggly hair and crocked teeth but she loved life and was surrounded by good friends. In 2007, Lexi seems to be living every girls dream of the perfect life. Her hair is straight, her teeth are perfect and she's married to the most gorgeous millionaire. Only somehow along the way she has grown to be uptight and has lost that close group of friends that made the old Lexi just a little less ordinary.<br /><br />The book centers around Lexi trying to figure out just how her life has changed so much over the three missing years. And all the various mistakes she makes in her perfect world now that the old Lexi has returned. These mistakes are supposed to be funny and are supposed to endear Lexi to the reader. However, I never laughed once and just kept thinking how annoying Lexi was. I also kept waiting for the big reveal, those little hints of how the 2007 version of Lexi came to be and was never fully satisfied with the little crumbs of information that were handed out. This slow reveal made the novel drag out for me and when some major bits were finally revealed they seemed anticlimatic and almost didn't seem to fit into the story.<br /><br />This book wasn't horrible, I've definitely read worse, but it wasn't great either. I didn't get that feel good guilty pleasure feeling that normal comes from reading a \\"chick lit\\" novel. This book was definitely not one of Kinsella's best and will probably make me rethink buying her next standalone book in hardcover...or at all. This isn't a book that I'd recommend to others.<br /><br />In Short: An unimpressive book that fails to deliver the promise of a light hearted brain candy novel. I don't think that I laughed once during this entire book which is something that I've come to expect from a Sophie Kinsella book. This book was definately not worth the hardcover price of it and will probably make me think before buying her next novel in hardback as this book left little impression on me. Its a quick read, however I've read better and not sure if this is something that I'd recommend to others.<br /><br />As originally posted on my blog Ticket to Anywherenext standalone book in hardcover...or at all.

B002E2M5IC|1.0|I'm not a huge fan of Coen Brothers' movies, but sometimes I just want to catch up on what's going on in American cinema nowadays. Being beyond the pale for Avatar, I go for \\"Burn After Reading\\" and \\"A Serious Man\\".<br /><br />I can find some excuse for rehashing old Graham Greene novels in \\"Burn After Reading\\", this excuse being - absolutely no pretensions. Also - pretty good satire (both Linda Litzke & Chad Feldheimer are very funny and easily recognizable types). Finally - star performance of John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and yes - even Brad Pitt!. That being said I'd have given this movie 4 stars in its genre of (almost) mindless and second-hand comedy.<br /><br />Now to \\"A Serious Man\\". This movie is clearly an indication that anything goes in American cinema today. Ron \\"true faith\\" in his comment here (also one star rating) with a title \\"Nothing new under the sun\\" says that \\"A Serious Man\\" is a \\"film that gives arthouse cinema a bad name\\". Come on, Ron, how can you even mention arthouse here when talking about this movie.<br /><br />Coens start with a short flashback to 18th century Europe where they show a Jewish family encounter with a so-called \\"undead\\" dybbuk, \\"a malicious possessing spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person\\". The viewer's supposed to make connections between this encounter and bad luck of a Jewish physics professor in the second half of XX century.<br /><br />This bad luck being: a wife who wants a divorce (to get married to a professor's old friend), a 13-year-old son smoking pot, car accidents, students who pressure him to accept bribes in exchange for good grades, etc, etc - and finally some bad news about recent X-ray examination. The problem with all this is that it was said and filmed countless number of times, from Philip Roth to Joseph Heller including all this Jewish family athmosphere, for which one is advised to go no further than Curb Your Enthusiasm. After Larry David one needs to add something really significant to the subject if one desires not to be completely discounted.<br /><br />No pop-philosophy including biblical references to the story of Job or whatever else would help, because the film is absolutely pointless and senseless. Another good example - gentile neighbours and Korean student with this bribe story. Why all that? What's the point? Why Korean? Can somebody explain please? The scene with the first (young) rabbi is the only one really worth watching, but is it enough for the full length movie?<br /><br />When one's reading Portnoy's Complaint - everything's to the point, beacuse the book is really groundbreaking. To an extent this can be said about American Pastoral, or Something Happened. But after the string of movies like \\"About Shmitd\\", \\"The Truman Show\\", and other \\"deep psychological/philosophical/existential\\" flicks \\"A Serious Man\\" leaves one with a strong resolution not to touch anything produced by Coen Brothers ever again.desires not to be completely discounted.

0312360258|3.0|Marked by P.C. Cast is a new take on vampirism. In Cast's version vampires have always existed...and in fact they are pretty much the leaders when it comes to art and musical exploits - if its famous it was most like done by a vampire....including Shakespeare, the Amazons, Nicole Kidman & Kenny Chesney to name a few. To become a vampire in Cast's world a person isn't bitten. There is some chemical/genetic make up in a person's blood that causes him/her to go through 'the change' when a teenager. When teens start to go through the change they get marked by an adult vamp with a crescent shaped outline on their forehead and head off to the nearest vampire school for training/education in the ways of vamps.<br /><br />Zoey Redbird is one such teen who gets marked when she is 16. Zoey is a typical girl struggling to fit in with the popular crowd while dealing with an uber religious and strict step-father. Zoey is unlike most teens in that she is highly judgmental of the the vices that teenagers are faced with. For example, if you do drugs or drink you are a loser. Now while I applaud Zoey's ability to resist temptation it often comes across as unrealistic dialog and just screams of the author preaching to a captive audience. Another thing that makes Zoey different is that shortly after she is marked her crescent outline becomes filled in....something that only happens when one is an adult vampire. This sets her apart from everyone else at the private school called The House of Night that she must attend while she goes through the change.<br /><br />While at the school she meets and bonds with 4 kids who are existing on the fringes of the student body and she quickly makes an enemy of the most popular girl in school, Aphrodite. Because Zoey's mark is different Aphrodite initially tries to recruit Zoey into her circle. But Aphrodite is mean and vindictive and Zoey not only sees through her but also becomes the only person brave enough to stand up to her. A rivalry is then born. One that I am sure will continue throughout most of the series.<br /><br />Overall the book wasn't bad and I enjoyed the different take on what it means to become a vampire. However, the dialog always seemed a little forced. It was as if Cast was trying too hard to speak teen. Which was further strained when she got onto her soap box to speak out against sex, drugs and peer pressure. Another issue that I had was the overuse of parenthesis (I mean seriously there was something within them every other paragraph!). Now while I get that the author was trying to bond with the reader with these little asides, they just were too many that they became distracting. Those bits of text could have been handled more directly (and the parenthesis could have been saved for more effective use).<br /><br />Not sure if I'd recommend this book to others. Its part of a series and wasn't horrible so I'll probably wait until I read book 2 before making any final judgments.<br /><br />In Short: Not a bad start to a series but not overly memorable either. There was a little too much preaching going on to make Zoey a believable teenage girl. While I will check out book 2, I'm not sure if I'll continue too far into the series.<br /><br />As originally posted on my blog Ticket to Anywheream sure will continue throughout most of the series.

Except for the quality of hi-def, this film is more exemplary of a mediocre family film, i.e. Kennedy.
0784011176|1.0|There's little in the plot to maintain interest, and no understanding of the background provided. For example, What were these people doing in New Zealand? Why did the woman come to New Zealand in first place - I know it was for marriage, but weren't there some better alternatives? What was the background of some of the characters? (Overall, they seemed like boors and louts.) Anyway, it was difficult to understand much of the dialogue (too soft, mumbled and accented) - I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.  Holly Hunter (Ada, the mute love interest) is a good actress but most of the scenes were eyes darting back and forth. You get dizzy watching.<br /><br />Also,the ending of her favorite piano is odd and did not make sense - she gets a new one later. Why is a body tied to the old piano?  Is it a symbol of Ada's former personality?<br /><br />The best part of the movie was the New Zealand scenery, greens, dark blues and purple.
B000A2RRF4|3.0|Let me start by saying I am a longtime MJ fan who grew up listening to the Jackson 5. Their Saturday morning cartoons and cereal box records were a way of life for me as a kid and are still some of my fondest and most vivid childhood memories. Since his untimely death I have been revisiting not only the Epic MJ albums, but the Motown and J5 catalog as well, and have recently discovered many musical gems I had been unaware of until recently. So naturally my attention eventually turned to MJ DVD's, which has led me to writing this review.<br /><br />I must confess that I am guilty of putting Michael Jackson on the shelf in recent years, but I have recently been making up for lost time. So although this concert is not new, it is new to me. It is a top notch performance of his Dangerous Tour, but I would like to get my hands on and slap the person who was hired and actually payed money to butcher the King of Pop's performance contained in this video. I understand the concept of trying to include the audience's reaction as part of the concert experience, but every other camera shot is of the audience and completely distracts from MJ's performance. This should be called \\"The Audience of The Dangerous Tour featuring Michael Jackson.\\"<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is an incredible performance and a must see for any MJ fan, but be forewarned that it is badly edited with way too many camera cuts of the audience screaming, crying and passing out during the entire performance. It gets annoying very fast and is very distracting during some of the most important dance sequences. I hope this will someday be re-edited to focus more on the performance instead of the audience and eventually be re-released. Until then, this is the best and most recent concert performance that exists of the King of Pop.
B0037W3LUE|5.0|Matt Bonner, Tim DeKay, Willie Garson and Tiffini Thiessen are an amazing cast. They play off of each other as if they've known each other for years. Bonner is so gorgeous to watch, sometimes I have to remind myself, \\"hello, story being told, watch the show.\\" He is absolutely convincing as a master thief and DeKay is equally fantastic as a (sort of) by the book FBI agent. Just as he was amazing in Daniel Knauf's \\"Carnivàle\\" as \\"Clayton \\"Jonesy\\" Jones (a must see series for anyone who loves the gothic), DeKay keeps pace with Bonner's fast moving, fast talking con artist.     What makes the show work so well are the subtle comments that are exchanged which draw us into the show and characters, especially their vulnerabilities. Peter's insecurity about how he dresses and how everything seems to come so easily to Neal: women, penthouses, a patron, everything. And Mozzie. His cute factor is 10+. He is a side kick that you just want to put in your purse and keep with you all the time. Thiessen's portray as Elizabeth is a great anchor for Peter. She charms him, Neal, every character and all the viewers.    It is a show you want to watch from the beginning, but if you can't, don't let that stop you. It is too good to miss. Thank you USA for producing \\"White Collar\\" and \\"Burn Notice\\". Two fantastic USA shows. The first reviewer is right, if you love these, you'll love \\"Leverage\\" (thanks TNT!).     The best shows are on cable.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I was skeptical that something this inexpensive and small could give me the sound I wanted, with good bass. I'm certainly convinced now. These headphones fit just inside the ear and are so lightweight you can almost forget you have them on. The sound is vibrant with a great range. I wanted headphones that would partly block sound but would also allow me to tell when someone came to my cubicle. These have been perfect for the double usage. They block much of the chatter that goes on, yet allow me to respond immediately when someone addresses me (I courteously remove the headphones first of course). Easy to put on and take off, they're a joy and I always keep a spare one.<br /><br />A coworker wanted headphones and tried mine, then ordered a pair for herself and loves them just as much. They give privacy while being small enough they don't intimidate people who see you are \\"plugged in\\".<br /><br />The wire that connects to the headphones is very fine and flexible, which is fine, but I've lost a pair or two because something accidentally fell on a wire and damaged it. The inexpensive price means easy replacement.

1423119509|5.0|I love Harry Potter books, especially the 1st 4. I love Greek myths.<br />I tried Lightning Thief when Scholastic was advertising it to my son's school. I'm always on the look out for fun books for him to read. I borrowed it from the library and got hooked myself!<br />The books are non-stop, fast paced page turners, no dragging or boring sections. Action or romp packed chapters. Tongue in cheek humor. Fun to remember beloved Greek myths imagined in modern settings. Though Percy is short for Perseus, he has adventures like Hercules and Odysseus, etc. Part of the fun is anticipating how he will solve his never ending problems based on what you remember from classic myths. The current first movie of the series loses much of the humorous narration of the book (Percy's view). These stories are fun and funny to read.<br />I actually prefer this series to Harry Potter for my own child to read because though Percy does get older and starts acting like an older teenager and there are battles and war at the end, it is not dark or eerie, gory or depressing as the last books in Harry Potter. I would have no worry about my 10 year old reading this and wondering if it is appropriate for his age.<br />Forget the treasure box. Cardboard quality is little more than a Happy meal. Secret compartment is a folded cutout cardboard insert. Tried to get an intact box twice from Amazon. Always torn up. I decided to keep the 2nd one after Amazon decided to give a 20% discount for me keeping a damaged product. Inside the treasure box is your usual boxed set type box - just plain gold without any markings except Disney Hyperion label in small print. Hardcover books x5 in excellent condition inside a regular plain box - great price overall for a series I really enjoy.

B000HKV7OG|5.0|The novel begins: \\"'What's it going to be then, eh?'<br />  There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really dim, and we sat at the Korova Milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening. . . .\\"<br /><br />With that, the action begins as Alex and his three thugs go out for action, ultraviolence, and the like. This is a portrayal of England at some future point. While much of the focus on this book has been conditioned by Stanley Kubrick's stunning movie, the central point is the society versus the individual. After his depredations finally bring him to \\"justice,\\" Alex is subject to treatment that rids him of his violent behavior--at the cost of taking away his personality (and, as an unexpected consequence, his ability to enjoy Beethoven).<br /><br />In a sense, then, this novel is about a dystopia. This version, apparently, is closer to the Kubrick version; the ironic final chapter is missing. This version ends as Kubrick's movie did, with Alex \\"cured\\" of the conditioning that took away his individuality, with the final line being: \\"I was cured all right\\" as he listened to Beethoven without pain. The 21st chapter, as noted, leaves one with a far different feeling at the close of this classic.<br /><br />It takes a while to get used to the language used by Alex and his peers, a mixture of Russian and English (for the most part). There is a glossary at the end, which is helpful. For instance, devotchkas are girls;  tolchok is hitting or pushing; nozh is knife. In the end, a powerful work.
0671449028|5.0|Personally, I don't get the appeal of this book.  I was totally with the story until the animals all went up to exercise right before bed.  Odd.  But my son absolutely loves it.  I have to stock up on copies because he's quite destructive and since this is his favorite it gets the most wear and tear.
0061122416|5.0|Great book filled with wisdom and poetry about finding happiness within. It is the journey that is the real gift and not the destination. Santiago grows mentally and spiritually and finds himself and the pot of gold. The treasure is within. He needed only to be mature to know that.
089898890X|5.0|If you are going to learn about Jazz drumming, this is THE book to get. Although the book is not super thick, it has a lot of useful information. The exercises in this book are challenging and musical. This book teaches with a musical approach. It does not have exercises for the sake of having exercises. That's why it's not as thick as other books on the subject.<br /><br />The CD that comes with it has 39 examples and 6 play along tracks. The recordings are done very well and John Riley him self is playing on them. My favorite track is the 64 bar bass line track. It's like jamming with a bass player.<br /><br />This book is the ultimate tool for a drumming instructor who is going to teach the subject of Jazz drumming.
B002ZG98J6|2.0|Percy Jackson is about a 12-year-old schoolboy who discovers to be a demi-god, grows up with his equally aged friends in Camp Halfblood and explores his origins deeply rooted in ancient Greek mythology...Oh wait, this has to be another story...     The Percy Jackson of this let-down of a movie is 18 years old and discovers that his uncle is Sean Bean, who pretends to be the almighty Zeus at a costume party highly reminiscent of an episode of the original \\"Star Trek\\" series called \\"Who Mourns for Adonis\\". This Percy Jackson drives his car around the States, falls in love with some arrogant brunette chick for some inexplicable reason called Annabeth Chase and has to discover that his second-favourite James Bond actor has grown horsebuns...    Seriously, this movie is nothing but a very sad travesty. The very basic, educational storyline and dialogues would have perfectly fitted with a children's movie, but no, they had to turn Percy Jackson into some weird action flick for young adults. The acting is throughout mediocre, the script lacks any depth and the directing is uninspired and bloodless. Even the costumes and sets look cheap as out of a 90s TV show.     Agreed. The CGI looks okay and the score by Christophe Beck is a masterpiece, but the rest of that movie simply lacks any coherence or aesthetic appeal.    I guess the only way to save this story would be to reboot is right away with some talented 13-year-old actors doing the book some justice. Or maybe retcon the entire thing with a new cast for the sequel à la \\"The Incredible Hulk\\". I don't care. But one thing's for sure: You are NOT Percy Jackson, Mr Lerman!
0761119752|2.0|The \\"rhymes\\" in this book are really bizarre and choppy.  I absolutely hated it and my son wasn't even slightly interested in it.
0439023491|5.0|5 Stars - AMAZING! This series just keeps getting better and better. It's even more interesting and entertaining with now the second book in a Trilogy and the turn of each page! I didn't know where Collins would take us in the second installment and was shocked and shocked some more as I read. As like with The Hunger Games I couldn't get enough. The twists and turns were written perfectly. The characters all seemed to grow even before my eyes. The things that each character has to endure just were heartbreaking and breathtaking all rolled into a nice & shiny pretty orange book.<br /><br />The way Collins writes is as if painting a picture or developing film before my eyes. The scenery is so easy to imagine as our hero's face unimaginable and unbeatable odds over and over. The strength comes through in huge amounts as these people are faced to live in such a hard time. Each district is so vastly different from the other, however they are all faced with the same troubles.<br /><br />From the horrible misuse of power within the Capitol and its ruthless President to each person living within the districts this book is something that shouldn't be missed by any reader. As I'm sure just about everyone on the planet has read the first two books, I have to say if you haven't you are missing out on something that's more then a story, but a thrill ride from start to end. You won't be disappointed. Go TEAM Peeta!

1400052173|3.0|THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS is purportedly the story of HeLa, one of the most important discoveries in scientific history, but in fact it is more the history of the Lacks family combined with a little finger shaking at the medical profession.  Author, Rebecca Skloot, skillfully guides the reader through a thoughtful examination of subjects ranging from the meaning of race and racism in 1950's America to an examination of what we deem to be medically moral and ethical behavior.  One of the most challenging questions the book presents is one of ownership. As a patient, who do your body parts and tissue truly belong to.......are they yours or, once removed from your body, do they fall into the realm of \\"public property\\" to be disposed of or utilized as the medical community sees fit?  (In the case of Henrietta Lacks, her family, and the doctor who discovered the indestructible HeLa cells, none of these folks ever made a plug nickel from the discovery..............that is not to say that others have not made obscene sums of money in what has become a multi-billion dollar business).<br /><br />In this comprehensively researched and compelling story that is part scientific research text-book and part biography the author has provided a voice we can literally hear, one that connects us to real people and their real-life experiences. She has provided with a profound reading experience that is not only informative......it is also a barometer or our own moral standards of right and wrong.  An obvious selection for any book club or reading group, this volume provides a plethora or subject matter that is guaranteed to encourage plenty of lively discussion. 3 1/2 STARS

0307454541|4.0|This was the original title, in Swedish, of 'the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and when I found that out, it made a lot more sense to me.  The 'girl' in the title is just one player in a beautifully written, at times disturbing, multi-layered crime novel.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because I found nearly all the characters - especially the main protagonist - to be so unsympathetic.  I'm glad I read it and look forward to the second one, which a Swedish friend tells me is the best.
0307271862|2.0|Kindle readers -- this price is a 26% increase! In the middle of a recession! Kindle readers, PLEASE wait till the price of this book goes down!    If you buy this at $12, then next year the price will be $15. If you buy at $15 then it will be $20. And this for a book that can't even be shared with your friends after you've finished reading.    Amazon is right about this one -- If you want the Kindle format to survive, you have to fight this. Send the publisher a message. Reserve this book at the local library. Or if you have to own it, buy the hardcover at $15. There are plenty of wonderful Kindle books still available at $9.99 (or less). Those are the publishers Kindle readers should be supporting.
0446569895|5.0|As rock bios go, this is one for the history books.  Ozzy is and always was a madman, but also fundamentally a sweet, loving guy - so at odds with his stage persona. His influence on all things rock continues to this day. I'm happy that Chris Ayres let Ozzy just talk, and edited with care and affection.  I worked with Sharon (before she married Ozzy) and Ozzy for a year, doing his PR just after he left Black Sabbath, so I have my own fond memories. The book helped them to come flooding back and it is a great, albeit brutally honest account of a crazy career.
B000W746GK|3.0|I think this is one of the least successful Harry Potter movies, but's mainly the book's fault.  Rowling was trying to copy the success of PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, but hadn't figured out how to scale it up to a big series yet.  So once again we have a story that ends up with   (1) Harry and a best friend figuring out how to get in a trap door  (2) The best friend getting waylaid halfway through and sending Harry away.  (3) Harry confronting an evil wizard underground.    Other problems:     To an adult reader/viewer, Lockhart is an obvious fraud from the start, yet it takes everybody in the story forever to catch on.   Branaugh fleshed him out a little, but he's still tiresome.     So Harry and Ron think it's OK to put drugs in candy as part of their investigation?    So Hermione turns herself into a cat by accident and it takes several weeks to wear off.  And nobody in the school administration asks how it happened (if they did, and found out about the drug angle, the trio would probably be expelled)    So Ginny is depressed and alienated, and neither her brother Ron nor the perceptive Hermione notices anything.  Doesn't that make them look insensitive?
0345455681|5.0|London The Novel, tells the story of the city of London from the time of Julius Caesar right up to the modern day, as seen through the eyes of a number of families that live there.<br /><br />I found the book a fascinating read! Each era is colourfully brought to life, as the momentous events that framed this city, be it war, religion, trade or politics, are vividly recalled. Such is the imagery, that at times I felt I was nearly living there through the ages. Highly recommended!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm relatively fit and in a good weight range, but wanted more definition and tone.  I also have some back issues to work around, so I needed something lower key and that would not stress my back unduly.<br /><br />After getting the go ahead from my doctor, I began the workout.  I was surprised how much effort and sweat I had to put forth!  (Perhaps I wasn't as fit as I thought).  Since I've been somewhat inactive for the past 6 weeks, I chose to work along with the beginner moves (you have two people to choose from--Erica, who demonstrated modified, easier moves, and Nicole, who does the advanced version of each move).  Even using the beginner moves, this was definately WORK for me!<br />There are 3 levels of workouts, and Jillian suggests that you stick with Level 1 until you feel \\"ready\\" to advance to Level 2, and so forth.  This didn't work out so well.  I found myself getting bored with Level 1 after the first few days.<br />Thank goodness someone here recommended going ahead and mixing up the Levels right from the start!<br /><br />What I did was to copy the beginner moves for each level...that way, I felt I could safely move ahead, mixing up the Levels, maintaining my interest and using different muscle groups with the different exercises.  I took 5 second breaks during the cardio or strength moves if I felt unduly out of breath or my back was getting sore.  (tried to take as few breaks as possible, though).<br />As its only 20  minutes, I felt I could make that commitment to do it 5 days out of every week.<br /><br />After using The Shred for 2 weeks, I can definately see improvement in my tone and definition.  My endurance for the cardio is improving greatly.  I no longer need to take any short breaks during the workout.  My back is strengthening, and my core is also improving which helps a lot.  I'm now using some of the advanced moves, too.<br /><br />In short, if you are a serious and experienced exerciser, I don't know that you will be terribly happy with this purchase.  Its fairly basic.  But if you are overweight, or a beginning exerciser, need definition and tone, or have some physical limitations (check with your doctor first!), this might be exactly what you need and want.  Its 20 minutes, people!  No excuses...who can't find 20 minutes?  Who can't make a promise to themselves (and keep the promise) to do at least this for yourself?<br /><br />Well worth the purchase for me, personally.  I intend to keep using it.But if you are overweight, or a beginning exerciser, need definition and tone, or have some physical limitations (check with your doctor first!), this might be exactly what you need and want.

B000002GKT|4.0|The Who, Led Zeppelin and Humble Pie were, in my opinion, the original heavy metal bands in the late 60's/early 70's.  What distinguished these bands from their descendants is that these bands were actually talented.  Rockin' The Fillmore is a great example of the original Humble Pie lineup before Peter Frampton left and went pop.  For the most part, from \\"Four Day Creep\\" to \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\" it rocks, and begs to be played as loud as possible.  Although it is a little too extended, the gem is clearly \\"I Walk On Gilded Splinters\\" and \\"I Don't No Doctor\\" suffers from being a little too over jammed, as well.  If for no other reason, as an example of early metal, this belongs in every collection, along with The Who Live at Leeds, and the first two Led Zeppelin efforts.

B002T9H2LA|2.0|In my opinion this director is absurdly overated. A movie that is 99% dialogue is not what I call entertaining. I don't care if that dialogue is masterfully clever(To me it is ridiculous). There are some cool scenes but they feel like teases in an otherwise bore fest. If the movie were entertaining and it wasn't all talking at a table, it would make up for the fact that it is a joke insult to good WWII movies like Saving Private Ryan. Unfortunately it is a boring joke. I wasted my money buying this movie outright. I don't undertsand why this movie was at all popular and I resent how I was mislead by bad taste.

B00338QENI|5.0|This incredible &#34;story&#34; (for the lack of a better word) is written with such passion.  I finished it this morning and it still on my mind.  The suffering and sucess of the Lacks family could not have been captured by a better author.  Each description lays out the facts for science 'newbies' and professionals alike.  This is, in my mind, the book of the year and a must read for anyone who has gotten a vaccine or gone to a doctor.  Read it!
B000002AHC|5.0|For me The Notorious Byrd Brothers is not only the best album they have ever produced, but that no other band has ever surpassed it!  Where to start, well there is not one track on the original 11, which was released on 3rd January 1968, that is weak.  (Triad, a bonus track, is not my favourite).  Artificial Energy is loud and forceful without being grating on the ears, then to follow, Goin' Back is a wonderfully gentle song of the joys of childhood.  Natural Harmony and Draft Morning flow into each other, the latter taking head on the conscription to the army for the Vietnam war, which The Monkees Last Train To Clarksville only alluded to.    Was'nt Born to Follow will always remind me of Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda riding their Harley Davidsons on their way to New Orleans in the classic 1969 film Easy Rider.   Get To You and Change Is Now also flow as if one song and Old John Robertson has some similarities to Was'nt Born To Follow and thats very high praise itself.  Tribal Gathering, Dolphin's Smile and Space Odyssey round it all off at a slower pace, but maintain the highest standards of musical inovation.  The original LP may be quite short, but it's all of the highest quality.  Apart from  the aforementioned Triad, there are another 5 bonus tracks of which 3 are instrumental.  The standout is Moog Raga, which while it may not be to everybody's taste, was released before Wendy Carlos' groundbreaking moog classic, Switched On Bach.  The other 2 instrumentals Bound To Fall and Universal Mind Decoder are OK rather than outstanding.  Version one of Goin' Back indicates how the recording developed from a loose arrangement to the definitive song on the original release.  Draft Morning is a little longer than the original.  So to me this is the standard to which I match any band's (not solo) offerings and so far none have topped it.  If it is unknown to you I recommend listern as soon as possible!
B002XMGGK6|4.0|If you played by the established rules in society and at every turn you gave, but received very little in return, what would you do? \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" answers the question.  Part of the equation call for skills in military science, master engineering with a twinge of diabolicalness and nothing to lose. Now, we have a movie!  But, in addition, we have society's worst enemy.     \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" while being more in the Action/Adventure genre', could stretch the conventionalism of traditional Science Fiction with a view of the future.  Think Bill Gates being totally disenchanted with society and turning all his forces of technology against us. Farfetched? Maybe, but \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" is the future of criminality; highly sensitive, intellectual, calculating and ambitious individuals training their sights upon dismantling society as we know it.    Watch \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" and judge for yourself. Only the screen writer saved us.    Edward Brown  Core Edge Image & Charisma Institute

0061968579|3.0|Having read the novel by Lehane (which I LOVED), the graphic novelization by de Metter and seen the Scorsese film, I suggest you stick with the original.  The graphic novel isn't bad, mind you, but just a bit confusing, especially if you're not already familiar with the story.  Also, just like in the film, certain key elements of the book were left out of the graphic novel (the deciphering of the codes and attempted escape on the ferry in the former and the explosion of the car and the meeting in the cave in the latter) so the reader (and/or viewer) does not get a complete picture of Lehane's original vision.  Mind you, I liked the movie and enjoyed the graphic novel, but neither should be regarded as a worthy substitute for Lehane's brilliant gothic noir tale.
B002HFP0QU|4.0|The Bee Gees were one of the best bands of the 70's and this collection shows it. Of course you have to have a taste for disco and blue-eyed soul/funk. I love this collection except that the remastering on this is not as good as that on their Number Ones collection. That other Greatest Hits package has less music on it, but when I play the songs on my computer side by side, I can compare the sound quality and Number Ones wins (no pun intended). That's a shame considering that NO was released in 2004 and remastering techonology has improved since then. To the casual music fan, this won't be noticeable and the not so casual fan won't notice the difference unless they compare it the way that I did. However, the hopes of sound improvement were the main motivator for me, so I have to give this collection 4 stars. The content is great though, and even though hardcore fans will have many complaints about song selection, this is the best bee gees compilation out there. They are much more than their disco era, even though most people know them for their Saturday Night Fever contributions to pop music. Another advantage of buying this collection is that you get almost the whole SNF album on this record and remastered to boot. You will still be missing some key songs from that landmark album, (it is still in the top 20 best selling albums of all time), but you get all of the BG hits, plus a rare version of \\"If I Can't Have You\\" with them on vocals. If you're a fan of this band and not an anal audiophile like I have the tendency to be, then get this by all means. You'll love it
073936474X|4.0|I bought this audiobook so that on the way down to Disney me and my family could listen to something other than music. I was very suprised and found the book very entertaing. The kids in the car also liked the story it was fast pased and did not take long to get into the action. Thanks we look forward to listening to the other books in the series on our next trip. Phoenix here we come.
0449002632|2.0|Although I agree with most of the reviewers who rated the book as one star, I will rate the book as two stars - as an appreciation of a huge work that the author did before and while writing this book.     Unfortunately, I was impressed neither with the story, nor with the characters and what was happening to them. There was one point where I was intrigued and wanted to know \\"What happened next\\", but to my disappointment this line of the story was dropped to be picked up about 50 years later, bland as the rest of the story lines.     The interaction between those families through the centuries in London town is highly unbelievable and sometimes looks like telenovelas.      Usually I try to finish books that I started, so I continued to read thinking \\"OK, I read 700 pages, I'd better finish it... Finish it... Finish it...\\"    Now I have about 10 pages to the end, and I have no desire to find out what happened. I am not interested what could possibly happen with these cardboard characters. How sad is that?
B0030BOCEG|5.0|This is probably HIM's best album yet. It's spreads across a wide variety of genres. Which would reach out to a wide variety of people. It's the perfect mixture of punk, pop, and rock. If I were to suggest an album to someone who has never listened to HIM, I would give them Screamworks:Love in Theory and Practice. They should be very proud of their latest album. It's gonna be hard to top.

0312370849|1.0|If you didn't already know how Jews were treated in WWII this book gives some important fact about the horror.  However, I've read a lot of books about this era in the past 45 years and Sarah's Key ranks at the very bottom of my reading list. It's good for showing how NOT to write. The author has focused on an important historical event, and apparently she's satisfied a lot of readers.   But I found the book itself dreadful for many of the same reasons given by other readers above: It's wordy, wordy, wordy, and filled with choppy, redundant sentences, poor character development, weak plotting, and heavy sentimentality. De Rosnay has little ability to use language in a way that conveys the sense of a place, a situation, an era, or the truths of a human heart. Instead she pounds the reader over the head again and again with the same few points about the Vel' d'Hiv'. and wastes the rest of the book letting her narrator stew.  In short sentences. To no good end.

0060558121|3.0|'American Gods' won a whole slew of awards, primarily science fiction awards, including the Hugo and the Nebula.  I'm not sure why.<br /><br />The premise has been outlined here many hundreds of times.  I will just say that the whole story boils down to 'if people stop believing in a god, that god ceases to exist'.  (Which reminds me of an honest-to-God story that happened to me a decade ago.  I was leading a Sierra Club hike.  A woman made her way to the front of the group, where I was, and asked me, \\"Do you believe in wood sprites?\\"  I was obviously taken aback, but I said, no I didn't.  She said, \\"Well, that's why they are dying out.\\")  So I guess there might be something to the basic premise of 'American Gods'.<br /><br />I found the story very long, a bit tedious, and ultimately not that rewarding.  Oh, Mr. Gaiman can write, no question about that.  He gives an interesting sense of wonder and spookiness to his tale.  But, I felt the ending was a letdown.  I was most interested in Shadow's dead wife, who, with a little help, just can't stay dead, and who saves her husband on several occasions.  This, after betraying him while he was in prison.<br /><br />Weird, to be sure.<br /><br />The book may appeal to others more than to me.  The fact that it apparently was a New York Times Bestseller attests to that.  And, those slew of awards.<br /><br />But it didn't move me as much as it has others.  I will give some of his other books a try.  Perhaps I'll get into those more.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Pixar has done it again. Up is possibly the best animated movie of the year and it could even be considered the best movie of the year, live action or animated. And Disney has once again produced an outstanding package, with a bonus DVD and Digital Copy. The blu-ray is simply mind-blowing, but Disney has taken care to produce a top-quality DVD and digital copy as well, within the constraints imposed by the two standard-def formats. The soundstage too is simply amazing, whichever version you choose to watch.      The story is original and takes the viewers on a rollercoaster (sorry, balloon) ride to a little known corner of the world. We can identify with the lead character, as we are all adventurous in our minds, but time and monetary constraints do not usually allow us to explore such regions of our world. There are plenty of thrills and spills on the way and perhaps no live action feature could do justice to a story of this nature. All the characters, man or animal, are lively. The dialogue is witty too. The supplements are good, though not exceptional. There are some moments which may be somewhat scary to very small children, so parents should watch it along with them.  This is not only a film for kids, it is a film for all ages. And I mean it also in the sense that it will stand the test of time, long after we are gone. The 3-D version will eventually find its way to homes via the new 3-D blu-ray standard, but until then this 2D release will do just fine. It will lift you up every time you view it - and you can view it many times. This movie is a `blind' purchase - you don't need to think twice before hitting the order button. It should be in every home video library, to be cherished for generations to come.

0393075966|5.0|While reading Freefall, my mind wandered more than once to imagining the character of Dr. Stiglitz himself, forming impressions of the writer from the writing, as one naturally does.     A quote by Shelby Foote, the Civil War historian, came to mind from a decade or more ago and the Ken Burns documentary. Referring to Grant, arguably not one of his favorites, Foote nevertheless grudgingly alluded to the great man's \\"three o'clock courage.\\" As I understood it, one could expect to wake Grant at an ungodly hour and still get an honest, cold appraisal of the situation as it actually stood.  Not a rationalization. Not a better sounding lie.    Stiglitz, to me, is like that, and so is his Freefall.  This book is a cold, rational appraisal by a man who doesn't have the intention of getting red in the face about anything.    Maybe I should have dropped the Civil War historian reference in favor of a mention of battlefield surgeons, and surgeries, from that era.    I can picture Joe Stiglitz, twelve hours into his rounds, covered in blood and standing next to a quart of bourbon that he'd not had time to drink.    \\"Handsaw, please.\\"    That's how immediate his economic news is to me.    Sad to say, our young Johnny doesn't know how bad he's hit. And his surgeon isn't about to yell.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|Clint Eastwood at his best, paired with John Malcovich at his best, with a great screenplay, photography, editing and direction-it can't get much better.

B00030590I|5.0|In terms of movie reviews, I believe there are far superior reviews than ones I can conjure up for the film. This movie, along with The Fountain, are two of my favorite visual films of all time. The complexity of the film is layered three fold - 1. The physical 2. The emotional and 3. The philosophical.    The first layer is comprised of mixing martial arts, combining wire work against traditional weapons of war - the spear, the sword, the bow and arrow. For those who actually follow Chinese martial arts movies, there are some basic moves that are considered \\"flash moves\\" - moves that performed in dramatic fashion and style, which provides a viewer with distinct visual enhancement (and for you more vocal movie watchers, these are the moments where you go, \\"daaaaaaamnnn\\" or \\"that's gotta hurt\\") Zhang Yimou's direction was not to overdramatize these moves, he instead carefully incorporated them into the Choreography, enhancing but never overshadowing the plot itself, thus never fitting the genre of a traditional martial arts movie.     On a side note, you may or may not know that all stunts were performed by the actors themselves, some of whom have little or no training in how to wield a weapon. In the \\"making of\\" section, Jet Li commented on this particular challenge, \\"it would almost be as if I have no training in Ballet yet took a five day crash course before going on stage for my first performance.\\" Zhang Ziyi was brought up as a dancer, Maggie Cheung (Flying Snow) and Chen Daoming (King) are traditionally dramatic actors, Tony Leung (Broken Sword) hasn't done wirework for some ten years. The only two people who are known for their martial arts skills are Jet Li and Donnie Yen, who (outside of Jackie Chan), are considered two of the best martial artists in the business. The physical demands of these actors and actresses need to be recognized before this review moves further.    The second layer is the emotional. Comprised of the loneliness of a king (Chen Daoming)who has never met his equal, an Nameless Soldier (Jet Li) whose quest for vengeance compels him to assassinate the king, the orphan (Broken Sword) and his quest to find a \\"home\\" with Flying Snow, the turmoil and jealousy triangle involved between Flying Snow, Broken Sword, and Moon and finally the deep emotional bond between Broken Sword and Flying Snow. The latter theme is beautifully demonstrated when they try to sacrifice themselves in the place of the other in a staged fight with Nameless. Broken's Swords' deep love for Flying Snow is demonstrated in his mentoring of her swordsmanship, but his deep love of those \\"Under Heaven\\" demands his sacrifice of his love for Flying Snow.     The complexity of their relationship also resides in a conflict of philosophical proportions - Flying Snow's need for vengeance in order to find peace, and Broken Swords' discovery that peace is found where there is no weapon either in hand or heart. His understanding compels him to not kill the king, at the cost of Flying Snow's love. Such an understanding leads me to the third layer of the movie - the philosophical.    When viewed through an ethnocentric Western lens, I can see some aspects of the film validating the \\"dictatorship\\" form of government formerly employed by China. However, my rebuttal is that the film's direction is FAR deeper than that. The film responds to a form of government that Plato called the Philosopher King. One of his most cited ideas is \\"[A] true pilot must of necessity pay attention to the seasons, the heavens, the stars, the winds, and everything proper to the craft if he is really to rule a ship\\" (The Republic, 6.488d). Plato claims that the sailors (i.e., the people of the city-state over whom the philosopher is the potential ruler) ignore the philosopher's \\"idle stargazing\\" because they have never encountered a true philosopher before. In this case the Philosopher King is the King himself. His wisdom is demonstrated by his attention to the essential characters of Flying Snow and Broken Sword, his real vision to stop the warring of the 6 Kingdoms and unite them under a single rule, his effort to unify China under a single language, and his attention to the winds and spirits using candles. Unfortunately, \\"without war there can be no peace\\" as the saying goes, the King's governing skills as a philosopher are not demonstrated here, (it is demonstrated in actual documented history however) his skills at conquest are.     Moreover, contrary to a Western, individualistic society, the Chinese and East Asian countries are collective in nature, which means that people tend to view themselves as members of groups and sacrifice to benefit the group, never to the needs of individuals. Baring that in mind, the sacrifices of Broken Sword and Nameless are not validations of the particular form of government, but are in the name of peace. In their review of the words Tian Xia (Under Heaven) drawn in the sand, they have discovered that their sacrifices are for the peace of the 6 kingdoms and the millions of people who would be united \\"Under Heaven.\\" Such is the reason that the King cannot be killed, such is also the reason they (and even the King) are willing to give up their lives to find that peace. In an Eastern perspective, such sacrifice is what bares the title of the movie, \\"HERO\\"      \\"Swordsmanship's first achievement is the unity of man to sword. Sword becomes the man, man becomes sword, and even a blade of grass is a weapon. The second achievement is when the sword exists in one's heart. When absent from one's hand, one can still strike an enemy with bare hands. But swordsmanship's ultimate achievement is the absence of the sword in both hand and heart. The swordsman embraces the world and everything in it. He does not kill and maintains peace instead.\\"
B002QQ8HAG|4.0|Marvelous look into the making, design and people who put the September Issue of Vogue out to the public. The fashion magazine that is a part of our culture and gives us the in depth study of fashion around the world.<br /><br />Anna Wintour is the the influential editor of 'Vogue' and everyone is reverential to her. Heads of fashion studios do her bidding, they understand she can make and break their careers. In fact, Anna likes to control those around her, Anna wants all of her people to be in shape and to be healthy. Several of her staff mentioned that she has suggested they go to the gym. We are shown a little bit of Anna's personal life. She speaks of her two brothers and sister, all very successful in their lives, and she says her family thinks her job is 'interesting'. She feels her job as editor of Vogue was predestined- she made a list of what she would like to be as a child, and she said work for Vogue. Her father chastened her and said 'Editor of Vogue and here she is, fulfilling her father's wish!<br /><br />Grace Coddington is the creative director and a more down to earth, realistic woman. She Was a model in the 60's and 70's and later went to work in the field of fashion, working her way up the ladder at Vogue. Anna Wintour considers her a genius in her field. Grace has long red hair, one of her trademarks. I kept thinking throughout the film that her stringy, frizzy hair really needed a shaping and cutting. Grace seems to love color, but is found wearing black much of the time. We can tell as we watch her work that she has an eye for fashion and creative design. Her scenes are fabulous, and this film is as much about her as it is Anna. They admire each other and have found ways to work with each other, but I suspect, Grace suffers more stress as her work is deleted.<br /><br />The two of them, Anna and Grace together, are formidable. Each knows and understands they job, and they do not deal with fools easily. Anna is known as the 'ice lady' but she is the head of the company and the success of each magazine rests on her shoulders.  She has power and uses it wisely from my perspective.  In her home she shows a softer version, and when she looks at her daughter you can see how proud she is of her daughter and how much she loves her. But, it is often the severe Anna we see, the fashion designers' hands tremble in her presence. One large jolly fellow is, Andr&eacute; Leon Talley, Vogue's resident jester, who wears a different bizarre suit, coat and hat every time he appears. The characters who are and surround the staff are all excellent and excel,and God help them if they make an error.<br /><br />Anna Wintour claims that \\"fashion is not about looking back, it's about looking forward.

0099450259|4.0|I read this book because my girlfriend works with Autistic children and she wanted to read it together.  I didn't expect much; from the cover, I thought it was Young adult liturature.  It turns out that it was a great read with a lot of depth.  It was amazing how much tension resulted from everyday situations when seen through the eyes of someone with Aspeger's.  It definitly increased my perspective on this condition.  Despite the tension it was a pleasant read, with a lot of humor.  It was a good page turner for me.  I stayed up way too late finishing it.
0393075966|4.0|This is a rather large book, but it is full of useful historic information   about the present economic global recession. Joseph Seiglitz was in a position to   see clearly the events that lead up to the recession, and to project his ideas   about what the near future might hold.   Stiglitz strongly favors more strict regulation of the investment banks and the private banks. His repititon of thoughts, kind of like a professor giving a university course, is good in a way, in that it helps one to remember the multitude of details.   Stiglitz is credible, and I recommend this book to anyone who desires factual information about how the world got into the present financial mess and possibly how to get out of it.

B001KVZ6FW|2.0|\\"Up\\" is a good movie.  It's visually impressive, with lots of colorful and exciting CGI images.  The story line is fun and funny for kids and adults.  However, I'm only giving it a 2 star rating because of the packaging.  My 8 year old Godson is hearing impaired.  He can't go to the movies because most don't provide earphones or closed captioning for the deaf/hearing impaired.  He had \\"heard\\" about \\"Up\\" from friends and wanted badly to see it, so I promised him a movie night when the DVD came out.  Unfortunately, when I went to the video store to rent it, I discovered that it came without subtitles or closed captioning.  Try explaining to a disappointed 8 year old that he can't see the same movie all his friends are enjoying because the company producing it is too cheap to add those conveniences.  If it's a question of money, then sell the DVDs for $1 more each.  I'm disapponted in Pixar and wrote to the company to express that disappointment.  Their response?  Silencio!

Culminating 3 years later in the 34th Voyage.<br /><br />Should anyone be allowed to go on Voyage 34?<br />- Only if mentally and emotionally prepared for the aftershocks.<br /><br />Does Porcupine Tree cause hallucinations?<br />- Do snakes have hips?<br />Well, no actually they don't so that is the wrong answer.<br />[But we just love that saying anyway]<br />So let's try that one again.<br /><br />Does Porcupine Tree cause hallucinations?<br />- Did your mother give birth to you?<br />[Test Tube Babies need not apply]<br /><br />How long does Voyage 34 last?<br />- 70 minutes > 41 seconds.<br /><br />Is Porcupine Tree habit forming?<br />- Extremely so. Do not partake of the Tree thinking of it only as a recreational drug. It will affect your entire life ~ both waking and sleeping.<br /><br />What effect does Voyage 34 have?<br />- This remarkable, sometimes incoherent transcript illustrates a phantasmagoria of fear, terror, grief, exaltation and finally breakdown. Its highlights have been compressed on this recording to make their own disquieting points.<br /><br />Does Porcupine Tree pose a danger?<br />- Yes.

B000O59AFC|3.0|If you take this movie on it's own without the knowledge of the original series you can enjoy it on the level of a good spy movie. But if you want what the original series was about: a TEAM of people fighting evil international forces who want to destroy democracy , then  forget about it. And that holds true for the sequels as well.  Instead of fighting international badguys; it is all traitors and other evil american stereotypical villians. Which is ok for this movie, but it makes the other two sequels  just lame. There is a whole world of bad evil forces out there and all we get is traitors and evil americans? Still in spite of that fact this movie is a good spy movie and it's well made on every other level. The blu ray looks great and is well worth owning if you want this movie.  Still how lame is it that they didn't have a real character driven team in any of the three movies?
0812973992|3.0|This book is told through many vignettes.   Each one is told with the same formula: Loads, and loads and loads of exposition, with very little plot moving forward.  Almost everything is backwards momentum. Where the excitement does come, however, is in the connections of the vignettes.   That, to me, is what McCann is \\"doing\\" with this book, and yet those connections don't pay-off hard enough or often enough to have moved me greatly.   And, the connections ultimately fail to really bring the book all together in a climax.   I definitely sat through some tedious and/dubious characters to get to.... not much, really.

1400032717|5.0|Well I read many of the reviews and I was very disappointed to see how many people hated this book. Since I didn't know anything about autism I was very interested to see what this book was about. I really, really liked it and I now want to lean more about autism. If I think that way after reading this maybe there are others who think similar and that is a good thing. I don't believe this is the only way to view autism, but it is A way. THIS IS A NOVEL or fiction, not a true storry! Since I read this book I talked to some people who have kids with autism and many say this book is a fiction, but has some true elements.    I just want to say to the parents of autistic children who hated this book, that I now want to learn more about Your child's condition and maybe one day I will work with kids like Yours and help them. You never know where you find inspiration and interest in a subject so keep Your mind and heart open!!
0767020308|5.0|There has been lots of enthusiastic hoopla over the newest (2009) BBC Emma with Romola Garai.  But this earlier adaptation, with the wonderful script by Andrew Davies, is still the best. Davies has a genius for preserving period language, which, in Austen's case particuarly, is crucial to period drama. This is only one reason why I prefer this over the 2009 version, whose screenwriters have modernized and, in my opinion, dumbed down Austen's language.     This version is not only perfectly cast, but perfectly acted--all the characters are portrayed exactly as Austen wrote them. Production values, of course, are top drawer, and the musical score is appropriately suited to the period. (Another unfortunate trend these days, besides modernizing the language, is using music that is jarringly modern.)    Despite glowing customer reviews of the 2009 version, this one is still the most faithful in terms of language and character portrayal. Let's hope the current trend of trying to make Austen \\"fresh\\" for today's audience is short-lived. She is timeless just as she is.
B000WTNCYA|4.0|I liked this cd. Keep in mind its a first release from the artist. The new one is very good and has more range. The music is hypnotic and I love, love, love her voice. This cd and her new one are two of my faves right now.
006621131X|4.0|This was a great story, especially if you are near or about the age of Patti Smith and can<br />remember the artists, places, music, sites, etc. that she mentions throughout the book.<br />The story was touching and deep in it's overall meaning. I would highly recommend it.
B001NESPHC|5.0|I saw this artist featured on a new show and I previewed the cd, and after I received it, its already one of my faves!!! This has soul, heart, blues, jazzy- and all kinds of sadness and happiness all rolled into one. One of the best blues/jazz cd's Ive ever heard in today's time. A must have in your collection no matter your taste!

B002WY65W4|1.0|After hearing all of the positive reviews the \\"experts\\" gave this(which they usually dont give out alot to comedys) and hearing my friends go on and on about how hilarious this is I went and bought the movie.  I watched it once.  And thought it was the dumbest movie EVER.  My friends were like \\"watch it again, the second time wears on you and you will laugh your tail off\\".  I am 55 min in for the second time as we speak, and I hate it more then I did the first time.<br /><br />I have a huge sense of humor and my fav. movies are Comedys.  i was expecting this movie to blow Step Brothers and Anchorman away.  I can honestly say, I didnt laugh one time the entire movie.<br /><br />Im not sure where all the great reviews come from, because this movie is a dissapointment.
1594488878|5.0|The compassion just knocks me out.  It's in there, in the humor.  What a writer.
B00003CWN3|5.0|I have always enjoyed watching \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" because it is so real and the acting is excellent.<br />Hilary Swank is amazing as Brandon (Teena Brandon), she puts all her heart and soul into this film and it totally shows.<br /><br />A+
B002L9N4DS|5.0|\\"Forrest Gump\\" (1994) is a classic, iconic American movie I think will live on. It's about a generation (about 30 years) from John F. Kennedy through the L.B.J. and Nixon administrations and beyond. Much of the early movie is comic. At the beginning and end of the movie we see Forest waiting and a feather floating through the air: life goes on, the circle of life persists and endures. Forrest, mentally challenged, learns to run like a house afire to get away from his enemies and his demons.<br /> Through a groundbreaking process we see Forrest's image merged with the real images on newsreel footage of the American presidents he meets. He isn't greatly impressed by famous people, fame for himself or money. He's loving, extremely loyal, kind, gentle, naïve, trusting, courageous, and a lot smarter about life than most of the people around him.<br />Tom Hanks, the quintessential American movie star of the last thirty years, does a fantastic job as Forrest. The movie is full of adages and sayings (like \\"stupid is as stupid does\\") that Forrest repeats and lives by. He and his mother (Sally Fields) have a deep connection, and he has one love in his life, his childhood sweetheart, Jennie. She's a sixties love child who deeply disappoints Forrest by becoming part of the 60's and 70's drug culture, but their love triumphs.<br />Because of his ability to outrun everybody, Forest Gump becomes a football star and an accidental hero in the Vietnam War saving Bubba Blue, the shrimp fisherman he's befriended. He also saves Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who eventually becomes his business partner and life-long friend. He goes into Bubba's shrimp business after the Vietnam War, and he becomes successful along with Lieutenant Dan.<br />The movie reaches into pathos, but it can be excused for those excesses. It's a classic. Life just happens to Forrest, everything is accidental, not due to his planning, but he endures as an American icon.

0307276902|1.0|I read this knowing full well it was fiction, after the furor.  The plot is sophmoric.  Everything tied up so neatly.  Tiresome language.  And the treatment of the female lead is a deplorable exploitation.  It's hard to exploit someone who is not real but that might be Frey's singular talent.  Dreck
B0030BOCKK|5.0|I became a HIM fan when Razorblade Romance came out and love all their albums, Though I like some more than others and found their last album Venus Doom a little lacking compared to Razorblade Romance, Love Metal, or Dark Light. But Screamworks however is up there with their best! I read some reviews on this and fully disagree with people saying that HIM sound different, How? it sounds like Love Metal and Dark Light albeit evolved a bit.<br />Ville's vocals are the best they've been since Love Metal and the band is firing on all cylinders, If you appreciate this band and haven't got this cd yet GET IT NOW! And the same goes for anyone looking for a great rock record.
0375704027|5.0|In some ways I regret reading it as it sets such a high bar for everything that follows.  The hardest thing to do is to take the tried and make it new.  A love story? Mundane right? And no talking cats.  A thrill ride of language to the last.
0321544080|5.0|I love Joe McNallys books. This one is another masterpiece.  The book is very well written and a joy to read from cover to cover.  You think you know it all, but there are new tips and tricks to learn, literaly on every page.  You will be forced to think in different options, each time you face a new troublesom lightening situation or a tricky \\"subject\\" handeling ditto.  This is not a manual, but a well of real life experience.  Use it to enhance your work. A great source of inspiration!

B002T9H2MO|5.0|I've heard nothing but great things about Moon from both critics and us regular movie watching folks, so I'm happy to say that the hype did not let me down.<br /><br />The movie starts off slow, but then the mystery element kicks in and keeps this baby moving right along. It plays out like an extended Twilight Zone episode, but in this case, it's like one of the great episodes. There are also a lot of similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey. The main twist is revealed earlier on than I expected, but I liked the way it was handeled. You think you have it figured out, then it goes in a surprisingly new direction. I have to admit that it caught me off guard.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is very convincing here in a role that requires him to just talk to a robot, voiced by Kevin Spacey, or to himself. Since he is the only actor we see for 95 minutes, his role demands someone of his talents and he deserved an Oscar nomination, as did the movie itself. Why broaden the Best Picture category to 10 films this year and put The Blind Side in over Moon?<br /><br />I recommend not knowing anything about Moon before watching it. I didn't even bother to read the description of the movie before viewing the rental last night. If you must, Amazon gives a brief explanation of the the plot without revealing too much. In any case, this is a low budget Sci-Fi gem that is getting the respect it deserves.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
0823023494|5.0|Great book for character design and personality. Also helps the artist determine the appropriate character style for the project. The book flows like a text book to help the artist learn more throughout the chapters.

1563523302|5.0|The book is still well maintained and I am satisfied with it. The delivery is in the stipulated period so I am satisfied with this too. Thanks.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|This movie had all the great special effects that you would expect from an end of the world movie but the characters were beyond boring. It's basically a guy running all over the place trying to save his family. However, they don't really deserve it. His kids seem more invested in there new stepdad and his ex-wife treats him like a complete idiot. Meanwhile, he is still trying to get everyone to saftey. Yes we have seen this story before but never has it been so boring.  I would definately skip this one. Even the special effects are not enough to save this. I'll give it only one thumb down because of the eplosions. Holla!
0316066524|5.0|It's not that often that I read a book which I have to put down in order to wipe the tears from my eyes -- from laughing.  A book that a year later can still bring a smile when I think of certain parts.  And although I gave it away after reading it, I'm now thinking of buying another copy to read again.    I think what may have tripped up so many of the people who hated this book is that they felt that they should be rewarded in some way for having made the 1000+ page trek.  There's nothing at the end that makes reading this book worthwhile.  No message, no deep philosophy, no characters that go through some satisfying, soul-deep transformation.  It's Jest, folks, Infinite Jest.  So enjoy, don't take it seriously, and feel that you got a bargain when you bought it: after all, it's less than $0.01/page...new.    I can honestly say (and often do) that at 1,000+ pages, I was sorry to see it end.  I could have gone on for another 1,000 (in two volumes, hopefully).    By the way, the book has no ending that ties everything up.  It's infinite, get it?
B0014DBZY2|3.0|Very good musicians who call to mind Gang Of Four and perhaps Primus with their robotically, precise rhythm section. They also have a fondness for pummeling the standard Ska beat into a choppy, frenetic transition between the more drum-wonky, herky jerky segments of their songs. There aren't many bands around with this much drumming flash & dash up front, but the entire package leaves one feeling a bit cold in the end.
B0026RHR6K|1.0|This Is NOT the real Battlestar Galactica!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why didn`t they call it Galactica or something like that? Think about it. In the Real Battlestar Galactica, Starbuck is a Man, The Cylons was not made by Humans, but by A Race from a Planet who hates humans. If you haven`t seen the real Battlestar Galactica, Look for it and watch the real thing. This, Battlestar Galactica, from what I`ve seen, is ok, but they should of called it something different. Watch and Enjoy what the real Series is all about. Don`t get me wrong theres nothing wrong with this show. They could have named it--- Battlestar Galactica: In The Future; or Battlestar Galactica: 100 yrs. Later--- You know after the First Battlestar Galactica Ended, then tell what happened to The Next Generation. Thats what they should of done.
B00319ECHE|5.0|Ever since Obsolete came out, and every release since then, I have been wishing that Fear Factory would return to and stick with the Demanufacture era sound. I am not saying that everything since Obsolete has been bad, I just prefer the Demanufacture sound and production. Well, I finaly got my wish with Mechanize! I absolutely love this cd and it is my 2nd favorite Fear Factory cd, easily blowing away anything else released since Demanufacture. When Transgression came out, I had just about given up completely on these guys but they restored my faith with this one.  Also, more credit needs to be given to Rhys Fulber. He is the 5th member.    Favorite songs:  - Controlled Demolition  - Oxidizer  - Industrial Discipline  - Final Exit  - Christploitation  - Fear Campaing    All 10 songs are masterpeices. Even the Crash Test remake kicks even more ass than the original.
140120841X|4.0|Another foot of snow & its too hard to get around by car, especially when your car is stuck in an unplowed lot. What a perfect day, then, to finish Alan Moore's \\"V for Vendetta,\\" a graphic novel about a mask-wearing terrorist blowing up London landmarks in the hopes of inspiring a revolution against England's reigning totalitarian government. Its basically a twist and shake of Orwell's \\"1984,\\" except with an avenging superhero.<br /><br />\\"V\\" isn't nearly so sophisticated intellectually as Moore's \\"Watchmen and that was disappointing. The earlier chapters, in particular, written, according to Moore, when he was younger and not yet wiser, are pretty simplistic fare. The story--and the characters--gets more complex as it advances from the halfway point on. Moore plants some nice suprises in the plot which would have been more of a surprise if I hadn't gotten the whole story from a friend who'd seen the movie.<br /><br />So, despite a somewhat straightforward \\"black-and-white\\" plot, Moore does inject some subtle shades of gray into his story to keep us off-balance, attempting to challenge our received ideas about right and wrong, freedom and oppression, law and anarchy. Even more pointedly, \\"V\\" raises the discomforting question \\"when is it one's duty to take up arms against the 'lawful' tyranny of one's own government?\\" What happens when we discover that the Law not only has the potential to become the tyranny with the biggest muscles, but it also has the loudest propaganda?<br /><br />These are questions that no government is happy to know its citizens are asking.<br /><br />Luckily for the powers-that-be, few people will come away from \\"V\\" seriously questioning their own freedom or the line they would rather die than cross if it meant surrendering what freedoms they might still retain. What the best tyrannies manage to do is to instill in the minds of their citizen-slaves the myth that they are free. In creating a fascist future for England, Moore has exaggerated the fictional evil more than enough to camouflaged it in real life. In fact, by putting such an exaggeratedly \\"evil\\" mask on the totalitarian state in \\"V for Vendetta,\\" Moore has done the oppressors an (involuntary?) invaluable service: he has made it that much harder to recognize the far subtler, far more benevolent mask that totalitarianism wears in our own culture.<br /><br />Isnt that a cool conspiracy notion? That even at the level of comic books, the government employs propagandists; that the State uses writers--the best propagandists of all!--to create a reality we've never actually seen but implicity believe exists. These writers create stories, poems, films--and graphic novels--to put a mask on evil so we'll never recognize it ruling over our own lives. We'll always be looking for someone else, for evil to look like something else, for it to look, for example, as it does in this book.<br /><br />I'm on to you Alan Moore! In \\"unmasking\\" V, you've blindfolded us!<br /><br />Oh, btw, I almost forgot to mention it: the art. The art in this book struck me, overall, as surprisingly muddy. Whats more, so many of the characters looked enough alike it was difficult to distinguish between them. And yet...and you wouldnt think it possible given the preceding...it was often just as difficult to see the similarities in characters from chapter to chapter. There just wasnt enough consistency, it seemed to me, especially when the characters showed emotion or physical distress. This is especially true of Evie who's supposed to be sixteen, at times looks to be in her late 50s, and ends up looking like Shirley from Laverne & Shirley...no, no, that woman who played Suzanne Somers and John Ritter's roomates on 3's Company...she looks like that woman by the end of V, which is bad enough, but worse is that she looked nothing like that at the beginning of the story.<br /><br />Anyway, this artist, David Lloyd is supposed to be some huge comic book drawing talent, judging from the wayAlan Moore goes on about him in the afterword, but outside of a few panels and a handful of techniques here and there, I wasn't all that bowled over by it.<br /><br />That's not why I'm thinking that I'll read a book without pictures next. Its just time.<br /><br />There goes a plow. Help! I'm going to go outside and shoot an entire aerosol can of hairspray into the sky. We need some more global warming. We need it fast!a few panels and a handful of techniques here and there, I wasn't all that bowled over by it.     That's not why I'm thinking that I'll read a book without pictures next.

B0006GAO5Y|5.0|Well they say the first is always the best , and in this case that is the story here.The old rags to riches story but in this case the film ends on a good note where Rocky does not win the title but ends up a winner in every other aspect.Great performances from Burgess Meredith and Carl Weathers and not forgetting Burt Young as Paulie.For a publicity stunt the world champion Apollo Creed decides to give a unknown a shot at the title , with nearly disasterous results for him at the end of the film.A great performance by Stallone where he also wrote the script , done on a budget the film raked in millions and made a star out of him.I have all the Rocky films but rate this and Rocky 2 as the best.From Rocky 3 on they sort of lost there way a bit , I would rate 3 , 4 and 5 with 3 stars and Rocky Balboa with 4 as they went back more to the grass roots with this film which I liked.
0786868724|4.0|I do like Mitch Albom. I've read two other books of his, The Five People You Meet in Heaven and For One More Day, and they are both so different from other books I read. Going into this one, I was expecting some serious reflection on my life.<br /><br />This book follows Albom in his interaction with two \\"Men of God\\". His childhood Rabbi who has asked him to do his eulogy, and Pastor Covington, a reformed drug dealer who is struggling to keep his decaying church afloat. Both men teach him profound things about life, love, and faith.<br /><br />This book claimed it would inspire me, and it did. It is a quick read, but it has a lot to say. Some of the writing was downright beautiful, and there are quite a few memorable quotes. My favorite was this: \\"The story of my recent life. I like that phrase. It makes more sense than the story of my life, because we get so many lives between birth and death. A life to be a child. A life to come of age. A life to wander, to settle, to fall in love, to parent, to test our promise, to realize our mortality- and in some lucky cases, to do something after that realization.\\" This book was just filled with little moments that shine, and the characters are so exuberant, I wish I could meet them.<br /><br />If you ever feel the need to be spiritual, to feel better about yourself, this book will give you the opportunity.
B000O77SRC|5.0|Well I have a huge collection of dvds at my house and over the next few years I am going to do a lot of reviews  to help people make the right choices when it comes to starting off your own movie library.What can I say about this first Die Hard film only that I still think personally this is the best out of the lot.They (the die hard movies) are all good action films but the first has normally original ideas , Bruce is at his best and I still reckon this is Alan Rickmans finest hour as the baddie Hans Gruber.I am lucky I was in my teens when all these great films like Terminator , Predator and Die Hard were released.As they have kept these francises going in sequels and Television shows a lot of the younger generation are in awe of these earlier films , a lot have said to me how lucky I was to have seen these on the big screen when they came out.In these older films like Die Hard a lot of stuntmen were used , great sets and minatures were also made and that is what sets them apart , CGI was in its infancy back then, thats what makes them so special-the lack of CGI.I went to see Night At The Museum 2 with my wife and daughter and even though i did enjoy the film the cost of going to see it on the big screen was exspensive-$45.00NZ dollars , that included a icecream each and one big box of popcorn which we all sheared.Die Hard back in 88' cost me about $6.00NZ to go and see , for one adult now it is $14.00NZ so we tend not to go and see them on the big screen anymore.Anyway back to the movie - great performances by all , huge exsplosions and great one liners , what more can you want , directed by John McTiernan who also did Predator and The Hunt For Red October-one of my favourite directors who has all but disappeared now. This is a easy to watch film and it seems to be over before you know it ,which is the sign of a good film-fast paced and not boring.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and at the end everyone stood up and clapped.  It made me cry, it made me smile, and it made me realize that the best was yet to come.  What a loss!
B0031OCY2E|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite + Cheesy 70s Movies + Steven Soderbourgh    This movie has me in stitches. From the music to the hillarious asides to the cinematography. It's wall to wall dry humor.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I loved the original and I love the 25th anniversary edition.  There will never be another like Michael!
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel Washington, one of my favorite actors, won his second Academy Award, this one for Best Actor, playing an unscrupulous, evil, demented police officer working the mean streets of Los Angeles. He gets a new partner in the form of Ethan Hawke, a young and innocent new rookie cop who is shocked by his partners unorthadox ways. \\"Training Day\\" is fast-paced, involving, and action packed, and just when you think the villin is going to get away with being bad, your vaulted out of your seat. Normally villins in movie history never win Oscars for their portrayals, but Denzel is so convincing you forget any of his other performances, a true mark of a splendid and versatile actor. The DVD set comes with audio commentary, an HBO look behind the scenes of the movie, 2 music videos, alternate ending, and more. The DVD is single layered. Rolling Stone says, \\"Denzel Washington is a sparking, snapping live wire\\".
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This DVD collections is brilliant and should definitely be in all Lost fans DVD collection. Season 4 is definitely the most action packed intense thrill ride known to man. Great show!
B002WY65W4|5.0|Zombieland is a fun and funny horror comedy that entertains totally and makes one ask how bad would a zombie plague be?  Highly recommend this to dark comedy fans everywhere.
0805091742|5.0|This book offers excellent information and advice on how to work as an effective and efficient team. It does not matter what business you are in, you will beneft immensely from this author's message. (I originally heard the author on NPR and was so impressed.)
B000I2J0W4|1.0|Stanley Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\" is a classic horror movie, starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. The movie is loosely based on a Stephen King novel.<br /><br />The movie is, of course, a turkey. It's not a co-incidence that \\"The Shining\\" has been frequently lampooned over the years. Especially the evil twins. Another iconic scene shows Nicholson looking at us through a big hole in the bathroom door. Here comes Johnny!<br /><br />Personally, I was scared by this movie when I was about 10 years old. Today, I suspect that the only people who like it are Stanley Kubrick cultists. But then, they like \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" as well.<br /><br />However, I readily admit that Jack Nicholson is excellent starring a man slowly descending into madness. He always is. Now, *that's* scary.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Awesome Headset. Sits very well on the head, some reviewers claim there is noise in the unit when you move, not true for myself.    There is a bit of buzzing in my headset also, have not yet found a solution (the game volume Intensifies the white noise).  I currently have the headphones setup for my computer.     The Connections For This Headphone:  USB  Red & White Audio Jacks (RCA)    These Headphones Did Not Come With A Headphone Jack Adapter For The R&W Plugs, Luckily I Had One Laying Around.  My Machine Registered The USB As The Main Headset For Audio, So Be Aware To Change That To The Headphone Jack.  Also With My Sound Card, I Had To Change The Settings To Manual To Setup The Surround.    Pros: Awesome Sound, Microphone Is Crystal Clear, Very Comfortable To Wear, Microphone Super Adjustable (compared to fixed mics). The Bass Is Incredible, & The Amplifier Controls Are Easy To Use    Cons: A Little Pricey,  Initial Setup,  WHITE NOISE,  Cable Adapters Not Provided.    Be Aware For PS3 Users,  You Need Your Component or rca Jacks To Make This Work.  (Granted If You Do Not Have Headphone Or Audio Out On Your Television)(You CAN Still Use The HDMI For Video)    Side Note.  These Things Are Loud. Totally 1337
B002T9H2L0|1.0|This movie is aptly named. It is indeed one of the biggest disappointments and pure pieces of garbage ever to disgrace my DVD player.<br /><br />It takes incredible liberties with the truth and has no basis in fact. It's attempt to appear artsy-fartsy is merely boring and out of place like a aria in a comic book.<br /><br />Never in the long history of war movies has there been a bigger piece of crap.<br /><br />When the great WWII movies are discussed like the Battle of Britain, the Longest Day, In Harms Way, Patton, A Bridge Too Far- this film deserves no mention because it is not great OR even true.<br /><br />It's not great. It's not even mediocre. It's an exploitation piece shot to make money with a big name cast (who should be ashamed of themselves) a substandard script and a director with delusions of adequacy.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on someone's fantasy of what WWII was like.<br /><br />Go with what really is great and true. The Germans were a dangerous enemy because they were smart, professional soldiers. By making them into blundering idiots cheapens a victory that a lot of people paid the ultimate price to win.
B003102JDM|5.0|Probably the, \\"artiest\\", thing the Cohen Bros have done since Barton Fink; A Serious Man is loosely a modern day adaptation of the book of JOB. Already notorious with a sense of humor that can be a little mean; the Cohen Bros. fill this movie with amazing scenes that are filled with a bitter anxiety but also a deffinite comedic dynamic. The film is asking you for a couple of viewings, to take in everything; and that's what makes this a great film to own.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This item came exactly as it was advertised and it was even still in the plastic which surprised me.  I would definitely buy from them again.
B001SS3JS8|5.0|Prior to reading The Pact, I read several of Jodi Picoult books.  Yet, The Pact exceeds the others by far and pulls at your heart unlike any other.  Picoult tells the story of two families torn apart after their son and daughter are involved in a suicide.  Picoult intertwines past and present, bringing us closer to the family members.  She does a wonderful job at portraying the issue of teen suicide and writes a heart-wrenching novel that will leave you breathless until the very last word.  I would definitely recommend The Pact, as it impacted me greater than any other novel I have read.  Two thumbs up for Jodi Picoult!
B001LF4IA6|5.0|I didn't latch on to Springsteen when I was a kid despite the popularity of Born in the USA when I was six (I sure did love Dancing in the Dark, though).  I recall liking Human Touch (the song) when it was released, but it wasn't until I got out of high school that I realized there was more to The Boss due to Secret Garden being such a big part of the Jerry Maguire advertising campaign.  That song refused to leave my head and so I purchased Greatest Hits, knowing only Hungry Heart, Born In The USA, Glory Days, Dancing In The Dark, Human Touch, Secret Garden, and Streets of Philadelphia.  That made it easy to validate the purchase, but when I actually listened to the whole thing I realized there was much more, though it took me a couple of more years until I explored Springsteen more fully.    When I finally got Born To Run and popped it in to a CD player I was mesmerized.  I love music.  I love what a song or a good album can do, but I'd never been TAKEN somewhere before.  I'd never just been sucked into a different world by an album.  By a book, yes.  By a film, yes.  And here was Bruce Springsteen just taking me away.  The experience was exhilarating.  Upon exploration I did find another Boss album capable of doing that - The Wild, The Innocent, and The E-Street Shuffle.  And that's not meant as an indictment on his other work, but those two albums feel very cohesive and they really flow and take you from scene to scene.  I may like Darkness On The Edge Of Town better than either (or not, have trouble ranking them), but it is not cinematic like those two.    And that brings me to Working On A Dream.  I avoided it for over a year for some reason.  I think that my enthusiasm for Springsteen had quieted down a bit.  I really liked Magic and The Rising, but had gotten into other things and for me time can often lessen my view of an artist, not enhance it.  Overall I think the 2000s were one of Bruce's best decades.  Great output throughout.    But The Rising, Devils &Dust, The Seeger Sessions, and Magic didn't take me somewhere.  So, after putting it off for a long while I finally put Working On A Dream in ye olde Zune and hit play.  It was then that it happened.    The Boss took me somewhere again, though not in the way of those masterpieces from the 70s.  This was more mature and definitely not as cohesive, yet it somehow all fit together seamlessly.    From the folktale of Outlaw Pete that recalls the absurdities of that genre and of The Boss' old street gang songs to the overlaid guitars, vocals, keyboards, and more of My Lucky Day and beyond, this record is wonderful and mature.  I doubt Bruce could make Born to Run today - he's no longer naive.  People always point to those type of things with older artists, but Young Bruce could never have made something with the emotional depth and knowledge of Working On A Dream.    Here he deals with love, growing old, with loss and does it beautifully.  Even a song like Queen of the Supermarket, an easy one to write off like Outlaw Pete, has a lot more depth when you really listen to it.  Besides, I think a lot of people have had those encounters with waitresses, checkout girls, etc where the possibility of something greater sneaks into your head.  Here the singer idealizes her just as the singer of Cynthia from the BUSA sessions did - the women serves as the exemplary ideal even if reality can't match it, but while he doesn't approach her and confess his feelings she can still serve as a pillar of all that is right in the world.  In that the character is naive, but there is a beauty in the naivete.    This album is laced with beauty that has become too uncommon in modern music.  This Life is beautifully on so many levels, from the craftsmanship of the music to the lyrics that really captures the beauty of life and love.  Kingdom of Days is another eloquent pop song that focuses on man and wife growing old together with Surprise Surprise closing out this cycle wonderfully.    The record closes (I'm ignoring The Wrestler as part of the record - great song that I regard as a separate item) with a goodbye and a sequel to Wild Billy's Circus Story from The Wild, The Innocent, and The E-Street Shuffle.  The Last Carnival is a beautiful farewell to Danny Federici, long time E-Street organist who died of cancer in 2008.  As a fan, this song chokes me up as Danny is put in the role of Billy who has died and will no longer join the carnival as it goes from town to town.  From the lead in carnival music (played by Federici's son) to the end with a chorus of angelic voices, this song is perfect, bittersweet, and heartfelt.      I wish I would have listened to this record sooner.  It's difficult to rank Springsteen's work, but he is clearly one of the greatest rock'n'roll artists ever.  This album probably flows the best of any of his albums since Born In The USA (Tunnel of Love, Human Touch, Lucky Town, Tom Joad, Rising, etc all had a hiccup here or there).  It is definitely his most pop oriented sound since Born In The USA, though it's not like that or The River entirely, with more Brian Wilson inspired stuff here.  But the pop sound works so well for Springsteen.  The problem with so much pop is that it is mindless lyrically and musically, but this album is neither.  The lyrics are mostly thoughtful with some quirks and the songcraft is top notch.  It's a shame that this is not the norm.  The kids all want to take the easy way out while making a quick buck, but not The Boss.  Buy it and then buy more Bruce if you haven't already.  I guarantee your opinion of a lot of the newest popular stuff will drop dramatically.
1592289444|5.0|We first became acquainted with this memoir about 10 years ago. My husband sat on the edge of the bed one evening to peruse the book. He was so captivated that he read the entire book within a few hours. We were so impressed with the tenacity of the author and his heroic escape that we told all of our friends and loaned our first copy out. Just several weeks ago we wanted to re-read it and couldn't find our copy. I ordered another one and have it waiting in the \\"wings\\" to read again. As last time, my husband picked up the book to review it and forced himself to put it down until his current book was finished. It is as good a read as the first time around. We give it five stars for its adventure, heroism, and vivid descriptive passages.
B00005JKYI|5.0|This movie is timeless and pure entertainment...it's a reminder of the angst of teenage years, dating, parental approval, best friends and the joy of living in a simpler time.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|The Shooter is just one of those movies that I could watch at any time and still enjoy.  It's full of action - very realistic etc.  I forget his name but the young guy who plays the FBI agent and the old Tennessee gun expert are excellent in their roles.  Just outstanding.  I also have to say that the final seane where the \\"seating US Senator\\" gets his due is a favorite of mone as well - gee, I wonder why?
B001UV4XWY|1.0|I was going to give thi film a very bad review but I decide not to hurt the feeling of the idiots who made it so only giving it a bad review. If there was anything good about it it must have been during the time when I fell aleep. The story, theme, acting , photography, producing and directing must have been by a group of over zealous christian evangelists. Bits and pieces were borrowed from other sci-fi movies. I hope the people who were involved in making this movie have a second career lined up. Maybe they could get work sweeping streets for Mr. Warner. Did they really get enough money in their church collection plates to finanve this trashy movie?
B00005R62N|5.0|I love this album, and the bonus tracks kick a#@ as well. New fans (youngens) should use this as a Heavy Metal refferance to the late 70s, early 80s. they were the first hard rock band that was heavy from first song to last song on album.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Not as good as I hoped it would be. I heard a lot of jazz about it, but I was sort of under the impression there would be 30 days worth of work out variations and there are only three different workouts so that was a bit of a disappointment. It gets boring after the first two really.    If you are in decent shape already, while the cardio aspect of the lowest level gets your heart pumping and gets you breathing heavily, it's not much of a work out. My arms were slightly sore for the first two days, but that was it. My abs didn't feel a thing in workout one.    From what I've heard, they won't until workout three, but I am so annoyed with it already I haven't made it that far. Because it was not as effected as I had expected.
B002SK2X3C|4.0|An insider's look at the failure of Lehman Brothers. It is very similar to \\"Liar's Poker\\", but it obviously operates in a more recent timeframe.    It follows a trader, Larry McDonald, from his early beginning hopefully looking through the windows of investment banking, to suddenly being squarely in the centre of the biggest storm since the Great Depression. He tells his story in an engrossing manner, and I found myself unable to go to sleep until I had finished \\"just one more chapter\\".    As can be expected, the book is deeply critical of (CEO) Dick Fuld's strategy; increasing leverage beyond biblical proportions, and ousting anyone who dared to criticize his actions - a strategy that ultimately sealed the fate of the 4th biggest American investment bank.
B00127RAJY|5.0|No better workouts than JM! Totally amazing. I'm converting everyone I love to her workouts. It'd be awesome to have her as your own personal trainer but this is the next best thing. Maybe even better if she's too intense for you :)

B0011UBDTK|5.0|this was way cheaper online than in the stores.  it shipped in its original packaging, arrived in perfect condition and only took about 2 days to arrive using normal shipping.
006621131X|4.0|I am struck by the lack of bitterness and score-settling in the 100 pages I've read so far. I'm surprised by the depth and sincerity of Smith's focus on God. Any young person who sees him- or herself as an \\"artist\\" ought to read this chronicle of Smith's and Mapplethorpe's devotion to the arduous, glorious path that all artists must take.
B002BFBAWO|3.0|I rented this movie because I thought it was going to be another Superbad.  Same directors and some of the same cast, so why not?  While it had some pretty funny moments, it wasn't nearly as funny and was way too predictable.  Sophomore slump, I guess.  Worth a rental definitely.  If you like it, may be worth a purchase.  I really expected more though.  Maybe that's why I feel this was just three of five.  Had it been from anybody else, I would have thought a lot more probably.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The product was in perfect condition and arrived within the mailing dates I was given. Good experience, I would purchase from this seller again.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|I really enjoyed this film, it's not your usual end of thw rold movie and spends mroe time delving into the minds of the lead characters than making you fear the potential threat, the virus.
B0026OE2NY|5.0|Great movie, excellent quality and stunning picture\video. Brought me to a different perspective on earth and it's resources. I'm going to do my part by recycling more and watching what I buy. Thank you
0307454541|5.0|best book of the year. I read girl who played with fire first and was enthralled. I then read dragon tatoo next and was equally amazed. I can't wait for the third in the series, girl who kicked the hornets nest out in may.Too bad Larsson died. He is brilliant
B00004RYZT|5.0|If you like hard rock, this DVD is for you! I don't understand the lyrics, but the music is HARD HITTING and  HEAVY!! Definitely would recommend.. Fantastic!!!
0307271862|5.0|In January 2006 in Sweden, the police arrive at Hesjovallen to find a battered corpse on the outskirts of the jarringly silent village.  Eighteen more severely destroyed bodies are found inside homes; not one living person remains inside the hamlet with no clues where they went.  Dissonantly from the brutal scene is a red ribbon and a nineteenth century diary written by Andren as a gang master of Chinese slaves working the transcontinental railway found in the snow near the first body the cops saw.<br /><br />Judge Birgitta Roslin reads about the worst mass murder massacre in Swedish history.  She is stunned that her Andren grandparents are among the dead; but even more shocking the branch of the Andren family living in Nevada were also brutally murdered.  She feels compelled to learn what happened in Hesjovallen and Nevada.  The clues from the diary already take her back to the American Civil War and China then and now; as well Zimbabwe and Mozambique.  However, all roads eventually lead to London's Chinatown.<br /><br />Although Wallander takes a deserved respite, fans of Henning Mankell will fully appreciate this super thriller that focuses on modern day global issues with links back to the middle of the nineteenth century.  The story line is fast-paced driven predominately by Birgitta as she disagrees with the police conclusion that a lunatic committed the mass murders. She thinks a deliberate intelligent person on a vendetta killed those whose blood caused generational blood flow of his or her family.  The Man from Beijing is a one sitting winner.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B0007WPJBQ|5.0|Quality of the DVD was good and arrived on time.  No complaints - wasn't expecting perfection.  The movie is a classic tale of deception between the two old friends, played by Brando and Malden.  It's well acted and memorable.  Katy Jurado was beautiful.  Highly recommended.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Many excellent reviews of 'District 9' have been posted, so this review will try not to tread the same ground but offer some new perspectives (if that's possible).<br /><br />The film is unusual and despite some minor issues with the editing and the splatter-movie violence, seeing it is time well spent. It’s original in concept and execution, repays at least a couple of repeat viewings and, surprisingly, explores quite deep and thought-provoking subject matter. It manages to be controversial and at the same the antithesis of simplistic or preachy.<br /><br />A mock-documentary style is used in the first part of the film and later reprised to update the subsequent action as it might be seen or reported by other observers in the media and in the street. This is an excellent device which works effectively by telling the audience: here's a wide spectrum of different people seeing this situation from all kinds of perspectives - it's obviously a complex problem with a long history. For example, one speaker justifies a common pejorative for the visitors thus:<br /><br />&#34;Some people call them prawns. You can't say they don't look like prawns. I mean...that's what they look like&#34;<br /><br />Racist terminology is OK for non-humans because our carefully evolved societal norms don't apply to them, see?<br /><br />By introducing the alien space ship and visitors as being present for 30 years the screenplay leapfrogs the &#34;Wow! ETs are here!&#34; sensationalism of first contact and fast-forwards the audience into &#34;...yes, but what might then happen down the line?&#34; Things have degenerated; the aliens are seen as a pestilence, a problem which needs to be contained. The obvious parallel is of new immigrant arrivals into any established community ending up in a sprawling, violent, filthy ghetto town: isolated, corralled, stigmatised, difficult for the authorities and the indigenous population alike. Existing ghetto gangsters - controversially portrayed as Nigerians, a recognised &#34;problem&#34; in the real present-day Johannesburg - prey on the prawns and are in turn preyed on by them: the film makers ran into some problems with the Nigerian government because of this ‘stereotyping.’<br /><br />Exploitation and greed rule here. Do ‘human rights’ apply to non-humans? If not, then why not? Where is the line drawn? The visitors seem to have no concept of human morality nor respect for existing law or property: they simply don’t think that way, and their society does not work with those mores. Should they be managed as a pseudo-human population, or as animals, or as some third category for whom a whole new morality needs to be worked out? Again, no glib or easy answers are offered. They are tolerated and contained, and it's now been decided they need to be moved to a new &#34;improved&#34; containment away from the city.<br /><br />Reportedly the arguments surrounding this film and disagreements about its ‘message’ were intended by Neill Blomkamp, the director and writer. It works on one level as a violent action movie (not really to this particular reviewer's taste) and as such perhaps he was aiming to attract a younger and more easily titillated audience, who might then be led to contemplate the more thoughtful issues at the heart of the story.<br /><br />Is it essentially about apartheid? Not really, it's more complex than that. Global migration, the non-integration and ghetto-ization of minority groups into human societies with older, established populations? Partly. Complex human attitudes and differing responses to a persistently threatening social situation? Yes, maybe.<br /><br />The story of the main protagonist Wikus and his gradual transformation into a deeper, more aware, enlightened human being as fugitive-on-the-run is at the heart of the story. The audience perhaps never fully identifies with the flawed and essentially self-serving Wikus though he does win our sympathy and as the &#34;hero&#34; battling the world alone, the viewer is in the latter part of the film openly rooting for him. Part-hybrid echoing &#34;The Fly,&#34; his transformation is a less-than-subtle allegory for dawning empathy with the visitors' predicament.<br /><br />The alien technology and weaponry looks OK for a modest-budget movie (US$30 million in comparison to Cameron's US$310 million for `Avatar') but does have a rather 1980s look about it. A greater criticism I would have is the gore-splatter violence of countless human bodies exploding complete with flying limbs and internal organs, the sheer gratuitous quantity of which does eventually anaesthetise the viewer. Maybe Blomkamp used this as a device to hook a younger audience more titillated by sensual stimulation into the movie to lead them into deeper waters. The editing is also rather messy in places, but competent enough. District 9 though is superbly realised, a cinematic recreation of an urban slum complete with squalor, chaos and an edge of danger around every corner.<br /><br />The final scene returns to the talking-heads doc format and post-action comments like &#34;Some conspiracy theorists believe...&#34; a fine observation of the ubiquitous CT industry's common way of distorting reality to comply with differing belief-systems, causing the viewer to smile wisely as he/she has been party to Wikus's adventure at close quarters and can now appreciate the chasm which will open between the inevitable emerging CTs and reality. This is fine social observation at its best, a wry humorous dig at the expense of &#34;conspiracists&#34; and excellent script writing and editing.<br /><br />Despite minor flaws, ‘District 9’ is an original piece of work and quite unlike anything else the cinema has seen. The subject matter of &#34;outsiders&#34; being seen as an unwanted, pestilential nuisance alone should give those who advocate &#34;government disclosure&#34; of the UFO/ET issue pause for thought. The film is certainly destined for ‘cult classic’ status and I hope Blomkamp makes another movie half as good as this one.attling the world alone, the viewer is in the latter part of the film openly rooting for him.

B001UV4XWY|1.0|This movie started with promise, intrigue and dragged on like a root canal. The most pointless slow worst movie I have seen since Ravenous. STAY AWAY STAY VERY VERY FAR AWAY! And I like pretty bad movies too. THis one was too much
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I went to see this movie TWICE in the theater, and still wanted to see it again. The video includes so many extras that were NOT shown at the theater version. Definately worth it. One of the best, if not the best concert/music flix I've seen.
1402568851|5.0|I am the school psychologist for a class of teens with Asperger's Syndrome (AS) and related disorders. I purchased a classroom set of books, including the discussion guide and audio set, for the teacher to use as a class project for literature and as part of our disability awareness.  Students with AS have a poor sense of self which underlies their deficits in Theory of Mind (that others have thoughts and feelings different from their own) and social communication. The main character, Christopher, so accurately demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of  AS. What is most fascinating is that my students, who are aware of their disability, cannot relate at all to the main character, even though Christopher has very similar behaviors to their own. All of this reveals how really impaired AS students are in terms of their intra-personal intelligence and ability to manage in every day life although they are bright and knowledge in other ways. The class is progressing slowly through this book, which is a remarkable story and beneficial for teens with AS to read. However, it is more appropriate to read through with them to get maximum benefit. It is a must reading for parents and others who want to understand Asperger's syndrome in every day life.
B00304RMFE|4.0|A series of mini-stories about Halo.  Each one is surprisingly deep and thoughtful.  If you like anime/CG and Halo, you'll love this.
B001E2JNA6|4.0|The story has about two centuries of review. The acting is excellent.  Paying mostly attention to the quality of the video transfer, it is good, but not excellent for a Blu-Ray.  There is an explanation to that effect that the original was not shot with a higher image definition, they wrote 16mm film.  Knowing the reason, the Blu-Ray was made the best it could be.  I enjoyed the film because of its variety of scenery.
B000M0XJ88|3.0|I've had this watch for a few years.  As others have noted, it runs a little fast -- seems like a few minutes every week or so.  Probably not bad at this price point, but it kind of defeats my purpose in getting an automatic watch, which was to not have to worry about the watch -- no winding, no battery, it just works.  Instead, I have to constantly correct it.<br /><br />The other negative for me is the feeling of vibration when it gets moved around -- maybe it is some kind of internal suspension to provide shock resistance, but it feels and sounds a little cheap.  It's a kind of buzzy clack, especially when the watch is moved perpendicular to the face.<br /><br />On the plus side, it looks nice, I enjoy having the day and date, the glass back is cool, and it way exceeded its advertised water resistance for me: I forgot to take it off when I went diving to 45 feet, and it has worked perfectly with no fogging or other signs of trouble since then.  As far as I know it is unrated at any given depth, so that was impressive.<br /><br />If you are sure you want an automatic watch, this is a good and inexpensive way to get there.  For me, I kind of wish I had either gone with a similar watch in quartz for a thinner case and better accuracy, or just gone upmarket.
0446569895|5.0|I loved this book.  It's written in Ozzy's voice, which made it feel like I was listening to him, personally, tell his stories to me (he told these life stories to the actual writer of the book, who turned them into this great memoir).  I learned so much about his personal life that I never knew before; I gained a new respect for the man.  Unlike some books I have been trying to \\"get into\\" lately, I found that I could not put this book down.  Great family & friend photos inside as well.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an entertaining read - whether they are Ozzy fans or not.  I was never a fan of his music, but I really enjoyed learning more about the man himself.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I recently borrowed this movie, knowing nothing about it.  The narrator starts off saying that \\"...this is not a love story...\\" Huh, I wondered, what is THAT supposed to mean....it looks exactly like a love story....  Well, what it is is a refreshingly, offbeat film about two people, Tom and Summer, who both work at a greeting card company.  She is the Executive Assistant and he is a would-be architect who instead writes greeting cards.  The chemistry is almost immediate and you root for them to be together, but again, you remember \\"this is not a love story\\".  The 500 days that Tom is with Summer are portrayed in flashbacks in random order.  I know, for some people this is too weird, and they are already turned off.  I liked it though, it was a different approach and in all the romantic comedies and movies in general I tend to like movies that don't necessarily stay with the standard formula.  It kept me watching through their good days and their bad.  Their growing together and apart.      The one thing that I liked about this movie was the message that people come into your life for a reason.  Tom I'm sure thought Summer's reason was because they were destined to be together, because that is what he so badly wanted, but that was not the reason why she came into his life, or why he came into hers.  The last 15 minutes of the film tie everything up beautifully for a satisfying ending, though not one you expected at the beginning of the movie.  Both Zooey Deschanel as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt do a great job in their roles.  The chemistry is definitely there, she is interesting to watch and a bit on the quirky side.      I'll be honest, I loved this one enough to buy it after I watched it.  Is it a girly, relationship movie?  Well, duh....of course, but I like girly relationship movies, especially ones that are cleverly written that are interesting to watch that take me out of the usual \\"romantic comedy\\" formula.     A fun, sassy movie for you and your girlfriendsto watch while the guys have a little \\"garage\\" time.
0780021967|5.0|The Criterion DVD of The 39 Steps is very well done.  The print is excellent and the extras are wonderful.  I especially love the radio versions of the stories they often include on Lux Radio Theater.  These versions which Criterion has included on many of their DVDs could have easily been lost but are a wonder to hear.  The 39 Steps is a terrific movie and probably the greatest of the British period for Hitchcock.  Hitchcock made may terrific films during this period but I love this one the most.  There is a great \\"Battle of the Sexes\\" relationship between the characters played by Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll with a wonderful plot of a man misidentified as a murderer while he tries to uncover a ring of spies. This is a Hitchcock film that is a must to watch.

0312370849|5.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" by Tatiana de Rosnay is an exceptional novel. The lives of two disparate characters are followed in this book. One is American writer Julia living in current day Paris. The other character is a French girl (Sarah) who's story begins in 1942 during World War II.    In order to write an article for her magazine, Julia researches French Jews that were sent to camps during WWII. As she learns about the horrors faced in 1942, she delves deeper into this historical event. She eventually decides to focus on one particular person's history - a young Jewish girl who used to live in the house where Julia herself will soon live.    The other story describes Sarah, who is in fact, the 10 year old girl that lived in the house where Julia plans to move. Sarah and her parents are arrested by French police along with many other Jews on the morning of July 16 1942. Sarah's story is heart wrenching and appalling. While this is a work of fiction, the part of Sarah is based on actual events.    This novel kept me enthralled and I couldn't put it down - read it in a single day. It's a very touching story. Highly recommended.
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown's latest \\"masterpiece\\" started out so well. The first 80% of the book was standard Dan Brown fare: mysteries wrapped in enigmas hidden inside secret panels, and all with esoteric meaning, known not to we the readers, but only to the ancients and to Robert Langdon.<br /><br />I thought the book had a great bad guy, and lots of surprising twists and turns, and one very important twist that blew me away -- that I never saw coming.<br /><br />So, I suggest that IF you buy the book, you stop reading about page 500 in this 530 page book. (The page numbers are total guesses, since I read the Kindle edition which has no page numbers). But somewhere around page 490-510 things start turning positive in the cat and mouse game. I give the book a 4-star rating to this point, and Brown should have taken another 10 pages to put a finish to the action and the book.<br /><br />Sadly, shortly thereafter, everybody who is a hero (or heroine) figure starts preaching new-age, noetic science, the-bible-is-code, drivel to each other and to the reader for 20-40 pages, although it seemed more like 100 pages.<br /><br />However, this section reads very fast, because you can read 3-4 pages of drivel-speak in about 5 seconds as you search for more action scenes. Sadly, there are none.<br /><br />So, this last section rates a one or two stars, overall worth a weak 3-star rating.<br /><br />Don't say I didn't warn you.

B002VKE0XA|5.0|Seeing the copious amount of reviews already posted about this film, I was reluctant to post a review at all.  But I do enjoy the film, and I think it deserves praise.<br /><br />Yep, I give it five stars.  I was lucky to see this film when it fell into demand and was shown \\"selectively\\" at a free screening in Chicago.  My buddy went with me; a horror film aficionado and in the MFA program with me at Columbia.  We sat down, not sure what to expect, except it probably used the same formula as BWP did ten years ago.  (BWP is one of only three films that I saw at least three times in the theatre)  Same formula, so what!  This movie, though predictable most of the time, really kept me on edge and anticipating each night of activity.<br /><br />It has a very simple A to B sort of timeline, each night escalates in activity.  Things get weirder and more \\"clues\\" arise as to the cause/reason/source of the activity, etc.  Though my friend almost never jumps or covers his face during scary movies, he and I were on edge the entire show.  To quote him, \\"I am never that scared.  What you saw is rare, I haven't been scared like that since I saw Blair Witch\\".  And it's true, it does have definite ties to BWP, and in a sense it is the exact same film, con temporized to the current decade.<br /><br />Go into it with an open mind, hoping and expecting to get scared.  It's unnecessary to question and point out the validity, likeliness, and theoretical elements of the story.  Of course its unrealistic and a rather silly premise to begin with.  Ouija boards, demonologists, EVPs and video footage.  All of that!  But what horror films aren't cheesy?  You should go into it expecting to enjoy a good fright.<br /><br />I found that I was often jumping and indeed covering my face in anticipation of what scares might come next.  Get over the \\"hype\\" of the film and don't prepare to be judgmental before you've even seen it.  Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did in the theatre.  Viewing it a second time at home, it still had the same lasting effect on me as it did the first time I saw it.<br /><br />It's safe to say if you enjoyed BWP then this film you will also enjoy.  But hey, it's not for everyone.home, it still had the same lasting effect on me as it did the first time I saw it.      It's safe to say if you enjoyed BWP then this film you will also enjoy.

B000YIGNKE|2.0|Having recently watched the 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version of Persuasion on PBS, I consider myself fortunate not to have invested in its purchase.  Compared to the 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciarán Hinds, Persuasion 2007's script leaves much to be desired.  The actors were another problem; they just seemed to put very little emotion into their characters. While watching the current one, I kept asking myself if I would have understood the depth of Austen's story had I not been familiar with the 1995 version and the answer was no. Do yourself a favor and skip Persuasion 2007 and purchase the wonderfully produced Pursuasion 1995. [[ASIN:B00003JRCQ Persuasion]]

B0032700Q2|3.0|Drastic measures had to be taken because Gentle Giant had reached a plateau and couldn't move beyond it; the band had a big following in the U.S. but they still hadn't cracked the top 20 in album sales. \\"The Missing Piece\\" was the radical surgery the band felt they needed at the time--making a more accessible album that would reach the same audience as Yes.<br /><br />Gentle Giant felt that they had something to prove (hence \\"Betcha Think We Couldn't Do It\\")with \\"The Missing Piece\\".<br /><br />The remaster of \\"The Missing Piece\\" doesn't sound quite as \\"harsh\\" as the previous CD incarnations and because it's drawn from the original master tapes improves on some earlier reissues of teh album. The bonus live performance of \\"For Nobody\\" (which could be from a sound board recording but sounds more like it was pulled from a bootleg) isn't included here. It would be nice to see a live album from this period of the band released and based on some comments from Derek Shulman perhaps it will happen (as an archive type limited release). Keep your fingers crossed because while \\"The Missing Piece\\" isn't \\"In a Glass House\\", \\"Free Hand\\" or \\"Octopus\\", it's still a good album worth exploring.<br /><br />The only way to improve this release would have been to make it a two disc set with a live disc from the same period/some outtakes and/or liner notes on the making of the album. If you have the DRT this reissue is a slight improvement on that that release.<br /><br />\\"The Missing Piece\\" wasn't that album. While it IS a compromise of sorts it also was a bold, new direction whether it was the RIGHT direction is based on how you feel about Gentle Giant. I actually like \\"The Missing Piece\\" and if you combine the best tracks from this album with \\"Giant for a Day\\" (particularly \\"Word for the Wise\\")you'd have a four star album. The change in direction gave guitarist Gary Green more room to solo and, in a sense, moved the Shulman's closer to their original sound (The Howling Wolves, The Road Runners and the early singles of Simon Dupree and the Big Sound) while incorporating elements of Giant's sound.<br /><br />\\"The Missing Piece\\" in retrospect 32 years on is a good album with an exceptional band searching for a new valid direction.f Simon Dupree and the Big Sound) while incorporating elements of Giant's sound.      \\"The Missing Piece\\" in retrospect 32 years on is a good album with an exceptional band searching for a new valid direction.

If you like Clannad or and Enya, you will enjoy certainly this CD.
B001HN69AY|4.0|Terry Gilliam's latest effort \\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\" is a very unique film only the director of \\"The Fisher King\\" and \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" can create. You either love it or you find yourself scratching your head and wondering just what the film is all about. You may call it wildly imaginative and fascinating, or just whimsical and self-indulgent. I am sure that many would agree on this, however - that no one else can create the dream-like world of \\"The Imaginarium.\\"    The fantasy film is set in today's London, which looks more like Victorian. You meet the traveling theater troupe of Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) and its members - Anton (Andrew Garfield), angry dwarf Percy (Verne Troyer), and the doctor's beautiful daughter, 15-year-old Valentina (Lily Cole). And there are some mysteries about the traveling troupe. They have a strange \\"mirror,\\" a portal to another world. The doctor himself has a secret that he should reveal to his beloved daughter, something she will know in three days.    As you know, \\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\" is Heath Ledger's last film. Heath Ledger is brilliant as mysterious Tony who is found hanging under a bridge. Tony joins the troupe and claims he has lost his memories. In the strange world on the other side of the mirror Tony is played by three different actors Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell.     Those who love the silly humor and extraordinary imagination of Terry Gilliam's animations in his Monty Python days will love the film's jokes and visuals such as \\"the dancing policemen\\" sequence. Those who find the director's previous \\"Tideland\\" tedious will not be disappointed with the film's visual imagination of the \\"Imaginarium.\\" Acting is also unanimously great and Lily Cole steals every scene she is in.    The story concocted by Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown (who co-wrote Gilliam's \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\\" and \\"Brazil\\") doesn't make much sense. Is it about Tony or Doctor Parnassus? Iam not sure. The larger-than-life characters don't seem to take themselves very seriously. Even \\"Mr. Nick\\" (very amusing Tom Waits) is not really serious about his bet and he looks as if just enjoying every moment he is in. Perhaps that is exactly what we should do to watch \\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.\\"

073933235X|5.0|Great book to get on audio. Chef Anthony Bourdain does well telling his own story, and through him insight into the cooking world. If you're fan of cooking shows (Bravo, the Food Channel, Fox) or interested in learning about what it takes to be a chef, this book offers one professional's insight into that world. His stories entertain, shock, and illuminate how difficult and complex being a line cook, much less a head chef.<br /><br />Chef Bourdain acknowledges his checkered past, the ups and downs, drug usage, alcohol abuse, 17+ hour days, and the total commitment necessary to be successful. I understand now why shows like Top Chef and Hell's Kitchen are constructed. The career line cooks would cook circles around many of those contestants.<br /><br />More important, Chef Bourdain shares what it takes to become a chef, whether taking a college track or apprenticeships, or a combination. A family member wants to be a chef. Now we have a way to develop a plan for building the foundation. Read this PG13 book, you'll enjoy the roller coaster ride.

0143038583|5.0|I tackled the book with an \\"It's another school assignment\\" mindset. I finished the book satisfied and savvy. After the few chapters I was readying myself for a couple of hours of reading. It may not be a page-turning thriller, but the humorous tone and interesting tidbits kept me reading.        Pollan turns scientific explanations about foods into understandable, plain English explanations about foods. It's easy to comprehend what he's talking about so I don't have to spare an extra brain trying to decode words like dimethylpolysiloxene and glyceride because Pollan follows up with simple, relatable definitions.        Throughout the book he supplies a bountiful amount of quotes from all sorts of people he encountered throughout his journey to trace raw food to our dinner table. He cites many other works and also occasionally pulls a sentence or two from them. He offers a variety of examples and some anecdotes to help support an ethical, healthy, and tasty meal.        A nice thing about his voice is it's not robotic. His writing sounds human, it sounds like a friend even. The casual tone and 2nd person perspective makes the daunting subject of discussing food science seem easier. Yet when information needs to get across he'll say it bluntly. Switching between straightforward, outright explanations and playful, colorful comments keeps the writing interesting.     In the beginning he mostly focuses on the scientific and economic aspects about food. He starts off with the Zea Mays (corn). Instead of boring his audience with a plain description about how corn dominates the supermarket, he uses a variety of interesting wordplay (The Rise of the Zea Mays, Corn Sex, etc) and compares corn to being something like a dictator. This kept me continuing to read on, which I'm glad I did. After he guides the reader through a series of exposition, he enters narrative. He talks about his experience preparing a purely hunter-gather meal (cutting a few corners) and this lets thereader feel. Instead of raw explanation, we now get more emotional and story-like. I thought this was a good move on Pollan's part to help persuade readers to combat the Omnivore's Dilemma and become healthier.        All in all, I enjoy Pollan's style very much. The humor gives good breaks between hefty paragraphs of dry exposition and the entertaining stories he brings helps the reader picture the scenes so that it isn't all dry, groundless science. Never for me has learning about eating healthy been so amusing. Definitely a good read, although slightly chunky and hard to digest at some points.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I haven't loved a Miyazaki movie since Princess Mononoke. Everything about this movie is amazing, especially the visuals. I was compelled from start to finish and I can't say enough great things about this movie. The video quality of the blu-ray is absolutely gorgeous; true reference material.    With that said, I had this blu-ray pre-ordered until reviews came out and reveled that only the English track is given the DTS-HD MA treatment. The original Japanese is given a measly Dolby Digital 5.1 (DVD audio.) I cancelled my pre-order immediately. I buy blu-rays because I want the full HD treatment and clearly Disney doesn't care about purists like myself. In my opinion, dubs are rarely ever good and this movie is no exception. Regardless, the original audio track is clearly how the movie was intended to be presented and the original track should never be treated this poorly.     I may buy this blu-ray down the road because I love the movie itself so much but only a crazy sale price will make this appealing to me.    So if you're a film purist like me, beware of the blu-ray.

I think my favorite was the character of Fermin who was a true friend in the best sense of the word. It's an eternal love story, a mystery, a tale of family. It's the perfect package.

The book doesn't provide any insight into how to develop innovative or creative ideas (nor does it claim to). Instead, the book focuses on how to better communicate the ideas we have so that they are memorable and lasting in the minds of our audience. This is not a trivial point. Even the most charismatic speakers wielding the greatest of ideas may fail in their effort to make these ideas stick. Revolutionary ideas do not speak for themselves. We must still communicating them in such a way that they will have an impact during and after their presentation. Made to Stick provides an excellent road map for doing so. The book is a bit long and repetitive in parts, but overall it is a useful reference for anyone who needs to communicate their ideas to a wider audience.
B0007R4TAS|4.0|I really like the recent BBC version of this story, but this adaption is still one of the better versions too.    George C. Scott really captures the gruffness of Rochester.  And although most like their Rochester handsome, there is really no big indication in the book that he is that way.  Jane Eyre admits point blank that she doesn't find his looks attractive, I don't think she was lying.  Scott exudes outright power and that is more than a little attractive for any woman.    I found the scene in which Scott's Rochester sings to Blanche in front of Jane the most heart rending out of all the versions.    The fact that both leads were a bit older than their characters didn't bother me.    As others have pointed out, the copy of the film is in poor state.  And unfortunately we will never have a properly restored copy.  According to fans on [...], the master print has been lost by the studio.  So the versions we are left with are just copies.
B000GUJZ4G|5.0|You probably wouldn't get that joke unless you had every line of this movie memorized.  Yes, it's a bit cheesy at times, being as it was made around the late eighties, but Point Break is one of those movies with a deep message.  An undercover agent infiltrates a group of bank robbing adrenaline junky surfers.  Initially his motivation was to bust them, obviously.  But after he gets to know them a bit he realizes that there's beauty in their life, and starts living it firsthand as well; they rejected a corrupt society, technology and the 9 to 5 blue money world, in preference of a life of surfing, skydiving, and partying instead.  And who can blame them?  There truly is quite a bit of beauty in that.  But inevitably problems begin occurring, after all some bird's feathers are too colorful to be caged, as the saying goes, and things go south quite quickly.  That's probably all I can say without ruining the movie.  One of my favorites, Point Break is definitely worth seeing.
1932100660|5.0|Wow, what a book!  I will let folks review all the hundreds of glowing reviews for more details on what this book contains.  But let me say that the author's basic message of \\"increase your plant food intake and (greatly) reduce your animal food intake in order to live healthier life\\" is put forth so convincingly that I cannot imagine anyone who has read the book eating a hamburger or drinking a milkshake without thinking twice.  In my own personal case I have reduced my animal food intake by two-thirds *before* reading this book with hopes of having a positive impact on my horrible psoriasis.  Well I lost weight, I feel better and my psoriasis is much improved.  Thanks to \\"The China Study\\" I now understand a bit more as to why.      Bottom line: I cannot recommend this book more highly.  Read it, and keep it on your bookshelf.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is a great film celebrating forever Michael's genius and his beautiful personality. Mr. Ortega sees him as we do, his fans, through the loyal loving eyes of a true friend, and shows Michael in all his magnificent self. I have been a fan for more than 20 years, yet this film revealed so much about Michael that I didn't know. How funny he is - this is captured on this film. How loving to all people around him on a casual regular basis - this is captured. How he sings all the time instead of talking, the metaphors he uses for regular things, how he sings every instrumental part better than any instrument can do - all this will make your jaws drop. How sweetly and funny he messes around with people, who all look at him with adoring eyes. How attentive and friendly to them. All smiles, all love, it's amazing. And his singing - I enjoyed so much hearing him without music, just his pure ethereal voice. I hope for a real soundtrack of this film, I think this is the most beautiful singling of Michael I ever heard. In all, it's a true transporting hypnotizing experience you won't be able to forget, and if you weren't a fan, you'll become one.
B000002LR3|4.0|The most disarming, appealing aspect of Screamadelica is its unrestrained bliss. Funny I should say that, since I like Primal Scream's later album [[ASIN:B00004SZG2 XTRMNTR]] for its unrestrained darkness. But hey, Primal Scream are a band that works best when painting in broad strokes. Either total rapture, or total chaos. Or maybe chaotic rapture. That's kind of like Screamadelica, actually.    Getting into specifics, \\"Movin' On Up\\" is possibly the most joyous rock song that I've ever heard. It is overwhelmingly, explosively happy. Every sound in it is big and uplifting -- the gospel choir, the blues guitar, the acoustic rhythm, Bobby Gillespie's howling proclamations of faith. \\"Slip Inside This House\\" is an anthemic dance song with an inventive rhythm track laced with major-key synth patterns. It's great for summer driving, especially if you're not single at the time. Screamadelica can make you feel young.    Even the sad songs are actually happy. \\"Damaged\\" is an ode to those \\"sweet summer days when I was feelin' so fine / just you and me, girl, was a beautiful time / ah yeah, never felt so happy, my, my, my.\\" Sure, he acknowledges that he'll never feel this way again, but he's having so much fun just recalling those days -- you can feel him savouring the memories -- that it doesn't sound like a lament at all. \\"Shine Like Stars\\" is a beautiful, idyllic love song in which Gillespie waxes sentimental about how, \\"I watch you sleep / you look so peaceful.\\" Possibly the darkest-sounding song on the album, \\"I'm Comin' Down,\\" still sounds calm more than pained. A fairly gentle come-down, really.    Then there's \\"Higher Than The Sun,\\" the product of a brilliant, one-of-a-kind meeting of minds. It's produced by The Orb, the first techno band to have achieved mainstream success, and precisely at the time when they were the talk of the town with their ground-breaking first album [[ASIN:B000005HTX Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld]]. It was a fantastic way for Primal Scream to establish their dance credibility. Nowadays, it may seem cynical for a rock band to grab a hot-shot young producer, but back then, The Orb's sound felt new and revolutionary, and it was an inspired move. Anyway, The Orb turn in the best production of their entire career, with their trademark echoes, weird ambient effects and bass, but also with gorgeous, blissed-out horns. It's such a perfect combination, to go from the chaotic ambient breakdown to the horns. And Gillespie's hazy voice, drawing out the lyrics deliberately slowly, conveys total, unreal happiness.    The last brilliant song here is \\"Loaded.\\" It's not produced by The Orb, but it sounds inspired by them. Basically it's a long sound collage with anthemic horns, sampled dialogue from a Peter Fonda [[ASIN:B0000542CP movie]], and jamming drums. Again, a stately, summery song, a perfect soundtrack for the glory days of one's youth.    These songs are all amazing, timeless material, but unfortunately, the rest of the album is a bit plodding in comparison. The dub version of \\"Higher Than The Sun\\" is very much an acquired taste, focusing mostly on freaky sound effects and the over-rated bass playing of [[ASIN:B000005HTY Jah Wobble]]. It is a bit much for seven and a half minutes. \\"Inner Flight\\" is a pretty, but very simplistic instrumental. The melodies in \\"Loaded\\" are also simple, but at least \\"Loaded\\" has many more different layers, whereas \\"Inner Flight\\" sounds very slight. \\"Don't Fight It, Feel It\\" has a generic-sounding dance diva on vocals, and the chirpy synth lead starts sounding very repetitive after a short while. And lastly, \\"Come Together\\" has more great vocals from Gillespie, but most of the song's numbing eight-minute duration actually consists of a gospel choir repeating \\"come together, oh, come together.\\" This also gets old fast.    Because of the filler, Screamadelica may be a bit difficult to listen to from beginning to end. It is quite long, lasting over an hour, and reaches its absolute peak early with \\"Higher Than The Sun.\\" However, for expressions of happiness, there is nothing like it. The best songs have a much more subtle production than they might seem to at first, so they have an ability to grow on the listener.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This book never failed to entertain me. With its fast paced plot and compelling mysteries, I was never once bored. However, I see how this book could be confusing and wierd to younger and less experienced readers. Reading this on the Kindle really helped me understand more what was going on because I had quick and easy acess to a dictionary.<br /><br />Overall, it was oneof my favorites, but could be a challenging read.
B00006I53S|4.0|I purchased this lens from Digital Pavilion Electronics (fulfilled by Amazon.com) and the unit I received was in a white box and not the retail box. There was a sticker on the box that said *New* and the lens looked fine, but white box versions generally sell for 10-20% less than this price and there is no mention in the description that I was buying a white box.<br /><br />Okay, I know- who cares about the box, it just gets tossed in a closet or thrown away, however the retail box is well constructed with form-fitting protective packing foam. The white box is flimsy and the lens was only protected by a thin bubble wrap sleeve. The shipping box had inadequate packing as well, as the lens was rolling around inside the shipping box. I was a bit concerned about the lens (after all, these are delicate, precision devices), but close inspection and testing revealed no apparent damage. Still, very unacceptable.<br /><br />The white box and packing did not influence my 4 star rating, since I do not think it is fair to ding products for seller-related issues. This is a very good lens and almost reaches the performance of the 24-105 f/4 L (no flames please- Google \\"ken rockwell 28-135 IS\\" for a qualified opinion). This lens has some nice high-end features such as the ultrasonic focusing motor, image stabilization, manual focus override, and non-rotating front glass. It loses a star since Canon has made no effort to address the lens creep issue, which is the #1 complaint about this otherwise outstanding lens.

0810982862|2.0|Really I could write a lot to explain why I felt this book was disappointing and try to give you examples from the inside to illustrate my point. I'm just going to post some things I felt after going through this book:  - \\"They are DEFINITELY releasing another Art of Avatar book and this one is just a quickie for the eager ones who couldn't wait for an avatar-related release\\".  - Is it april 1st?  - watching this movie in 3d was WAAAAAAY cheap for the movie ticket price and now they're charging me for the rest of it.  - Was it initially called \\"The Information about how Avatar was produced for the people who have no clue\\" and then renamed it to \\"The Art of Avatar\\"?     If you're an artist looking for inspiration DON'T spent THIRTY dollars + taxes on this book, WAIT for the blue-ray and pause it on your favorite scenes and just stop and appreciate that. You'll save money and be more satisfied.
0385528752|2.0|This book is largely unhelpful to those who wish to \\"change\\" because it presents a framework that is too vague to be useful.  In Switch, authors Chip and Dan Heath appear to have researched loads of success stories (in the individual, corporate, and government realms), and then attempted to create a framework for \\"change\\" based upon the similarities in those stories.  But very few stories follow the framework closely, and the framework is too ambiguous to be useful.  Motivate the elephant (i.e., our emotional side)?  Shape the path?      What this book is really about is inspirational leaders and how they have accomplished change in nuanced situations that would rarely (if ever) apply to the most of the rest of us.  For example, one (of many) stories discusses a South American railroad exec who turned his business around by focusing on short-term cash flow and reusing old rails.  Inspirational?  Yes.  Useful?  Probably not.      That's not to say that the book doesn't offer tidbits of information about what we generally know about change (for example, look to success stories, establish specific, well defined goals, set lofty, but not too lofty goals, etc.).  But that's really nothing new, is it?  Reading this book felt like watching an infomercial, except that no product was being sold.  I really wanted to make some changes, but other than keeping in mind generally accepted principles of change, and some inspiration (derived form the numerous success stories in the book), I really wasn't in a better place than when I started.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I was just looking for something to watch one Saturday afternoon.  Temple Grandin came on and I was enthralled.  The movie did a great job of having you care about the character, and still tell a story in a cogent fashion, with a time-line that moved along and made sense.  I was moved to tears several times.  We all have our own frustrations and triumphs, and I think most people will enjoy sharing Temple Grandins'.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|2012 is not about the storyline. 2012 is just about having a good time! Look back at all of the disaster movies...they are all about the jaw dropping special effect(Exception would be Titanic) I know the movie will not be as good on my home television as it was on the big screen, but I am still going to buy it. There is a decent story line but some parts of it are unbelieveable. Best advice for anyone sit back, shut up, and prepared to be wowed!
B0032SMR1W|2.0|I can count on one hand the times I have fallen asleep while watching a movie. This movie is one of them. The first 15 minutes are intriguing, but then the plot goes down hill very fast until it ultimately falls off a cliff and I fall asleep. I finally did manage to watch the movie in its entirety, it didn't get any better.<br /><br />I can't say the acting is bad, because it's not, it's the plot and the premise of the movie. The writer obviously scraped some solid ideas from many other movies and attempted to glue and rubber-band it into his own grand creation, sorry fella, it didn't work. Don't waste your time or money on this flick, the more ambitious it wants to be, the worse it gets.

It's the type of book I want to write a thank you note for because it is a remarkable gift to the reader by one amazing writer.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|This documentary has evaded the law of identity. What Michael Moore is criticising is corruption, not capitalism. There are negatives and disadvantages to all economic systems, but Moore does not focus upon the bad aspects of capitalism, but instead the unethical practices which people have exploited others, within the current American economic system. Most economist would agree that America is not currently a pure capitalist economic system, it is a mixxed economy. Moore is part of an agenda which is encouraging the shift towards, higher taxes, bigger government, less free market practices. This is to the determent of all Americans. I would urge anyone to gain a comphrensive understanding of laissez faire capitalism from an unbiased point of view, rather than be manipulated by Moore's dramatised depiction of victims who were manipulated by predators to believe that the housing bubble would not crash. Moore's portrayal of 'the bankers' as capitalist has personally made me lose respect for him. Those people are not capitalist, they are common criminals who have violated the princicple of capitalism and the free market, a representation of political corruption, cronyism and outright robbery, all civilizations have had the misfortune of having such parasites, whether capitalist, communist or feudal. Moore knows this, I hope his audience do too.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Before I start, I should mention that I have original LP box set called The Beatles Collection imported from the UK augmented by the German Magical Mystery Tour and the two-LP Past Masters set.  I only got the original Beatles CD box set because it was on sale for less than I paid for The Beatles Collection.  Yes, I was disappointed with the 1987/88 CDs, especially because A Hard Day's Night and Beatles For Sale were in mono even though they were recorded on four-track tape allowing for good stereo mixes. That's why I burned a CD with the tracks from those two LPs.  So I was excited to find out about the remastered Beatle CDs including the new box sets, of which I got this one as I was used to the old Parlophone stereo LPs.  This time, EMI did it right down to the packaging.  Yes, I am disappointed with the cardboard CD sleeves as they are rather flimsy.  But thanks to the sturdy box, the sleeves are protected.  Now for the music, all the tracks released on vinyl in true stereo are in true stereo here including a pair of early songs \\"From Me To You\\" and \\"Thank You Girl\\" from Past Masters issued on CD in stereo for the first time, as were the first four Beatle albums (finally!).  Note that on the stereo version of \\"Please Please Me\\" towards the end, John flubs a line causing him to sing 'come on' with a slight chuckle.  So while I own the complete Beatles collection three times over, I will listen to this set more often now. The songs sound better than I ever heard them.  It was like I was listening to the playback from the Abbey Road studio 2 control room fresh after the tracks were recorded.

0061922315|4.0|'The Secret Daughter' by Shilpi Somaya Gowda is an engaging and captivating novel about adoption, family, and the search for self. Set against the backdrop of India, we share the life of Asha, along with her adoptive and biological parents, from the day of Asha's birth to her development into a young woman.<br /><br />Asha is Kavita's second daughter. Due to the dire poverty and circumstances of her life along with the cultural belief in India that boys are much more important than girls, Kavita's first daughter was taken from her at birth and killed. There is no money for raising more than one child and that child must be a male one. Kavita gives birth secretly to her second child in case it is a girl.  When she finds out that it is indeed a girl, she conceals the infant child from her husband who killed her first daughter. She is determined that this daughter will live. Along with her sister, Kavita walks miles to Mumbai. There, she leaves her daughter, who she's named 'Usha', at an orphanage.  Her next pregnancy is fraught with anxiety for fear this child might also be a girl. Luckily, the child is male and is much loved. A day does not go by that Kavita  does not think about the heartrending losses of Usha and her dead daughter.<br /><br />Somer is a physician in the United States who is unable to bear children of her own. She is married to Krishna, an Indian man from Mumbai, also a physician. They decide to go to India to adopt a child. The child they choose is Usha whose name they change to 'Asha'. Asha is 10 months old when she is adopted. She is raised in a loving home and given every advantage and entitlement that an upper middle class American child can have. Somer is reluctant to engage in any conversations with Asha about her past or her heritage. She denies that part of her family that is Indian, creating distance and discord between herself, her husand and her daughter. By the time that Asha is twenty years old, she has not been to Mumbai since the time she was in the orphanage.<br /><br />The novel does a wonderful job of showing the cultural discrepancies of Indian life, its diametrically polar aspects. Indians live either in dire poverty or with great wealth. The slums are described in vivid detail, such that you can almost smell, touch and taste the florid poverty. There is a much larger population of adult men than women in India and the fact that female children are killed at birth or aborted is shown as a routine event in the lives of the poor. Though India is the seat of great advancements in technology, many people live without electricity or basic utilities. Education is valued highly but the poor have little access to it. Children from poor families either work at home in caretaking roles or are on the streets begging. It is rare that a poor Indian child gets to go to school.<br /><br />Asha is drawn to her Indian heritage but knows little about it. As a child, she resents her parents for not sharing more of her past with her. She writes letters to her birth mother that she keeps in a treasured box. Any family that has dealt with adoption will appreciate the way this book deals with the subject. As Asha searches for her true self, she learns the meaning of real family and inclusion. She struggles to find herself as she is often the only child in her class with very thick black hair, beautiful slanted golden eyes, dark skin, hair on her arms, and big eyebrows. She asks herself where this all comes from, how do others deal with it, why is she different. Somer is blond and blue-eyed, the prototypical Californian. Krishna is a busy neurosurgeon and is not one to sit down with Asha to discuss these poignant concerns.<br /><br />The book reads quickly and maintained my interest throughout. The only problem I had with it is that some of the characterizations were not treated with the depth they deserve. While I got a fairly clear picture of Asha, Kavita, Somer, and Krishna, it is not until the end of the bookthat some of these people and Asha's extended family really became fleshed out for me. Others remained shallow throughout.<br /><br />It would not surprise me at all if this book becomes a best seller. It has all the elements that attract readers, especially women. It is a pleasurable read and the characters are mostly likable and easy to identify with. That, combined with the themes of adoption and the Indian culture make it a novel of interest to many.'s extended family really became fleshed out for me. Others remained shallow throughout.

B00000DCHI|2.0|During my childhood years when I was seldom far from commercial radio, Billy Joel was probably the most popular recording artist in Australia full stop. Every one of his albums from 1977's [[ASIN:B00000DCHC The Stranger]] to 1986's [[ASIN:B0012GMWES The Bridge]] was among the top 100 albums of the period between my birth and reaching adulthood, and as a result I heard him (and the other two \\"Billy\\"s, Idol and [[ASIN:B0000004VW Ocean]]) consistently on the radio.<br /><br />Even as a child when I had developed no ability to think critically about music and did not know in the cloistered confines of suburban Australia how to gain access to music different from what was played on the radio, I was generally suspicious of a lot of what Billy Joel produced - seeing it as motionless and lacking in energy. However, his more upbeat songs I easily tuned into and never lacked anything for enjoyment of his simple pop tunes like \\"You're Only Human\\", \\"Big Shot\\", \\"The Stranger\\", \\"My Life\\" and \\"Moving Out\\". Even today, it is fair to say that these are the only tracks on \\"Greatest Hits: Vol. 1-2\\" that sound anything other than syrupy and dated. Indeed, today the production on most of these songs is at the very least sufficient to prevent them from sounding like the most terribly pompous material on so many albums from the period.<br /><br />On the other hand, I must say that much of Joel's best-selling album (the ninth top album of the 1980s) [[ASIN:B00000DCHG An Innocent Man]] was one I disliked even before I had listened to anything that was not on the chart at the moment I listened to it, and today it sounds even worse. The title tune is awfully flyweight and syrupy, whilst \\"The Longest Time\\" is one song I would always place high on a list of the worst songs of all time, and I have been turned off trying to remember it for the last two decades. Many of his earlier ballads, like \\"Piano Man\\" and \\"Say Goobye to Hollywood\\" (described as \\"fast rock'n'roll\\" in one place) and even \\"Just the Way You Are\\" have the same problem.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that a few moments remain far from bad, Billy Joel is proof of the many problems found in mainstream 1980s music.\\" have the same problem.

B000NVIXFK|3.0|It's not their best work, but not their worst either.  It's better than Feedback, Vapor Trails and 1/2 of Test For Echo.  This album does restore my faith in Rush, and for the first time in 15 years I am actually looking forward to their next album.  However, I am mystified by all the 5 star reviews-this is a 3 star effort at best.  If you want a 5 star Rush album then listen to Moving Pictures. This album is good...not great, and yes, I do own every Rush studio album and do consider myself a fan.  Rush fan before? Then yes, by all means pick up this album.  If you're new to the band(chances are you're not even reading this review) then pick up any of their pre-Test For Echo material before this and if you like it, then maybe give this album a try.
B000002UWE|2.0|Talk Talk are a contrasting band whose albums moved in a very unusual (perhaps unparalleled) manner from generic 1980s dance-pop (with a voice totally unsuited to that style) to intense, slow, orchestral, experimental music that later was, along with [[ASIN:B0000019KE Slint]] and [[ASIN:B0000019HU Spiderland]], to prelude the 1980s post-rock sound.<br /><br />The last three albums they made, especially 1991's amazingly powerful and gut-wrenchingly emotional [[ASIN:B000001FZK Laughing Stock]], stand as the story of a band that evolved in a way no other group had ever done before: from a pop band to the most challenging experimental group that it took me seven years to properly appreciate. The amazing power of \\"Desire\\", the last song on \\"Natural History: The Very Best of Talk Talk\\" was something I completely missed when I first heard the album trying to find their 1982 Australian hit \\"Talk Talk\\" at a time when I was trying to collect every hit from the eighties I could find. The slower \\"I Believe in You\\" was edited for single release and that may have been (part) of the reason why I missed it in the 1990s.<br /><br />Even in the 1990s, I could find very little of note in Talk Talk's early hits like \\"Today\\" (which is terribly slushy) and such dated synthesiser pieces as \\"Dum Dum Girl\\", \\"My Foolish Friend\\" and \\"Such A Shame\\", which lack even the most basic of hooks that one would expect pop songs to have. \\"Talk Talk\\" does not have the problem of lacking hooks - indeed it is somewhat catchy - but still there is nothing to really distinguish it form the vast number of 1980s pop songs I heard in my childhood.<br /><br />When one does get to the things that made Talk Talk a noteworthy band on 1986's [[ASIN:B0000074BS The Colour of Spring]] and 1988's [[ASIN:B000005RS5 Spirit of Eden]], there is still a lot missing, including a taste of what were in fact detours in the process of moving away from a rigidly commercial sound such as \\"April 5th\\" that showed for Hollis, Friese-Greene and Lee Harris how to achieve a sound that did not replicate anything at all and would no doubt be more satisfying in the long term to them. If one listens carefully to these two albums, what one sees is a very clear progression that is often overlooked by critics, especially concerning \\"Spirit of Eden\\", and as \\"Natural History: The Very Best of Talk Talk\\" is compiled, one overlooks a great deal.<br /><br />All in all, this is not the way to know a critical band that helped to invent one of the most important genres in the modern music world.to achieve a sound that did not replicate anything at all and would no doubt be more satisfying in the long term to them.

1608201236|5.0|Have you ever read a book when you get so attached to the characters, that your chest aches - constricted with emotion because of what the characters are going through... that is what happens with me with this book.     This is the final book, and while I enjoy reading the mystery, is is the relationship between Adrien and Jake is what sitting on front seat. This one fills with sentiments from the two of them. How they are dealing with what has happened. I'm close to tears in some scenes, while on the others, I either feel that squeeze around my heart, or sigh in relief.     This book is such a perfect closure. Such a PERFECT ending. It is a wonderful way to say goodbye (excuse me while I sob). One thing for sure, I never regret the day I decided to go with my hunch and bought the first two books of this series last year.
0060853972|5.0|The apocalyptic found its way into Christianity early, which makes sense considering the persecutions of early Christians, and foremost among the texts of Christian apocalyptic thinking is the book of Revelations. But it's also true that this book has long been something of an embarrassment for a lot of Christians, since it portrays God and Christ in most unfavorable terms, as bringers of war and death for really no reason, a sharp departure from the loving God of the gospels that makes Christianity appealing.    So it makes sense that the story found in Revelations would be parodied, since parody is often the best way to make sense of the senseless. Niel Gaiman and Terry Pratchett have done just that in Good Omens, which takes the not at all unreasonable position that something as complex as the apocalypse foretold in the book of Revelations is likely to get all mucked up by simple human mistakes. To this Gaiman and Pratchett have added the reasonable argument that those who are supposed to make the apocalypse happen might just, for good reason, question the point of the whole thing.    The result is a delightful read, and unlike the pretentious and predictable [[ASIN:0842342524 Left Behind]] novels, we really don't know how the end times are going to turn out in Good Omens. We do know, early on, that it's going to be both funny and thoughtful, and from any parody, that's about the best you can ask for.
0786868724|2.0|While I have enjoyed several of Albom's other books, especially the Five People You Meet in Heaven, this one was a great disappointment. The storyline is nice, but there is nothing particularly inspiring about it. Albom spends some time getting to know his Rabbi as a person, so that he will be able to write his eulogy. Interspersed with the Rabbi's story is the one about Henry--former criminal and drug addict who becomes a pastor. Both stories are interesting, but there is nothing unique about either of them, and nothing that we haven't heard or read before. There is no climax, no \\"wow\\" factor, nothing. The two men are unique, as we all are, but really, the stories as they stand are not book material. I would say that this could have been a magazine article, or even 2 magazine articles--one about the Rabbi and one about Henry. That's how skimpy the material was. Great for a short piece, but there wasn't enough here for a book. If Mitch Albom wasn't already famous, I highly doubt this would have been published.    Towards the middle of the book, it really became somewhat repetitious and I started skipping paragraphs. Then pages, because it just droned on, saying the same things over and over again. Nothing happened with the Rabbi except that he just grew older over the course of about 7 years, and then died. His wisdom is given to us early on, and then just repeats. And that wisdom is also nothing special, just the usual stuff that you see everywhere else. The characters of the Rabbi, Henry, and everyone else are very flat and poorly developed, and the other characters that appear are drawn like stereotypes.     I'm sure that if he wanted to do, Albom might have been able to paint a full and rich portrait of the Rabbi, instead of making him into an almost silly caricature. The \\"singing\\" dialogue got old really fast, and most of the dialogue was stilted and forced.    But I'm glad that Albom was able to bring attention to Henry's ministry for the homeless, and I hopethe book helps him further.     But standing on its own, this is a terrific disappointment, and it seems that Albom wrote it up just to get another bestseller on the list. I would guess it took no more than a few weeks to write it, and it shows. I hope that Albom returns to fiction, or if he does more non-fiction, then at least picks a solid story that will carry a book.

B0011UF79C|4.0|Well, this movie was an experience!  Just a short commentary.  Gattaca punches home a curious \\"What If.\\"  What if science got to a point where genetic engineering was perfected to where a parent could choose any trait, either sex, and practically guarantee a near-perfect human being with excellent odds at success?<br /><br />And even with the genetic make-up totally in his/her favor, could said person achieve his goals?  Can you genetically engineer a spirit, a will and an intention to succeed?<br /><br />Vincent's parents decided to have him as a \\"natural\\" birth, i.e. without genetic prompting.  The hospital took a blood sample from his heel at the tender age of 10 minutes old (practically!) and got a sterile computer read-out of the chances of heart failure, life expectancy and so on.<br /><br />The parents tried again, this time conceiving Anton, who was a product of genetics but the parents decided they wanted to keep a few things \\"natural.\\"  Fascinating.<br /><br />The movie is a story about conflict between one's genetic code and one's desires to overcome the obstacles that an immorally bankrupt society can throw in our paths.<br /><br />The proof that this is true is when Anton, the genetically superior brother, yet loses swimming matches with his brother.  His brother has the will and the drive.<br /><br />Through a \\"handler\\", Vincent takes the genetic material of \\"Jerome\\" and in fact becomes Jerome.  He sneaks in blood samples, straps urine bags to his leg and wears contacts as Jerome would.  Jerome is genetically superior yet has no real drive or real dreams and though the genetic clock is in his favor, \\"always made second place.\\"  Jerome is locked in a wheelchair as the result of an attempted suicide and his only lot in life is to supply Vincent with enough blood and urine samples to maintain the pretense of Vincent being Jerome.  Gattaca does daily genetic testing, so the deception must be perfect.<br /><br />Uma Thurman plays a woman who works at Gattaca, a facility that flies a dozen or so flights into space.  Jerome (aka Vincent) fools her for some time but when she discovers his secret, she can relate and protects him.  The whole thing here is quite tender but the acting is somewhat forced.<br /><br />In the middle of all this, Jerome (Vincent) is nearly found out several times during a police investigation of a murder that occurs at Gattaca.  Will he be found out?  Is his will so strong and his goal so pure (getting to Titan, a Saturnian moon), that he can even overcome the watchful detectives and even his brother Anton (who makes a surprise appearance)?<br /><br />The film may take another couple of watchings since its commentary on the human condition and where society is going is quite fascinating and important to understand.<br /><br />Oh, cool Ernest Borgnine appearance as the head janitor and former boss of Vincent.  Priceless acting from a Hollywood veteran actor!<br /><br />Word play:  Jerome = Genome?  Eugene = Eugenics?  Curious.<br /><br />The movie is a bit uneven at times, but overall has quite the \\"1984\\" message to tell in such an original fashion.<br /><br />Recommended!s into space.

0385340575|4.0|Gone Tomorrow is another in the series featuring ex-MP, Jack Reacher, and his brand of vigilante justice.    The story begins with Reacher on a New York City subway car when he notices a woman who has all the indicators of being a suicide bomber, except she is in a low-value target area;  an underground vehicle with only five other people in it.  The story starts with a bang and gets even crazier from there as Reacher criss-crosses Manhattan sorting the good guys from the bad guys.    Gone Tomorrow is much better than the previous Reacher novel, \\"Nothing to Lose.\\"  Reacher still makes some amazing intuitive leaps and there are a few things that defy logic, but Gone Tomorrow is a fun ride for Reacher fans.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I love this mobile!!! I wish they made more like this. The best features are when they get older you can take the top part off and still leave the music part attached to the crib and when they are old enough they can hit the buttons themselves to start the music.  I had planned to save this mobile for my 2nd baby but my son is now almost 3 and still uses this every night!  If he wakes up in the night he can easily reach up and touch one of the buttons.  It even has a little night light in it.  I think I've only changed the batteries twice.  Now that I am getting ready to have another baby (even though my decor is not this rain forest theme) I am seriously considering getting another one of these!! It's well worth the money.

B00275EGWY|5.0|This is a classic example of how good movies should be made, & it's heartening to see that this superb example of film making, has been directed by a woman. But is is good enough to garner the Oscars for Best Film & Director. Absolutely! However, since the Academy has never awarded the Best Director statuette to a woman in the past, the odds are truly against Kathryn Bigelow. However, if it's to happen, then this is the film to bring it off. It's an exceptional piece of film making in every aspect. Great story, great cinematography, great acting, & exceptional directing. Bigelow brings it all together beautifully. It's simply the best war film I've seen since Full Metal Jacket. There's none of the patriotic graveside scenes that spoilt Saving Private Ryan, & none of the extreme blood & gore scenes so prevalent in most of the recently made war films. Amazingly, they have managed to produce a brilliant war film, that presents the horror & dangers of war, without the endless blood-letting. A great cinematic experience that no fan of this genre should miss.
B002WCLG3Y|1.0|If Halo and Pokemon had a baby, that baby would be named Halo Legends. This is not a good thing, as it would be a very ugly, very stupid, cliche-ridden and nonsensical baby. I'm guessing that Microsoft and Bungie would be the greedy grandparents.    This is a situation where just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should.  And I'm perplexed as to why this was made the way it was anyway.  Japanese don't like/use X-box or Halo, Americans, aside from a niche fan base, don't embrace anime, so they put the two together and I guess come up with what you would expect.      Specifically, what makes Halo Legends so bad is that it was done so lazily.  Most of the animation is so very poor, people that actually play Halo can make better scenes from the theater in the game than what you can see in Halo Legends.  Also, the stories are filled with cliches, the dialog often doesn't even close to making sense, and there are numerous ripoffs of other films and games (Star Wars, Metroid, heck, even Jurassic Park).      You may find about 5 to 10 minutes of worthwhile material on this disc.  I am amazed that some people actually give this a four or a five in their reviews, because for the most part, this disc is unwatchable.  I would call into question the veracity of these reviews, but then again, Twilight is successful.    Oh, if only Peter Jackson didn't waste his time with the Lovely Bones and decided to make the Halo movie.
B001FB5634|5.0|I was astounded at the raw and gritty portrayal of humanity driven to desperation in \\"The Road.\\" Cormac McCarthy's novel was beautifully written, and this movie adaptation does it justice (in my opinion). The strength of the movie lies in the visceral performance by Viggo Mortensen, the depiction of the loving relationship between a father and his son, and the realistic sets and compelling visuals of the barren landscape - a world where there are no visible animals, where trees have long since shed their leaves, where the ocean itself has long since ceased to be blue, and where humanity is hardly evidenced. There are not many humans in this movie - the main characters, a man and his young son (played by Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee) are on a journey, more of a quest really, to reach the coast, where they hope there will be some hope for survival. The wife and mother (Charlize Theron) is seen via flashbacks,and the viewer gradually learns her fate. Almost all of the other 'humans' in this movie, are barely people anymore, just rampaging creatures driven by a need to satiate their hunger...creatures who devour their own kind. Yes, there are many graphic visuals of cannibalism here...as Viggo Mortensen's character says at the beginning of the movie, \\"Cannibalism is the great fear.\\"<br /><br />Will humanity really be driven to this when the end comes? What semblance of one's self will remain? Neither the book nor the movie tell us what caused this devastation on Earth, yet that is besides the point. The story addresses the basic motivations that drive people - when there is nothing left, what does one do - maintain decency, hope, and love, or prey upon others? The father's eternal love for his son, and the son's instinctual desire for mercy and compassion are compellingly portrayed. It is this that kept me hopeful as the credits rolled.
B000JQTWPO|5.0|For a fun read, well written and clean, you can't miss with this one.  The characters are unique, the plot is well-paced.  It won't keep you up at night with suspense but the wit and twists will keep you entertained and engaged.
B001CT877Q|4.0|This version of Eraser is Region 1 and is uncut as opposed to the Region 2 dvd and vhs copies which are cut by a couple of minutes(certainly the copies i own).I saw this film in the cinema back in '96 i think.   The picture quality i think is quite good.The special effects hold up well,especially the guns, even Arnold's airplane exit looks good,the crocodiles look well too,except when Arnold shoots one in the head,but still a lot better than some effects today.There are probably a few places where there is some fuzz but not that you'd notice unless you went out of your way.    The sound is good,great bass and even dialogue.No extra's just like my dvd copy!  The film itself is good,a couple of parts between Arnold and James Caan were a bit over done,dialogue wise.The actings fine,the late Robert Pastorelli is quite good in his role(he was great in Murphy Brown).     Arnold is solid(no pun)in his role as is Caan.   Oh yeah this is a region 1 blu-ray,you can't buy it over here,it's region free though. Overall worth the cash,which wasn't much anyway.
B000P0J0G0|4.0|We are now through the first 3 seasons and partway into the 4th season.  There is some pure gold in this set - the entire family is enjoying it.  On the other hand, there are a fair amount of clinkers too - the shows are hit or miss.  If you are sensitive to off-color language this set is ABSOLUTELY NOT for you.  Many of the best skits are available on YouTube, though the video quality is certainly substandard by comparison.  All-in-all, this was a good addition to our home library, though if I had to choose between this collection and the Complete Jeeves & Wooster - Jeeves would win hands down!
0385504225|5.0|I don't like reading other people's reviews on such subjective topics as books or movies but the negative reviews I have seen about The Lost Symbol are about as redundant as their claims about Brown's plots.  We all know Brown's formula and method of operation and we either love it or hate it.  I wish the people who hate it would stop reading his books expecting some miraculous change and read authors that they know and love.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is exciting and entertaining and was hard for me to put down.  I didn't spend my reading time psychoanalyzing characters or plot holes, I just took it for what I believe it is meant to be:  ENTERTAINMENT.  I watch movies and read books to escape reality and that's what The Lost Symbol did for me.  If you want to be entertained and slightly educated, read the book and ignore the naysayers.
1439170045|5.0|Story Overview<br /><br />Alice Howland is 50-years-old and has achieved great personal and professional success. She is a tenured professor at Harvard in the field of cognitive psychology and a world-renowned expert in linguistics. Her husband John is also a respected Harvard professor and researcher in biology. She has three grown children, Lydia, Anna and Tom. Although she's had some tragedy in her life (her alcoholic father killed her mother and sister in a drunken car crash that only he survived), Alice has a satisfying and full life. Although her marriage has operated on cruise control for several years as she and John have pursued their separate careers and she and her daughter Lydia disagree about Lydia's decision to pursue an acting career instead of college, Alice has a satisfying life--filled with travel, teaching and family events.<br /><br />But lately, Alice seems to be forgetting things more often--losing her train of thought in the middle of a lecture she's given hundreds of times, leaving her BlackBerry in a restaurant, mixing up times for appointments. But one day while out running, Alice finds herself completely disoriented and lost--in the town where she's lived for more than 25 years and on a route she's run countless times. Flushed and panicked, Alice wanders around her home town until her world suddenly rights itself and she knows where she is. But the experience shakes her to the core, and more lapses cause her to visit her long-time family doctor. Is it menopause? Stress? Depression?<br /><br />After several tests, her physician sends her to a neurologist, who conducts more extensive tests and gives Alice shocking news: she has early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Initially reluctant to share the diagnosis with her husband, Alice finally shares her secret with him. Like Alice, he is unwilling to believe it and pushes for more tests. But the worst proves to be true, and they face a future that seems bleak and hopeless--a future where Alice will slowly disappear until the faces of those she loves are the faces of strangers and her ability to communicate (the linchpin of her professional life) disappears as her brain is ravaged by the disease.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />This book is heart-breaking. I struggled to read the last 65 pages or so because I was crying so hard I could barely see the words. I've always known Alzheimer's is a cruel disease, but reading Alice's story--and \\"experiencing\\" Alzheimer's from the patient's point of view--brings to life the horror and the tragedy of the disease in a way that makes it all too real. Lisa Genova has done something special with this book; she has given a voice to people who are slowly and irrevocably losing their voice. She's managed to bring her readers inside the mind of an Alzheimer's patient and take them on the journey from momentary lapses in memory to a world where the man you've been married to for years becomes \\"the man who owns the house\\" and your daughters become \\"the mother\\" and \\"the actress.\\"<br /><br />In many ways, the book reminded me of Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes. In that book, a young man named Charlie with an IQ of 68 undergoes a special experimental procedure to increase intelligence, which seems to have worked successfully on a mouse named Algernon. The experiment works, and Charlie's IQ increases dramatically. However, the improvement is only temporary and he reverts back to his initial mental capacity. In the story, which is written as letters and notes in Charlie's journal, you can track Charlie's progress by the way he writes. Initially his writing is very simple and full of spelling errors. Then as his intelligence increases, the writing gets more sophisticated and the spelling errors disappear. Then, as he declines, the writing reverts back to how it was in the beginning. That book also made me cry; you mourn the loss of Charlie as you see him beginning to crumble mentally after achieving a \\"normal\\" life.<br /><br />InStill Alice, you experience the progression of Alzheimer's as Alice does--repetitive conversations, leaving a room after talking to a long-time acquaintance and coming back moments later and introducing yourself to them as if you've never met before, losing vocabulary. As Alice deteriorates, you experience her losses and gaps in memory as if it is happening to you, and this makes for heart-breaking reading. At the end of the book, when she wonders why she can't go to her home and wonders why she is with the \\"man who owns the house,\\" my heart was full of sadness. One device Lisa Genova uses to chart the disease's progression is a series of questions that Alice devises to \\"test\\" herself before her dementia gets too bad. The idea is that if she can no longer answer the questions, she should open a specific file on her computer and follow the directions there for committing suicide. As the book progresses, the answers get shorter and more inaccurate--charting her deterioration. It was a brilliant device, and I was sobbing when Alice finds her letter to herself and struggles to carry out its instructions.<br /><br />As tragic as this story is and as horrible as the disease is, Genova is also able to present some beautiful moments as well. As the disease progresses, Alice lets go of many of the things that kept her separated from her family--healing her relationship with her estranged daughter and allowing her to realize what is truly important to her. Although I wouldn't wish Alzheimer's disease on anyone, I thought Genova offered some slight reassurances that the disease itself may possibly protect the people suffering from it at the end--giving them a simplified and almost childlike existence. The ending scene between Alice and Lydia offered a kind of bittersweet ending--reminding the reader that love can still be alive despite the ravages of the disease.<br /><br />My version of the book included an interview with Lisa Genova about her research and motivations for the book. The book itself was given the \\"stamp of approval\\" by the National Alzheimer's Association, and Ms. Genova writes for the organization in a professional capacity. In addition, she holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Harvard University. I think this is worth mentioning because this isn't a writer who imagines what Alzheimer's might be like. She studied and researched it and worked hard to accurately capture the diagnosis process, symptoms, treatment options and progression accurately. I, for one, applaud her hard work and decision to write this book.<br /><br />My Recommendation<br /><br />I think this book is a must read for anyone affected by Alzheimer's disease. I pray that this disease never touches me or anyone I know. I cannot imagine anyone being unaffected by this book. It will rip your heart out, and I suggest you do not read it without having many tissues nearby. I haven't been this emotionally affected by a book in a long time, and, for this reason, I must give it 5 stars.'s as Alice does--repetitive conversations, leaving a room after talking to a long-time acquaintance and coming back moments later and introducing yourself to them as if you've never met before, losing vocabulary.

B002DKGWSE|4.0|**Warning - Spoilers Below**<br /><br />The last House on the Left was recommended by a friend of mine stating it's a good horror film. Once I read the portrayal of the movie I thought it sounded interesting (you can't go wrong with psychopathic killers) and rented it through my local blockbuster.<br /><br />First of all, it is a horror film but not something that I have encountered before. Where the film portrays occurrences that unfortunately do exist in this world there are scenes that are just too much to bear or witness. The psychopathic murderers look as normal as any human being -they are not represented by the usual psychos looks like in other movies- yet inside they are full of evil and wickedness.  What made this movie shocking and disturbing was the two specific scenes that I'm sure would have made the whole world talk about if it had done well in the box office; the rape and the stabbing sight.<br /><br />The rape panorama was indeed very gruesome and grotesque especially when it's to a very young girl by an adult male (one of the psychos). It didn't cut filming in order to give you the idea of what was going on; the movie actually films the whole thing without interruption. You can't get any more realistic then that.  Very intense and disturbing!  The other scene where the other young girl gets stabbed looked as well very sensible. I'm sure you'll clutch on to something when you're watching it.  The acting in the movie and the excellent interpretation of all characters added the touch to make it look even more realistic.  Not for the faint of heart and I'm sure this will make many people stop viewing the film after such incidents.<br /><br />Horror? Yes! Thriller? Even more! After the events mentioned above the movie will kick in taking you for a ride of vengeance and reprisal by one of the girl's parents. It is a great thriller mixed with horrific scenes but if you're strong enough you'll be able to surpass it.
0446698342|4.0|THE LUCKY ONE is another great read from master storyteller Nicholas Sparks. Here we are given a story with a slightly darker edge and far more suspense then his usual soppy romance and dog lovers or fans of THE GUARDIAN in particular will appreciate this engaging romantic suspense.<br /><br />Each chapter here has been written from a different characters POV incorporating Elizabeth; a divorced mother with a young son who along with her no-nonsense Nana run a dog kennel in their small North Carolina town, Clayton her ex-husband and the town sheriff (bully) comes from a influential family yet harbours some nasty little secrets and Thibault as our hero. An Iraq war veteran, Logan Thibault alongside his dog Zeus has walked (yes walked) from Colorado in an obsessive search for the unknown woman in a photograph he found during his three harrowing tours of duty in Iraq. He believes the picture to be his good luck charm and directly responsible for keeping him alive. In the end all the characters merge for a predictable yet ultimately nail-biting ending.<br /><br />One of the great (or not so great) things about Nicholas Sparks is that he doesn't always give you a happy ending and it was with this in mind that about half way through (just as the flood waters started to rise, secrets began boiling to the surface and I was completely invested in the characters and their budding love story) I began to get nervous for the ending. I mean you just knew something bad was going to happen, the clues were all there but the real question that kept me turning pages at a frantic pace was... to who?<br /><br />The last chapter is very, very sneaky with Sparks keeping you on pins for pages before finally giving up the ending of which I had no clue. I fell in love with all of these well fleshed out characters, each coming with rich personalities and history including several flashbacks. The love story is well done and as I said before not too soppy. Thibault is a quiet, tortured hero and just so damn lovely with Beth perfect as his caring yet tough partner. The antagonist is creepy and also well written yet because of who he is you can't really wish him dead. Sheesh, I even fell for the boy and the dog. So yeah, I highly recommend another Nicholas Sparks novel.h Beth perfect as his caring yet tough partner.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't usually review shows. I find it to be a waste of my time. In fact, this is my first review for anything on amazon. I've watched many shows out today, lost, 24, house, but nothing compares to firefly. I only started watching firefly a few weeks ago because of how highly regarded this show is, and I must say, after watching the first few episodes, I was in love with the show. I've watched the aforementioned shows for several years now, but after a few episodes, I can say firefly is my favorite show of all time. I finished watching the last episode of firefly and the movie serenity a couple of hours ago and I am saddened to see that its over. I love the movie, but I must say, I wish it was never made because the existence of this movie hurts the possibility of the return of firefly, at least with all the crew on board. Anyways, I can't think of any show that can combine the elements of story, dialog, character development and originality as well as firefly. Dollhouse was another great show by Joss Whedon but it still can't hold a candle to firefly. If you've never watched firefly before, I envy you because you will get to experience an amazing show like this. I've already finished watching this show, and sadly, I'm not very optimistic that another show as amazing firefly will come about again in my life time. I'll miss this gorram show. I suggest everyone buy the DVD/Blu ray, give it to your friends if you have it, spread the word. Heck, even watching it on hulu for free will support the show through ads. In short, bring back firefly and kiss my pigu fox!

She likes unfolding the pages and reads it to her baby brother. It is a cute introduction to the phases of the moon.  She likes especially to have her daddy read it to her.
0439023483|4.0|This is the first book in a young adult series (and I think it shows!) about a dystopic world where the United States is now known as Panem. Divided into twelve distinct districts that each have their own industrial focus, Panem is ruled from the Capitol with an iron fist. To help keep the people in line--which is very necessary considering everyone is kept on the brink of starvation--the Capitol requires each district to send two tributes (a boy and girl) to The Hunger Games each year. A country-wide televised event, The Hunger Games changes each year, with a special arena being constructed for each game. What doesn't change is the basic rule: all tributes must either kill or be killed, and only one tribute can be left standing at the end.<br /><br />The concept of having young people being thrown together in an arena and being forced to fight to the death sounds horrible--and it is, but it also makes for exciting reading. The story is told from the point-of-view of Katniss--a 16-year-old girl from District 12 (the coal mining district in what used to be Appalachia). Katniss is not your average girl by today's standards. She's a rule-breaker (leaving the fenced district to hunt for food in the woods) and a skilled hunter, especially with bows and arrows. When her beloved younger sister Prim is selected as a tribute for the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to go in her place. As she enters the flamboyant, anything goes world of the Capitol, we learn more about the Games and her fellow tribute--Peeta, a good-looking son of a baker who showed kindness to Katniss years ago. When they are thrust into the arena, all bets are off as Katniss struggles to survive and be the last tribute standing. But Peeta throws a wrench into the mix and changes Katniss's game plan, leading to an ending that is sure to cause problems for everyone involved.<br /><br />In the second book, Catching Fire, (and I doubt if you read the first book you won't continue on with the series), we get to find out what happens after the Hunger Games described in the first book. Once again, Collins sets up a cliffhanger ending that will probably ensure that the third installment will shoot straight to the top of the best-seller lists.<br /><br />I'm not going to talk too much about these books as they've probably been discussed to death already. My guess is if the concept of the books appeals to you, you're going to read this series and will be pretty satisfied with them. I didn't think the writing was stellar and I had some issues with Katniss being unaware of what is going on around her (especially in the second book), but these books are meant to be fast exciting reads and they don't disappoint. Frankly, I felt Collins could have dropped the whole \\"love triangle\\" subplot and had a better book, but perhaps that is just me.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: 4 stars for concept and 3.5 stars for execution. Perfect for young adults and anyone seeking a fast-moving dystopian tale that doesn't make you think too much. I read both books in a day. These books are the equivalent of eating a candy bar--a candy bar with spikes in it--but a candy bar nonetheless.appens after the Hunger Games described in the first book.

B002VECMAE|5.0|If you ever wondered what the Republicans are doing with your money in Iraq, here's one answer. I wouldn't call it a comedy as much as a tragedy of sorts. We always knew the Feds were exploiting all that was good in us. Now, we have proof. Don't expect to laugh as much as have your eyes opened--in a big way. This is a prime example of how to use all our god-given gifts for evil AKA war. It's an important movie for you to watch, if only to understand why the Iraqis will have actual reason to kill us in the future. God help us all...    If you want to know more about what your gifts are, this movie will illuminate parts of that. However, this is not the movie to show you HOW to use your gifts.
B00319ECHE|5.0|I BUILT IT TO BREAK IT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!  I BUILT IT TO BREAK IT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!  I BUILT IT TO BREAK IT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!...I'VE BECOME MECHANIZED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      Just like those lines from the title song, I'VE BECOME MECHANIZED! I'm at a lost for words that I don't know what else to say. This is the best album of the decade. I would like to say best album of the last 20 years, but Demanufacture and the Pantera albums rear their head. Definitely, best comeback album of the last 20 years, for sure. Just the precise technicality and focused aggression. This is the sickest and most \\"off the chain\\" album I've heard in a long time. The guitar from Dino and the drums from Hoglan are freaking insane. I was expecting something good after all these years of waiting but not this sickening. When I heard the start of the title song, I was expectant of what was to come and when the aggression started, I wanted to puke and soil my pants. When Mr. Bell started screaming \\"MECHANIZED!!!\\", I just fell to the floor in amazement. You can tell that he really means his anger when he sings the title. This is how modern metal should be done, so all you nu-metal posers take note. That's you Slipknot, Green Day, Nickelback, Korn, etc. If you're tired of all the posers and nu-metal crap polluting the airwaves, do yourself a favor and get this cd. This is for all those of you looking for a \\"real\\" metal cd and band with the modern 21st century touch and feel done very well. The whole album is out of this world. 5 stars are not enough as a rating, heck not even 100 stars, heck not even infinite stars!!!      THANKS A LOT Dino, Hoglan, Mr. Bell and the whole Fear Factory clan. It was a long wait but well worth it
B001992NUQ|5.0|I haven't watched Fight Club since shortly after it originally came out and let me say this was amazing. The Blu-ray edition is well worth it with crisp picture quality and wonderful sound. The menu is always good for a laugh too for people who haven't seen it before. ;)
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I bought it as a gift- for friends and myself!  I definitely consider the movie as a collectible because of glorified violence and flawless acting. The german/french actors add a lot of subtle details - even during silent conversations - and some of those give you goosebumps.  Signature Tarentino movie but differs from Kill Bill (in case you like to use Kill Bill as a popular reference for Tarentino's direction).

Eric's guitar playing is just as good as was over 40 (Forty) years ago! Now all we need is a duet album with him and Buddy Guy!...Now wouldn't that be something???

B000UJCALI|5.0|You've probably seen this movie before. Either that or you've at least heard of it somewhere. Yes, Stanley Kubrick's loose adaptation of Stephen King's \\"The Shining\\" has become one of the most famous horror films of all time. It's been praised by critics including Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin, and has been parodied in music videos and TV shows such as The Simpsons. It may not be loved by Stephen King himself, but I, including millions of others, love it. It's not your typical Hollywood-style horror film, and it doesn't want to be like one. It doesn't have any loud \\"jump\\" music or annoying teenagers or underdeveloped villains. This is a very unique film that stands on its own. It's not the blood and gore that make this film very special, but the eerie atmosphere that is present throughout the film. It also delivers some haunting images and iconic performances. Now I do like a few recent horror films such as Saw, Event Horizon, and House of 1,000 Corpses, but The Shining remains as my #1 favorite in this specific genre.<br /><br />Like many other Kubrick films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Full Metal Jacket, critics and audiences have analyzed the entire movie. There have been film critics and college professors who always discuss everything from the opening aerial shot to the photograph right before the end credits. I don't think that's really necessary, because The Shining isn't supposed to be fully analyzed. It's up to us to decide for ourselves what the story is all about. For some, it could be the effects of isolation and how it transforms into insanity. For others, it could be how the spirits that dwell in the Overlook Hotel are messing with these people's minds. For me, I would go for the latter. True, a few scenes seem like they come out of nowhere, and have no relevance to the plot (the man in the bear costume, for example). But the images themselves are so grotesque and so undeniably scary, that you can't help but be amazed by them.<br /><br />But aside from the ambiguous story and some terrifying images, I think the strongest elements in the film are not only the eerie atmosphere, but also Jack Nicholson's performance. Nicholson is without a doubt a fascinating actor; he knows how to play crazy. Here, you can see some fine examples. Nicholson was rightfully cast as the lead character; he knows how to be frightening and intimidating when he slowly becomes psychotic. It's a very effective performance, and one of his greatest in his entire career. The other performers do extraordinarily well themselves. Scatman Crothers is believable as the chef Dick Hallorann, while Danny Lloyd is surprisingly good as Danny. Shelley Duvall, despite all the complications during filming, really pulled it off with her character Wendy. Her fear and desperation look genuine. I don't think anyone else would have done a better job than her.<br /><br />At least 95 percent of the reviewers here have nothing but praise for this movie, and I am part of the majority. I won't say much about The Shining, since it'll probably make this review look like a short story, but I will say that it's one of my favorite films, and my top favorite horror film of all time. Kudos to Kubrick, Nicholson, Duvall, Crothers, etc.<br /><br />Grade: Aous story and some terrifying images, I think the strongest elements in the film are not only the eerie atmosphere, but also Jack Nicholson's performance.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Just by chance one evening I happened to hear a couple of songs from this album on tv and then the program was over.  I wondered where I could buy it and on that same evening checked Amazon and there it was.  I ordered it, received it very quickly and love every song on the 2 disks.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Based on the Jane Austen novel, \\"Emma\\" tells the story of a young woman in England who plays her town's matchmaker. When attempting to match up her friend with the Reverend Elton, Emma starts to run into complications, which multiply amongst themselves with cases of mistaken intentions of love, a cast of supporting characters who each love someone else, but Emma doesn't know who loves who, and Emma finally realizing the one person she truly loves. I found this movie almost totally delightful. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays 'Miss Bates' are all absolutely terrific. The story is often amusing, endearing, and at times, quite touching. A fantastic adaptation of a beloved book. Highly recommended.

One can feel the connection between the author and young Chris.  I bought this book after seeing the movie and realizing there was much to the story that connected with my own life.    I have place this beautiful and thoughtful book, the sum of a young man's life, on the bookshelf of honor, beside Ed Abbey's Desert Solitare and John Grave's book Goodbye to a River.  There is no higher honor I can bestow.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I would categorize it as a suspense-drama based on actual events. The plot development was excellent and the acting was very good. The setting and props for the late 1920's and '30s were well done. The story itself was really intriguing, while offering some thought-provoking historical insight into the victimization of women of an earlier generation by the corrupt and powerful. This movie is emotionally gripping, and at times disturbing.

0571240151|5.0|This book is INCREDIBLE. The storytelling is breath taking! Although the book deals with a tough subject, and does deal with animals in pain, and somewhat abusive situations, it does so in a way that doesn't make you want to stop reading the story mid-way through.     I read this book in one sitting, and have never fallen so completely in love with a novel as quickly as I did with this one! This is a book that should be read by every child and I am sure will one day be a classic. I rate it right next to Black Beauty.....in fact it may even be BETTER- and trust me that's saying A LOT!    This book will definitely have a permanent spot on my bookshelf!

B002ONC9NC|5.0|When I first viewed this film in a theater, I was expecting another \\"dirty old man seduces a younger woman\\" tale and a dry British one at that!!  How wrong I was!! This is a brilliant dry comedy based on a memoir by Lynn Barbour about her coming of age due to a romance with an older man. Also it has a breakout performance by Carey Mulligan (she was 22 at the time) as a precocious 16 yr old teen who falls in a love with an older man (Peter Saarsguard, a Yank who nails his role as a Brit).  Alfred Molina is also excellent as her befuddled father who is also charmed by David (Saarsguard).  I've read in various interviews that Saarsguard approached his role as a man who is charmed by Jenny--and he avoids becoming creepy by this approach. But this is Mulligan's movie and who knows she may upset everybody and win the Oscar for this role since she's already won the British Academy Award.

I watch shows like True Blood, Prison Break, The Wire, The Shield, and Sons of Anarchy so you get an idea of what shows peak my interests. Spartacus is totally entertaining with action that makes you jump out your seat! The story started off slow but I'm on my 5th episode and I am addicted. The actors and actress play their roles to a T, and the visuals are amazingly gory (good thing). I gladly add this series to my wish list. I only wish it aired on HBO because I am not subscribing to Starz. Thank god for the internet.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Excellent movie, the actresses and actors brought this one to life. There is quite a bit of nudity, but it does serve a purpose to the story. Truly makes you think about the dilemma Michael Berg, the main character has to deal with. It is a movie that has you wonder what would you do if you were in his shoes. Kate Winslet gives a excellent performance. It's a haunting and heart-breaking, and should not be missed.

159448385X|5.0|I weeped at the end of this book. Simply weeped.<br /><br />Before I get into its praises, let's get a few shortcomings out of the way. There are a few aspects to Hosseini's writing style that I'm not fond of, and the same minor complaints I had in The Kite Runner also apply here, except to a lesser degree. He still did some explicit foreshadowing, but only a couple times, and in at least one case, I do think it added a bit of suspense rather than detracted from the current narrative. Later on, when foreshadowed events occured, characters undoubtedly conjured up old memories that reminded the reader that said event was foreshadowed - as if Hosseini didn't trust the reader to be smart enough to remember on his own. But, in most cases, it seemed natural that if these events were really occurring, the characters would remember these old conversations with fondness, regret, or poignancy, so it wasn't really out of line to write about such memories. Overall, I think Hosseini's writing is more developed in this book, and ultimately, my rating of a book depends a great deal on how much of an impression it left on me, which is why I gave this book 5 stars despite these minor annoyances.<br /><br />If The Kite Runner was, in part, a gentle and lovely portrayal of a peaceful, bygone time in Afghanistan history, then A Thousand Splendid Suns is its natural successor, telling intimate stories of women who endured the recent decades of multiple wars that tore the country apart and made it unrecognizable to its own citizens. On one level, this book serves a purpose by informing readers of Afghanistan's political turmoil and the nightmare of living in a war zone. But, it is also a book about motherhood, self-sacrifice, endurance, grace, and unadulterated love for one's homeland.<br /><br />The book is filled with interesting characters. A woman who, to a stranger, may look like the embodiment of weakness and servility, but proves to be a fountain of admirable grace, wisdom, and strength not in spite of, but because of her sufferings. A man who mistreated women with shocking cruelty out of a misguided sense of tradition and conservatism, but also not unintelligent and still capable of affection and tenderness. Another woman who has enormous potential as a child, who is raised to value education above all else, but who must succumb to the draconian laws of the Taliban.<br /><br />I was so invested in the characters that two-thirds of the way through the book, I started to fear that an undesirable conclusion would ruin the book for me. Without giving anything away, I'll say that I loved the ending.but because of her sufferings.

B001UV4XWY|2.0|This would have been better had it remained in the realm of planet Earth and conspiring humans instead of having to do with Mars or physics or Donnie Darko flashbacks on the part of the director.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|An unknown and lethal virus has wiped out five billion people in 1996. Only 1% of the population has survived by the year 2035, and is forced to live underground. A convict (James Cole) reluctantly volunteers to be sent back in time to 1996 to gather information about the origin of the epidemic who he's told was spread by a mysterious \\"Army of the Twelve Monkeys\\" and locate the virus before it mutates so that scientists can study it. Unfortunately Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990, six years earlier than expected, and is arrested and locked up in a mental institution, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert. \\"Twelve monkeys\\" is also where you see Bruce Willis stand back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies, instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman. Brad Pitt steals most scenes with a great performance.  \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" is Gilliam's masterpiece of madness. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

B001PR0YGC|4.0|This was a good based-on-a-true-story kind of film, with good performances from Damon, Bakula, Lynskey, Brown, and company.  Soderbergh did another fine job of directing it, with a tight screenplay by Scott Burns.  I won't spoil it by telling you what's really going on with the main character; you need to sit and watch it so you can get full satisfaction in that regard.    I just can't fathom why there are no extras on this DVD, as there are on so many others--unless they're really horrible.  And this one certainly isn't horrible.  It's puzzling.
B001DWNUCO|2.0|You know what the problem is? That after watching HBO's Rome series nothing comes even close. I thought Id go for this when the price was right at about $11.99. BTW thats about the top price for it imho. True its a 2 disc version and Region free (am in Australia). At least I managed to sit through it all, was amazed how graphic the sex scenes were considering when it was made. Quite pornographic which I find well at least theyre telling it like it was, plenty debauchary. McDowell was over the top. Im not to familiar with the true history of Caligula, but this cant be a close rendition. Alot of poetic license in use. Not much in sets used could almost have been a stage production. Either way the blu ray transfer was bearable, Id say 80's DVD quality perhaps. I didnt bother checking out disc 2 yet. But this isnt a keeper once watched so will be offloading it in the not to distant future.<br /><br />Hope this may help you in your decision, if so please vote on it.

B002K0WBXW|4.0|\\"The Proposal\\" is a hilarious romantic comedy because of the fantastic casting.  Betty White steals more than one scene with her hilarious antics and one-liners and Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job of playing the uptight, control-freak boss who's housing a lifetime of pain and vulnerability under her intimidating persona.  It is Ryan Reynolds who gives this familiar we-weren't-supposed-to-fall-in-love-but-we-did plot its refreshing twist.  He is two-thirds leading man with his gorgeous looks and suave demeanor.  But he's one-third comic genius and Mr. Reynolds deftly shows us both sides throughout the whole movie - alternately wooing the female audience with his Cary Grant looks and charm, and then unexpectedly showing the looney comical expressions and antics that his fans have come to love about him.<br /><br />The reason \\"The Proposal\\" works so well is because we can relate to the common man-vs.-woman struggle that defines most romantic relationships.  Ms. Bullock's character is one we can identify with - she's strong, capable and desires to be in control, while simultaneously vulnerable and secretly hoping there's a man out there who will really love her enough to put up with her \\"stuff\\" and not abandon her when he sees her many flaws she desperately tries to hide.<br /><br />The script is witty, there's wonderful character development as we start to see why each character behaves the way they do - all in all, I thought it was a fresh, witty and totally enjoyable movie - I've seen it 5 times.

B001FB4W0M|3.0|The reason for the 3 star rating isn't for the show itself.  I love every season of Supernatural and this one was no exception.  It had me hooked from the moment Dean's hand burst out of the earth in Lazarus Rising to Sam's urgent whisper of \\"He's coming\\" in Lucifer Rising and every cat scream and Chuck the Prophet in between.  It's the format itself.  While I appreciate the fact that I can see \\"Dean's\\" freckles on occasion and the crispness of the images is outstanding, that means I can also count the pores of any actor on screen for more than a 12 seconds.  Which is nice...I guess. =/  Maybe it's my Blu-Ray player, but I keep having problems with the Supernatural Blu-ray discs.  Sometimes I'll put one into the player and it'll jump right into the middle of the 3rd or 4th episode of that disc.  It won't give me the option to go back to the beginning of the episode or the disc.  I have to take it out and wait a bit before I try running it again.  It's really weird and a pain to deal with.  This doesn't happen with any other Blu ray disc I use in the player.  Just the Supernatural Blu-Ray discs.  Aside from that, the other features aren't really anything special.  I was expecting something fantastic to be waiting in the extras.  There is nothing there that couldn't be found on the dvd. And to be quite honest, The whole experience has turned me off to Blu-Rays.  If I had to buy this all over again, I would have just bought the DVD. In fact, I might just be tempted enough to buy it after I return this.
B0030E9V7Q|5.0|I missed When You Reach Me when it was first published and discovered it when it received the prestigious Newbery Award in 2010. When You Reach Me is the perfect example of a cross over novel.  It doesn't fit any specific genre. Set in the late 70s it can be defined as an historical fiction novel but since the story  brushes against the time traveling concept it also qualifies for science fiction. The main character is a girl yet boys will  identify to the smart, sensitive and funny Miranda. Besides when the story starts her best friend is a boy. She's is twelve years old so typically the story would be better suited for readers younger than twelve. Yet Miranda is independant: she lives in New York City,  has the key of her apartment, walks to and from school, has lunch outside of schoool and even got a small job. Readers  will forget that she and her friends are still in middle school. Miranda's relationship with her mother who is single but has a German boyfriend is filled with humor, tenderness and loyalty.   References to A Wrinkle in Time from Madeleine L'Engle, another Newbery Award recipient, seem to be sprinkled through the story but they are like a thread to follow.  When You Reach Me is a petit chef d'oeuvre like we say in France, my native country and it would not be fair to the book to be more specific. Revealing too much would spoil the discovery of a unique story that challenges readers of all ages.  Even adults like me.
B00275EGWY|3.0|\\"The battle rush is a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug.\\" This sums up the conundrum of the Hurt Locker, a film displaying the 'days in the life of' a bomb-defusion team of soldiers in Iraq whose job it is to analyse and resolve bomb scenarios - on a daily basis - in the dusty and tense neighbourhoods of Baghdad.    The movie, compellingly shot with almost a 'reality-show' feel, is (as almost every reviewer commented) one of the more authentic war movies appearing for some time. No sensationally cool explosions and barely a soundtrack, no bullets thrashing everything but the good guys, no just-in-time rescues or escapes (e.g. Tears of the Sun), no distracting side-mission (e.g. Three Kings), no unreal defeat of an army by one man (e.g. Rambo) and so on.    What's  even more interesting, though, are the hidden (or not so hidden) dimensions of meaning within (or hovering on the margins of) the movie.    On one hand, it's a tale of courage and sacrifice for a war-torn community at war with itself. Sgt. Will James and his team count down their days in Baghdad going from street to building to bomb-site either trying to stop bombs from exploding or exploding bombs before they hurt people. In some scenes, the team struggles with the tension of keeping safe as opposed to (usually Sgt. James himsef) going the extra mile to resolve the situation or catch the bad guys. Will may personify, on this view, the American martyr-in-motion risking death from fiery shrapnel so a battle-ravaged people can have fewer bombs on their streets. It's the American soldier as model of Good-against-Evil humanity to balance off America the War-Crazy Nation. The  movie in this sense operates as a poster for the Global Patriot with a conscience.    On another hand, The Hurt Locker could be 'standard' Hollywood-fare displaying the mundane horror, hatred, victims and meaninglessness of war so the average media-drenched consumer at home 'connects' better with the war veteran, wounded anddead. The movie's thus a vehicle for social integration, war 'awareness', giving human faces to the War on Terror. The many jagged scenes of civilian confusion, the 'normality' of those planning the bombings, the internal resignation and hopeless faced by the soldiers themselves all make the movie seem like an updated desert-context version of Platoon.    Then again, maybe this story ISN'T about war at all. Maybe it's not about how to 'make it' through weeks of almost certain death. Maybe instead the Hurt Locker is about 'surviving' the depression and superficiality of everyday 'peaceful' existence i.e. of Life as we know it.     There must be a reason why the central character, Sgt. William James, is named after a philosopher cum psychologist who wrote about pragmatism and how we need to CREATE reality as the part-and-parcel endeavor of understanding it. Truth-value makes sense only the context of use-value i.e. if it doesn't help or doesn't work, it's pointless to discuss it (let alone enshrine it into some philosophical canon).    Sgt. James, therefore, could be the embodiment of the drive to 'fix it', to go near problems no one dares to. Will's will to spending his life defusing bombs is a decision which releases him from the need to ponder life's absurdities - like a divorced ex-wife who still stays at home, like the myraid of cereal choices the supermarket offers, like the death of children, like war, like the very need to ponder at all.    What would cause a man, after going home and seeing his family (and even playing with his baby son) to choose to RETURN to a whole year defusing devices which could level entire streets and leave hundreds dead? What is so addictive about being face to face with death each and every day?     Could it be that bomb defusion becomes the substitute for defusing life? Selecting the right coloured wire to cut may be the ultimate pragmatic act because life becomes (very practically!) focused onto one - and only one - activity which, if done incorrectly, brings everything to a smoky end.     The Hurt Locker, perhaps, doesn't represent the space into which men and women are trapped by the pain of war. The *locker* could, instead, mirror the *numbing unbearable hurt of the void of everyday living* from which - other than, say, being incinerated in the heat of detonated C4 - there is no escape.    Yes, maybe that's it. The Locker is Life itself.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|What can you say that hasn't been said before about The World At War??<br />The A&E 11 disc set is a bargain, somewhat, and the visual remastering compared to the<br />original is a marked improvement. But I find it very irritating listening to the<br />remastered, 'processed' audio track. I've played these dvd's on numerous<br />systems and their all the same. The audio is not clear, it's muffled and the<br />volume has to be turned up way past normal, like they 'no noised' it to the<br />point where natural sibilance is totally gone. The original set was not like<br />this. Yes, it had 'hiss' and other noise but it was much easier to listen to than<br />this newly remastered set. The chances of that being fixed are nil to none. But I would<br />pay $500 for a properly remastered set from the Criterion people (are you listening?).<br />This incredible set deserves no less than that kind of treatment and A&E just looked<br />at it as a mass market product, criminal in my opinion!<br />But nonetheless I thought I'd chime in because to me this is a major distraction<br />taking away from an otherwise well done remastering job. In No Way is this a<br />critique on the actual documentary, just the dvd remastering job A&E did on the<br />audio track. Otherwise and indispensable Series that needs to be taught in every<br />school on Earth!!
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|Having read the other reviewers comments, I admit that I am no K.D. Lang expert. In fact I had never owned one of her tapes nor had an interest in owning one until I saw her perform at the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Winter Olympics (on television of course). To me her singing of \\"Hallelujah\\" was THE highlight of the ceremony. It was SUPERB!  I couldn't wait to access Amazon.com and order a CD of hers with \\"Hallelujah\\" as one of the songs. To my most pleasant surprise, this two-tape set far exceeded my expectations. Granted I am one of those over 50's who may liken Lang to singers like Linda Rondstadt--only a sexier and sultrier version but I simply LOVE her!  I am SO GLAD I bought this two tape set which is a collection of outstanding songs I will be enjoying for a long time to come. I may not be as knowledgeable of Lang and her music as the other reviewers but I know what I like and THIS is it!  Good job K.D.!

B0025KVLV0|5.0|Let it Be is usually placed behind Sgt Pepper, Abbey Road, White Album, Revolver, and maybe one or two other Beatle albums. The fact that this album is considered no better than the Beatles' fifth best work, and yet includes classics (or at least semi-classics) such as Across the Universe, Two of Us, Let it Be, Long and Winding Road, and Get Back, says ALOT about the band. I started listening to it again for the first time in 30 years and became smitten with it again.
1582701709|5.0|This is an amazing work.  I also have the CD soundtrack.  As a regular woman, and as a professional life coach, I firmly believe and use the Law of Attraction, which is the basis of \\"The Secret\\".  After I read the book in 2007, I began using it for the little things as an experiment. I tried it for parking spaces and it worked.  I have great parking spaces.  Traffic flows better for me.  And even if I leave late I get to my destination early or on time with ease. People are nicer.  But the biggest thing is that I am now Multiple Sclerosis-Free.  My body is healthy and works.  My eyesight returned to normal, the numbness went away.  And I can walk distances without an aid now.  My neurologist is mystified.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Secret\\"!  If you don't like to read, get the CD set instead.  But either way, if you are open and have a positive heart, you will find it enlightening.

B000WOT406|5.0|This was the second album I purchased from the band, the Mars Volta.  Man am I blown away.  The opener Son Et Lumiere and Inertiatic ESP guarantee that this album is gold.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video to get out of my tae-bo rut, which I have been doing for a few months. I thought I was in decent shape until I met Jillian. I was panting with level one and I have seen results in less than a week. I had to buy new shoes to deal with all the high-impact but it is so worth it. My goals were to get fit and toned with losing some weight as a bonus. I am so pleased with this that I am taking it on my seven day tropical vacation (no kidding-my husband volunteered to carry my weights in his bag)! I am working out between levels one and two (two is tough). I was too busy dying to notice the bad music and I wish that you could fast-forward through her intro but not a big deal. If you want to see results in only twenty minutes, get this video. It is worth the small price tag.
B002CNZSB4|3.0|This is the perfect introduction to this band because it is nowhere near as good as their other albums, most of which are PHENOMENAL.    Since We've Been Wrong-  Side note; if you download this album, you will get nine tracks, if you buy it on cd, you will get eight.  the reason is that the first track is essentially a one note synth song lasting about a minute and a half, and on the cd, it is consolidated with this song.  Aside from that, wait about a minute and a half and the real song begins.    The lyrics are extremely well written, and convey the message that cedric intends.  Musically, it makes for a good opener, however i find that the drums when they come in seem out of place or time.    Teflon- If you ask me, the lyrics here are worth looking at, but this song is essentially filler compared to the rest of the album, I find it musically uninteresting.    Halo of Nembutals- not bad, better than teflon at least, but once again, little more than filler to me.    With Twilight as my Guide-  If this is the \\"acoustic album\\" this song is why.  It is only simple arpeggiated chords, however THIS is where Cedric Bixler-Zavala shines the brightest.  a.  Because it demonstrates his amazing vocal range,  b.  the harmonies here are beautifully performed,   c.  the lyrics are full of imagery, and are extremely intricate  First song i really noticed on the album.  and this is where all the good songs begin    Cotopaxi-  To me, Teflon sounded like a knock off of this.   Just an awesome rocker, with good lyrics to boot.    Desparate Graves-  it was this song, and since we've been wrong, that I liked from the samples.  Another hard rocker, with a darker feel.  One of my favorites on the album    Copernicus-  the quietest song on the album.  Only listen to this when you are alone and everything is quiet.  It has harmonies reminiscent of with twilight as my guide, and lyrics that could be about a kidnapping.  very well done.    Luciforms- I don't listen to this much, but it is anice ending, and good lyrics.    overall, I would not call this the acoustic album, but the \\"Harmony Album.\\"  Also, a little advisory, I would buy these albums in stores if you are a CD nut, because they are way overpriced here.
B001TM1X0O|5.0|This book is a fun read but even more it is a book of simple realization for any woman. The authors portray things very simply and I don't think the scenarios that they review leave anything question as to whether or not \\"He's Just Not That Into You.\\" I have let friends borrow this book but always make sure I get it back. When dating, it's a good companion to have to help you not lose your head on the wrong guy ;)
B002VLNB1Q|3.0|I think Room For Squares is ok.  I have not heard Heavier things.  I LOVE Continuum.  I am disappointed by Battle Studies.  I think it is lyrically proficient, however it is somewhat lacking musically.  I am not a huge fan of Taylor Swift, however I don't see the point to consiging her to harmonies.  Heartbreak Warfare is good, as are Who Says, Assassin, and Friends Lovers or Nothing.  I am appalled and left in a state of wonder at his cover of Crossroads.  A bluesman like John Mayer playing one of the great blues staples, and he decides to use some weird synth pedal and NO AMAZING GUITAR SOLO??? I have heard John Mayer's guitar solos; they are great when they are done right; here they are done so very wrong.  Also, I feel like he ripped off the same riff from Stop This Train and used it again for Who Says.  Overall, get it at a discount price if you can find one.
B001UV4XWY|4.0|THE BOX is an eerily effective tale and offers a provocative offer--would you take a million dollars even if you knew someone you didn't know would die as a result?<br />Director Richard Kelly fashions this premise into an allegorical/sci-fi vision of what happens to a couple faced with this offer.<br />Cameron Diaz and James Marsden are okay as the couple but aren't overly impressive, but Frank Langella is quite effective as the mysterious benefactor.  The plot is sometimes esoteric and confusing but it held my interest.  Overall, THE BOX delivers.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|... considering what happened to my review of the film Avatar! A hundred thirty comments, and still coming! But I truly wonder why NOBODY has remarked on the similarity of the two films, Avatar and District 9. Not quite the same script, but mighty close: an alien species is unable to defend itself, for the time being, from Blackwater-style mercenary gunners until one Homo sapiens comes to their aid. In both films, the rescuer is a cross-breed, in Avatar by intent, in District 9 by accident. Both films end up with the half-human and the aliens blasting the baddies (us) to kingdom come. And both films have a profoundly subversive anti-capitalist message. And both films depict humans as unredeemably bloodthirsty racists. Avatar has the edge in pretty scenery and 3-D, but District 9 includes ACTING! A scruffy-looking unknown, Sharlto Copley, plays the role of the DNA-infected 'traitor' to human national and corporate greed; if Copley doesn't win some kind of Oscar for this performance, there's no justice on Earth.<br /><br />By this time, I think it's safe to presume that everybody has seen both films, so I won't offer a synopsis, nor a teaser nor a spoiler. Instead, I want to outrage the usual outragees by speculating on the current mood of apocalyptic fantasy among us H-saps. There are several channels, obviously, one of extraterrestrial encounter, one of global catastrophe (that total snoozer about instant climate change comes to mind), and the third about a Day of Judgement scenario. 2012? I haven't seen it, but it must fit one of these categories. The \\"Left Behind\\" novels. What's up, humanity? Are we so desperately fearful of our finite and fleeting existence that we need to bolster our self-image with fantasies of Armageddon? Relax, you silly primates! If there's anyone -- or Anyone -- out there, He, She or They are not preoccupied with us.<br /><br />Is this really a five-star film? Beyond the acting of Copley and the special effects, no way! It's 'kinda dopey' as we say in Minnesota. There are more logical inconsistencies in the script than in a speech by Sarah Palin. And there is a grievous problem with the depiction of the Nigerians in the film; they are stereotyped in the most racist, neo-colonial manner. Somebody ought to be ashamed.<br /><br />But you have to see it, believe me, before the sequel comes out, when the aliens come back. Unless, of course, you think you can take their side ...esota.

0316069906|1.0|As a (mostly) vegetarian for years who has read several of the books in this genre in the past decade who is a fan of his other work (and with a youngster whose food and rituals I put a lot of thought into, to boot), I was very excited to pick up this book.<br /><br />However, this is a shockingly poorly written account of this issue.  The book came across like a smug, arrogant jerk that slapdashes arguments here and there without sequence and development, and with repetition.  It wants to convert you, but inevitably makes you want to run out and sink your teeth into a factory farmed cheeseburger in spite.<br /><br />In your acknowledgments, you said you were 'outside of my own zone of comfort' (269).

0307588335|5.0|A Colossal Failure is a Gigantic Success as a modern day, true business crime novel - sadly non-fiction.  Lawrence McDonald has amassed a compelling collection of downright criminal behaviour from since fallen Lehman leaders and the repercussions that accompanied their leaps (or were they pushed) from grace. Facts jump off the pages in the form of a tale of tragic mistakes, convoluted fraud and outright greed. Lehman Brothers was once a stable, profitable, growing company harbouring some of the best financial minds in the world. They grew quickly into a feisty giant on Wall Street, striving to be bigger and better at any cost.  Larry explains, in an easy-to-understand fashion, why Lehman died, who killed it and why - uncovering the ill-fated business decisions that corrupted its leadership and brought it down in a tumultuous calamity of bankruptcy and broken dreams. If you don't read anything else this year, you'll want to absorb this Gigantic Piece of Literature[[ASIN:0307588335 A Colossal Failure of Common Sense: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Lehman Brothers]].

BS was creating a new musical archetype, and they pull it off with flying colors.

It looks like it was literally taken in someone's nightmare.
B001FOPODS|5.0|I just watched this movie on Netflix with my husband two children ages 4 and 6.  We were all completely blown away with the amount of detail.  I have never in my life seen such close attention paid to animated figures.  I immediately jumped on Amazon to purchase this movie.  It is a keepsake.      Some reviews have complained about the story line being different than that of the original, but this new version is even better.  Others complained about Duck being eaten in a graphic manner but that is part of the beauty of this film....life is not always a bowl full of cherries....as Disney also points out in every single movie they make.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|Cuaron is the best of the three caballeros (Iñárritu, del Toro and Cuarón). His film making style is elegant, clear, brave, authentic and one step ahead always. This is his best movie. Based on P. D. James novel Children of Men Cuaron keeps nothing to himself. Crude, brave and to the point. Clive Owen; Julian Moore and Michael Caine surrender us with great performances. The story is like a whip on the back and the final action secuence, filming it as if it was some news reporter in a war, soberb.

If you didn't live through this period in time, here's your chance to see what it was all about.
0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol is definitely a Dan Brown book.  It breaks everything into short chapters that constantly switch scenes, has a plot twist, and has its archetypal super-nasty bad guy.  It uses action at a frenetic pace to cover any weakness in facts or plot (like Star Wars).  This is what one expects from Brown, and he doesn't fail us in this book if that's why you read his novels.  As usual, he goes way out on a limb with some of the information he presents, but this time around, the limb breaks.    Except for the villain, the characters in the book are suffering from some brain-crippling disease.  This makes them easy pickings for the puppet-master, who knows just how to play them until the plot twist, when he also succumbs to the same brain freeze as everyone else.  I hoped for better, but I'll accept what I got.    Rather than trying to describe what I thought was wrong, I'll let the book speak for itself.  All bracketed entries are mine, either to put the quote in context or to make some snide remark.  The first quote, I liked, but after that, they go downhill rapidly.    p10:  I am a masterpiece.  [Mal'akh is indeed a piece of work.]    p34:  The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced [Noetic Science - more advanced than Creation Science or even Homeopathic Science] that it no longer even resembled science.  [The resemblance is indeed faint.]    p148:  An unusual, fetid odor wafted out of the darkness.  [Elemental sulfur smells fetid?]    p152:  Ethanol fumes wafted out as she reached down into the [specimen preservation] tank and flipped a switch just above the liquid line.  [It must be a special switch not to ignite the fumes.  (Ethanol fumes burn violently with just a spark.)]    p182:  Seventy-five feet overhead, stained-glass skylights glistened between paneled beams adorned with rare \\"aluminum leaf\\" - a metal that was considered more precious than gold at one time.  [The Library of Congress (Thomas Jefferson building) was completed in 1897, when Alcoa was producing cheap aluminum using the Hall-Héroult process - far less than the price of silver and nowhere near the price of gold.]    p185:  The security guard was on his way, and for some unknown reason, her attacker smelled strongly of ethanol.  [Ethanol smells vaguely sweet (if you can smell it at all); water has a much stronger smell.  Any other odors come from contaminants.]    p200:  Normally, a two-inch-tall object would not be an issue of national security unless it was made of enriched plutonium.  [Who isotopically enriches plutonium?  It's useful because it's already enriched when it's created.]    p208:  Katherine's work here had begun using modern science to answer ancient philosophical questions.  Does anyone hear our prayers?  Is there Life after death?  Do humans have souls?  [Does this have anything to do with science?]    p209:  Mal'akh hurried now into the lab and retrieved the Pyrex jug of Bunsen-burner fuel - a viscous, highly flammable, yet noncombustible oil.  [Will fuel oil also work with a Meker-Fischer burner?  How do you convert it from using natural gas?  And do they use Pyrex because they heat the jug rapidly?]    p268:  He felt pure again, having washed off the last remaining scent of ethanol.  [He probably thought that smelling sweet clashed with his personality.]    p313:  Science and mysticism are very closely related, distinguishable only by their approaches.  They have identical goals...but different methods.  [PZ Myers needs to be notified.]    p335:  Different substances incandesce at different temperatures.  ... Think of a mood ring.  Just put it on your finger, and it changes color from body heat.  [This is incandescence?]    p335:  The early alchemists used organic phosphors all the time as thermal markers.  [Because they incandesce so readily?]    p392:  Noetic Science clearly suggested that thoughts had mass, and so it stood to reason, then, that the human soul might therefore also have mass.  [Of course!]p495:  The results were conclusive and irrefutable, with the potential to transform skeptics into believers and affect global consciousness on a massive scale.  [...and any concerns about her methods would evaporate.]    p498:  Katherine was apparently familiar with the [Capitol] dome's startling acoustical properties...because the wall whispered back.  [The focal points of a sphere are at its edge?]    p498:  The science of Noetics may be new, but it's actually the oldest science on earth - the study of human thought.  ...\\"And we're learning that the ancients actually understood thought more profoundly than we do today.\\"    p499:  \\"Your brother tried to convince me that the Bible is encoded with scientific information.\\"  \\"It certainly is,\\" she said...  [Anyone who has seen the movie Time Changer already knows that \\"the only science worth knowing is in the Bible\\".  After all, the Bible has all the details for building a time machine.]    p499 - p500:  The human brain, in advanced states of focus, will physically create a waxlike substance from the pineal gland.

044656740X|2.0|*MONEY AS AN END IN ITSELF*<br />One thing I saw as a big problem with this book is that it largely does not address _why_ you should listen to him. He does say that he wants to make money to stay out of the \\"rat race\\", but that does not translate into being Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Donald Trump, which are people he says we should strive to study and emulate. Robert is presenting this book from the paradigm that money is the goal in and of itself. Why should you try to be rich? Because then you'll be rich! A circular argument that he feebly defends by equating being excessively rich to not being in the rat race. To him, being taught from a young age by his rich dad, he sees richness as an obvious premise to life, but he fails to adequately defend this paradigm that underlies the entire book.<br /><br />*MONEY IS EQUAL TO WORTH*<br />Robert constantly criticizes poor people, and people who don't make the decision to be rich. He criticizes people who realize that to do what he does, they would have to do things they feel are destructive, or too risky. While I don't think he ever states it explicitly, he does constantly equate a person's worth (as a person) to their balance sheet. This is the justification he uses for BLAME THE VICTIM (below). It doesn't make sense to see punishing poorness with job insecurity, inadequate medical care, etc etc, unless you see poorness as being worthy of punishment. I don't remember him using the word punishment, but he does express that this is a deserved negative consequence. He could defend this by saying that poorness is merely a reflection of worth, not that they are punished _for_ being poor, but that they are punished _with_ being poor (ie poorness _is_ the punishment), that would still be a misdirection. According to his book, the poor are poor because they don't generate assets, they generate liabilities. They put their money in the expense column before the income column. Is this worthy of punishment? Why is struggling to put food on the table a legitimate punishment for behaving in ways that aren't monetarily conducive? In other words, the money system is self-referential. You have money because you are good at making money. You lose money because you are good at losing money.<br /><br />If we take monetary worth to be an indicator of anything other than one's ability to succeed at making money, then we are deluding ourselves. Worthwhile behaviour does not translate into money, detrimental behaviour does not translate into poorness. Slavery ended about 150 years ago, plantation owners were upset because slavery is free labour, a very profitable way to behave even though it abuses a huge portion of our society. And many people who produce value for our society are poor, consider open source authors and teachers, for example. Money and lack thereof cannot be equated to true worth or value to the society. In an anecdote from the book, he points out that he is a \\"best-selling author\\", because he understands sales and marketing, while a woman he meets with is a \\"best-writing author\\" who can't sell any books. In this example, her admittedly good writing doesn't generate money, while his book does. So in this case, money did not select the better book, but rather the better marketed book. So clearly we cannot take money as equivalent to inherent worth.<br /><br />*BLAME THE VICTIM*<br />Robert admits that the poor are victims, he talks about it constantly, calls it the rat race, talks about the many ways they are taken advantage of, such as with taxes. He admits the reason for this is their lack of financial literacy, they are doing what they are taught to do, and says this can be perpetuated throughout many generations. He says their schools and parents and society teach them to behave the way they do which places them into this poor and middle class brackets where they are the victims. They think going to school, getting a job, having a family, buying a house will make them rich, butit just puts them at the bottom, in debt, living paycheck to paycheck. So they are victims because they were trained to be victims. He constantly talks about mindset (one thing I agree strongly with him about), suggesting that a major part of becoming rich is the decision to be rich. To think like rich people do (for a criticism of this, see CAPITALISM IS A ZERO SUM GAME, below). Something these people do not do, because they were taught to think like poor and middle class people do. Then he proceeds to blame them for being poor. Says that they are poor because they are afraid, ignorant, and indecisive. He sees capitalism (as most capitalists do) as a system of rewards and punishments for selecting people and ideas with the best value and worth.<br /><br />But how can he justify punishing the poor for being the way they have been taught to be? He had a \\"rich dad\\" to teach him the ropes, and while he did initiate that relationship, the vast majority of people do not have such a mentor, cannot initiate such a mentor (ie he grew up in a rich neighborhood, so while he capitalized on opportunity to find a rich dad, that opportunity itself is not available to most people, and becomes decreasingly probable the poorer one's parents are).<br /><br />Also, the most pervasive influence is society and culture, an image and worldview set in large part by magazines, movies, television, music, etc. Areas marketing people use to influence people into thinking and in turn behaving in the ways they desire. This marketing is purchased by the rich. They establish the behaviour that is causing the problem. If all the poor and middle class are excessive consumers, then the rich make money. So they encourage this mindset. They establish norms, the people on television live a certain lifestyle, this lifestyle is then associated with a certain group / bracket of people, even though that group / bracket cannot afford to live that lifestyle. The people see that, think that they are supposed to have those things and live that way, and so they do. They go into debt, not even realizing they are living outside their means. The poor / middle class mindset is thus not just taught from parents with the mindset to their children, but also from the rich in order to make greater profits at their expense.<br /><br />*USES EXPLOITING THE DESPERATE AS A JUSTIFICATION*<br />Robert gives many examples of things he has done, and has seen others do (see OVER-RELIANCE ON ANECDOTE). These things largely result in exploiting poor people. For example, he waits for people to go bankrupt, or have banks foreclose on their property, and looks for houses that have been on the market long enough that he can offer significantly less than they are worth. In other words, he has trained himself to spot desperate people, and then capitalize on their desperation. He justifies this by saying that he is providing a service, or something of value, something beneficial, as evidenced in that these people pay him money. If he wasn't doing something good, they wouldn't have sold him a $70k property for $5k that he turns around and sells for $60k. But the reason they go along with this is not because he is providing something valuable, but rather, because their situation is so desperate that they have no choice. They are forced to take the offer, because they don't have any other options. He is not providing a service, he is exploiting the desperate. As analogy, if someone is desperately poor, they may feel forced to sell their organs for money. Thus we outlaw selling of organs, to prevent this exploitation. But if it were not outlawed, then his reasoning would imply that purchasing cheap organs off of desperately poor people is beneficial, to them, because otherwise they wouldn't have made the sale. Turning around and selling them for hundreds of thousands of dollars to people who will die if they don't get them is not extortion, but service, because otherwise they wouldn't have made the purchase.<br /><br />Because he justifies what he does by using their evaluation of the value of his deal, he also must ignore some of his foundational points in the book about how terrible these people are at evaluating the merit of such deals, as talked about in BLAME THE VICTIM.<br /><br />*OVER-RELIANCE ON ANECDOTE*<br />This book is heavy with anecdotes intended to illustrate the points. Most of the anecdotes are personal experiences, and most of them deal with real-estate. This may seem pragmatic, but I think it hides serious problems. If the theory behind his points is wrong, then the anecdotes make it seem right. He believes that everyone can do the things he does (and to be fair, I agree with that), but his examples are mostly himself. If you did not have his experience with international law from piloting ships, leadership from the military, sales and confidence from selling xerox machines, knowledge from attending conferences and school, then your chances of replicating his success would be drastically reduced. His anecdotes are very heavily real-estate based, but that market has been largely tapped out. I can't help but wonder if he would still be \\"broke\\" (which he distinguishes from \\"poor\\") if not for having that wave to ride. He says his rich dad started teaching him when he was 9, but that he didn't become \\"[financially] free\\" until he was 47. If he had all these advantages and all this capability, then why did it take so long? The anecdotes don't address this, they get the reader excited and make his points seem valid, while sweeping potential issues under the rug.<br /><br />*CAPITALISM IS A ZERO SUM GAME*<br />He claims to be selling financial wisdom, the lessons his rich dad taught him. He presents this as a laudable thing to do, he'll educate people about how to make money, and then they will be better capable of making money, making their lives better. So it seems like he is providing something valuable. But this is myopic, we cannot all be winners. There are a finite number of dollars, for every one that I acquire, that is one fewer that anyone else can acquire, thus capitalism is a zero-sum game. For every winner, there is a loser. Actually, with the way it works in practice, for every winner, there are about a thousand losers. In other words, if we all learned to think and act like he does, then no one could get ahead, and his lessons would be pointless. There could be no rich people if there were no poor people, so by adopting practices to make himself rich, he is adopting practices to make others poor. His model for how to get ahead is a model for how to put others behind, directly contradicting many of the justifications he gives for adopting his views and practices. He wants to help educate us to become rich, but this goal cannot be attained (if everyone is rich, then no one is rich).<br /><br />*THIS IS NOT A BOOK ABOUT RUNNING / STARTING A BUSINESS*<br />It was marketed to me as a book about business, or at the very least, a book about wise financial thinking. But running a business is almost never talked about, instead he focuses on investment. If you have seen his chart of the four different groups of people who make up the world of business (not in \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\", but you can find it on the covers of several other books in this series, such as \\"Rich Dad's CASHFLOW Quadrant\\"), he breaks it into employees, self-employed, big business owner, and investor. This book focuses almost exclusively on the investor category. Even then, it is more about mindset than practices. One thing is sure, he spends very little time talking about how to own a business, it is all about choosing to own assets. (ie he would say that you shouldn't own and run a business at all because that is a job. Instead unless you have someone else running it for you, because then it is a passive income, and you can spend your time looking for other investments)<br /><br />*WHAT THE BOOK IS TRULY SELLING<br />This book is aimed at eager capitalists, people who get excited about money, people who want to make money, people who want to start businesses, people who feel trapped in the \\"rat race\\", people who consider themselves savvy and intelligent and don't understand why they are not rich. Through marketing, it also pretends to be for parents concerned their children will wind up in the rat race like they are, but this is mostly cursory. So what does it give these people? What can they get from this book? What is Robert trying to convey?  You might say it gives them hope, or a dream. I think it mostly just gets them excited, makes them revel in their financial desires, makes them feel that these desires are achievable, and that reading the book is helping them achieve them, somehow.<br /><br />But, if you've looked at the people it is marketed to, you'll notice that they are mostly people who do not want to be poor, or who feel trapped or unhappy in some way. The book equates poor and middle class and rat race with extremely undesirable positions, and imparts that you should be getting out of them. This, in itself, builds the foundation of discontentment that the dreams rely on. That you can get to a better place than you are. In other words, you are not in as good of a place as you _should_ be. Once you are sold on this, it turns that \\"should\\" into a \\"can\\", and you are inspired. But you wouldn't need this inspiration if you didn't feel that you were in a bad place, a feeling the book goes to great lengths to ensure you experience. It manufactures discontentment, and markets it as the American Dream. Is the dream attainable? If you can truly learn to think like Robert does, then it is more likely to be attainable, sure. But it sets no paths to follow (see summary below), no set of steps. You'll be in the same position when you finish as when you started, you'll just feel more desperate that things aren't happening.<br /><br />SUM UP THE BOOK IN A SENTENCE<br />If you think about money _all_of_the_time_; critically analyze what others and yourself are doing to be successful and unsuccessful; constantly look for money making opportunities; and strive to make money making decisions, then you will become rich.uation of the value of his deal, he also must ignore some of his foundational points in the book about how terrible these people are at evaluating the merit of such deals, as talked about in BLAME THE VICTIM.    *OVER-RELIANCE ON ANECDOTE*  This book is heavy with anecdotes intended to illustrate the points.

1400049628|1.0|In the Zombie Survival Guide, it is apparent that Mr. Brooks intended to create a humorous work.  The intent of it seemed to be to satire the zombie genre with a field guide to zombies that takes itself far too seriously.  Unfortunately, there is little comedy to be found here.  The book is intentionally written in a dry, droning style.  Unfortunately, while this was intended to be funny, it results in the book being utterly boring.  The problem with the book is that it is a satire of nothing.  It does not mock the zombie movies it takes its inspiration from, as sections on what not to do (for example use chainsaws) have the humor value of someone who watches a slasher and remarks on the stupidity of the victims: that is to say, it points out the obvious as if it has found something incredibly clever, something that has evaded the rest of the viewers' feeble minds.  Of course, in reality the rest of us have chosen to ignore the glaringly unrealistic elements.  The \\"recorded attacks\\" are Mr. Brooks' attempt at writing straight-up fiction, of course in the same manner as the rest of the book.  The results are below most fan-fiction.  These are written in the same dry style as the rest of the book, and lack any cohesion as stories.  Despite this, they are a step up from the \\"manual\\" segments of the book, and as such are its highlights.  In short, this book fails at any form of satire; I would encourage zombie fans to look elsewhere for their fix.

B001CD6FKI|3.0|I wanted to like Speed Racer a lot. I grew up with it. The cartoon is the first thing I remember watching on our new color TV. The movie was cast perfectly, with everyone's looks and mannerisms similar to what I recall. The plot was a more sophisticated version of the cartoons, complex enough to survive 90 minutes.<br /><br />Where did the movie go astray? It tried too hard to be modern. Rather than create a new product based on the old, like the Spiderman and Superman franchises, it tried to blow us away with a sense of what Speed Racer could be.<br /><br />I was going along happily until Spritle flipped off the bad guys in an elevator. While the movie was hardly profanity-laden, it had Speed, Racer X and several other protagonists using course language. This was unnecessary to plot and character development and showed weak screen writing.<br /><br />Racing scenes mimicked some of the old hyperbolism of the 1960s version, but took it too far. The CGI and other animation were colorful and amazing artistically, but left all sense of drama behind. I couldn't follow which car was which in the blur of jumps and loops. It was like my old Hot Wheels set on LSD.<br /><br />Christina Ricci looked like Trixie. With her, the personality update was OK in that she was less of an airhead Betty Boop and more of a genuine, confident woman. Speed Racer's relationship with her pushed what I would be comfortable letting a young child see. While nothing happens, a scene at Inspiration Point is led along until Spritle and Chim-Chim are found in the car.<br /><br />Many aspects of Speed's personality are rich and right on the money. His disdain for school as a child and the implication Trixie cheated to help him graduate was a poor choice.<br /><br />John Goodman cast as Pops Racer was brilliant. He had the look and feel of what I would expect of a guy running a racing company.<br /><br />Paulie Litt is terrific as Spritle. An actor to watch. In a DVD extra, he takes viewers around a tour of the studio during which production people explain their role in developing the film. He's playful and smart, and I expect we will see more from him.<br /><br />The plot is solid. When billionaire E.P. Arnold Royalton wants Speed to race for him, Speed is intrigued. For good reason too. Royalton offers incredible training, resources and glamor, as well as the promise that his family will be free from financial worry. The trouble is races are fixed. Speed's integrity is challenged. He fights back against corruption by rejecting the impressive offer, but Royalton pushes right back with a bounty on Speed in the next race. Racer X gets involved, as does another racer looking to escape from Royalton's clutches.<br /><br />Overall, my expectations were higher. While marketed to young viewers, the race scenes, profanity and romantic themes might be too much. For me, not so young, this was the case. I was confused at times, and disheartened. I am glad I didn't see this in the theater.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />[...]plain their role in developing the film. He's playful and smart, and I expect we will see more from him.

B0029LHW68|4.0|Like many of the other reviewers here, I really love their first album. And Beautiful Lie had some great tracks, but felt a bit watered down. Now if you're looking for a repeat or sequel to the debut album, yes, you will be disappointed in this one.    But since when were bands supposed to be factories that pump out cookie cutter riffs? Evolution and change is an essential aspect of art, and there is always an element of risk in it. Any band really worth listening to has an evolution in their music. They try different things. Look at neo-grunge bands. All the songs are the SAME.    Granted, 30STM gave us the promise of something really fresh and different with the original album, and never quite followed up on that. Giving some of us sonic blue balls. This album is a different animal from the debut, but if you listen to it without the prejudice of expecting a repetition, then it is quite good.    Here they've fused all sorts of interesting styles and elements together. Although I agree they went overboard with the child choirs. Although the lack of them made Alibi and Stranger even more compelling in contrast. Their music on this one is more \\"listen happy\\" or melodious where the debut was almost jarring (in a really good way) and Beautiful Lie was touch and go from melodious to depressed. But almost everything on this album has a lot of energy behind it, and really moves forward at a fast pace. Much of whether you will like it or not depends on what styles you are into.    I personally find the most interesting (challenging) track on the album is Stranger in a Strange Land. It's definitely different, but appeals to their lyrical style and sensibilities from the debut, yet is such a new sound from them.    I agree this album isn't the super fantastic come back it could have been. But no one could (or should) please everyone. Personally I'm not dissapointed, and found plenty to like about this one. And looking at it, I really do think their next album is due to be something really extraordinary.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|Michael Moore's parting words in this documentary serve as a great summary of what he was trying to convey in his film:<br /><br />\\"We live in the RICHEST country in the world. We all deserve a decent job, health care, a good education, a home to call our own. We all deserve FDR's dream. And it is a CRIME that we don't have it. And we never will, as long as we have a system that enriches the few at the expense of the many. Capitalism is an evil and you cannot regulate evil.

B001S2PT3M|5.0|We don't get Showtime, in our cable package, and this is unfortunate.  What's so great is that we can purchase selected programs anyhow, and this is definitely one that you won't want to miss!  Don't just buy this one, though, start at the first season, and go from there.    We didn't know about this series until one of my sons was talking about it, and just went on and on.  Then, Christmas came, and he gave us Season One as one of his presents to us.  Well, we sat down and started watching it, and watched the whole season in one weekend!  We were hooked!  It was  that good, and it kept us on the edge of our chairs!  The writing is absolutely gripping, and the suspense, at times, is gripping.  Michael C. Hall is perfectly cast as a conflicted serial killer who works for..... the Police Department?    I immediately went online and ordered Season Two, and Season Three.  We have now watched them all, and are waiting, and waiting, and waiting, for Season Four.  I think that comes out in May 2010, and the wait is interminable.  There was one thing, though.  I kind of started worrying that I was rooting for a serial killer, but my wife reminded me that he was a \\"good serial killer.\\"  He only kills really bad people.  That helped me a little, I think.    In short, buy it!  You won't be sorry!

B000HLDFK4|5.0|This is one that my wife and I both agreed on.  We both love movies of the \\"time genre,\\" and this one certainly puts a somewhat different twist on time travel, and is a great love story, also.  One other thing; I, personally, am not a big fan of \\"chick flicks,\\" but my wife is.  This is one of those movies that will appeal to everyone, I think.  Give it a try, and I think you'll like it, too!
B000T0XEGS|4.0|To begin with, Zeffirelli has done a hatchet job on the score. Almost half an hour of music is thrown out. That is unfortunate since the performance is quite admirable. Domingo is still a young man and of course sings gloriously. Cornell MacNiel is also at the top of his form.<br />  But the center of the production is Teresa Statas' Violetta. The woman is a superb acting singer. She deserves the mantle of Callas - and like Callas the voice is a little sharp. But she will break your heart. She concentrated on a few roles and thank goodness many of them are available on DVD - Salome, Seven Deadly Sins, Boheme. If you do not know this artist you are in for a great discovery.<br />  Four stars for her performance. It would have had five if Franco had kept his hands off the score.

B0001Z53MY|4.0|It is a good album, not an amazing surround effect but it does something, it has breathtaking high fidelity by the way, the bonus track of Candle in the Wind (Acoustic) makes this album worth every cent, the voice is So Clear, and the acoustic guitars Oh my...!, the rest of the disc is good, three or four songs are not exactly my kind of music but the slow songs are excellent to enjoy both, great music and great audio quality. This disc is not expensive, buy it and you won't regret.
B0024FAR5M|2.0|I bought this DVD set used and it came in great condition.  My two star review isn't due to the product condition or quality, it's due to the quality of the DVD series itself.      I'm really shocked that this show has gotten such high ratings.  Are people really that mindlessly entertained?      Writers/directors occasionally make a movie or TV series in a certain vein, usually a very specific niche (like a MC) where it will have every chance to suck.  Surprisingly, some actually pull it off and don't suck.  This one fell to the odds and does. Hard.      I can't take it seriously.  The elements of the show that should be entertaining; the bikes, the outlaw lifestyle, the violence, end up coming off as a joke. The parts that should be a bit boring in comparison; the more dramatic parts, end up being the most interesting of the show.    The plot is trite.  Contrived.  It's the typical good vs evil deal, with the main character, a handsome, clean young guy (in comparison to his biker buddies), and his internal struggle of the morally right vs wrong. In the first episode he finds some old writings from his true father, the original founder of the club, which begins his conflict; do the right thing, or follow the will of his step-father, now head of the MC. The main characters name is \\"Jax\\" (which just sounds like a bad biker name), and just about every episode closes in a weak attempt at being deep, with Jax sitting on a rooftop reading his dad's writings, which generally contradict the direction that Clay, his step-father,  is steering the MC.  Oh, Jax is a new father too.  He just had a premie baby with his ex-old lady, a junkie played by Chris' girlfriend from Sopranos (her real name escapes me).      The plot swirls around the SoA going around, doing \\"biker\\" things like dealing arms, fighting Mexicans and white supremecists, drinking, doing drugs, passing around ladys that aren't yet someone's \\"old lady\\", dueling with other MC's, etc.  All along the way, Jax is second guessing the call of his step-father, the club's leader, played by Ron Perlman (the ever one demensional).     Don't get me wrong, it does get a little deeper than that with Jax' new baby, the doctor/love interest, his mom, etc, but only about an inch deeper.      There doesn't seem to be any character development.  What's set in the first episode persists throughout the season.  You can see each new development coming a mile away.  The dialog seems fake, worn out and boring.  One of the few bright spots is Katey Sagal (Peg Bundy), who portays Jax cold, conniving mother.  She really does a great job, and after seeing her in it, I can't think of a better actress to play her part.  She is the one character who is almost believable.      Overall, the series comes off as exactly what it is; a bunch of actors in leather vests playing bikers.  There's nothing \\"gritty\\" about it.  If ever there were a series that needed some grit, this is it.     I really think it could have been a cool show if done differently.  That said, i can't tell you \\"how\\" to do it differently without actually following a real MC around in their day to day.    At this point, I'm only finishing the season because I paid $20 for it.  I don't think I'll check out the second season when it comes on DVD.  However, i just found that Henry Rollins will be appearing as a skin-head in the next season, so maybe I'll torture myself a little more after all....
006135323X|5.0|\\"Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions\\" by Ariely Ariely (PI), was an interesting read, and deserves to be looked at by economist, psychologist, marketer, or just people looking to improve their selves alike.  It follows the trend, set by Freakonomics, by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, in discussion of esoteric economic concepts, but without the academese that tends to keep casual readers away.  I found myself personally engrossed while reading this novel due to the parallels of irrational behavior I discovered I also exhibited and will be actively correcting.  The following three I believe have sentimental value to me and I feel are genuinely worth discussing.<br /><br />Zero cost irrationality as described by PI is the concept that reviews the large bias humans show towards \\"free.\\"  I put free in quotations as I am using the term loosely in this context as often the decision chosen is not without cost, and in relative terms, it is often not the option that held the most value per unit of the exchanging intermediary item.  In fact, just a few hours before writing this brief review, I purchased three Publix cloth shopping bags that I had no intention of purchasing beforehand, but because they were buy three get one free.  I can say in earnest, without that free offer, I would have completely shrugged off the Publix bag, to purchase at another time.  A potential solution to this problem, derived from a specific example he mentions within the chapter, is to mentally give the \\"free\\" item a price, even one as low as one penny.  This, surprisingly, nullifies the zero cost irrationality for most individuals, allowing for proper cost-benefit analysis of the additional item or offer.<br /><br />Procrastination, or the giving up of long-term goals for immediate gratification, this desire for immediate satisfaction permeates particularly strongly throughout American culture. The effect of this national procrastination can be seen by abhorrently low national saving rate, or more implicitly or healthcare system that is more reactive than proactive. Though I personally am not a pure procrastinator, in fact many would consider me an extrovert, I believe that there quite a bit I still put off that I do so exactly because I fail to properly evaluate the opportunity cost of the long term benefit of said action. For example, I did a quick back of an envelope calculation of me putting of my savings to next year, rather than not starting when I begun work two years ago. This three wait has cost me over half a million dollars (Assumptions: Roth IRA, with locked six percent APR, maturing in fifty years). I have begun taking Ariely's advice, and setting hard deadlines for many things, such as this particular book review which I gave myself exactly the day after completing the book to complete, no exceptions and no excuses.<br /><br />The final personal irrationality I've found plaguing my decision making has been that of `keeping doors open,' or not being able to stand the idea of closing our alternative options.  My irrational in my context, has to do with maybe not a plethora of options, as emphasized within the book, but rather when I am down to two options that have to deal with something within the social sphere.  Case in point, I would fret over the decision of whether I should continue to chase after a girl or letting her go, or going to a party where I would probably feel uncomfortable or not, though these examples may seem simple to an someone else, I struggled with these decisions constantly.  Often than not, I found myself unable to take the choice that errs on the side of negative (deciding to stay home, or leave the girl alone) as I felt doing so eliminates a multitude of options without producing any new ones of  benefit. I am curious to whether how much confidence has to do with the exact experiment presented within the book. I speculate if participants were required to self select as confident, or perhaps anchored to think of confidence, if such decisions become easier.  I wonder this, since many my such decision-making gridlocks underlie a lack of self confidence, perhaps those with more of it at the time of the test may change results. In sum, Ariely's solution, as I interpret it, the cure for procrastination is really premised by self-confidence, where one sets long term goals and bravely commits to them.<br /><br />The book discussed around 14 irrationalities in total across 13 chapters, each holding a slight new scope of human cognizance to gain. The three above mentioned irrationalities after a deep introspective look, I felt held the most personal utility.  I genuinely I have a new lens to the world.  I genuinely believe that holds the potential to enrich the perspective of most readers as well, no matter their relative amount of academic background on the subject.of confidence, if such decisions become easier.

B002VKE1K2|5.0|Let me preface this by stating that I skipped most chapters to solely watch the \\"meat\\" of the film, as in the bedroom scenes.     To me, this film works and has the adverse effect that it seems to have intended. I am a 40 year old man with a rational mind and also the parent of two teens. My daughter wanted to see this with me and I obliged just out of my own curiosity. I'd heard mixed opinions and am not a big fan of the \\"home video\\" style of film making as the shaky camera tends to get on my nerves. Suffice to say...I did watch this tonight and am having a difficult time sleeping. Hopefully, writing this review will exorcize my own inner demons.     On the surface, yes, the story itself is cliched and pretty derivative. What few daytime scenes I did watch were pretty dull and contrived. The Micah character, for all intents and purposes, was pretty idiotic to the point of laughability. I even made the point that his demise at his possessed girlfriend's hand was a prime example of \\"natural selection\\" and deserved his fate.    To me, the movie works on the principle as stated in my review's title. Whether you believe in ghosts, apparitions, or demons, is irrelevant. Anyone that has ever had that uneasy feeling at night can relate, even in some basic and primal way, to the intended scares here. It brought to mind an incident a while back where my wife and I were sleeping...deeply I might add...only to awaken to find our teenage daughter standing by the bedside. Granted, she was wanting some cough medicine and was having a difficult time sleeping. However, awakening from a deep sleep to find a teenage girl hovering over me was an instant jolt. Not that she was trying to scare..or intended any harm for that matter. It's the stark realization that when we are in our deepest sleep, we are ultimately at our most vulnerable. You would be lying if you can say you've never been awaken by a noise at 2:30 in the morning and immediately unnerved and filled with a momentary dread. We grownups know the boogie man doesn't really exist, but that's not to say that there isn't the possibility that the \\"unexplained\\" can't be just as terrifying.     I guess, in short, this movie spoke to me because I have enough sense to know that I don't have all the answers and can't simply explain away every single night terror and sensation of fear I have ever felt in the dead of night. It's a deep and primal emotion we all have, even the most jaded of us. Fear of the dark is natural and part of our psychological make up. While we all know nothing is really there, it is ultimately the fear of the unseen/unknown that taps into that survival instinct.    I read also that there is interest in a sequel. Just like Hollywood to take something fresh and just ruin it with more of the same.. Standing alone, I think this film has \\"classic\\" potential. The lack of a musical score, the cleverly shot \\"occurences\\", and over all effect just make this one I will likely watch again. I have to commend the director for taking the Speilberg/Hitchcock approach by making the effects subtle and allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks with their own imagination. This is the first horror film I have seen that actually frightened me since \\"The Exorcist\\".     It's such a shame that, despite it's success, there are so many people out there that are so jaded to think that this film fails to provide scares. To me, the best scares aren't the disembowelments and in your face gore fests...it's all about the unknown and unseen.
0679424741|5.0|Written when the author was only 23 (paralyzed at 30, dead at 50) and an American masterpiece. The novel penetrates the deepest mysteries of the human heart, employs no sentimentality or romance, yet relentlessly floods the reader's soul with almost unbearable understanding and love.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|-Supernatural: The Complete First Season Review  (by an avid Supernatural fan)    What a great show, airing since 2005, it has survived The WB/UPN merger into The CW and still is consistently the best show on broadcast television for me. Now, I recently discovered the show \\"Lost\\" as well (which I highly recommend for fans of Supernatural) and it could be argued as the best show on TV, but I have been with Supernatural from the beginning and am an avid supporter. The thing about this season is that it has more of a classic feel to it compared to the newer ones on The CW today. In Season 1, Dean and Sam are both very inexperienced at hunting and what I like to call \\"rookies\\" at the job. One of the best parts of this Season 1 DVD package is the exclusive commentary with Jensen Ackles (Dean) and Jared Padalecki (Sam) on Disc 1 - Episode 4: Phantom Traveler. The actors talk about filming and the on and off camera that they had developed at that point in the first season of filming. The main plot (not to give too much away for those of you who haven't yet watched the show) of the first season focuses on the brothers (Dean and Sam) objective to find their father and find the creature who killed their mother when they were children. I got this used for a very cheap price from the Amazon seller: Go Hastings, out of Texas and it was in great quality. This season 1 DVD Package is well worth this price.    Highly Recommended (5 Stars)
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|Great product. The lead tone is phenominal....some of the best I've heard ever....this includes 100 watt amps. Only complaint is the rhythm tone is kinda crunchy....more overdriven...not really distorted. But it won't bother you anyhow....I just prefer a little more gain. The battery life is pretty good, just replaced em' for the first time in 4 months of constant use. It get's pretty loud for a mini amp and if you're a diehard metal head who appreciates anything from slayer to killswitch engage...than this amp is for you.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Twin peaks truly was a excellent show that burned brightly for a short time then fizzled out as quickly as it came.  The main reason was network pressure for Lynch and Frost to solve the Laura Palmer case before it's time (which may have never even been meant to be solved).  The mystery of who killed Laura was meant to be a driving force in the shows for years and years but when they were forced to solve it midway through the second season it destroyed one of the things that made the show so compelling. After that, the twin peaks plane didn't just crash and burn but burst into flames in mid air.  It really is remarkable to see how the quality that made the show so great suddenly vanished almost immediately after the murder was solved.  Sure the show was still decent but never near close to it's glory days.    I'd say that the first 16 episodes of the series were masterpieces of not only storytelling but cinematography.  Beautiful shots, vibrant colors (which are so rich due to the digital remastering) and that amazing twin peaks music to back it all up really make this series a pleasure to watch.  Each episode (especially the first seven) are like a quality film unto their own.  If you have never seen this show, you really owe it to yourself to check it out.  I remember seeing it as a young child and watched it again for the first time in almost 20 years last winter and was utterly blown away by what a great show this is.    The special features on this box set are amazing too.  The SNL skit is so funny and it has a nice 2-hr film on the making of the series that any fan will love.  A Slice of David Lynch is also really great to watch and really shows what a cool guy David Lynch really is; he seems non at all \\"pretentious\\" as it might seem for some of the oddness of his work and is a really funny guy too.

B001NFNFNU|4.0|In 1928, in Riverside county, California, a cold, dispassionate, demented and brutally insane serial killer named Gordon Northcott (Jason Buttler Harner) amasses a string of some twenty kidnappings, molestations and murders of young boys. His eventual arrest, capture and trial became National news, leading to his conviction. This extraordinary film is called \\" Changeling \\" and is based in part on the true events of the time, including the abduction of Walter Collins (Gattlin Griffith). The crime also lead to a direct investigation of the Los Angeles Police Department. Their ambivalent attitudes and corruption charges would eventually lead to the dismissal of Police Chief James Davis (Colm Feore), Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) and several other police Officers. The movie's heroes include Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), Dectective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) and Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). Together they expose the single minded effort of the police to convince Mrs. Collins that her kidnapped son was found and returned to her. However, the police are mistaken when they believe the case has been solved, as Mrs. Collins is not convinced the boy is her son. Waging a non-stop war with the police, the medical doctors and their cronies, she becomes a force to be reckoned with, despite being ignored, arrested, jailed and confined to a mental Instituation. The movie and all it's tragedy is perhaps a great tribute to Clint Eastwood (Director) in filming what for many is an incredible and unbelievable story of horror and disbelief. Yet when one sees the final product, there is little doubt, Eastwood and his cast has created a Classic. Touching and dramatically sensational, this movie is recommended to any seeking the great effort it takes to fight City Hall. ****

B002HWRYJE|5.0|There are several generations of Star-Trek fans out there and based on their refusal to 'Grow Up' will in all likelihood be more. Those of us who enjoy the original series and perhaps a couple of the movies, realize that despite all the effort to replicate the original dream, directors will never please everyone. This newest film entitled \\" Star Trek \\" is reasonably better than others in that the new cast is well selected. In this offering we have Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike, the original Captain of the Enterprise. (Superior selection.) Chris Pine plays the young James T. Kirk, who is full of vim, vigor and enthusiasm. Zachary Quinto plays the early Spock, full of expectation, promise and definitely logical for the role. Karl Urban plays the erasable Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy. It seems they select the right man as he fits reluctantly into his role. Simon Pegg plays engineer, Montgomery Scott well and believable and I believe, James Doohan would have agreed. John Cho is the youthful Lt. Hikaru Sulu, the pilot and portrays him very and observably masculine. One wonders why? The navigator is the very young Russian Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) Based on his performance, very believable. Then we have eye-candy Zoe Saldana as Communication's officer Nyota Uhura. Her 'brief tease' and wondrous appearance in this film is not only attractive, vivacious, but forcefully sexy. What is unexpected is her apparent love interest which will conjure up a bagful of mixed images in the sequel. After the introduction of Eric Bana as the heavy, Ben Cross as Sarek, we are further treated to special guest appearance by Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime. The film is loaded with magnificent action scenes, hurtling explosive crafts, photon blasts and violently exploding worlds. In addition, the inter-dimensional space-time travel and encounters with gigantic Black Holes will have the audience gasping and wanting more. Excellent film and a worthy addition to Gene Roddenberry's dream.****
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Okay, all of these old \\"copies of the original\\" are poor in video quality.  Even so, the story is so good that soon you take no notice of the poor video.  Though there are several versions of this story, each one has it's good points and those that some tend to pick apart.  Best advice?  Simply enjoy the wonderful story and the imagination that the makers demonstrated in this attempt: if you take a positive attitude and look for the good you will certainly find it.  Enjoy!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|According to the Mayan Calander, the first Sunday of November should have fallen on the 5th and the Japanese should have destroyed only five of the Nine Battleships. They instead attacked on Sunday, December 7th and sank all nine. This error of history proved to doomsday predictors the Mayan system of astronomy was off by eight hundred years. In this futuristic movie called \\" 2012 \\" the end of the world as we know it should end on this date. Well except for the date, little if anything went wrong with the movie. Watching the film within the surround sound system of a Cina-Plex theater, the entire movie was an exciting, fantastic thrill-ride on steroids and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting, the assembled cast, the wonderful CGI-effects, the volcanic explosions, the crumbling earth, toppling buildings, world wide catastrophic flooding and doomsday happenings made this incredible movie a monumental visual success. The story as we see it has John Cusack playing writer Jackson Curtis, who predicted the world's end in a book entitle 'Farewell Atlantis.' Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Adrian Helmsley a scientific adviser to the president who having read the book has concluded the government should listen to him. Oliver Platt is Carl Anheuser, the Political adviser to the president and is superb in that role. Woody Harrelson plays Charlie Frost a radio host and doomsday prophet. Danny Glover is President Thomas Wilson who believes mankind waited too long to hear the truth. John Billingsley is wonderfully serious as Professor West. With a supreme effort in direction, this movie will easily become a Sci-Fi award winner. The special effects will also make this an all time Classic and a milestone for John Heard in his career. Enthustically recommended. *****
1563894696|5.0|I was blown away on how good this story was. I am a big Marvel fan, but have been thinking about breaking out into mainstream DC books. I was not disappointed with this read. It combines Batman's dark precence and a great murder mystery to make a great story. The art also contributes to this as well. This is a great start for anyone who wants to read more Batman, and I am sure I will buy more Batman books in the future.

1400052173|4.0|Most of the reviews here nicely explain the mechanics of this book--the two, intertwined stories of Henrietta Lacks and her cells, and the reporter's journey to describe the effect this has on her children--but don't delve into the other aspects so powerfully presented here: race, class, discrimination, and medical callousness and malfeasance. All of these issues are entangled (like cancer cells) within the two stories and, inseparably and together, are what make this such an important book.<br /><br />As we learn from the author, the story of Henrietta Lacks has been told before in popular magazine articles and in a BBC documentary. However, what these tellings lacked is the comprehensive treatment of race in America that Ms. Skloot gives us via the biographies of the Lacks family: the long road from slavery to Jim Crow to racial isolation in contemporary Baltimore, and how Henrietta's \\"otherness\\" affected her medical treatment by white doctors in the 1950's.<br /><br />Two other important issues are also part and parcel of the book, and affect all of us today as patients: who owns our cells and tissues, and what is informed consent? (These are discussed head-on in the afterward, and I urge all readers concerned with these to read this first, as a prelude to reading the book. It stands alone and does not interfere with the story.)<br /><br />The medical community, with the exception of a few, does not come out well here: self-absorbed with their power under the twin umbrellas of \\"scientific omniscience and progress\\", they treat patients badly, sometimes horrifically (see, for example of the latter, the chapter devoted to the hospital for \\"The Negro Insane\\".) There is enough evidence here to make any patient careful about their own medical care today--white or black.<br /><br />The book is also infused with the historical specters of racism and racial discrimination in our country, and Ms. Skloot describes these without bias, with no agenda or fervor, and with a good reporter's clarity. This is as important to the telling of Henrietta's history as is her cancer.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is that it could have used some additional pruning and editing of the chapters devoted to Ms. Skloot's reporter's journey. Reading about the mundane and quotidian is often quite boring (and, moreover, unnecessary), and in the later chapters, the book careens from the wildly fascinating to the enormously dull, so much so that I wanted to put the book down. For this reason, I'm giving the book 4.5 stars.<br /><br />However, I encourage all readers to read the entire book. It's an important contribution to American history.

0545123267|2.0|i really wanted to like this book and in the beginning i did. it was interesting how the author set up the chapters and i liked the characters, but when i got about twenty pages in, it started to get bad. it was just a mess. the main character is apparently SPOILER in love with a wolf. its not like she knows the wolf is a in fact a human man, but she thinks he is just a cool looking wolf with gold eyes (Twilight much?) who she cant stop thinking about. she goes about thinking about this wolf, ignoring her friends and daydreaming, refusing to leave her wolf or her home to hang with her friends just in case the wolf might stop by. it has good points and good chemistry when the wolf is a guy, but other wise its a bit lame. will read the sequel only because i always finish series, but will not buy them like i did Shiver.

B001QWBM62|5.0|This is a great unit.  I've owned mine for a few months now.  I originally purchased the Zoom H4 (the original model) for a friend who I wanted to encourage to record her music.  I wanted an easy tool that she could pick up and, without too much effort, get to work.  However, after I gave it to her (she was thrilled with it) and got to play around with it a little bit, I was incredibly impressed by the fidelity of the audio it captured.  It far exceeded my expectations.    So I recently purchased the H4n for myself as a tool to aid in composition, grabbing ideas as I have them on the fly, and for field recording and sampling.  Since then I've used it to record lectures, concerts where production quality was important but not critical, and my own compositions in scratch format, and it serves wonderfully for those tasks.      Just last night I used it to record a friend's show (mostly for archival purposes) at a local venue, and, being in a rush to set up, I just stuck it in a corner of the bar out of the way but with a decent field for the built-in mics, and set some preliminary levels and let it run.  I was really surprised by how good the result was.  I was not expecting much given the haste with which I prepared it, but I ended up with a very balanced recording that was as good as the acoustics of the bar allowed.    I'm used to audio editing, so for me the menu system, while not that pretty to look at, is intuitive and solid.  I've rarely been confused by a feature enough to pull out the instruction manual (I'm a hands-on first, instruction manual later to learn what I'm missing sort of guy, and this device was simple for me to use.  I had it up and recording out of the box).  On the other hand, if you're new to audio and multitracking, you'll want to read the manual.  The english is a little poor, but you can usually decipher the meaning of things.    It even has a fair amount of editable built-in effects which are great for sampling potential sounds for, say, aguitar line that you know you want to dirty up in the final song, but you're not sure of the exact variety of dirt you want until you hear it in the mix (of course, it may vary in a final studio recording, but you can get an idea).  In 4 track mode, you can play back any initial tracks you've recorded and then audition different effects in another track before you lay down the take.  Great for finding the general sphere of effect you want for a particular part.    And while I have no use for this feature, for someone on a budget, I love the idea that it doubles as a USB audio interface.  They really thought of everything when designing this!    In short, I love this device, and since its general sturdiness seems to have improved since the original H4, I'm hoping mine lasts me for many years to come, or until something smaller or, somehow, better, comes along to replace it.

B002VECM72|5.0|THE BLIND SIDE<br /><br />STARRING: Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, Tim McGraw, Jae Head, Lily Collins, Ray McKinnon, Sharon Morris, Omar J. Dorsey, Kim Dickens, Tom Nowicki and Kathy Bates<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: John Lee Hancock; based on the book by Michael Lewis<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: John Lee Hancock<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Drama<br />Release Date: 20 November 2009<br /><br />At last Sandra Bullock has finally gotten the praise she has been so deserving of since the early 90s. Thanks to her wonderful performance in The Blind Side, she has received her first Oscar nomination.<br /><br />She plays Leigh Anne Tuohy in this heartfelt true story. Leigh Anne and her husband Sean (Tim McGraw) live in a big house, have a lot of money, and a terrific family. Then, things get even better for them when a troubled young man named Michael comes into their lives.<br /><br />Michael is played by Quinton Aaron. This kid has a look to him unlike anything you have ever seen on the face of anyone in Hollywood; he has the kindest eyes you could imagine and just looking at him you want to be his friend because he seems like the nicest person you will ever meet. It is no wonder Quinton Aaron was cast for the role of Michael, because his character is the exact same way.<br /><br />The Tuohys first meet Michael when he is walking home in the rain from a high school volleyball game that their daughter was playing in. He's a very huge guy you see, and you just can't miss him. He is completely drenched to the bone when they pull over to see if he needs a ride.<br /><br />When Leigh Ann asks him if he has a place to stay for the night and he says no, Sandra Bullock sealed her Oscar nomination with one of the best delivered lines of the year: \\"Don't you dare lie to me.\\"<br /><br />He in fact was lying as he does not have a place to stay. Nor does he have a change of clothes or a family of his own or even so much as a loyal friend to talk to. Michael has nothing.<br /><br />Leigh Ann is destined to change all of that. She invites him to stay the night on the couch and soon enough he is living with them. Eventually she gives him his own bedroom and learns that he's never had a bed to call his own before. It's hard for her to hear this, but he has one now so she accepts that, as Michael has had to.<br /><br />The film is called The Blind Side for two reasons. One is because Michael is black and the Tuohys are white and everyone in town except for them seems to notice this. The second is because as well as being an emotional drama, it's also a very good football movie; referring to the blind side of the quarterback.<br /><br />Leigh Ann narrates parts of the film and beefs us up on our knowledge of the world of sports. She tells us the story of how Michael came to love the game of football and how it changed all of their lives.<br /><br />Michael tries out for the team and isn't exactly the best and doesn't necessarily love football at first. With a little help from Leigh Ann, he learns that he can use his incredible size to protect the quarterback. Leigh Ann explains to him that the team is his family, and asks him if he would protect her and her family. Michael takes this very seriously and makes her and us believe that he would do absolutely anything for her and the family.<br /><br />That's pretty much all it took to turn Michael into an unstoppable machine on the field. Before long, colleges are beating down their door with offers. Leigh Ann has even gone so far as to hire a private tutor to help Michal with his grades. There are some very good scenes here, with the always enjoyable Kathy Bates, playing the tutor.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the film is also very laugh-out-loud funny through its entirety. This is particularly thanks to the fine acting of Jae Head, who plays Leigh Ann and Sean's goofball son, S.J.<br /><br />One of the things that could hurt the film for others, I actually found to be one of its greatest assets: It doesn'tfeel like a film. There are no real over the top dramatic performances and character arcs and plot twists in the film. You can really tell that the filmmakers were trying to be as true to the story that actually took place, as possible.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is astonishing. You will notice the accent that she perfected flawlessly and that as she has done in so many other films; she adds a unique physical posture to her character. She walks and physically moves like someone else and you can really notice it. She also looks a great deal like the real Leigh Ann, as can be seen in photographs at the end of the film.<br /><br />This movie doesn't pull any fast ones on us and it never pretends or wants to be anything that it's not. It simply tells its marvelous story: Michael was a great kid that nobody gave a chance to and everyone gave up on; until he met Leigh Ann Tuohy.<br /><br />This film truly moves you because it shows you that no matter the size of a person, they have feelings; and the slightest gesture of kindness can change someone's life forever.n the film.

B001OQCV6K|4.0|SHERLOCK HOLMES<br /><br />STARRING: Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, Eddie Marsan, Robert Maillet and Kelly Reilly<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, Simon Kinberg and Lionel Wigram; based on the characters created by Arthur Conan Doyle<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Guy Ritchie<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Mystery<br />Release Date: 25 December 2009<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is back! Thanks to his blessing as Tony Stark in Iron Man, he's catapulted himself to A-list status. He's recently blown us away with his Oscar nominated performance in Tropic Thunder, and his highly underrated portrayal in The Soloist. Now, he returns to take our breath away yet again, as the amazing Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />I'm not gonna lie; I am not familiar with the character of Sherlock Holmes at all, despite him having been depicted probably more than any character we know of. That includes favorites such as James Bond and Ebenezer Scrooge. According to [...], Holmes has appeared in well over 200 television and cinematic projects; the first of which dates all the way back to 1905. That's impressive. I have no idea if this movie lives up to what fans of the character and the novels would expect. But I enjoyed the film a great deal. I simply saw it due to the actors involved in the project. Ok, I'm a bit of a Guy Ritchie fan as well - but who isn't?<br /><br />The film is undoubtedly an obnoxious action flick that may annoy many. It has a bit of humor, and a great deal of mystery to it as well, but it's the action-junkies that will get the most from it. Unfortunately, I suspect that is also what will ruin it for some; particularly those expecting it to be more of a subtle mystery.<br /><br />I'm just a sucker for good action movies and so long as the actors are magnificent, I'm willing to look past a somewhat weak story. Sherlock Holmes was exactly that for me. It moves very fast and at times you may be off track by what is going on. What's great however is Holmes will often catch you back up to pace with things you might have missed, using well-narrated flashbacks and comedic one-liners.<br /><br />The plot could have been better, but then again it certainly could have been worse. We meet a nasty villain early on in the film by the name of Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). He's a tyrant who practices in the dark arts. Holmes and his faithful sidekick Watson (Jude Law) take him down in the first few minutes, and he is put to death by hanging. Due to his dark trade, he magically comes back to life to wreak havoc on the people of London once again. Somewhat bitter by his un-expected return from the grave, Holmes and Watson are eager to take the case and catch him a second time.<br /><br />Downey and Law are brilliant together and you get the feeling they have known each other for years. They go together like peanut butter and jelly or Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller.<br /><br />Law plays Watson very well and is everything you would want a sidekick to be. And Downey was definitely snubbed out of an Oscar nomination for his performance as Holmes. His accent is perfected to a T and his Sherlock persona is more than impressive and highly entertaining. At least he took home the Golden Globe.<br /><br />I was disappointed to see some of the scenes with Rachel McAdams that we saw in the trailer, sadly removed from the theatrical version of the film. Maybe they will show up on the DVD and BLU-RAY discs. She was wonderful as always, as Holmes' love interest, Irene.<br /><br />The look and feel of the film reminded me a great deal of the phenomenal horror / thriller From Hell. Director Guy Ritchie has given Holmes a playground amidst the streets of an eerie London that looks like it could easily be housing Jack the Ripper. It's not too dark though; the brilliant Academy Award nominated score makes the setting less sinister.<br /><br />Ritchie did a terrific job directing this film. His cinematography is very detailed and every shot looks like a million bucks. The `guy' (no pun intended) has an eccentric vision. The fight sequences are awesome and are among the best I've seen since Fight Club or the Jason Bourne movies. He uses some computer graphics, but only where he needed to and they look amazing. He's not afraid to use them in wide shots, that fill nearly the entire frame and that takes guts.<br /><br />If it's not too much to ask, I have only one request for the currently untitled sequel that is to be released sometime in 2011 (with Brad Pitt rumored to be co-starring). I'd like very much to see Watson at some point in the film say to Holmes, \\"Well no s*** Sherlock.\\" Would that be too much? I think it would be swell.) has an eccentric vision.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|I just got this yesterday and am really enjoying it.  It is one of my favorite shows.  Contrary to popular opinion, I like it better than X-files. It is rather more mature and sophistocated.  When I got to disc 3 Episode 6, \\"The Cure\\", where Agent Olivia Dunham, faced down David Esterbrook, Senior Officer of INTREPUS, it was so cool I had to watch it 3 times. It would only have been better if it had shown her perp-walking him out of the building, which apparently she did.  This is one of the best scenes I have ever watched. I have to get off of here and back to Fringe  The only thing bad about this set is that it is in the window box form.  I can adjust my sceen to display it to the full widescreen, but then I have to adjust it back to use the menus.  The resolution is just fine, but it would be really nice if the makers of these windowbox DVDs would also make the menues in window box so I wouldn't have to switch back and forth.
0545123267|5.0|Although SHIVER is listed as a Young Adult book, I absolutely loved it -- and I'm a grandmother.  Perhaps those who didn't review it as enthusiastically can't remember what being a teenager in love is or was like.  Admittedly, I do love werewolf/vampire/wizard tales, but the love story in SHIVER is truly lovely.  Human Grace and Werewolf Sam are wonderful characters and I fell in love with both of them.  The only thing that didn't ring true for me was Grace's totally clueless and selfish parents!  As for the reviewer who couldn't find the \\"Ahhhh\\" factor in the book:  It's on the very last page.  This is a book I will re-read every so often - I enjoyed it that much.

But there isn't, so this will do.  I actually saw this before I saw any stage productions, and it's not bad.  It's just not great.  I really do NOT like the Potifer scene at all.  It's...well...strange, cheap, and...I don't know...just kind of creepy.  I do love Donny Osmond...he is fantastic!  And the narrator here is still the best I've heard, video or stage.  It's worth getting for a reasonable price.  Enjoy it, but don't expect to be \\"wowed.\\"

1439116881|5.0|Still Alice is beautifully crafted, emotionally evocative, thought-provoking, compassionate, and riveting. I rarely read a book straight through these days, but I could not put this one down. In no way do I mean to imply that this is a quick read or an insignificant one. To the contrary, Still Alice affected me as profoundly as any book I have ever read.<br /><br />It is the story of Alice Howland, a tenured Harvard professor with a doctorate in Psychology. Her specialty is language formation and organization--a brilliant woman, a great teacher, a renowned researcher, a sought-after lecturer--who has been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. Early, as in her 50's, still at the pinnacle of her chosen and beloved career, still young enough to be anticipating further career advancement as well as retirement and grandchildren.<br /><br />Alice relates her story in her own voice, and eventually in her own thoughts, as her faculty for speech diminishes much too quickly, albeit predictably, for this articulate and erudite woman--an especially cruel irony. Her mind knew, but she lost the ability to convey that inner part of herself. The reader travels each step of Alice's journey as she descends into the formless unknown, and unknowable, chasm of Alzheimer's dementia. Early on, her doctor insists that Alice always bring someone else along to appointments, since given the nature of her condition, she will not always be a good judge of what has been going on in her own life, or in the progression of her brain disorder.<br /><br />For Alice, always the consummate organizer and scheduler, disorder is a good description of what became of her exterior life. What once made sense no longer did, the words she used with such precision were gone, and time and place lost context. After a while she could no longer participate in making decisions for herself and she slowly lost her independence. While frightened and frustrated and at times incredibly angry, her spirit remained intact. She continued to make her feelings and thoughts known as she was able. To the end, she fought for her dignity and that of other sufferers of dementia.<br /><br />For Alice's family, there was fear of the unknown. Would her husband be able to, or indeed want to, take care of her as she slowly deteriorated? Himself a well-known research biologist, he had once shared so much in common with Alice. His educated grasp of the processes of disease gave him the tools to fight for her treatment, as well as insight into the probable futility of any cure. His frailty as a human made it hard for him to accept what was happening to Alice and mesh that with the future of his life as it had always been planned. Her children had to deal with the very real threat that her Alzheimer's was hereditary. One son and one daughter chose to find out their genetic predisposition through testing; the youngest daughter chose not to have the test. Their choices would have lifelong ramifications. So, this is also the story of Alice's family and the effect of a most puzzling and cruel and unpredictable disease on them. It is a story of triumph in the face of a disease has the ability to cause a family to come apart or pull together in a crisis.<br /><br />The reader is not left without hope. As the book ends, we know that the core, the very innermost part of Alice, remains. Her career, her position in her family, her independence all stripped away, she retains the essence of the person who was Alice before Alzheimer's dementia wreaked havoc with all she was and all she knew. She loved and was loved.<br /><br />Although this is a novel, there is much factual information in Still Alice. Genova's research was extensive, in both the medical aspects and the human. Few people in this day and age have not been affected by Alzheimer's, whether in their own family member, or that of an acquaintance. This book would be of great value to all of them. For myself, I will keep this book, reread it and share it. It is simply that good.<br /><br />by Susan Ideus<br />for Story Circle Book Reviews<br />reviewing books by, for, and about womenStory Circle Book Reviews  reviewing books by, for, and about women

B0036B8MXC|5.0|Spartacus: Blood and Sand is a kick ass show.  Let me say right off of the bat that there is extreme sensuality, brutality, and violence in this series and it probably will offend some of you out there.  That being said, I think everyone should watch it.  (By everyone I mean all men because I bet that 99.9% of women will hate this show with a passion of 1000 burning suns.  Yeah it's that cool.    In case you haven't noticed, Spartacus is a gladiator.  Do you know what this means???  It means there will be almost unlimited gory gory gory duels in the arena.  Limbs are flying left and right like frisbees, heads are getting cleaved in two by razor-sharp swords, and guts are seeping out of cuts across the belly (yeah you actually see the intestines).  If this is too much for you, quit reading this review right now and never speak of Spartacus again because I'm just getting started.    OK, here's a basic run down of the story.  Spartacus (actually his name isn't really Spartacus, but since that's the name he is given and uses in 99% of the show, I'm going to use it too) is a Thracian who agrees to help fight along with the Romans to help fight off the Barbarians.  However, he deserts the Roman army to run back to his village and save his wife because the Romans don't give a rat's ass about his village and want to march the other way.   So, they hear about this and catch him right after he has an awesome sex scene with her, and sell him to slavery.  He is thrown into the arena to die and actually kills everyone.  So they realize his potential and is bought by Batiatus and trained as a gladiator.  I'll leave out the details so I won't spoil it for you, but just to let you know, he becomes a kick ass gladiator.    There are so many conflicts in this, I can't keep track of them all.  Someone is either ripping another guy's guts out or chopping off his head, having a very explicit sex encounter with someone, or cussing someone out or making cock jokes.  OK, about the guts andheads: so many people die in this it isn't funny, it's HILARIOUS!!!  Gosh I've never seen so much blood and body parts in all my life!!!! (Actually body parts has two meanings; 1- limbs and heads flying off and 2- sexual organs.)  Yes, you get to see everyone's junk, including the men's junk.  This is like combining 300 or Gladiator (the movie) with a porno.  They also make way too many cock jokes and references.  One thing they say is \\"Jupiter's cock what have you done??\\"  Another is \\"Oh the gods have rammed their cock right in my ass!\\"  You get the idea.  It is funny at first, then it gets funnier, and then it gets boring they say it so much.  But don't let that stop you from watching this!  Let me sum this up for you:    Here's the awesome:  1. Great intense action!  Blood everywhere!  2. Superb acting!  Andy Whitfield is excellent!  3. Great sex and nudity!  Male and female!!  4. Double crossing and intrigue!  You don't know who's working for who!  5. Unlimited obscenities and cock jokes!  \\"Jupiter's cock!\\"  6. Oh and did I mention blood?  I'm not talking buckets of blood, I'm talking dump trucks of blood.    I'd recommend Spartacus: Blood and Sand (which you see a lot of in this show) to anyone who likes reproduction (sex) and the opposite of reproduction (killing).  If you have a soft heart, don't watch this!  Notice: do not operate machinery while watching Spartacus, until you know how Spartacus affects you, do not drive either.  Be sure to have a stress ball nearby to channel your rage so you don't break a window.  Also keep all women away so you don't go on a sex frenzy while you are under the influence of Spartacus.  That being said, Have Fun!!
B00005B36H|4.0|I bought this cd for a friend as a gift so I knew that it wasn't going to be shipped directly to me.   The timing was good. It got to my friend in 2-3 days. He opened it and the cd was great. I highly recommend this band. It's our favorite and we already had the mp3s, we just wanted the physical itself so I was really hoping it would be perfect.  The only disappointment I had was that the casing it came in was tearing off. The glue was old so when my friend opened the case, it was already worn. We figured it was because of how long it has been in stock, the glue on the case probably got old and just undid itself. But I was a bit annoyed just because it was a gift and I didn't want him to have an old worn out case. He's a big tool fan and all the parts of the cd are important to him, including the case. However, he decided it was fine like that and he fixed it himself.   Overall, he said it was a great gift. I just have to warn buyers that if you get this cd, just know that this cd is very old and the casing is very old, so it may wear off in due time.  Still worth the money, I'd say.
0385737424|5.0|I put off reading this for quite awhile because quite frankly, Newberry award winners don't usually blow me away.  I have to say that this is the best award winner I have read in a good number of years. Yeah!  A book I can confidently recommend to 5th graders on up!  This is a book everyone should read - it's a beautifully constructed story about friendship that incorporates mystery, science fiction and even brings in some social issues of the 70's.  I read this in one sitting because I became too engrossed in it to put it down.  I could go on and on about the wonderful characters, or the intricate plot, but since this  has already been addressed in many other reviews, lets just say that here's a book for middle readers that doesn't talk down to them, isn't teaching a preachy lesson but is just providing a good story they can relate to.  I look forward to Ms. Stead's next effort!
B002SF9YUM|4.0|Javier Beltran's eloquent performance as Federico Lorca was believable.  Robert Pattinson's portrayal of Salvador Dali was quite good although his Spanish accent didn't work out too well at times.  It was nice to see him play in a different type of movie.  It was heart wrenching from Lorca's pov but i was left confused about Dali's true genuine emotions.  It was a very interesting film.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|I would be hard-pressed to try and even describe this movie to anyone.  It simply must be seen to understand its message. A movie about death would never seem like such an engaging topic, but this one surpasses all expectations. Particularly poignant is the deep respect embedded in the Japanese culture for the ritual surrounding burial and death, a reverence that the rest of the world would be wise to emulate.     Plot synopses are readily available everywhere, so I will simply say that this is a movie worth owning in a personal library - and pulled out for viewing in times of grief when we mortals need a reminder of the value of life.
B002RSDW80|4.0|My husband and I watched this and felt like we were watching two separate movies.<br /><br />One movie was greatly watchable and interesting - Meryl Streep and Stanly Tucci portrayed Julia and Paul Child with great like-ability. Talented as always - Streep lives up to her well-earned reputation as one of the most talented actors.<br /><br />The other movie, portraying Julie and her husband, was also well acted, but Julie's character is so narcissistic and terribly unlikeable. This type of movie should be a feel-good movie, but the parts with Julie and her husband are not.<br /><br />Walked away from this film, thankful for having seen the Julia Child part, but the Julie Powell part are minutes of my life I will never get back.
B003102JDM|1.0|I thought I was a fan of the Coen brothers, but after this movie I am reconsidering ... this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Was it some sort of childhood payback that led them to make this movie about growing up Jewish and dysfunctional? If there was a plot, it may (?) have had something to do with the meaning of life being buried in a Jefferson Airplane song, but it was impossible to tell. I tend to think that its whole purpose was little more than an indulgent piece of throwaway art. Though the acting was good, the talents of those involved were wasted on slow, boring dialogue that tries to generate sympathy for the tortured hero at the center of the film. Sadly, it never quite got there for me or those with whom I watched it.  It ended with us scratching our heads and wondering how it got made. As a final note, I found this film insulting to Jews and \\"Goys\\" alike (mostly goys) sterotyping both in the most negative manner. Not a single laugh, and not even close to the Coen brothers that I thought I knew.

B002T9H2MO|2.0|I love Sam Rockwell, and I was sure that I'd love the movie based on the reviews and the trailer...     I didn't. This movie has an excellent idea, but though Sam Rockwell is a fantastic actor, he wasn't electrifying to watch. His performance was genuine and incredible, but boring. There would be periods when it would feel like the movie would pick up and take me somewhere exciting, but then it wouldn't deliver. I wasn't looking for Michael Bay 'splosions and Roland Emerich-level apocalypses, but this seemed more like a novel playing out on screen than a movie. A novel that didn't translate well to images.     Moon has a lot of potential. A really fantastic idea, an interesting group of actors, an interesting ending and a thoroughly developed lead character are all things that the movie has going for it. The movie just failed to deliver on all of its promise. It could have been so much more than it was... but it just wasn't.

I highly recommend doing business with 'texttextbooks.'

B00004RJ71|1.0|I only watched a part of this movie, and saw absolutely no reason to watch the rest.<br /><br />The actors are bad, the characters ridiculously stereotyped. But then, who knows? Maybe all White Nazis in prison are homosexual, all prison guards are rogue, and all Chicanos wear gang colours and speak English with a ridiculous Spanglish accent. Are we surprised that the Black prison gang is called \\"the Black guerrilla army\\" or that the White gang is an \\"Aryan brotherhood\\"? And then there are the usual altercations in the prison dining room. Yawn. Did I mention the homosexual Nazis? And yes, there is graffiti as well. Man, I thought that was a Black thing.<br /><br />If you want to celebrate Mexican-Americans, do a movie about the UFW and  Cesar Chavez. Or Crystal City. Or even about how Davy Crockett got blasted at the Alamo. Please forget about the street gangs and the Hollywood stereotypes.<br /><br />Enough said.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|If you are at Season 3 of Dexter, then you are hooked. Jimmy Smits is awesome as the guest star for this season. If you haven't yet seen Dexter, you need to watch each season in order, so that you get to know all the characters who appear in each of the three seasons.  The only problem we have is deciding when to stop, as we usually watch 3-4 episodes at one sitting (We just finished watching the 2nd season a month ago)

0307271862|3.0|The large chunks of the book taking place in China seem almost to have been written by someone else.  The woman judge who \\"solves\\" the mystery frequently relies on her vague feelings, rather than evidence, to determine her next move.  She also does some inexplicable things (if this were a movie, we'd be saying, \\"Don't do it!\\").  The strange actions of the Chinese characters are explained away by it being a secretive society.  There was a lack of cohesiveness regarding the plot, and I fail to understand exactly why the villain acted as he did in Sweden.  In addition, there were entirely too many coincidences.  On the plus side, we know that China is buying farmland in other parts of the world, ostensibly to increase food production for their billion people.  But the possibility that another reason is to export Chinese peasants is intriguing.

0307702103|5.0|All of the reviews that I could find pertaining to the Audiobook were negative.  I wanted to post a review to say that I loved Grisham's reading of this book.  I think the speed, pauses, and the way he reads it are all very much on purpose.  It seems to me that he read the book exactly how he intended it to be when he was writing it.  While he can't do all the voices like Michael Beck (A Time to Kill) or Vincent Marzello (The Last Juror), I enjoyed the whole thing.  The stories, writing and narration were top notch for me.  I hope he does more of these.
B001QP86WM|3.0|Whether you love or leave this album will depend on where you stand in the punk scene and what matters to you in the music you listen to.      The best things about this album is that it is well recorded, the band (and therefore the songs) gel well together and the songs have tonnes of energy.      The biggest negatives are the lyrics are quite banal and boring and generally seem to be about nothing except keeping it real in the scene.  They over do the gang shout repeating the line the singer just sang (this becomes particularly grinding after a while and loses its impact) and the band don't really offer anything new to the scene.  Instead, they have taken parts from popular punk bands and blended them all together.    When you listen to the album you can pick the influence with each track.  The Downfall Of Us All borrows heavily from New Found Glory, It It Means A Lot To You could have been written by Say Anything and the hardcore tracks sound, well, like every other hardcore artist of the last decade.     Nevertheless, A Day To Remember do it well.  If you are new to the scene this would be a great introduction to what's going on in punk music at the moment.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|Guillermo del Toro is the perfect director to bring the characters and events of Mike Mignola's horror comic Hellboy to the big screen, and manages here in the sequel to the mostly satisfying [[ASIN:B001AK3S4Y Hellboy]] to create a fully realized and seamless vision of a fantastic underworld that overlaps with the everyday.  Del Toro's unique sensibility, that combines a strong sense of whimsy and a keen eye for the macabre, matches precisely the story of an orphaned demon from Hell, raised by a kind-hearted gentleman who happens also to be an expert on the occult.  Hellboy, as played by Ron Perlman, is one of the coolest fantasy heroes ever brought to the big screen; he's tough as nails with a heart of gold, both brutish and tender, the kind of guy who'd single-handedly destroy a monolithic monster, and save a kitty with the other hand.<br /><br />Here Hellboy, or \\"Red\\" as he is known to his friends, has to deal with a rogue elf prince, who plans to eliminate humanity, because of its callous indifference to the magic and wonder of the world.  At the same time Red's trying to figure out his girlfriend, a human torch played by Selma Blair (in my mind, her best role -- she's never looked better nor seemed so at ease in a role), and deal with the obnoxious authorities who want to impose rules on a force of nature.  A scene where Hellboy and buddy Abe-sapian commiserate and get drunk to Barry Manilow's \\"Can't Smile Without You\\" is pitch perfect hilarious - yet the demons and monsters are inventive and scary and the swordplay, effects, and action is intense and thrilling throughout.  While it may lack some of the profundity and depth of some of the greatest fantasy, you'd be hard pressed to find a fantasy thriller that is more flat out entertaining than this one, at least for those with a geek sensibility like me.

B002T9H2MO|4.0|In a not-so-distant future, Earth's energy is being supplied through extraction of Helium-3 from the Moon.  Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a space miner whose job is to make sure that the massive mining machines keep running and to ship the fuel they extract back to Earth.  He's at the tail end of a three year stint, and can't wait to go home -- and Gerty 3000, his robot companion whose design and mission is a significant twist from that of Hal 9000 (of [[ASIN:B00005ASUM 2001 - A Space Odyssey]]), seems worried he is beginning to lose focus on the mission.  It turns out Sam has much bigger issues to worry about.<br /><br />The German philosopher Martin Heidegger wrote that in an age of technology, where everything is treated as a resource, we ourselves become just another means to an end.  We think of technology as our servant, but humanity itself becomes another means to an end, a cog in the globalized technological machine.<br /><br />Director Duncan Jones has created a profound yet simple and small science fiction film that thematizes questions regarding the impact of technology on human life, how it affects human relations to each other, even what it means to be human.  The film feels like a return to some of the most intriguing science fiction of the seventies and the eighties, films like [[ASIN:B0016I0AJG Soylent Green]], [[ASIN:B000063UR1 Silent Running]], [[ASIN:B00000ILDD Alien]], and [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner]], even if it is working on a smaller scale than the last few of these.  (It's worth watching more than once for its inclusion of clever references to many of these films - the script and the setting include a number of subtleties, that are likely to be missed on first viewing.)  The production team obviously made the most of a small budget, and managed to create a very realistic moon base, and very convincing machines and subtle use of special effects.  Of course, the most impressive component of the film is the performance of Sam Rockwell, who almost singlehandedly carries the entire show, and gives a delicate and nuanced performance throughout.  This is excellent independent science fiction.  Highly recommended.andedly carries the entire show, and gives a delicate and nuanced performance throughout.

0439023483|5.0|When you're reading The Hunger Games, you are preoccupied with the immediate terror of: will Katniss survive? Will Peeta survive? What's going to happen next??? The raw suspense is by far the predominant reading experience of The Hunger Games. But it is in the days and weeks after you finish the book -- after you've already gone onto other books -- when you realize that you're still thinking about Katniss, Peeta, and Rue. You realize that these characters and the world Suzanne Collins has created for them have stayed with you long after you closed the book. Their world continues to haunt you in the back of your mind; their bravery continues to humble and inspire you. In my experience as a reader, this is the mark of truly great writing. It is a rare thing, and it is what I'm always hoping to find when I open a new book, and what I'm hoping to revive when I open an old one.

0812973992|2.0|I wish I had spent the time reading a non-fiction book about Philippe Petit, the man who walked a tightrope between the twin towers. Instead I read about a somewhat sad bunch of people whose stories were loosely connected by the events of August 7, 1974. And indeed, their lives were intertwined in other ways that were revealed in vignettes (with somewhat jarring transitions between them). I felt the selection of characters was almost intentionally chosen to show the author's prowess for exploring diversity. Some of the prose was cutesy as well, particularly in the story of Claire, a grieving mother whose son was killed in Vietnam. I won't go into each story - I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. And for me, it was exercise to keep going at times. I did keep reading though and eventually raised my star count from one to two. I now plan to read the real story of Philippe Petit - I am very curious to know what he was thinking!

B0012GMVQC|4.0|Jeff Beck is one of the great artists of the electric guitar. After Hendrix (who is in a class of his own), Beck is one of the greatest. Unlike many others, he covers a broad musical spectrum, incluing hard rock, more or less straight blues, jazz fusion, more or less straight jazz, and classical (bent his own way, of course).<br /><br />In Guitar Shop, Beck continues his journey. Not as groundgreaking as his very early work--with the Yardbirds--he replaced, and improved upon, Eric Clapton), and not as revolutionary as his work with the Jeff Beck Group (Truth and Beck-Ola). Not cutting edge jazz fusion (Wired and Blow by Blow), it still stands head and shoulders above virtually anyone else playing on electric guitar!<br /><br />Buy it, but don't stop hear!

B0031R5K68|3.0|[[ASIN:0385504225 The Lost Symbol]]<br /><br />Dan Brown has very little idea of Self, Mind, Ego and Consciousness as explained in the Vedas. Mental power being material is only as good as physical power, if a comparison could be made. Spiritual strength arising from understanding and realizing one's own Self is what is called the Secret Science by Krsna is Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 7). Mere thoughts, and the mind which is built of these thoughts, are just impediments. Misplaced ego and intellect further contributes to binding one in darkness.<br /><br />That apart, Dan Brown drags in Noetic Science to state that the Spirit Soul, encased by physical body, has weight. Spirit is not matter and hence has no weight. Brown could have referred to NDEs (Near Death Experiences) which has a more acceptable basis in science.<br /><br />The villain, curiously named Mal'ak (angel in Hebrew), was a former drug addict with no initiation whatsoever into the world of the Left Path. He has no master, no guide and no book. He has a lot of Internet material for guidance. Mal'aks and fallen Mal'aks are realized souls, Grand Masters, not de-natured body builders clothed with tattoos. In normal case he will not be acceptable even in the Hell.<br /><br />Free Masons, as any other similar sect of spiritualists, try to break free for the written word of the scriptures. Masons use rich symbolism. Vedic Masters use aphorisms and ecstatic love expressed by elevated songs and dances. Others use various other constructs. They don't try to decipher the secrets of the scriptures and reach heaven-ward.  On the contrary, they aim to transcend the written word and reach inward. For it is often said \\"Your friend can help point your attention towards the full moon, framed by branches of a tree. Seeing has to be done by you and only you\\".<br /><br />I hope Dan Brown will attempt to \\"see\\" before he writes his next book.

0061537969|5.0|I am not much of a reader and never write reviews.  However, I heard a co-worker rave to others about a book he read about life from a dog's perspective, and the concept sounded interesting.  I purchased \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" because it met the basic criteria of what he was talking about.  I don't know if this is the same book he read, but I enjoyed this book immensely!  I read one book a year tops.  For some reason, I read three books this past month, all recommended by others.  If you ever had a dog (I put one to sleep who looked like the pooch on the cover), this book will touch your heart.  If you are a parent, this is a great read.  If you ever felt like life was crushing you and you did not know whether to give up or move forward, this is a book for you.    A prior review said this is an 8th grade reading level.  It is not.  Enzo is one deep thoughtful dog!  I have not shared any of the book's contents in this review because you just need to read it.  I really enjoyed \\"Marley and Me\\" (the book, not the movie), but this book is completely different...in a very wonderful way.    All I can say is I hope you read it.
1439190275|5.0|In my first-look at the brand new \\"Atkins diet\\" book from Atkins Nutritionals, I'm happy to say that advocates of a high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carb nutritional approach will have a lot to cheer about. Unlike the December 2008 release of [[ASIN:B001KBZ670 The All-New Atkins Advantage: The 12-Week Low-Carb Program to Lose Weight, Achieve Peak Fitness and Health, and Maximize Your Willpower to Reach Life Goals]] by Dr. Stuart Trager and Colette Heimowitz which advocated \\"lean protein\\" and lots of vegetables as the basis of the world's most popular low-carb diet, this new book gets back to the roots of what the good Atkins name is really all about.<br /><br />Three of the most well-known and highly-respected researchers of carbohydrate restriction were charged with penning an updated Atkins diet book that would be simpler to follow and completely backed by the latest science. The result of those efforts are culminated in the book release \\"New Atkins for a New You: The Ultimate Diet for Shedding Weight Fast and Feeling Great Forever.\\"  Written by the perfect trio of today's brightest low-carb scholars -- Dr. Stephen Phinney from the University of California-Davis, Dr. Jeff Volek from the University of Connecticut, and Dr. Eric Westman from Duke University -- it aims to set the record straight about why low-carb works, what you need to do to make it work, adapting it to your busy lifestyle, and then providing the evidence that proves what they say about the Atkins lifestyle is valid.<br /><br />This is a book that has been sorely needed on the market ever since the untimely death of the late, great Dr. Robert C. Atkins in 2003. And the authors acknowledge the forward-thinking that Dr. Atkins possessed so many years ago when he started using his low-carbohydrate plan on patients and they hope to carry on his legacy for many years to come by sharing the amazing research that is now confirming much of what he taught people struggling with weight and health problems.  They share a wealth of science in this book through the 50+ references to real scientific data that has been conducted on carbohydrate-restriction in just the past few years.  Much of this information may be new to the public since it has not received a lot of attention in the press.  But the good thing is they present the information in such a way that the general public will easily understand and implement these dietary changes into their own weight and health regimen.<br /><br />Anyone you know who thinks the Atkins low-carb diet is just some passing \\"fad\\" that is not backed by any substantive studies needs to know about this book.  Even for people who have read the 2002 edition of [[ASIN:1590770021 Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution, Revised Edition]] this new version contains a whole new way to look at low-carb living like you've never seen it before because the authors made it easy-to-understand and instituted subtle improvements to make the plan more effective than any of the other Atkins imitator books that have come along in recent years.<br /><br />This new Atkins will shock the naysayers (that is, if they actually READ this one!) when they learn you consume lots of healthy non-starchy veggies on it, can implement some basic strategies for greatly reducing or preventing the common negative symptoms associated with starting low-carb, have a great guide for knowing when to transition from phase to phase of the diet, will find a detailed explanation of making this a permanent weight maintenance plan, have the ability to customize the plan to your specific dietary wants and needs, and that eating low-carb on the go isn't as impossible as some people think. This really is a new way of looking at healthy low-carb living from a new perspective.<br /><br />The contents are broken down into four main parts:<br /><br />PART I outlines all the nutritional mechanics of Atkins low-carb eating. The authors help you determine if the Atkins approach is right for you, clearly explain that this program is not meant to completely eliminate carbs, just limit them, identify the various health improvements that one could expect by following the plan, share what the four phases are and why they are important, define the \\"Atkins Edge\\" that comes when you put your body into fat-burning mode, give the mechanism behind why food becomes energy and is stored as body fat, reveal the damning role that most carbohydrates play in healthy living and discover the right ones you should be consuming, uncover the unique role of protein in the Atkins diet and give reasons why this plan is not high-protein as is often erroneously claimed, and share the evidence behind why consuming dietary cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fat, should become your diet's best friend.<br /><br />PART II gets into the nitty gritty of the diet by showing you what you are supposed to eat and tailoring it to your specific health goals. The authors help you focus intently on looking at the net carbs of the foods you consume, insure you are getting an adequate amount of protein in your diet daily, understand the amazing benefits of fat when you greatly reduce your carb consumption, learn the benefits of consuming fiber-rich foods like the \\"Foundation Vegetables\\" that are essential on the Atkins plan as they always have been, how to keep the added sugar and refined carbohydrate out of your menus, supplement your diet with the appropriate vitamins to obtain optimal health, and find the appropriate level of exercise that will fit within your specific physical fitness capabilities.<br /><br />Tools for making yourself successful are also included in this section, including setting goals, finding support, planning meals, making appropriate lifestyle changes, keeping a food log, and participate in online web sites and blogs. They even show how you can make your Atkins diet vegetarian or even vegan if you so choose and even a \\"Latin Beat\\" version for the growing Hispanic population dealing with obesity and diabetes. Specifics for following Phase 1 Induction, Phase 2 Ongoing Weight Loss, Phase 3 Pre-Maintenance, and Phase 4 Lifetime Maintenance are also included with more information than you've ever seen before about doing it right along with some common pitfalls that may sabotage your efforts along the way. As long as I've been studying low-carb over these past six years, never have I seen a book so clearly demonstrate the details of the Atkins way of eating in such a concise manner.<br /><br />PART III is dedicated to helping you live the Atkins life in the real world by arming you with ways to make virtually any restaurant into your own personal low-carb restaurant with appropriate substitutions and changes.

0312305060|5.0|Cunningham seamlessly weaves together the lives of three disparate women: one, the author Virginia Woolf, who will write \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" and then later commit suicide due to her schizophrenia; the second, a 1950s hausfrau who dreams of leaving her perfect sheltered world and who is peripherally linked with the third woman, a 20th century middle-aged author herself, who's planning a party in honor of her former lover who's dying of AIDS.  Tragic, but beautifully written and moving.

B0015I2P0Y|5.0|There are many qualities of The Seldom Seen Kid that must be appreciated.    1.) Elbow fill space with such perfection. It seems every beat, every syllable, and every phrase is calculated and prescribed just the right instrumentation and fill. Not every gap is filled with predictable guitar strums, hums, or piano doodling. If any instrument repeatedly fills space, it will nearly always take on a different sound every time. \\"Some Riot\\" is characterized with a scraping, synthesized bass sound that nearly shaves your scruff off when wearing headphones that then retreats to an eerie rumbling. \\"Mirrorball,\\" which is possibly the \\"best\\" track of the album, denies a cramming instrumentation and instead relies on acoustic space, snare rimshots, and a simple piano/guitar harmony to create such a beautiful melancholy. \\"The Fix,\\" on the other hand, employs several voices, harmonies, and instruments to create a menacing, frolicking feel when the song closes out.    2.) Vocals are quality! Fans of Coldplay will be surprised to find a singer reminiscent of Chris Martin... but with a technically better voice: a well-placed and relaxed tone; no weak falsetto to change between ranges (typical of Coldplay), impeccable intonation, not to mention an impressive upper range in full voice (as in the chorus of \\"One Day Like This\\").    3.) Musical knowledge. Elbow refrain from a company front attack from the get-go. Instead, they plan the peak of their songs for maximum effect (as is evident from the lengthy tracks, which are atypical of many bands who have nothing left after three and a half minutes). They often add instrumentation throughout the song to do this so as not to throw it all out there from the start. There's also an evident understanding of modes. I'm always impressed with the note-play in \\"The Bones of You,\\" which toys with minor/major tonalities and often employs zig-zagging melodies (\\"But image on image like beads on a rosary, pulled through my head as the music takes hold\\"). Elbow are obviously rich in influence as well. Take the tracks \\"Grounds for Divorce, \\"Weather to Fly,\\" and \\"The Fix,\\" for example. None seem to be produced by the same band, yet each have a distinct sound.    I certainly recommend The Seldom Seen Kid for its knowledgeable musicianship, its thoughtfulness in creation, and (duh!) because of its enjoyable nature! What a great find.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I love this movie.  The performers who sang themselves were great.  The cinementograpy was positively beautiful.  The costumes true to period.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|\\"Inland Empire\\" is the best movie in the whole History of Film. It achieves what, as far as I have seen, no other film has achieved. What essays on narrative said movies couldn't achieve, in comparison with Literature. That is, to show the psyche, the interior monologue, the dreams and the nightmares, within the characters. And it does it in a way no other film (that I know) has made it: showing just their (her, in this movie) mind.     This is a huge step forward in Cinema. It's like the step from silent movies to \\"the talkies\\". But, from the point of view of the merit of films and directors, with the significant distinction that Lynch's has been taken not because of the development of a technology that any director can use, as something taken for granted, as a routine, being the merit of scientists, but because of the personal art of the filmmaker.     Many other filmmakers had tried to do the same thing. Lynch himself had tried it in \\"Lost Highway\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\". And he did it masterly. But, in \\"Inland Empire\\", he excels. He does it for the whole movie. From the beginning to the end (or almost; the next step is too obvious). For the first time in history. That's why I think this is the best movie ever (so far). A landmark forever.    As for the story, I don't know if Lynch reconstructed his home in Boise, Idaho, for the shooting, but I would say that \\"Inland Empire\\" it's just another way of telling, and from another point of view, a very similar story to that of \\"Mirror\\", by Andrei Tarkovsky.       The sad news: Lynch will never again achieve something like \\"Inland Empire\\", I dare to say, maybe prematurely. He will do other movies, brilliant as he always is, but I'm pretty sure he will never reach that artistic level. He has already done it. He can repeat himself, tell other stories the same way... In fact, it's like he didn't want to stop that story of redemption: \\"More things that happened\\". He wanted, attempted, to show everything that happened, to get rid of it, to heal himself (he wasn't even, maybe, completely aware), once and forever... He did it. It's done. And, as a Spanish genius, the sculptor Jorge Oteiza, said, after an Artist makes his masterpiece, all he'll be able to do is \\"craftwork\\", \\"decoration\\". I think that's what Lynch will do after his masterpiece: just follow the paths (as an activity he masters and enjoys doing) he left undeveloped in \\"Inland Empire\\".
B000FBFMFW|4.0|I'm no literary critic but I know what I like and I like Robin Hobb's writing style enough that I've read six books. Plots aren't necessarily a strong point but character development is wonderful. A writer that begs to be read.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|Shortly after purchasing this record player the automated needle arm started malfunctioning.  First of all, an automated arm is completely unnecessary, and in this case ruins the record player as a source of malfunction.  The \\"start\\" button will bring the arm over to the record, touch down to the record for a second, then return to its starting position.  If you try to manually move the needle arm over to the record, the automated function kicks in and fights you to move back.  eventually it will play, but it takes about 10 minutes of fighting with an irritating and altogether unecessary automated function (that is electronically broken) to play a record.  Get a more reliable record player.
B002Y0TGOU|2.0|Enjoyed this movie. It was our first (and so far, only) streaming video rental from Amazon. We have a 10mbs FIOS connection so we should have been able to stream the HD version of this movie (which we paid extra for). However, the stream rebuffered and we had to watch in lower quality. My advice, stick with Netflix. HD streaming is no substitute for Blu Ray.
B001TKADSY|5.0|Americans read much less foreign literature than their foreign counterparts - approximately 3 percent of the works published in America are foreign written.  Some bloggers claim the number to be more like one percent.  No matter what - American knowledge of foreign literature or foreign culture is significantly constrained by such lack of publication.  And, in this failure, ignorance is not bliss.<br /><br />This author attempts to weaver fictional accounts with real events of Afghanistan - a clever device to educate Americans about the nuances of his culture and his people.  Biting topics with cultural insight hopefully can often open American eyes to cultural and other concepts not displayed by the news media or other modes.<br /><br />On the shallowest scale of interpretation, this is a book about male inhumanity to women in Afghan's world.  But, as the sheaths are stripped off the topic's metaphorical onion, this book grows into a novel of much greater dimension.  It is about women's love for women; about children's adoration of mothers; and, about the spirit of two women in this book which outlasts and endures the hardships imposed upon them.  As the main character's mother once says, \\"Women like us. We endure. It's all we have.\\"<br /><br />That character, Mariam, unlike her mother fights to the end. And her love of another woman, Laila,  is shown by the greatest gift one can give to another - her life.  And, upon delivery of that gift, the other woman - equally oppressed and shrouded with concepts of guilt for loving the person to whom her heart is attracted - determines in the end that her life is best exemplified as one of joy not in being with her love of her life, but rather having been loved in her life by another.<br /><br />Senator Clinton, after seeing the rubble left behind by the Taliban which uprooted whatever independence women ever had in Afghanistan, recited the nation as one where female apartheid persisted. And, this Afghani writer is not ignoring that fact.  Men can beat their women, be polygamists while the women cannot, can educate themselves while the women cannot, and are allowed outside without escort.  Events of running away from an abusive husband frequently end with incarceration where children are born and raised - never knowing of the world beyond the jail's bars. This author is not asking for forgiveness of such things - rather he tells us how these events evolved and allows us to try to understand how things could be so different from a place not that far away.<br /><br />I liken this author's portrayal of Afghanistan to de Berniere's portrayal of Turkey -- [[ASIN:0099478986 Birds without Wings]]. Each blends the local dialect with the American novel to make the reader feel closer to the place of the story.  And, each is a magnificent writer who can deliver great plot and dialogue.<br /><br />I think this author's [[ASIN:B002PUKHZG THE KITE RUNNER]] was magnificent.  I think this is a better work.  I wonder if a third novel can be as successful.heir women, be polygamists while the women cannot, can educate themselves while the women cannot, and are allowed outside without escort.

For such a grim task  he comes with a great smile, a cool attitude, and an happy complexion, like a scorpio on honeymoon. He goes from airport, to luxury hotel, to Office to airport, to luxury hotel, to office in different cities with the task of saying: \\"OK, old buddy, I'm so sorry but... you're fired\\". He has also the task of training a young employee for this thankless job. Meanwhile, he enjoys volatile (that's the word!) encounters with a friend and lover.Soon we'll see what an empty life is this, and he'll realize that too, in a most harrowing way.   This is a very poignant social commentary, very sad but so true: and the uprooter of jobs is so good at his job, we learn, because HE HAS NO ROOTS.

B002WCLG3Y|4.0|Well, let me get this out of the way real quick.  I'm a PC gamer, so my exposure to the Halo universe has been dreadfully slow, but I still regard Halo: Combat Evolved as one of my favorite FPS games.  The mysterious environments, the badass weaponry, and some of the coolest characters in video game history all come to mind when I remember those first days playing the game.  I was quite excited when I heard that a Halo anime was going to be released.  After all, animation opens up so many possibilities for the direction of the Halo story to progress, but now that I've watched the whole DVD, I can't help feel somewhat disappointed.  Many of the stories just don't have the emotional pull I was hoping for.  The pieces are fairly short and you have to get used to a new animation style after every part, which isn't too bad, but some of them are animated in strange ways (a watercolor animation for example).  Let me leave off with a few more comments.<br /><br />1.  The voice overs are not bad, but you do have the option of listening to the voice in Japanese or English.  Both are worth a listen.<br /><br />2.  \\"Odd One Out\\" is intended to be a parody of the Halo universe.  I don't think some of you understood that and unfairly criticized it as something it wasn't.<br /><br />3.  ORIGINS is by far, my favorite part of this collection(actually two parts).  Origins is the reason why this DVD will stay in my collection.  Cortana's sweeping narration and the effective animation of Studio 4C was amazing.  Part II was as much a story about humanity as it was Halo.  Although I appreciate the hard work that was put into the other parts, I wish that they where more like these segments.  Very impressive.<br /><br />I'd recommend this DVD if you are looking for a light evening experience.  Don't expect to be moved to tears or experience some sort of epiphany, but try and enjoy these episodes for what they are.  Ya have some light comedy in there with \\"Odd One Out\\", unique animation with \\"The Duel\\", all around excellence with \\"origins\\", and a decent mix of action/lessons in morality in the rest of the episodes.  Not bad, but not great.  Make sure you get a good price.lence with \\"origins\\", and a decent mix of action/lessons in morality in the rest of the episodes.  Not bad, but not great.

B000FBFN1U|4.0|I've got to get this off my chest. George R.R. Martin is a very good writer and an excellent plotsman BUT....this series takes FOREVER. And, just when you think that you've found some momentum (after 2000 pages!!!) you find out that the series isn't finished.    Martin's plot develop is excellent and this series contains many sub-plots that could stand on their own. The problem is that there is never any resolution to any of the plot lines. It reminds me of the old TV series Twin Peaks that died under the weight of it's continually changing and evolving plot twists. It became so convoluted that viewers simply stopped caring and you got the sense the writers were just screwing with the audience with no true sense of purpose or direction.    From the outset it's clear that one of Martin's obsessions is medieval heraldry. He devotes an inordinate number of words to vivid heraldic descriptions. Normally this wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that there are a HUGE number of characters and each earns a lengthy description. It's a bit self indulgent but at least he's consistent with it so that it becomes an accepted part of the landscape.     The huge cast presents major challenges for the author as he tries to craft plot lines for them all. This series contains many well drawn and memorable characters that could stand alone in their own stories. But just when you begin to identify with a protagonist or antagonist he kills him/her off. It's baffling to me why an author might devote 500 to 1000 pages developing a character and them simply off them. At first, it comes as a major and unexpected plot twist. After the fifth time it's as if he's thumbing his nose at his audience.    Here's where I think Martin has dropped the ball. Tolkien understood that you can create an entire otherworld but that it takes individual stand-alone stories to build that world brick-by-brick. Martin has created the world first and tried to tell a thousand stories that are all interconnected in some way (we are often left to guess how).    In the final analysis, I enjoyed these books a lot. Ultimately, though, without resolution, there is no sense of satisfaction and the reader's commitment flags under the weight of this never ending saga.

B002I9Z8B2|5.0|I love Wrath of Khan, it is my favorite Star Trek movie.  This was the first movie I ever saw alone in the theater (my parents wanted to see Firefox instead), so there is a certain nostalgia for me when watching.  Anyway, this is the best looking version of this movie I have seen.  About 2 weeks before I bought this it was on HDNET movies and there is a night and day difference in the quality of the blu-ray.  Picture is much sharper, colors are brighter, sound is crystal clear, overall I am very happy with this purchase.  Considering the age of the movie I am amazed at how great it looks.  I know some people were upset about this not being the extended cut with the extra 4 minutes, but in my opinion those 4 minutes don't really matter much (though I don't know why they were left out?).  I suppose you can wait for the eventual release of the extended super duper restored, remastered, re-filmed with new actors edition, but I don't see the point.  If you love Star Trek or just love sci-fi movies this is a movie to add to the collection.

Some parts of it are insightful and interesting, but on several occasions Gilbert lapses into an oddly sanctimonious rant on varous subjects. From her clearly bitter feelings about Christianity, the Department of Homland Security and social conservatives to her long defense of gay marriage, it's a very disjointed read. If you're looking for the same fun ride that was \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\", skip this one, you will be disappointed.
B002LYTNR4|5.0|This is a good CD set to listen to for about 54 to 70 minutes or so for breathing exercises, meditation and focusing. Later, I will look for a book/video on Xi-Gong and get back into it. This is an excellent CD set to get centered, though Tolle, at least to me, is no messiah. I use this set for personal centering and self-monitoring to deal with difficult people and not get caught up in other people's lives; I just focus on my own life. His voice is very calming when I get frustrated with troublesome software. I can forget about feeling the low-self-esteem. I recommend this audio version so you can listen to it over and over again. If you fall asleep, you can always start it over. Now, I am less involved in things I can't do anything about.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I have been looking for this album in all the stores and finally found it here. This particular CD has everyone of his hits that I love, from 'More than a memory' to 'The fever'.  The CD was delivered to me within 3 business days and am very happy with my purchase here.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Great deal,i got it in about 2-3days which was also great,and of course its MJ so that is even Greater,thanks for the cd
B000V697WK|5.0|\\"Gaucho\\" is not really like any of the other  Steely Dan albums. There is obviously no doubt that it's Steely Dan is playing, but the album has a unique sound and sentiment and it is very homogeneous. This does not mean that all songs are equally good. There are clearly tracks you remember better than others; actually there is a couple of songs which are not very memorable on their own; but in the context of \\"Gaucho\\" they work fine.<br /><br />The title-track \\"Gaucho\\" probably won't be the first song your attention is drawn towards, on the other hand, it could easily turn out to be the song you'll want to re-hear most often with its Incredibly beautiful horn-theme, and of course the song itself is actually very catchy and classic Steely Dan.<br /><br />\\"Third World Man\\", was my first favourite, and it is a song of durability too.<br /><br />\\"Hey Nineteen\\" is probably the most commercial and catchy number. Nice funky rhythm with some nice blues guitar.<br /><br />\\"Babylon Sisters\\" is both funky and dramatic, while \\"My Rival\\" is both catchy and has a good funky riff.<br /><br />\\"Glamor Profession\\" and \\"Time Out of Mind \\" are fine well-produced tracks, which probably do not quite have special qualities of the rest of the album.<br /><br />After \\"Gaucho\\"  the group took a break for nearly twenty years until \\"Two Against Nature\\" in 2000. So for many years \\"Gaucho\\" was thought of as a farewell work - and a very commendable one of its kind.<br /><br />Fortunately, Becker and Fagen are together again, and they have so far recorded two more fine albums.

B001DQH8Z0|5.0|I will admit, I was not familiar with Electric Wizard until I picked up Terrorizer magazine this week and saw their choice of Dopethrone as the best metal album of the last decade.  That piqued my interest.  That they are considered a \\"stoner rock\\" band, and I am a fan of the band Sleep, cemented my decision: I had to hear this album.    I'm glad I did.  Dopethrone is one of the heaviest albums I have ever heard.  It is thunderous!  The vocals of Jus Oborn are mixed down into the music and can be difficult to decipher, but that is not a complaint.  To me, the non-prominent vocals add to the denseness of the songs.  Four of the tracks exceed ten minutes, and not one of them is dull.  The riffs, the crush, and the sheer heaviness of this album make Dopethrone a true wonder.    I do believe Terrorizer is right on this one.
B0036EH3TS|4.0|Again - don't let the movie snobs fool you; this is a really good flick.  I am excited to see (and hear) this on Blu-Ray.  Armageddon is easily this is one of the best action flicks of the 1990's and will take any viewer back decades to old science fiction stories of the 1950's and 60's found in movies and comics.  It really is traditional story telling in its purest form.  It contains the perfect mix of humor, action and suspense.  Is this film deserving of an Academy Award?  Well, no...but it is a good flick for a boring Friday or Saturday night!  Enjoy...
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This Is It! For fans of music, rock & roll, film, or Michael Jackson. This DVD is essential for your collection. I wonderful inside look at the genius of The King of Pop. As we go through the journey of the preparation of one of the greatest shows to ever be presented live on stage you realize how Michael got the title of 'King of Pop'. It is also an intriguing look at how live productions are put together. All the work that is involved and how much effort it takes from many people to make a spectacular stage show. This Is It is a wonderful film that anyone would enjoy. I saw it twice in the theaters and I pre-sale ordered the DVD. Get your copy today.

1416594787|1.0|Like many biologists, Richard Dawkins doesn't understand the difference between animals and human beings and why so many philosophers say that God exists. In a textbook used by 65% of all biology majors in the United States, the index includes the phrase \\"mind-body duality.\\" I'm sure Dawkins and Charles Darwin would find no fault with this explanation:<br /><br />\\"And certain properties of the human brain distinguish our species from all other animals. The human brain is, after all, the only known collection of matter that tries to understand itself. To most biologists, the brain and the mind are one and the same; understand how the brain is organized and how it works, and we'll understand such mindful functions as abstract thought and feelings. Some philosophers are less comfortable with this mechanistic view of mind, finding Descartes' concept of a mind-body duality more attractive.\\" (Neil Campbell, Biology, Menlo Park, CA: The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., 4th edition, p. 776)<br /><br />That abstract thought is unique to humans is not the only thing there is to know about it. What a biologist more than anyone else should understand is that the knowledge that humans generate abstractions does not come from one of the five senses. This knowledge comes from our ability to make ourselves the subject of our own knowledge. Also, abstract thought cannot be defined or explicated. Consider, for example, knowing the page we are looking at is black and white. This knowing means more than that light is entering our eyes and a signal is going to our brains. It means an awareness of this. This gives rise to the unanswerable question: What is the conscious knowledge of humans as opposed to the sense knowledge of animals? Its unanswerability means humans are indefinabilities that become conscious of their own existence. To quote Shakespeare, \\"We are such stuff as dreams are made on; and our little life is rounded with a sleep.\\" The infinite abyss we are surrounded by when we contemplate our own existence is incomprehensible. Some say this mysterious part of self-knowledge is God.<br /><br />Ren&eacute; Descartes attempted to explain why a human is able to control its body as if it is a possession. This question is called the mind-body problem. According to Descartes a human consists of two different beings, like a stagecoach with a driver and a team of horses. Cartesian dualism is inconsistent with the metaphysical truth that a human being is one being, not two beings. It is a matter of common sense that human beings are embodied spirits. Body and soul are metaphysical principles or incomplete beings that explain why humans are equal to one another but at the same time different from one another. This is why evolution applies only to the bodies of humans, not their souls. The cosmological proof of God's existence comes from the metaphysical analysis of the finitude of beings.<br /><br />Some knowledgeable people say the proof of God is just an argument. I don't agree because that implies you have to decide whether to be an atheist, theist, or agnostic. I don't see any reason to make such a decision. Jean-Paul Sartre is supposed to have been an atheist, but this is what he said:<br /><br />\\"Thus the passion of man is the reverse of that of Christ, for man loses himself as man in order that God may be born. But the idea of God is contradictory and we lose ourselves in vain. Man is a useless passion.\\" (Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness: A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology, New York: Washington Square Press, p. 784)<br /><br />What we have to decide is whether or not God has revealed himself to mankind, regardless of how incomprehensible, contradictory, and hypothetical God may be. This decision is as personal and emotional as the decision to live the life of a selfish libertine or a virtuous ascetic. It is the connection between this decision and evolutionary biology that clouds the discussions about evolution and fuelsthe controversy about teaching evolution in schools. This is Dawkins discussing evolution reasonably:<br /><br />\\"By the time Darwin came to publish On the Origin of Species in 1859, he had amassed enough evidence to propel evolution itself, though still not natural selection, a long way towards the status of fact. Indeed, it was this elevation from hypothesis towards fact that occupied Darwin for most of his great book. The elevation has continued until, today, there is no longer any doubt in any serious mind, and scientists speak, at least informally, of the fact of evolution. All reputable biologists go on to agree that natural selection is one of its most important driving forces, although --as some biologists insist more than others--not the only one. Even if it is not the only one, I have yet to meet a serious biologist who can point to an alternative to natural selection as a driving force of adaptive evolution--evolution towards positive improvement.\\" (p. 18)<br /><br />What Dawkins calls the \\"fact of evolution\\" is also called common descent. Adaptation and common descent are two separate phenomena. Adaptation refers to the ancient observation that species are adapted to their environment, and common descent refers to the 20th century discovery that all species evolved from a single prokaryote over a period of 3.5 billion years. I consider it significant that Dawkins does not refer to the complexity of life in the above summary. There was not much of an increase in complexity when natural selection caused polar bears to acquire only hair without pigment, but complexity increased considerably when fish evolved into mammals. By using the adjective \\"adaptive\\" and the phrase \\"positive improvement\\" and by not mentioning complexity, Dawkins is saying that natural selection explains adaptation only and does not explain common descent.<br /><br />The reason natural selection can't explain common descent is that a living organism is presumably a collection of molecules and atoms and subject to the second law of thermodynamics. According to this law, there is a tendency for molecular systems to go towards a state of greater disorder and less complexity. In the free expansion of a gas, for example, there is a decrease in complexity because there is less knowledge about the location of each gas molecule. In a protein, there is a high degree of complexity because the location of every amino acid in the protein is known exactly. This limitation on natural selection is explained in a peer-reviewed paper titled, \\"Conflict between the idea of natural selection and the idea of uniqueness of the gene does not seem to be near a solution yet\\" (Nature, Vol. 224, 1969, p. 342). This paper calculates the small probability of a protein composed of three hundred amino acids evolving by random chance. I'm unaware of any biology textbook, peer-reviewed paper, or scholarly work that states natural selection explains the increase in the complexity of organisms. With the exception of advocates of intelligent design, I also don't know of any biologists that attempt to draw the line between adaptation and common descent.<br /><br />In this passage, Dawkins gives a different account of natural selection. The word adaptive is dropped and an explanation for the complexity of life is given:<br /><br />\\"When creationists say, as they frequently do, that the theory of evolution contradicts the Second Law of Thermodynamics, they are telling us no more than that they don't understand the Second Law (we already knew that they don't understand evolution). There is no contraction, because of the sun!<br /><br />\\"...energy from the sun powers life, to coax and stretch the laws of physics and chemistry to evolve prodigious feats of complexity, diversity , beauty, and an uncanny illusion of statistical improbability and deliberate design...Natural selection is an improbability pump: a process that generates the statistically improbable. It systematically seizes theminority of random changes that have what it takes to survive, and accumulates them, step by tiny step over unimaginable timescales, until evolution eventually climbs mountains of improbability and diversity, peaks whose height and range seem to know no limit, the metaphorical mountain that I have called `Mount Improbable'...Life evolves greater complexity only because natural selection drives it locally away from the statistically probable towards the improbable.\\" (p. 415)<br /><br />According to the Bible, especially John 1:1-2 (\\"In the beginning was the Word: the Word was with God\\"), God created the universe ex nihilo. Hence, the lack of a scientific understanding of the Big Bang, and to a lesser extent, the origin of life and evolution is one of the reasons to believe in the Bible and the Koran. Dawkins is aware of this reasoning and it probably causes the author of The God Delusion to overstate the scientific understanding of these three phenomena. In the above quote, he is saying natural selection explains common descent. Dawkins's analysis reveals a lack of understanding of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. When a plant grows, its complexity increases because the complexity of the sun decreases, not its energy.<br /><br />You can see this same mind-set at work in his discussion of J. B. S. Haldane's answer to a question posed at a public lecture:<br /><br />\\"Evolution skeptic: Professor Haldane, even given the billions of years that you say were available for evolution, I simply cannot believe it is possible to go from a single cell to a complicated human body, with its trillions of cells organized into bones and muscles and nerves, a heart that pumps without ceasing for decades, miles and miles of blood vessels and kidney tubules, and a brain capable of thinking and talking and feeling.<br /><br />\\"JBS: But madam, you did it yourself. And it only took you nine months.\\" (p. 211)<br /><br />\\"J. B. S. Haldane spoke simple truth to his skeptical questioner, but he would not have denied that there is mystery, verging on the miraculous (but never quite getting there) in the very fact that a single cell gives rise to a human body in all its complexity.\\" (p. 217)<br /><br />Notice that Dawkins associates lack of scientific knowledge (\\"mystery\\") with a sign from God (\\"miraculous\\"). Also notice he doesn't realize that Haldane's answer was not an answer at all but gave another reason to be an \\"evolution skeptic.\\" Haldane in effect pointed out another thing that had to evolve besides \\"miles of blood vessels,\\" i.e., the development of a grown human from the initial fertilized egg over a period of 15 to 20 years. Human brains, for example, grow bigger after birth so the fetus can get through a pelvis narrow enough for upright walking. According to the theory of natural selection, I suppose, babies with small heads had a better chance of surviving than babies with big heads because their mothers were more likely to survive their birth.<br /><br />The following is another example of Dawkins's scientism because he must be thinking of the Big Bang and must be thinking the Big Bang solves something:<br /><br />\\"...Darwin went on to say, `It is mere rubbish, thinking at present of the origin of life; one might as well think of the origin of matter.' He didn't rule out the possibility that the problem would eventually be solved (indeed, the problem of the origin of matter largely has been solved)...\\" (p. 417, emphasis added)<br /><br />Another example of wishful thinking is his discussion of the origin of life:<br /><br />\\"We have no evidence about what the first step in making life was, but we do know the kind of step it must have been. It must have been whatever it took to get natural selection started. Before the first step, the sorts of improvement that only natural selection can achieve were impossible. And that means the key step was the arising, but some process as yet unknown, of a self-replicating entity.\\" (p. 419)<br /><br />Dawkins repeatedly refers to creationist as history-deniers, but he denies a lot of history himself:<br /><br />\\"The popular canard about Hitler being inspired by Darwin comes partly from the fact that both Hitler and Darwin were impressed by something that everybody has known for centuries: you can breed animals for desired qualities...Don't be mislead by the ill-chosen and unfortunate subtitle of Darwin's great book: The preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.\\" (p. 62)<br /><br />Darwin said humans are superior to animals, not because humans have spiritual souls, but because humans are more intelligent and civilized. The idea that humans don't have souls means humans are not equal under God. This negation of human equality leads to the idea that some individuals are more useful to humanity than other individuals and that some human races are more evolved than other human races. The following quote justifies calling Darwin the founder of the eugenics movement:<br /><br />\\"If the various checks specified in the last two paragraphs, and perhaps others as yet unknown, do not prevent the reckless, the vicious and the otherwise inferior members of society from increasing at a quicker rate than the better class of men, the nation will retrograde, as has too often occurred in the history of the world. We must remember that progress is no invariable rule.\\" (Charles Darwin, [i]Descent of Man[/i], Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1998, p. 145)<br /><br />In the United States, 65,000 handicapped individuals were forcibly sterilized in 33 states in order to improve the human race. In Germany, over 400,000 were sterilized in similar programs. The link between Darwin and Hitler is Ernst Haeckel, who was Darwin's advocate in Germany and who said things like this repeatedly:<br /><br />\\"...the difference between the highest and the lowest humans is greater than that between the lowest humans the highest animal.\\" ([[ASIN:140397201X From Darwin to Hitler: Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics, and Racism in Germany]] Richard Weikart, , p. 105)<br /><br />Humanism is the philosophy that our purpose in life is not to serve God and hope for salvation, but to serve mankind and strive for self-realization.

0670021652|3.0|Yes, I read the reviews that state this is a very different book from EPL, yes, I read her snippet at the beginning about how she wrote this for her friends etc.  But i was still disappointed.  I think this book would have been much better if it had been done in half the space.  Sometimes I got so sick of hearing the same thing about her and Felipe over and over, that I did something I never do--skip pages!  The parts that had to do with travel are great, but the rest of it left me wondering, Is it possible for Felipe to utter a sentence that doesn't include the word 'darling'?
185984054X|5.0|Before discussing Hitchens' book and Mother Teresa I would just briefly mention that I have spent most of my own life working in hospices, hospitals, and nursing homes, and often for no money. I say this not because I think it makes me any better than the next guy, but only because I want to pre-empt at the outset one criticism that has appeared in many other reviews: \\"When you spend one day working with these poor people, then maybe you can criticize Mother Teresa.\\"  Such concerns are beside the point. The issue should not be the reviewer; it is Mother Teresa and her work.<br /><br />I've read the many negative reviews of Hitchens' book, and virtually all the reviewers suffer from at least one of two flaws:<br /><br />1. They focus on limited, insignificant parts of the book, overlooking the most devastating material. This suggests they either have not read that material or do not care about it.<br /><br />2. They attack Hitchens the man instead of what he says and the evidence he presents. This \\"shooting the messenger\\" is known as arguing \\"ad hominem\\" and accomplishes nothing beyond gratifying the reviewer's pique. (This includes an astoundingly ignorant review by William Donohue of the Catholic League, who spends so much of it attacking Hitchens' character that one wonders whether he paid any attention to what Hitchens actually wrote.)<br /><br />So in taking a closer look at what Hitchens did write, let us not be deterred by the fear of attacking an icon. Let us rather be motivated by what Mother Teresa herself claimed was her dearest concern, the compassionate care of those who are poor, those who are disabled, those who are sick or dying or in great pain.<br /><br />If these are our concerns, then the evidence Hitchens presents is damning. Much of it comes from people who worked for Mother Teresa and can be independently verified. Personal attacks on Hitchens or his religious views cannot in any way negate this evidence.<br /><br />One key witness is Susan Shields, who wrote about her experience in Free Inquiry Magazine (Vol. 18 no. 1, Winter 1997/1998). Shields was a sister in the Missionaries of Charity. She lived with them in the Bronx, Rome, and San Francisco. According to Shields, the philosophy that guided the Missionary Sisters both considered suffering a virtue and strongly discouraged attachments of any kind to the people served. The inevitable result of this combination was an indifference to human suffering. If suffering is good, and if feeling emotional responses toward the patients is bad, then any uncomfortable emotions that may arise from witnessing their suffering must be quickly switched off. This makes true compassion difficult if not impossible.<br /><br />The Missionary Sisters were not bad people. Most of them meant well. They tried their best to be obedient, and did not know that the great bulk of donations their order received remained hidden unused in Mother's bank accounts. Shields knows this because one of her assigned tasks was recording those donations. \\"We wrote receipts for checks of $50,000 and more on a regular basis,\\" she reports.<br /><br />Since poverty was also considered a virtue, little of that money could be spent either on the order or on the patients. As Shields tells us: \\"Mother was very concerned that we preserve our spirit of poverty. Spending money would destroy that poverty. She seemed obsessed with using only the simplest of means for our work. Was this in the best interests of the people we were trying to help, or were we in fact using them as a tool to advance our own `sanctity?' In Haiti, to keep the spirit of poverty, the sisters reused needles until they became blunt. Seeing the pain caused by the blunt needles, some of the volunteers offered to procure more needles, but the sisters refused.\\"<br /><br />Hitchens quotes parts of Shields' unpublished manuscript, but her article in Free Inquiry may easily be found online and is worth reading in full.<br /><br />Another eyewitness Hitchens quotes is Dr. Robin Fox, who in 1994 was editor of The Lancet and who reported his findings in that journal in an article entitled \\"Mother Theresa's Care for the Dying\\" (September 17, 1994). While noting that the residents of the home were at least well fed, Fox nevertheless observes that their medical care was inadequate. He calls it \\"haphazard,\\" refusing to permit normal diagnostic procedures like blood films because such practices \\"tend toward materialism.\\"  He concludes:<br /><br />\\"I was disturbed to learn that the formulary includes no strong analgesics. Along with the neglect of diagnosis, the lack of good analgesia marks Mother Theresa's approach as clearly separate from the hospice movement. I know which I prefer.\\"<br /><br />Hitchens points out that this state of affairs at the Home for the Dying cannot be excused by any plea of poverty. Mother Teresa had at her disposal \\"immense quantities of money and material.\\"  The home was as it was because it reflected Mother Teresa's philosophy of suffering and the poor.<br /><br />Dr. Fox's account is supplemented by the observations of Mary Loudon, a volunteer at the Home of the Dying whose testimony Hitchens obtained. In Loudon's words,<br /><br />\\"This is two rooms with fifty to sixty men in one, fifty to sixty women in another. They're dying. They're not being given a great deal of medical care. They're not being given painkillers really beyond aspirin and maybe if you're lucky some Brufen [ibuprofen] or something, for the sort of pain that goes with terminal cancer and the things they were dying of.\\"<br /><br />I have years of experience working in hospice. Cancer pain can be unimaginable, and considerable intravenous morphine infusions are often  scarcely enough to contain it. But if you have cancer in Mother Teresa's home, you'll get aspirin for your pain or maybe Advil if you're lucky.<br /><br />Loudon goes on to observe that needles were reused continually and not sterilized but only rinsed at the cold water tap - another false show of poverty at the expense of the residents' well being.<br /><br />Mother Teresa apparently considered pain sacred - as long as it happens to somebody else, and as long as that person is poor. Hitchens mentions (p. 41) a filmed interview in which Mother Teresa says with a smile what she told a patient suffering unbearable pain from terminal cancer: \\"You are suffering like Christ on the cross. So Jesus must be kissing you.\\"  The patient's response: \\"Then please tell him to stop kissing me.\\"<br /><br />It is supremely arrogant to tell someone in agony to be grateful for the blessing of pain while availing oneself of the best and most expensive hospitals in the West during one's own illnesses, as Mother Teresa did. Did Mother Teresa not wish to be kissed by Jesus too?<br /><br />Another witness Hitchens quotes is author and journalist Elgy Gillespie, who spent time at Mother Teresa's San Francisco hostel for people with AIDS. She reports that the ones who were not too sick to care were extremely depressed because they were not permitted to watch TV or have friends come over, even when they were dying. She mentions one patient in particular who was able to escape the hostel for a while, because a caring friend of Gillespie's offered to take him in. When his illness worsened and this friend could no longer care for him, he begged her not to send him back to the hostel. He was afraid that at the hostel he would be denied necessary medication, including morphine for his pain.<br /><br />How can one possibly excuse the willful denial of pain medication to people who are terminally ill, regardless of the theology behind it? How does one call somebody who does this a saint? Those who try to discredit Hitchens' book by attacking Hitchens personally are ethically irresponsible. They would also have to attack and discredit Susan Shields, Dr. Robin Fox, Mary Loudon, and Elgy Gillespie. So far to my knowledge, no one has.<br /><br />Now why on earth would anyone withhold pain medication from people in intense pain, especially if one had millions to pay for such medication? Who can really discern another person's motives? One can only observe the obvious: there is no credit for helping the poor if they are not poor, the suffering if they are not suffering, and the disabled if they are independent. Mother Teresa made a great show of helping only the poor. In an interview with Malcolm Muggeridge she stated: \\"We cannot work for the rich; neither can we accept any money for the work we do. Ours has to be a free service, and to the poor\\" (p. 60). Another quote from Mother: \\"I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people\\" (p.11).<br /><br />There you have it. Mother's theology glorifies suffering. Suffering is good. It is the kiss of Christ. The suffering of the poor helps the world. So one can be a saint only by helping the suffering poor. There is no saintliness in helping the non-suffering non-poor. So collect millions in the name of the suffering poor; just don't spend it on relieving their pain or restoring their dignity.<br /><br />Nothing illustrates this attitude better than a bizarre incident that took place in New York in 1990. The city gave two buildings it had seized for back taxes to the Missionary Sisters for one dollar apiece. The sisters planned to convert them into a homeless shelter. But there was a wrinkle. The city required that the residence be accessible to people with disabilities, and so asked that the sisters install an elevator. Mother Teresa adamantly refused. She even rejected the city's offer to pay for the elevator (never mind that she could easily have afforded to pay for it herself). So the nuns abandoned the project.<br /><br />What's so bad about an elevator? The nuns wanted the residents to experience the charity of people who would care for them in their poverty. \\"The sisters said that if anyone couldn't walk up the stairs, they'd carry them, just like they do in Calcutta,\\" said Anne Emerman, director of the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, who opposed the nuns' request for a waiver from the city's handicapped access law.<br /><br />Emerman was vilified in some quarters for her opposition to the great saint, but to the disabled community she was a hero. \\"We have different ideas here of personal dignity\\" she said. \\"Some people might not want to be carried.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, some disabled people might actually prefer to be independent and to have their independence respected. But promoting independence just doesn't have quite the same flash as service to the poor.<br /><br />(Hitchens mentions this incident in a quote from Susan Shields on pp. 45-46, but full details can be found in these two articles: Associated Press, \\"Mother Teresa Group Gives Up NY Shelter Plan over Elevators\\" [Boston Globe, September 18, 1990], and Sam Roberts, \\"Fight City Hall? Nope, Not Even Mother Teresa\\" [New York Times, September 17, 1990].)<br /><br />Now what if New York City had not offered to pay for an elevator? Could the Missionaries of Charity plead poverty as an excuse not to build it? Well they could, but it would hardly be credible. Mother Teresa ranked with the best in her ability to manipulate people's guilt to elicit funding. By all accounts she could be very persistent. In an article entitled \\"Mother Teresa: Where Are Her Millions?\\" which appeared in German's Stern magazine (September 10, 1998), Walter Wuellenweber notes several examples:<br /><br />\\"For purchase or rent of property, the sisters do not need to touch their bank accounts. `Mother always said, we don't spend for that,' remembers Sunita Kumar, one the richest women in Calcutta and supposedly Mother T's closest associate outside the order. `If Mother needed a house, she went straight to the owner, whether it was the State or a private person, and worked on him for so long that she eventually got it free.'...<br /><br />\\"Mother Teresa saw it as her God given right never to have to pay anyone for anything. Once she bought food for her nuns in London for GB £500. When she was told she'd have to pay at the till, the diminutive seemingly harmless nun showed her Balkan temper and shouted, `This is for the work of God!' She raged so loud and so long that eventually a businessman waiting in the queue paid up on her behalf.\\"<br /><br />So the question remains: If Mother Teresa was so good at raising funds and did in fact raise millions, why is there no money for clean needles in hospices? Where does the money go? As one man said after asking  Mother for help in building housing for 4,000 of Calcutta's homeless and failing even to receive a response, \\"I don't understand why you educated people in the West have made this woman into such a goddess! I went to her place three times. She did not even listen to what I had to say. Everyone on earth knows that the sisters have a lot of money. But no one knows what they do with it!\\"<br /><br />It seems no one can answer that question completely. But Wuellenweber continues:<br /><br />\\"The fortune of this famous charitable organisation is controlled from Rome, - from an account at the Vatican bank. And what happens with monies at the Vatican Bank is so secret that even God is not allowed to know about it. One thing is sure however - Mother's outlets in poor countries do not benefit from largesse of the rich countries. The official biographer of Mother Teresa, Kathryn Spink, writes, `As soon as the sisters became established in a certain country, Mother normally withdrew all financial support.' Branches in very needy countries therefore only receive start-up assistance. Most of the money remains in the Vatican Bank.\\"<br /><br />Wherever the money did end up, most of it never went to the poor Mother Teresa was supposed to be serving. In her Free Inquiry article Susan Shields states: \\"The donations rolled in and were deposited in the bank, but they had no effect on our ascetic lives and very little effect on the lives of the poor we were trying to help.\\"  Reporter Donal MacIntyre, writing in the New Statesman (London; August 22, 2005), describes conditions in Mother Teresa's orphanage that were not only squalid but sometimes even cruel:<br /><br />\\"I worked undercover for a week in Mother Teresa's flagship home for disabled boys and girls to record Mother Teresa's Legacy, a special report for Five News broadcast earlier this month. I winced at the rough handling by some of the full-time staff and Missionary sisters. I saw children with their mouths gagged open to be given medicine, their hands flaying in distress, visible testimony to the pain they were in. Tiny babies were bound with cloths at feeding time. Rough hands wrenched heads into position for feeding. Some of the children retched and coughed as rushed staff crammed food into their mouths. Boys and girls were abandoned on open toilets for up to 20 minutes at a time. Slumped, untended, some dribbling, some sleeping, they were a pathetic sight. Their treatment was an affront to their dignity, and dangerously unhygienic.<br /><br />\\"Volunteers (from Italy, Sweden, the United States and the UK) did their best to cradle and wash the children who had soiled themselves. But there were no nappies, and only cold water. Soap and disinfectant were in short supply. Workers washed down beds with dirty water and dirty cloths. Food was prepared on the floor in the corridor. A senior member of staff mixed medicine with her hands. Some did their best to give love and affection - at least some of the time. But, for the most part, the care the children received was inept, unprofessional and, in some cases, rough and dangerous. `They seem to be warehousing people rather than caring for them,' commented the former operations director of Mencap Martin Gallagher, after viewing our undercover footage.\\"<br /><br />This is the best care that millions of charity dollars could afford? No money even for soap and diapers?<br /><br />Mother Teresa's entire attitude towards money seems rather odd. Apparently it is virtuous to give, as long as the giving is to the Catholic Church (and never even reaches the poor) and regardless of how the funds given were obtained. Charles Keating, a sort of Bernie Madoff of the 80's, donated 1.25 million dollars to Mother Teresa in return for the respectability of being associated with her. When Keating was tried in 1992 Mother Teresa wrote to the court asking clemency for him. Hitchens reproduces her letter to the judge on p. 67. It it she says that Keating \\"has always been kind and generous to God's poor\\" and asks the judge \\"to do what Jesus would do.\\"<br /><br />One of the prosecutors wrote back to Mother Teresa explaining (just in case she did not know) that among those whom Keating defrauded may also be counted some of \\"the least of these\\" whom Mother claims to serve, including \\"a poor carpenter who did not speak English and had his life savings stolen by Mr. Keating's fraud\\" (p. 69). He continued: \\"No church, no charity, no organization should allow itself to be used as salve for the conscience of the criminal.\\"  He urged Mother Teresa to do the right thing: \\"Ask yourself what Jesus would do if he were given the fruits of a crime; what Jesus would do if he were in possession of money that had been stolen; what Jesus would do if he were being exploited by a thief to ease his conscience? I submit that Jesus would promptly and unhesitatingly return the stolen property to its rightful owners. You should do the same. You have been given money by Mr. Keating that he has been convicted of stealing by fraud. Do not permit him the `indulgence' he desires. Do not keep the money. Return it to those who worked for it and earned it! If you contact me I will put you in direct contact with the rightful owners of the property now in your possession.\\"<br /><br />Mother Teresa never replied.<br /><br />So what can we make of all this? It is a shame that whatever good Mother Teresa may have done has been tainted by her exploitation of the very same people she made a show of helping. Perhaps we need to choose our saints a little more carefully.<br /><br />It is easy to find superficial fault with Hitchens' book. Its title, \\"The Missionary Position,\\" is juvenile. Its citations are sloppy. And Hitchens is no expert in the Bible or theology, so sometimes he gets things wrong, as when he says (p. 29) that Jesus broke the box of costly ointment on his own feet. But Hitchens' antipathy towards religion in no way mitigates the testimony he presents from several eyewitnesses. The cynical use of the poor to promote either oneself or one's church only gives ammunition to those who already find religion loathsome.<br /><br />\\"So whenever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by others.

0385736002|4.0|For some reason that I can't pinpoint, it took me a while (past half-way) to really feel IN to this book.  One of the reasons: The author's note at the end was really helpful for framing the story-so why put it at the end?  It doesn't give away any of the plot.  I really would have liked to have read that before starting the book.  In spite of the slow start of enthusiasm, I am very much looking forward to reading the next book.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|of Neal Caffrey and Peter Burke. As another reviewer said...\\"maybe there's someone on television currently more rakish and dashing than Neal Caffrey. But, for the life of me, I'm drawing a blank.\\"<br /><br />Well, I don't think there is, and this character has the perfect blend of boyish charm, intelligence and cleverness to go along with that mischievous twinkle in his eye. Matt Bomer inhabits his character with an ease and grace which belie his youth. Tim DeKay as the ever put-upon straight man, Peter Burke, is the G-Man who, despite his best efforts, can't quite keep it under wraps that he's got a heart...which would explain his gorgeous, intelligent and even more put-upon wife, Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen), whose contributions are always on point. And then there's the quirky man's quirky, Neal's behind-the-scenes guy, Moz, perfectly played by Willie Garson.<br /><br />So, the only question becomes ... how did the USA Network round up so many clever and witty writers to completely dominate TV? They're churning them out over there as fast as Mardi Gras beads in China.<br /><br />White Collar is a welcome addition to my other USA favorites, Burn Notice and In Plain Sight. With their winning combination of intelligent plots with fascinating detail (even to those who are afflicted with always-know-the-ending-itis), quirky characters with all-too-human faults, a large dash of humor, and exquisite casting, these are the best shows to come along in years. Who knew, years ago, when that defective detective with OC disorder premiered, and I thought, \\"Well, this is certainly different,\\" that the USA network had revived and perfected the hour long Action-Dramedy? I haven't seen anything as compelling and entertaining as the USA line-up since Northern Exposure or Due South. Really my only complaint is the seasons are TOO SHORT! (Well, and a wolf would be nice, too...) But that can be forgiven, as USA budgets are probably not in line with some other networks out there. Though, if advertisers are paying attention, they soon should be.<br /><br />Keep it up USA! You are the bright spot on my TV!, if advertisers are paying attention, they soon should be.<br /><br />Keep it up USA! You are the bright spot on my TV!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie is absolutely awsome. As a parent of a child recovered from mild/moderate autism, I was absolutely glued to the movie on HBO. I will definitely watch it again. I wish it had gone on for another hour, it was so enthralling. I laughed and cried, and saw so many of the Autism traits my daughter had. I would recommend this movie for anyone as it is a wonderful story of triumph over adversity, but especially if you love, know, or work with some one with Autism.

0596522347|4.0|There has been some debate, although from minority, on the value of this book. I design corporate presentations and have to admit that there isn't enough of these books out there. It's about time someone tackled the topic. The title of this book gives the impression that it's about PPT and how to create better slides. Actually, it's because PPT is the most popular and accessible presentation application, the book is addressing \\"slideware\\" business. Presentations can be developed using film, illustrations, props, product demo, etc. However, the concepts within the book are more geared towards those presenters that address wider audiences and have more resources. Nothing wrong with that. Not everyone will be a Steve Jobs (Apple). It's a niche, and Nancy's book doesn't make any qualms about it.     Personally, I've benefited from it and Carr's as well: My slides are cleaner, simpler, and communicate better. It's not expected that all of us working in the corporate world will be given the opportunity to design \\"slides\\" that way. It has to do with the culture of the company and the settings surrounding the delivery. Delivering a technical review to a small team is different from introducing a new idea to a prospective venture capitalist. I gave it 4 stars due to the fact that I was clamoring for more of her world-class presentations to be included. Thank you Nancy. Awaiting the sequel :)
0385523904|5.0|I was completely rivited by this book!  Five stars is simply not enough - thus my review title of six stars.  The stories in the book are fascinatingly detailed and the people behind them are incredibly couragous. The author's research comprehensive, and she backs her research up with mulitiple source checking which she shares at the end of the book.  Reading this book provides more insight into this mysterious, difficult country than the average reader (like me) could gain from the daily media.  Towards the end of the book, the author says:  \\"While the persistence of North Korea is a curiousity for the rest of the world, it is a tragedy for North Koreans, even those who have managed to escape\\".  That is one of the many lessons the reader takes away, and one that cannot easily be forgotten.

I congratulate Ms. Schloot for a terrific effort and would recommend this book for all.

B002YIHO7I|2.0|One would have thought that after a ten year hiatus from recording that they (Sade) would have come back with a vengeance, but such is not the case here, sadly.  This album is (very heavily) weighed down with some really slow, sleep-inducing recordings.<br /><br />After having heard the lead title single, I would have thought that the album might have been more upbeat (in parts,) but instead, each song thumps along to a mournful drone.  Sade's voice, thankfully, has not changed a bit; it's still sexy and raspy, but gone is the exotic element in the melodies that introduced the music world to such awesome gems as \\"Hang On To Your Love,\\" \\"Smooth Operator,\\" \\"Your Love Is King,\\" \\"The Sweetest Taboo,\\" \\"Never As Good As the First Time,\\" \\"Nothing Can Come Between Us,\\" \\"Paradise\\" or \\"No Ordinary Love.\\"<br /><br />This album, much like \\"Lovers Rock,\\" doesn't exhibit any real \\"gems\\" as we were once treated to repeatedly on albums past.  Instead, it presents as one big heap of undistinguishable meloncholia.  Just make sure you overdose on coffee before listening to it.<br /><br />Here's hoping for a return to form a la \\"Diamond Life,\\" \\"Promise,\\" \\"Stronger than Pride\\" or \\"Love Deluxe\\" because \\"Lovers Rock,\\" despite its romantic title and \\"Soldier of Love\\" just don't sound like the Sade we've come to love over the past twenty-five years.

0316017922|5.0|Outliers is an amazing book that discusses different examples of success.  Non-intuitive insights are presented as a way of explaining success in terms of factors that transcend the \\"rags to riches\\" story lines that we are too often force-fed.      According to Gladwell, being successful depends on ability, opportunity, hard work, arbitrary circumstances, family history, and cultural legacy.  Working hard is obvious but not so obvious were some of the other factors.  Success is no accident as people do not rise up from nothing.  Extraordinary achievement has more to do with opportunity than it does being talented.      Outliers was a fascinating book with many eye-opening moments.  I highly recommend it for parents, teachers, and anyone who wants a deeper understanding of the factors that define success.

I like how its a short workout because if it was an hour long i doubt that I would follow through with it. I hope I can keep up with this, because I did this for 2 days then after my calf hurt and I was limping for several days. I waited until It felt better and did it again for 2 days in a row. It is not after the second day and I am feeling that pain in my calf again. I hope it will go away with conditioning and that It will not hurt bad enough to stop my progress again.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|If you want to see a movie filled with solid scientific data,good acting, truth and realism, this is not the movie. But if you want entertainment or escapism, this movie is for you. Just go watch the movie, shut off your inquisite brain, but enjoy the spectacle in front of you. Who knows, maybe by the time the movie has finished, the real world has already ended without you knowing it ! I gave it 4 stars only because the script needs a bit  tightening, and the acting is so so.

B00005O5CM|5.0|I graduated from law school recently, so seeing the Hollywood version of law school in [[ASIN:B00005O5CM Legally Blonde]] did make me gag. Law school isn't fun (neither is law practice). Despite that, I was able to laugh throughout this movie at the originality of the humor and sheer inanity of the plot twists. The fates collide to make Elle's first year at law school revolve around fashion knowledge more than habeas corpus. Reese Witherspoon holds the plot together - she's able to portray a blonde bimbo at one point, while also conveying a sense of confidence and articulateness. Her acting makes the movie believable and entertaining.
1423113497|4.0|I bought the 3-book set because the first two books in the series were being passed around by my students so much, they were getting pretty dog-eared--and (verbal) fights were breaking out about who got what book next.  (These are high school kids.)  As a teacher whose heart goes out to learning-challenged kids, I have to appreciate the fact that Percy Jackson, the protagonist, has ADHD and dyslexia--issues that only enhance his heroics, not detract from them.  The books are easy and engrossing, with plenty of sword brandishing and sarcasm, so they keep teens reading. There are, of course, mini lessons on Greek mythology throughout the books (often as the ever-valiant heroes are being attached once again by another fury or hydra or what-have-you), so I appreciate that, too.<br /><br />I stop just short of a five-star rating here as I have read as far as Book Four and I would have liked to see Riordan be a bit more creative with his plot devices.  The fourth book opens with Percy beginning school at yet another new school and this time it's the cheerleaders who are not what they seem to be, but that's only slightly different from how the other books open.  Some situations have been used so repeatedly that I've begun to predict how our heroes will be backed into a corner with no way out this time--and who will save them.<br /><br />Overall, though, I think this is a great series for young folks.

1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin does a great job of describing the changing world of work and encourages you to become what he calls a linchpin: Someone who can invent, connect, create and make things happen. Someone who creates order out of chaos. Someone who can work without a map, or rather create a new map - for yourself and others in your organization.<br /><br />The author encourages you to bring your passion to your job, to overcome your fears and take risks, to lead. That's what the world needs now (more than ever), he argues, and it is therefore also the best personal strategy for success.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and engaging, written in a very bloggy style. Also, the author creates of a whole set of terminology around his ideas (which are many and powerful). Packaging them in this way makes them easier to grasp, more compelling, and lends them well to further thought/discussion.<br /><br />I found the book to be very timely and inspiring and highly recommend it.

0812973992|5.0|Looking to heal the great trauma and loss associated with September 11th, 2001 as well as weather the massive survivor guilt, Colum McCann crafts this wonderful fictional tale of rich, disparate and seemingly disconnected characters.  Gradually the characters lives move together and become interrelated.  This book, for me, was a powerful and transformative experience.  I came to love and appreciate all of the characters but  my favorite was definitely Gloria.  Not surprising, since I believe that relationships and simple acts of love and kindness can save and transform the world.  I highly recommend this wonderful book, but suggest reading and savoring it slowly.
0451228731|5.0|Daniel Suarez, in this book and the sequel FreedomTM, is one of the rare authors who has made me rethink how I live my life. I am amazed at his deft interweaving of technology, gaming culture, economic and social theory, and philosophy.   This duo is more than the simple \\"Terminator on a cron job\\" thriller I was expecting. And it gets *more* interesting as it goes, with the second book even more thought-provoking than the first. Warning - the first novel just stops, and you really want to have the second in hand to finish the story. Daniel Suarez writes thought-provoking thrillers in the spirit of  Cory Doctorow and Neal Stephenson, with a dash of Michael Pollan.    Open Source and FLOSS advocates, and techno freedom-lovers everywhere, this is a book for us.

Changing a character's name (and the names of his two best friends), the name of his school, making muggles mortals and selling rehashed stories as original ideas does not make you an author, Mr Riordan.

Save your money and just re-read the Harry Potter books since they're the same exact stories.

B0031OCY2E|2.0|THE INFORMANT! has an exclamation point after the title for a good reason - it suggests that even the writers and actors as well as the usually superb Steven Soderbergh had a tough time figuring out how to make this story into an entertaining while  quite implausible movie.  Though based on a true story the movie is basically a running monologue by the hyperkinetic Matt Damon in a role that suits him not at all.  At moments it seems like an outrageous comedy, then  at others it appears as yet another appalling expos&eacute; of how big business and big politics intertwine to the detriment of our environment and moral deterioration.  No one seems to know how to treat this piece, and maybe that is just as well.  Keep the exclamation point after the title - that sort of tells it all.  Side step this film if you are a fan of Soderbergh or Matt Damon.  Grady Harp, February 10
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House is a book that I would rank in the top 10% of all books I have ever read.  I found it to be difficult to put down at times and at other times I had to set it aside because what was transpiring was so painful.  I fell in love with the characters, absolutely amazing! You can feel their love and emotions, so deeply touching. I especially loved Lavina and Mama Mae.  Mama Mae was completely selfless, opening up her heart and home to this very broken white girl who was an indentured servant. Something that I appreciated was the way the author didn't go into graphic detail of the especially horrible events. She didn't need to, it was easy to fill in the blanks.  I am a little troubled by the author's comments at the end of the book in which she gives credit basically to the spirits of these two women for telling her the story...I'd rather not know that! I can't stop thinking about this novel and I am sure it will be one of the rare few that I read a second time. Bravo!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|DEPARTURES (aka OKURIBITO) is an experience film, one of those graceful creations of cinema that finds the balance between comedy and drama, sensitive and sentimental, and is embellished by a wondrous musical score and glowing cinematography.  Running time is in excess of two hours, but likely most viewers would elect to rewind and watch it again, so touching and vital is this story.<br /><br />Daigo Kobayashi (the enormously gifted Masahiro Motoki) was raised by his mother when his father for some reason left his family when Daigo was only six years old: his last memory of his father is a quiet scene by the ocean when the child and the father exchange found rocks.  Daigo was encouraged by his parents to learn to play the cello so that he could amount to something special as a man.  Things happen: Daigo goes off to study cello, his mother dies and he doesn't attend the funeral, he marries Mike (Ryoko Hirosue), and spends all their money on a prime cello to gain admission to the major orchestra in the city.  The orchestra plays to near empty houses and is finally disbanded.  Daigo is without an income, sells his prize cello, and with Mika's blessing, returns to his hometown to live in the home of his childhood. He answers an ad for work, an ad that uses the word 'Departures' making Daigo think this is a travel agency. When Daigo 'interviews' with the owner (Tsutomu Yamazaki) he discovers that the job in one called 'encoffinment' (a Japanese ceremonial procedure of preparing, dressing & praying for the corpse before putting them in the coffin). At first repulsed by the job, Daigo gradually discovers the importance of paying final respects to the dead and preparing them for the life ahead, and his experiences with the new found beauty of encoffinment ties in with memories of his family, recalls his estrangement from his father, and reunites him with old dear friends who run a bath house, etc.  Mika is spared the truth about her husband's new job, and when she discovers the truth, Mika leaves Daigo who by now is enchanted with his position.<br /><br />Many experiences follow as Daigo encoffins all manner of people: there are some ugly scenes and some very humorous scenes depicting the variety of 'calls' Daigo gets.  How the story winds down is not necessarily difficult to discern, but the manner in which the film ends is a work of great simplicity and beauty.  Daigo's dealing with departures allows him to find his own arrivals.<br /><br />Writer Kundo Takita and director Yôjirô Takita well deserve all the awards lavished on this perfect little film.  But much of the success of this story about another way to view death is the astonishingly multifaceted performance by Masahiro Motoki, a beautiful man and an equally beautiful actor.  This is a film to watch repeatedly and definitely one to add to the personal library of DVDs.  Grady Harp, February 10th, Mika leaves Daigo who by now is enchanted with his position.

The singing and dancing reminds you of actually sitting in the theatre but is on screen being portrayed as a movie instead.<br />Even though one of the characters does die in the play, it shows how much this group of friends really stuck together.<br />The beginning starts a pretty slow build up however watching the middle and especially the ending of this play makes it all worth it. I had to watch it twice because it was really a sensitive movie and a very good one I might add.

B002X9W50E|5.0|I have recently rediscovered all of my old Bowie CDs. The reason for this was this wonderful live cd. While some would argue that past live albums such as Stages or David Live are classics I would rank this one as his best. While he is nearing the end of what can only be classified as a hall of fame career and his voice may be a bit weaker than in earlier years, he still has it. This CD is packed with all of his greatest songs, done in an intimate way both with the listener and the fans. It makes me wish he had released other live albums over the years. If you love Bowie this is a must have. If you are new to Bowie buy this album first. It will allow you to see the progression of him as an artist through the years.
014062029X|5.0|The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.<br /><br />Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.<br /><br />Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions:  that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the eventsarise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.<br /><br />There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering:  the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.<br /><br />But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.<br /><br />This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.<br /><br />Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.<br /><br />I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere.

About page 20 I was thinking I'd seen this story before.  At page 40 I was dead certain.    A quick check of old twilight Zone episodes revealed a story called, \\"Number 12 Looks Just Like You.\\"  In the story, which can be seen on Youtube, young adults undergo, you guessed it, mandatory surgery to make them beautiful.  A scene between the protagonist and her mother is recast in the book as a scene between the two main female characters.    Issues of plagiarism and originality aside, the story reads well and the characters are engaging.  My daughter says she like the story and I, as a parent, applaud the moral sub-text...
B000002HRE|3.0|Reload by Metallica is just an OK album, in my opinion. Not bad, not great, just OK. There are some recognizable radio staples from 1997 - Fuel, The Memory Remains, and The Unforgiven II. This album, like the previous album Load and even the Black Album, is a perfect example of Metallica \\"selling out\\" and becoming too commercialized. And mellowing out a lot. I remember watching the 1997 American Music Awards and Metallica performed the song King Nothing from Load and to me it seemed somewhat \\"corporate\\" and not the raw Metallica from their early years. At the same time, Reload is an example of the band maturing and experimenting and there's really nothing wrong with that. But a lot of times bands will experiment and get too far away from the material that made them famous. It ends up disappointing their longtime fans who want to see the band go back to its roots. Some bands listen to their fans and learn their lessons and deliver the goods.<br /><br />If you're just getting into Metallica, start with either Ride The Lightning, ...And Justice For All, Master Of Puppets, or Kill 'Em All. Those are the REAL and RAW Metallica albums before they \\"sold out\\".

6305176299|4.0|Veteran cinematographer Jan de Bont, whose credits included Die Hard (1988), Jewel of the Nile (1986), and Basic Instinct (1992), makes his directorial debut in Speed (1994), one of those pure action films, where if you just enjoy the ride, and don't bother to question its many logical fallacies, you should have a fun and entertaining time.  De Bont, delivers a slick looking film, with some well executed and edgy action sequences.  Star Keanu Reeves', bold determination, and physical skills, serve him very well here.<br /><br />Greed and revenge, drive ex-cop and demolition expert, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), after his scheme to extort money is foiled by LA police officers Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels).  Believed dead, Payne shocks Traven with the news that he has wired a bus with explosives that will detonate, if its speed dips below 50 mph.  Jack jumps aboard Bus 2525, looking to save lives, but when the driver is accidentally shot, passenger Annie Potter (Sandra Bullock), takes his place behind the wheel.  The action moves at a brisk pace, as the bus races through the streets of LA, leaving wreckage in its wake.  Replacing Annie, is apparently never a consideration, and the bus amazingly winds up alone, on an unused section of freeway.  After completing an impossible jump, the bus heads for LAX, where it can safely cruise and maintain the required speed.<br /><br />The excitement continues, as Jack gets on a dolly, and slides below the bus to try and disarm the bomb, nearly losing the skin off his back.  Meanwhile, Temple is hot on Payne's trail, but unfortunately gets too close.  With fuel running low, the police mount a rescue mission that succeeds in freeing the hostages.  They spring a trap to try and catch Payne, but he strikes first, grabbing Annie as a hostage, dragging her aboard a subway train, for yet another dangerous ride.<br /><br />Speed delivers thrills, but is too squeaky clean to be taken seriously, with lighted elevator shafts constructed like nothing on this planet, buses with pristine undersides, spotless subway cars, and immaculate subway tunnels.  Blood, dirt, darkness, grease, garbage, and graffiti, almost seem not to belong in this reality.<br /><br />Playing a crazed criminal is familiar territory for Dennis Hopper, and he does a fine job of pushing Jack's buttons, without quite losing control until the very end.  Sandra Bullock was relatively new, but well suited to the role of a sharp tongued smart mouth, with a heart of gold.  The 'opposites attract' formula seems to apply to Jack and Annie, but her observation that 'relationships that start under intense circumstances . . . never last', foreshadows future events.  Speed gave Bullock's career a major boost, and she would team again with Jan de Bont, for the sequel Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997), however Reeves would not participate.<br /><br />It is not too hard to look past its faults, and accept Speed for the fun ride it is intended to be.  The film does not deviate from a course of straight ahead action, and Reeves and Bullock make a fairly good pair.  Dennis Hopper, adds a nice bit of madness to the mix, making for some solidly entertaining fun.  Billy Idol's end credit number 'Speed', like Ratt's 'Nobody Rides For Free' in Point Break (1991), finishes another Keanu Reeves cop outing with some balls.afts constructed like nothing on this planet, buses with pristine undersides, spotless subway cars, and immaculate subway tunnels.

B001GCUER0|1.0|This review is not based on creative content but on an apparent DVD production flaw. Having bought, watched and enjoyed Mad Men season 1 from amazon.com, we ordered the season 2 discs from NetFlix. The first set that arrived wouldn't play in either of our DVD players (\\"No Disc\\" error message), so NetFlix shipped a replacement set - same result. We then ordered the season 2 discs from amazon.com - and again the discs wouldn't play. We returned them for credit (excellent service from amazon.com, as always). None of the discs had any obvious flaws or damage - they just wouldn't play. These are the ONLY discs that have ever given us this result; all other DVDs, whether commercial or recorded on our DVR, play perfectly well on both of our machines. Would be interested toi know if anyone else has encountered this phenomenon, or has any suggestions about what the problem might be.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|11pm after a 5 hour nap from an exhausintg day of work I put this movie in and expected to fall back asleep watching it. The film woke me up!! The twists and turns are enough to give you a headache but I enjoyed the complexity of it all. Amazing actress in the lead role and I was right with her along the way. It wasn't the greatest movie I've seen but sure one I'd suggest others see.

0143116738|5.0|This book has some great strengths and presents some powerful insights. The author is a wonderful speaker (watch him on youtube) and I could hear his voice as I read the book. There is a good bit of humor in that book that stresses the need for all of us to find our personal element.<br /><br />The book effectively presents the idea that helping children find their element will improve education. Sir Robinson reached me when he started talking about the notion of Tribe; the idea that we can learn about our element by finding our fit in the world. Who do we relate with? Who inspires us? Where do we feel at home? When we are open to learning about ourselves through our relationships and groups, we have an easier time finding our element.<br /><br />The book contains a great number of stories of people (some celebrities) who found their element and pursued it to great success. I loved the chapters on the diversity of intelligence, the power of imagination, and the advice to stay committed to our won capabilities. Sir Robinson reminds us to listen to our own inner calling and to not be dissuaded by the group.  All in all I found this book to be very inspirational and enlightening. Great information backed by research and delivered with a sense of humor. I recommend it to anyone as a good read, as bit of encouragement about personal path, and for a new view on education and learning.<br /><br />Elisa Robyn, author of Pirate Wisdom.
B00389XW6Y|5.0|Chuck is not only critically acclaimed, it is very entertaining! It is my favorite show currently on and one of my favorites ever. I find that I can enjoy the funny and sweet scenes repeatedly.<br /><br />I own seasons 1 and 2 in standard definition and have bought season 3 in HD On Demand. All of them look good! HD is somewhat better.<br /><br />I like it enough that I own it both On Demand and the DVDs for seasons 1 and 2. Sometimes I'll watch a Chuck episode at my computer while I'm waiting for it to finish some number crunching. The Unbox works well.<br /><br />I also like to watch it from DVD when exercising on my elliptical.<br /><br />Personally, I'm rooting for Chuck and Sarah to get together.<br /><br />Right after I wrote this positive review, the wheels seemed to come off the show. The last episode wasn't funny or sweet!

B000PC6A3E|5.0|Terrific introduction to the Dark Knight legend. This movie and its sequel assured that Mr Chris Nolan did the best job ever with the caped crusader movies. I already own it in DVD but had to buy the BD version. Specially with a less than $10 price, it is a MUST buy.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|HOMM 3 - terrific game. Hours and hours of fun and definite replayability. Heroes 4 - not so good, actually terrible. For the price, can't complain! Just heroes 3 alone made the game a worthwhile buy. Although as mentioned, does crash periodically on 64 Bit Win 7. Not so much that it becomes actually irritating but has happened a handful of times.
B002XMGGK6|1.0|The only thing worse than the writing in this gory vigilante thriller were the gigantic holes in the plot.  The main character (played by Gerard Butler) was completely inconsistent and Jamie Fox's character was flimsy and unlikable.  The movie began and ended in the first fifteen minutes and the remaining hour was painfully difficult to sit through.  If you like an intellectual thriller this is NOT it.
B001QWBM62|5.0|My target application was for live recording of piano, voice and guitar. Also I wanted to use the device to help with practice with the variable tempo function. I have a full mixing rig and high end condensers, but I sometimes just want to record without the hassle and setup.  I also purchased the Tascam DR-100 which is the main competing model to the H4n.   I tested both for voice, piano and guitar having them record the same performance simultaneously positioned just adjacent to one another.  I had my family then listen through speakers and headphones in a blinded test.     There are pros and cons with both recorders.     *LIVE Recording Built-in Microphones:  The H4n is the clear winner; my completely untechnical family picked the H5n recordings every time-  the soundfield plus the high quality mics make for hauntingly good recordings, vocals sounded incredible;  the Tascam seems to have very low gain and a drier sound- competent, but without the rich sound of the Zoom.    *LIVE recording acoustic electric guitar:  H4n is clear winner, you can combine the built in mics with direct input from the guitar pickup for a 4 track recording, or use the mics for vocal while plugging the guitar (or 2 guitars, or guitar/bass) directly into the zoom.  The Tascam is just not good for soft acoustic recording.  *LIVE recording external mics:  The Zoom seems to have more gain in the mic amps-  both can work well for this, but I prefer the Zoom for the higher gain and possibility of 4channel recording.   If you are using external mics, you'll probably use a mixing board anyway, but if you are not, then the better mic gain comes in handy.   *DIRECT recording through line in:   The Tascam DR-100 has a slight edge here, I recorded high resolution audio from SA-CD or DVD-audio, the Tascam is slightly more faithful to the source but both sounded very very good. Noise was not an issue with either.  *TEMPO SHIFT:  Very useful practice tool, allows slowing down or speeding up recordingswithout changing pitch:  Both can slow the recording down by 50%; both are usable but the sound of the Tascam DR-100 is somewhat better when slowed down, but both are compromised.  The Zoom does have a greater range of adjustment for increased tempo, an additional 40% I believe.  FORM Factor/Battery life:  The Tascam is a little wider and boxier and just doesn't work as well to hold in the hand.     The battery life for both is excellent, but the Zoom definitely uses less power and includes the AC adapter. The Tascam includes a remote control, the zoom remote is about $30.  The plastic hard case with the zoom is very usable.  CONCLUSION  Well those were the important issues for me.  The live recordings were just too nice from the Zoom for me to pick the Tascam, though I preferred the Tascam menu system and appearance, and its much simpler file handling/naming.   If I were buying one just as a portable 2 track tape deck replacement, I'd get the Tascam.  For amazing live recording with built in mics, I pick the H4n.
B000YDE46Y|5.0|Very good looking boot,so nice I wear them indoors to keep them looking new! They feel broken in and look absolutely superb with jeans or chinos.  I am so glad I finally found these particular Earthkeepers and am a proud owner of a pair.  They are oversized like the reviews I had read. I strongly recommend ordering a half size   smaller, I wear a size 11 and ordered a size 10 1/2 and I wear a thick sock with them along with a DR Scholl's Air Pillow insole I added.  They feel good so I might suggest even ordering one size smaller than normal size because they most definetely are oversized!! Thank you Amazon for helping me get these much wanted boots!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I know that Lots of Dedicated Fans like myself have reviewed this great Documentary of MJ, but I just wanted to give my input to a special man, the one and only King-Of-Pop!!!    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD to fans of MJ (even the casual MJ listener/fan would dig this). Since age six (kindergarten), I was hooked to a man who brought TALENT AND INNOVATION to \\"new heights.\\" As a kid, Michael was nothing but overwhelming to a six year old (with his dance moves, cool outfits/sunglasses, and his beautiful vocals-WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). This music documentary shows exactly how much of a PERFECTIONIST MJ was and how one was to break (many people's)records. This movie was so informative that people like myself have only seen finished products of MJ's work such as audio tapes/records (back then prior to CDs), music videos, and live concerts. In other words, seeing behind the scenes footage at how he produced such GREAT work caught my attention.    You will not be disappointed with this movie, IT ROCKS!!! RIP to the BEST   Performer of ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001PJRAUS|4.0|The key to enjoying this film is coming to it with an open mind, completely suspending disbelief, and enjoying the ride.  It is Jane Austen, all mucked up in a delightful mess, and if you need everything put back in order, then quickly review the 2005 version with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth or the 1996 version with Colin Firth as Darcy after you watch this one.  What works about this movie:  the alternate universe, the suspense of whether Amanda will make things \\"right\\" in the end, the new spin on a few characters who do not turn out to be the same as they are in the book, the surprise ending, and the great casting.  I also loved the view of the flip side, seeing Elizabeth Bennett (and eventually Darcy) in the 21st century.  What didn't work:  Amanda should have seemed like an alien life form to the Bennetts, and yet no one seemed to really notice she was stranger than someone simply from town (and it would have made for some interesting moments).   If you are a stalwart P&P fan who cannot bear seeing the characters behave out of character, you may want to skip this one; otherwise, pull up a seat and enjoy the fun.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I would like to re-iterate that this product IS NOT A VACCUUM!!    The first \\"electric sweeper\\" I owned was the Swiffer Vac, and I HATED it! It didn't suck up anything... just moved it around. This product, however, is awesome! The first time I used it, I cleaned my whole kitchen floor and hall (both hardwood), and then ran it over my carpet stairs. I must say, using the sweeper to clean my stairs in about 2 minutes is WAY better than lugging my huge vacuum up the stairs for 30 minutes!! I bought the Sweeper at a local craft store for $20 on sale, and it's the best $20 I ever spent! Can't say I'd spend $40 though... I agree with the previous review that $29 or $19 is a much better price.

0393316041|5.0|Subtitled \\"Adventures of a Curious Character\\", this memoir by physicist Richard Feynman plays up both aspects of \\"curious\\".<br /><br />As we follow Feynman's antics from MIT to Princeton to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos to his adventures in Brazil, it's easy to see how Feynman's peers might have had the impression he was a bit odd. And yet the driving force in all of Feynman's activities was an unquenchable curiosity about the world around him and about the people he encountered.<br /><br />Feynman isn't the typical image that comes to mind when one thinks of scientists. Scientists who are \\"typical\\" don't learn to play the bongos and end up marching in Samba bands during Carnivale in Rio de Janeiro. Nor do they become established artists holding gallery shows to exhibit their drawings, or get reputations a major players in Las Vegas. And they certainly don't spend their time learning safe-cracking or investigating out-of-body experiences in isolation tanks. Feynman did all of those things while he was making major contributions to the field of particle physics.<br /><br />Feynman makes an effort at humility in places, but can't help reporting his exploits with a certain amusing swagger. He clearly enjoyed a life of being a royal pain-in-the-rear to many of the people he worked with, government officials especially. His efforts to be \\"helpful\\" were not always seen as such, especially his foray into safecracking at Los Alamos during and after the Second World War.<br /><br />Feynman discusses a whole range of fascinating topics in this book, spending relatively little time on physics and instead on concentrating on his many other interests, his interpersonal relationships (he was married three times, and also wrote quite a bit about his efforts to meet women in between), and his scuffles with government and university bureaucracies. In one amusing anecdote, he agrees to give a talk for a government program only on the condition that he will not sign his name more than thirteen times in the required paperwork. When a 14th signature is required for him to receive his check, he refuses and decides that he will just not take the money, only to be told that there is no legal way for the government NOT to pay him. Feynman got great enjoyment from giving the runaround to figures of authority.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable memoir that will be worthwhile to anyone interested in the personalities behind the science, and its descriptions of the Manhattan Project are a fascinating look at the beginning of the Atomic Age. The book is very accessible to non-scientists and makes for an entertaining read regardless of interest in or understanding of physics.uired paperwork.

1400064287|5.0|CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN were present as well as front page coverage in USA Today, The Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post's Style section not to mention the butt of several jokes on late night TV.<br /><br />Subject: \\"A medium-sized 'butter' popcorn at a typical neighborhood movie theatre contains more artery-clogging fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, a Big Mac and fries for lunch, and a steak dinner with all the trimmings-combined!\\"<br /><br />This was a real-life example in using a few of the concepts discussed in \\"Made To Stick\\" by Chip Heath and Dan Heath. The Brothers Heath have taken the \\"stickiness\\" concept from \\"The Tipping Point\\" by Malcolm Gladwell and given it teeth.<br /><br />SUCCESs is spelled out:<br />Simplicity * Unexpectedness * Concreteness * Credibility * Emotional * Stories<br /><br />Many urban legends unknowingly survive based on some of these concepts. The \\"Kidney Heist\\" story that involves a friend of a friend of a friend that no one really knows. \\"Kentucky Fried Rat,\\" \\"Check Your Halloween Candy\\" or \\"Coke Rots Your Bones\\" all survive due to similar features of SUCCESs.<br /><br />The Heaths found out over time and trial that methodologies of some of those who made their ideas stick were similar. Teachers in particular were usually good in making concept stick with students even though each teacher had a unique style.<br /><br />Cataloging some of these methodologies and combing other research done on making ideas resonate lead to writing \\"Made To Stick\\" so that others could apply the template and find their own SUCCESs<br /><br />The biggest roadblock to getting your point/message across to others is The Curse of Knowledge. Take for instance a study done where there were \\"tappers\\" and \\"listeners\\" who had to communicate. \\"Tappers\\" were told what songs they had to tap out and \\"listeners\\" were to tell them what the song was they were trying to communicate.<br /><br />Most of the Tappers were shocked at how difficult it was for the Listeners to guess. Due to the fact the Tappers had the song running through their head as they tapped it out, but the Listeners did not have the luxury of being in the head of the Tappers. \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" apparently sounds a lot like \\"Happy Birthday To You\\" when tapped out on a desk by someone with their fingers.<br /><br />We've all had an idea in our head at one time or another and attempted to convey that idea to someone else, either just to share it with a friend or attempting to find funding to launch our idea. We've all seen that \\"What?\\" look on the faces of the person we're trying to convince that it's not a wacky idea and yes, it is worth funding.<br /><br />Most people think that every idea is unique and cannot be placed into a \\"template\\" to be applied to future ideas. Each of us would like to think that our concepts could not have a \\"measurable overlay\\" placed on them and categorized. Research has actually found otherwise.<br /><br />In 1992 a group of Israeli researchers found that 89% of award-wining designs could be placed into six categories/templates then applied by novices who then went on to impress judges who knew nothing of the skill level of the novices. But as the brothers state: \\"Regardless of your level of 'natural creativity,' we will show you how a little focused effort can make almost any idea stickier, and a sticky ideas is an ideas that is more likely to make a difference.\\"<br /><br />I'll leave you with another story, a true one that uses a few of the principles outlined in the book to make a concept stick. This concept was that of prejudice.<br /><br />Jane Elliott, of Riceville, Iowa was trying to think of a way to explain to her class of third-graders why someone would want to hate someone enough to kill them. This was in the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968.<br /><br />Third graders had no concept of this level of disdain for another, until Jane told them they were different.<br /><br />Brown-eyed children were told they were superior to blue-eyed children. Blue-eyed children were made to wear a collar so that their superior brown-eyed classmates could identify them across the playground and continue to ignore or taunt them.<br /><br />The brown-eyed children were quite viscous and the blue-eyed kids even began performing poorly on projects they'd previously done well on.<br /><br />A day later Jane made a shocking announcement. \\"I was wrong children, the blue-eyed among you are actually superior.\\" and at that moment, the children exchanged places not only physically, but emotionally as well. Once the collars and the disdain were switched, so was the prejudice.<br /><br />Years later when the students were reunited they stated that was one of the most profound messages they'd ever learned and at that young age it was ingrained that differences can be mistaken and can generate unnecessary levels of hate.<br /><br />Please check out \\"Made to Stick\\" as well as the recently released \\"Switch\\" by Chip and Dan Heath.

B001FB55H6|5.0|Based on the great graphic novel by Alan Moore. It is set in an alternate reality in 1985, where Nixon has been reelected for a 3rd term, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. are on the brink of nuclear war, and masked vigilantes are outlawed. The movie opens with the murder of one of those vigilantes and what appears as a plot to kill old superheroes turns out to be so much more. This movie is a great mystery, action, thriller disguised as a comic book movie. The story challenges you to think about society, liberalism, violence and morality as you ponder the possibilities of \\"what if superheroes existed?\\" If so, what would they be like and how would they act with all that power. The R rating is well deserved and young kids shouldn't be watching this. A great movie that makes you say \\"who watches the watchers?\\"<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Amazing picture and ear popping sound. All the spec features are ported over with some BD exclusives. FINAL VERDICT: DEFINITELY UPGRADE! A MUST OWN!

B0012RCMH4|5.0|Despite their legendary status within the extreme metal world, Hellhammer music has always seemed hard to find.  Already a Celtic Frost fan in 1986, I remember looking in vain for Apocalyptic Raids, a difficult quest before the era of Amazon.com and downloading.  I finally found it, but it was frustrating to know that there was still a plethora of Hellhammer material that I never thought I would hear.  Demon Entrails, a remastered collection of the band's demos, has made it worth the wait.    Disc 1 is their \\"Satanic Rites\\" demo and is outstanding.  The music sounds like a raw and faster version of Celtic Frost and it is quite unique and breathtaking.  Punk, black metal, death metal, doom metal, and proto-thrash are all apt descriptions and the record is filled with great riffs and abrupt tempo changes.  Every single track is excellent but my favorites are \\"Messiah\\", \\"The Third Of The Storms\\", Euronymos\\", and \\"Crucifixion\\".  Later versions of \\"Messiah\\", \\"The Third Of The Storms\\", \\"Triumph Of Death\\", and \\"Revelations Of Doom\\" appear on Apocalyptic Raids as well but the versions here are faster and more aggressive, the drumming in particular is brought out more loudly and clearly in the mix.  It is too bad that Tom G. Warrior did not include a remastering of Apocalyptic Raids on this disc, that would have made the collection complete.    Disc 2 includes the earlier \\"Death Fiend\\" and \\"Triumph Of Death\\" demos and is not as good as disc 1 but still quite fascinating.  Songs are short, often 2 or 3 minutes, and include primitive versions of \\"Maniac\\", \\"Triumph Of Death\\", \\"Reaper\\", and \\"Cruxifixion\\".  Audio quality is relatively poor, the songs are not well constructed, and Tom G. Warrior had not yet developed his trademark vocal style.  However, his gift for writing riffs is already apparent and it is amazing to realize how far the group had progressed when Morbid Tales was released just one year later.      Demon Entrails is a must have for every Celtic Frost fan and anyone who enjoyed Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion.  The music obviously has tremendous historical significance but disc 1 in particular is an excellent collection of songs that still sound heavy and timeless to this day.

B001TD1XWG|3.0|Lil Wayne's 'Rebirth' certainly won't garner any Grammy nominations but I appreciate the album because Wayne took a huge chance in making and releasing it. The other reviews on this album prove that Wayne was definitely not selling out to sell a lot of records. He wanted to experiment knowing that he would probably upset and turn off many of his fans in the rap world. I don't mind the album. 'Prom Queen' is Wayne's best attempt at rock throughout the whole album and 'Drop The World' is a better than average rap song. The highlight of the album for me was 'On Fire,' a Cool and Dre produced track that has all the elements of a club hit. I would suggest buying this album because it will be historical...by the sounds of the reviews it will probably be the only rock album Lil Wayne ever produces and releases.

B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Jeff Lindsay isn't the first author to try and allow the bad guy to be the hero, but like his predecessors, you have to admire his boldness. While the Showtime series' first season attempts to keep Dexter as the hero by not allowing you to focus soley on him, but on the complex maze of relationships in his life, Lindsay makes no such attempt. In fact, it is this distinction that I find the most fascinating, and certainly remarkable; the fact that Dexter seems even more loveable in his more exposed and vulnerable state. Shocking, really, and it almost makes me feel ashamed.<br /><br />Dexter, of course, does not fit the typical perception of a \\"serial killer\\", as you might expect. Linsday allows his readers the freedom to let Dexter be our vicarious vigilante. Dexter's noble mission is to clean up society by being the instrument of justice to those who have escaped the justice of our legal system. He does it by killing and dismembering them, of course, but he only will kill murderers, and preferably those who have killed innocent children or women. Hence, since child killers who aren't brought to justice are perhaps the lowest dreggs of society, anyone who cleans that up has to be a good guy, right?<br /><br />I've been thinking about this whole Dexter thing for some time, and something odd occurred to me. Dexter's basic MO (vigalante killer) isn't exactly new. Ever heard of the Punisher? If you discount their methods, the Punisher's glaring antisocial killing tendencies would seem to make their characters quite similar. A lot of comic books like the dark hero, the hero that wants to clean the \\"scum\\" from the streets, wants to act as a vigilante, uses any means necessary, and is, at times, not above killing. Dexter fits that mold perfectly. Let's look at his comic book traits.<br /><br />1) He has an \\"alter ego.\\" You know Bruce Banner and Hulk. Well, you've got Dexter Morgan, and well, just plain old Dexter. There is the Dexter who pretends to be human, with a job as a blood spatter specialist, and you have Dexter the serial killer. Even his alter ego has a justice seeking air about it, like many super heroes.<br />2) He has a \\"secret lair.\\" This is a bit of stretch, but bear with me. Dexter has a collection of slides in his apartment. If you watch the first season of Dexter, he kept in the AC. In this book, he keeps it in the bookcase. Still, a place where he can peruse private things that other people don't know about, and it keeps his identity secret.<br />3) He has a \\"tragic history.\\" We all know from Dexter season one that Dexter's mother was killed in a shipping container along with some other people. In this book, we learn that Dexter's father was killed in it too, along with Dectective LaGuerta. Well, the first book, coming back to visit that haunting site of that tragic event is a typical comic book idea of coming full circle.<br />4) He had a \\"wise mentor.\\" Harry Morgan, cop, adoptive father, inventor of a code of conduct for Dexter Morgan. No one has shaped Dexter's life like Harry, and even if the book does less to emphasize that than the Showtime series, it is obviously a huge factor in what Dexter has become. Having the fact that Dexter's adoptive mother and adoptive father have both died is very very very typical comic book hero family history.<br />5) He has a \\"side kick.\\" Another stretch, but many comic book heroes have that faithful friend, or informant, or contact, or even spouse on which they can rely on always. Dexter's adoptive sister Deb fits this bill nicely. She is trying to make it as a cop, and needs to rely on Dexter's keen \\"intuition\\" about serial killers. But they play the family angle for all it is worth, like many comic books.<br />6) He has a \\"super power.\\" This dark passenger, or the thing that drives Dexter to kill is an extremely powerful motivator which allows Dexter to focus tremendous energy and effort into doing his vigilante thing extrordinarily well.<br />7) He has a weakness. No quoteson that one. Yeah, the dark passenger is it's own weakness, like Kryptonite, sometimes creating the need to kill so strongly that it jeopardizes Dexter's safety.<br />8) He serves some sort of justice. Sure, Dexter kills because he likes it, but he will only kill those who \\"deserve it\\" based on a very strict set of rules. These rules are based on the idea of justice.<br />9) He holds to a set of morals. Well, who doesn't, but most super heroes have a code of conduct that sets them apart from folks who don't. Dexter has a code of conduct that goes beyond who he kills.<br /><br />What am I saying by all this? I realize that these points don't necessarily mean anything. You could make these statements about a lot of protagonists, and that doesn't degrade the characters. Even though I think Dexter would make a great comic book doesn't mean I don't think Dexter isn't good literature as is. All I am trying to say is that to me, this character seems to be somewhat inspired by comic books, and I think that is why he makes such a good hero. He has so many heroic traits.<br /><br />Yet in the end, he is a messed up sicko; a sociopath with a cause, but a sociopath nonetheless. I still feel a certain \\"dirty\\" feeling reading these books, like I've been doing something that I shouldn't have been doing. Overall, it is a good experience, but it feels like continued exposure is just not healthy. I am going to skip the reading Lindsay for a while, and perhaps return to him later.

0743201140|5.0|How many of us, well into our careers, still live with the mistaken idea that the purpose of most of our activities is to work on those weaknesses and somehow turn them into strengths? I would venture to say, the majority of us, certainly those of us who grew up with post war parents who themselves believed that success in working life and achievement can be measured by the extent to which his has been accomplished.<br />In the meantime, strengths, natural aptitudes, and in most cases the activities that enhance our well being are almost ignored, simply because so much energy goes into working on those weaknesses.<br />When put this simply, none of us should be surprised at the level of unhappiness sustained by a lot of people in their jobs.<br />So, in the face of this general discontent, Marcus Buckingham comes along to shake us up and wake us up. With the help of his, dare I say it, easy to understand theory, we can turn our professional and personal lives around.<br />What you need to do, is rediscover the strengths that are an integral part of your own personality, and by strengths he means, not only the things you excel at but that also give a sense of satisfaction and contentment. Then to increase well being it is essential to take these discoveries seriously and ensure they can be put to use to either help you choose a new career path or to improve your situation in your current job.<br />Bosses, he says, must be aware of the natural strengths of employees and work on finding ways of utilising these instead of regularly planning training programmes to help them identify weaknesses that subsequently should be worked on to transform them into strengths because that just isn't about to happen. It takes much more energy and investment to work on weaknesses than it does to enhance strengths.<br />Simple, yet it took Marcus Buckingham to point it out. A definite eye opener. I recommend it to bosses and employees alike.
B0018QQQKS|5.0|This is an excellent primer on the history of the financial mechanics that have been handed down to us today.

0307454541|3.0|As I was reading this, I was continually surprised that this was the blockbuster read that it was.  The build up was painstakingly slow at times, and I remember thinking at one point, \\"I'm 200 pages in.  When is the story going to come together?\\"  In the end I was pulled in properly, as one should be when reading a mystery, and all the build up did have a purpose of sorts.  The characters are many, and if this the first in the series, understanding the main characters as well as we do will serve us well in future books.<br /><br />However, as much as I finished this book with a satisfied feeling (and stayed up half the night for the last 100 pages or so), I would warn any readers who are familiar with the usual clip of mystery books to adjust their expectations.  This one is easily twice as long as the normal mystery I've read, and you notice.  I am curious to see if the second book is as sluggish in the beginning, or if, with most of the back story explained in this one, it can move at a faster pace.

B00192KCQ0|2.0|The last album by Metallica I can say that I liked was the Black Album.  Yes I'm one of the people that doesn't like anything they have done since.  In some ways I can appreciate what this album supposedly sets out to do which is recapture that thrash sound they have been missing for almost two decades.  The problem is that it fails on so many levels.  The obviously bad sound problems are the least of my worries, the songs are overly long and boring.  \\"...And Justice For All\\" also contained long drawn out song structures but was much more inspired.  This just comes off as an album made by a group of guys past their prime trying to act like they are in their twenties again.  It isn't the worst thing they have released, but it is so mediocre that it is a chore to sit all the way through it.

B0017HMF6W|5.0|This is probably in my top 3 for Hitchcock films for many reasons. The best that I can think if is that it is perhaps the best example of cinematic drama. For those not familiar with the plot, the story is a gripping mistaken-identity thriller: advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken as a government agent by the sinister Philip Vandamm (the ever-amazing James Mason). Vandamm is convinced Thornhill is after him, and tries to dispose of the strawman. Thornill eventually finds himself at the center of a complicated espionage plot which takes him across the country, ending with a spectacular climax atop the Mt. Rushmore.    What makes this film nearly perfect for me is the way it's paced. It's a study in economy, since we're told very little at the beginning (parallel to Thornhill's ignorance), and more is revealed slowly over time. Hitchcock and screenwriter Ernst Lehman weave a carefully crafted tale, and Hitch's fluid direction is superb as Thornhill is placed in increasingly dangerous situations. Punctuating this danger is Bernard Hermann's tense and frightful score, and the blu-ray audio mix does it justice.    The film may very well be Grant's best performance -- certainly his best in a Hitchcock film (his 3rd or 4th collaboration w/ Hitchcock, I believe.) He is his rakish, humorous self, but in N/NW he displays a certain physicality (Grant was a circus performer before becoming an actor) that makes him somewhat of an action hero. (Grant also has the greatest business suit of all time, which somehow survives all his encounters with little more than a dusty lapel.)    I appreciated how well the film was transferred to blu-ray, with very rich colors, nice deep blacks and sharp images. Some flaws are to be expected since the film is over 50 years old. My only complaint is the cardboard keep-case -- I really wish studios would dispense with \\"fancy\\" cases and just put use good old plastic snap cases instead. The supplements seem fairly well rounded, but are in standard def. I'm looking forward to hearing the commentary by Lehmann, although I wish there were more commentary tracks available, perhaps from a learned critic such as Roger Ebert. (Ebert's commentary on \\"Citizen Kane\\", for instance, is excellent.)    In all, this is an exceptional classic film that deserves to be in any collection, and now in a blu-ray format that doesn't disappoint.
B002UOMGVU|2.0|DON'T BUY THIS DISC: IT'S POINTLESS. WAIT FOR A RE-MASTERING.  What utter crap!! What is it? Can't Warners be bothered to re-master one of the great films so it really looks as good as it COULD on blu-ray?? Stick with whatever copy you have and don't let them profit with this scam! I feel ripped off and I'm PISSED. I mean, I put the disc in and in the first shot of the movie I see \\"ghosts\\" coming off the red tail lights of their car cruising down the highway. Then when they stop to open the trunk and the tail lights are washed over those three greats Liotta, De Niro, and Pesci, the detail to the shot is almost non-existent. The rest of the movie doesn't look any better, like standard video, not high definition. At first I thought I had screwed up and put in a dvd of the movie by mistake, not a blu-ray! Hell, I've seen DVDS far far better looking than this disc.   Shame shame shame on you Warners. You guys are the TRUE gangsters.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Vigilante/Revenge/Justice movies started to be big box office draws in the 70s with movies like Death Wish, in which Charles Bronson extracts street justice with his pistol after the murder of his wife and rape of his daughter. This genre of movie, having to take the law in your own hands due to the failings of the justice system, is also seen in [[ASIN:B00005JN0W Man on Fire]], [[ASIN:B00015YVDG Ransom (Special Edition)]] and the Dirty Harry movies. Law Abiding Citizen goes the James Bond route that I haven't seen in one of these movies yet. Yes, Cresey in Man of Fire (both versions) was an  ex-military/agent type, but this movie takes that to the Nth degree with lots of high tech gear. Its like a game of chess and the DA has no idea they are even playing. And as with some of these movies, the person exacting revenge/justice starts going overboard, \\"Biblical\\" was the term used. So the person you are cheering for at the beginning of the movie starts to look like the bad guy later in the movie. If you are into James Bond gadgets, like to see some justice dished out on the bad guys and hate the way criminals get slaps on the wrist and set free all the time, then you will probably like this action thriller.
B002Y5FKUE|4.0|I admit, I fully expected to hate this production.  I can't say that I like it, but it's not all that horrible.  It's simply a bad idea that no one had the good sense to squash.  During the most moving music, I found I was able to ignore the dress rehearsal conceit, for the music in this is glorious.    I thought both Ms. Dessay and Mr. Florez were much better in this performance than on their respective audio-only recordings.  Ms. Dessay sings with a remarkable combination of sincerity and technical brilliance.  Mr. Florez offers the same bright tone and and impeccable musicianship as on CD, without being hampered by the highly mannered Amina of Ceclia Bartoli.  The very best parts of this performance are when Ms. Dessay and Mr. Florez join in their two big duets in the first act.  Act II gives them both splendid opportunities to shine on their own.    Michele Petrusi's Count Rodolfo is well sung and well acted.  Jennifer Black as Lisa gets one verse of each of her arias.  I wouldn't have minded if her second act aria had been cut as she didn't appear to have the technique for it.  I couldn't hear even an attempt at the repeated trills.    If you can overlook the idiotic concept of the production, there's really a great deal to enjoy here.

The previous album \\"Chaos A.D.\\" should be enjoyable if you liked this, and may serve as an even better transition to their early thrash metal albums.
1563899426|4.0|Reprints #s 1-5 of the Fables ongoing DC/Vertigo series, plus an original illustrated prose short story.      Here's a strange murder mystery for you - who killed Rose Red, sister of Snow White?  Was it jilted suitor Bluebeard?  Her current boyfriend Jack (of Jack And The Beanstock fame?)  Or someone else?  The investigation takes place amidst all the hustle and commotion of modern-day New York city.       Those who aren't familiar with the Fables mythos might wonder what all these storybook characters are doing in New York - that's the second main angle of this collection, and this angle, rather than being wrapped up here, is only beginning.  The realms of myth and fable have fallen, one land after another conquered by a mysterious, horrific entity known only as The Adversary, and the Fables - beings from these magic lands - have long since fled into 'our' world.  They live amongst us hidden, never revealing their true natures to the 'mundanes'.  Familiar characters abound, although not in the familiar forms from classic childhood stories.  Old King Cole is the mayor of Fabletown, Snow White is technically his assistant but in actuality the real power behind the crown, Bigby (Big B.) Wolf maintains a human form most of the time and is the top Fable private investigator.  As the investigation into the murder that rocks the Fable world continues, we're introduced to many of the key characters and ideas that will play roles through the larger series.  Not all the characters are what they first appear, and part of the fun and suspense is figuring out who you're going to be rooting for and rooting against in the overall epic.  Dark without being nihilistic, and through all the 'real-world-style' bickering and pettiness, the story continues to add little touches of whimsy; those who after reading just the first issue or two lament the loss of innocence (and in some cases, likability) of these legendary Disney-esque characters may find themselves surprised as the seriesgoes on.  The characters are very well-developed with multiple nuances, and in a lot of cases the original elements of the fairy tale characters's pesonalities still co-exist with the edgier, angst-ier character traits in this re-imagining.  Having seen their largely idyllic home kingdoms devastated and then trying to make a go of it in 'our' world could darken a talking woodland critter or fairy-tale princess, I guess.  The murder mystery is solved in this story arc, but the larger mysteries of the overall Fables tale are just beginning.  Great writing and beautiful, distinctive art.       Also in here is an original 6-page prose story (accompanied by 2 full-page illustrations) taking place during the great exodus from the Fables's homelands, back when the Adversary was overrunning everything.  We see the first meeting between some of the series's most important characters, and it adds a lot to the overall saga.

B001M4YZ90|5.0|If you are a fan Guy Ritchie's films (i.e. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) you'll love this one! Rock n' Rolla (RNR) features the same brand of humor and style you've come to expect from a Ritchie film. For those of you who are unfamiliar with his work, I would describe Ritchie as the Quentin Tarantino of the U.K. Ritchie's films usually revolve around organized crime, but they are done in a slightly satirical way. RNR bares some similarities to Pulp Fiction in that there are several branching storylines that eventually intertwine all of the major characters. And despite the dark undertones within the storyline there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments
B00275EGWY|5.0|I was thoroughly enthralled by \\"The Hurt Locker\\".  It's a war film without the absurd bravado and fake special effects.  Heroes like Sylvester Stallone and, in an earlier time, Ronald Reagan, are also completely absent.  If it's possible, it's an art house war film.<br /><br />The essence of the story revolves around the lives of a three man Explosive Ordinance Disposal team in Iraq.  Each of the men is very different. The team's leader, Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner) is a war junkie.  He seems to love the adrenaline of the moment.  Unfortunately, this leaves him prone to rash and foolhardy decisions.  His two juniors, Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge, are not happy with his approach; they are just counting down the days to when they can leave Iraq.  As the days count down, the team has many close shaves.  It is these close shaves that keep the viewer on edge.  Defusing ordinance requires great courage and a cool nerve.  The viewer feels the emotion by the bucket load.<br /><br />The essence of James' character is seen briefly near the conclusion of the film.  He has trouble adapting to civilian life.  He wants more of the adrenaline.  It is his lust for excitement that drives the movie.  It is a white knuckle ride at times.<br /><br />\\"The Hurt Locker\\" deserves an Oscar.  It is a modern war classic.  It also deserves a wider audience.  Perhaps a nod from the Academy will help it extend its reach?
B0000047GA|4.0|I got into jazz via fusion, and picked this up as a \\"historically important recording\\".  It went completely over my head at the time (as did B*tches Brew).  Mahavishnu, Weather Report (especially from Mysterious Traveller onward), Holdsworth-era Lifetime, and the electrified Return to Forever were bands that played in a jazz-influenced style - there was improvisation - but within the context of clear-cut rock-style compositions.  This album predates those and still has very strong, obvious ties to the modal-to-free post-bop that Williams had recently played with Miles Davis - relatively simple melodies and sparse arrangements quickly dispensed with so that the musicians could play extended, exploratory solos.  It's closer in style to mid-60s Miles or Coltrane than to Birds of Fire or Romantic Warrior.    Listen to the first tune, \\"Emergency\\".  Yeah, the melody is played over a rock rhythm, but as soon as John McLaughlin begins his blistering solo, Tony switches to a swinging post-bop rhythm.  These guys were familiar with the 60s jazz avant-garde and they definitely bend (but never break) rhythm and tonality.    There are two other beefs with the album.  Yes, Tony's vocals are bad, and the lyrics are even worse.  You just have to shrug these off - even the 3 tracks they appear on contain some fiery instrumental playing.    The sound is poor, but it's not catastrophic.  You can hear McLaughlin and Williams fine; Larry Young is hurt the most, and I wish he'd been recorded better.  (You can get a sense of what he sounded like during this period on the Blue Note release \\"Mother Ship\\" under his name.)  I wouldn't go quite so far as saying I'm glad it's poorly recorded, but the rough recording does add to the intensity for sure.    Overall, Emergency is a diamond in the rough.  It's not the first attempt to merge jazz and rock, but it's among the earliest where the musicians actually understood both styles and combined them in a thoughtful way to create something new.  Ifind it hard to believe that someone could listen to the explosive playing on \\"Sangria for Three\\" and not shout in amazement.

0393327655|3.0|What Sam Harris discusses in this book is obviously a truism: that religion is detrimental to longevity of civilization. Religion could be the death of us all. Yet why do I need to pay money for someone to tell me something that I already know? That would be okay if Sam had also told us what the cause and solution to religion is -- which is what I was expecting him to do -- but he never went there other then to lightly touch on the subject of mysticism as a replacement for religion. From a historical point of view, this book is a good overall view of the history of the atrocity of religion, but as for explaining why religion is that way or how mysticism could be a replacement for religion, Sam fails miserably.    Sam errors in his reasoning when he assumes that humans attained their superiority through violence. As he states in the chapter on Experiments in Consciousness, \\"Advanced civilization did not arise in sub-Saharan Africa, because one can't saddle a rhinoceros and ride it into battle\\" (pg 215). That simply is just not true. What wins battles is intelligence and intelligence doesn't require the violence of a battlefield to develop. One might even argue that violence is the opposite of intelligence. Sam's experiments in consciousness is not a mechanically repeatable list of instructions that one can follow, but rather a hasty, not very well thought out guess at what could be the next step in spirituality for humans.    That doesn't mean that Sam didn't (accidentally) have a few good insights now and then. I liked Sam's assessment of religions role in making pot illegal on page 162 (religion doesn't like competition), or the difference between science and mysticism on page 221 (concepts), or the problem of mixing subject and object in human experience on page 214, but this isn't enough insight to make the book worth buying.
B000ZECQ08|1.0|No Harry Potter fan will miss seeing it.  We'll all buy it no matter what any review says.  I've read all the books and bought all the movies.  This movie might be better for those who haven't.  Director Yates has obviously got a broken wand.  I'm not sure why he felt it necessary to not only rewrite the book's story line but to reinvent the environment.  Hogwarts, the Weasley house and their surroundings have no continuity to previous films.  Why?  Like most fans I looked forward to this movie.  I held off until I could get the special edition which I preordered.  I was so disappointed after watching the first hour or so that it took me over two months to finally watch the whole movie.  At least our expectations have been lowered to the point that the next movie may seem better.  It may not be a bad movie in itself but when you love the book and the movie title is \\"Moby Dick\\" you don't expect to get \\"Free Willie\\".<br /><br />We'll all buy the next two Yates interpretations which will make his sales statistics look great.  Who knows.  Maybe magic will happen and he'll get a new wand.  Since he butchered many of the lead ins to the last book my hopes are low.  But who knows, he didn't do such a bad job on Order of the Phoenix.
B001UV4XX8|3.0|When I saw the short story on the Twilight Zone, I thought it was one of the most suspenseful stories I had ever seen.  The original short story gets a definite 5 out of 5 stars.  However, this adaptation could have been markedly improved if it had ended in the same place as the Twilight Zone version.  Esentially, everything after Steward picks up the box only stinks up the story.  The best way to explain it is that its like seeing the fake aliens at the end of Close Encounters.  Before you see them, its suspenseful and scary.  When you see the children in rubber suits, the entire effect is destroyed.  Here, enough detail is added to destroy the suspense, but in the end, the movie leaves you hanging.  Its an extremely unsatisfying movie.  The performances were okay but not stellar.  And, there were several subplots that either never developed or never made any sense or added anything to the movie.  Out of generousity and respect for the original story, I give it a 3.  That's a gift.  (the other people I watched it with all liked it far less than I did)
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Departures is a beautiful film. Gently paced, quietly scores and filmed in pretty much all natural lighting. A film in an Autumn mood. The acting, too, is natural and unforced. The four main characters are all rather memorable. Daigo is played by young actor with considerable poise and feeling. Mika, Daigo's wife, is played by quite an experienced young actress. Mika is almost childlike creation, she was so sweet and trusting.<br /><br />The worldly boss of NK Agents was well acted, as was his off-sider.<br /><br />Even though the subject matter of this film was rather gloomy, the story was a very beautiful and human one.<br /><br />Very warmly recommended by me.
B000002JNJ|4.0|I have noticed that it has become popular for underground metal listeners to hate this band.  This album however contains little to no tough guy routines that some of the later ones would rely on more often.  Instead you get treated to a polished yet aggressive metal album.  The guitars and vocals are stretched more here then on the following releases.  For all intensive purposes, the classic heavy metal sound is all here.  There is a couple duds (Primal Concrete Sludge, Message In Blood) but the rest is consistently good.  I have also noticed it has become popular to hate any band that injects a bit of groove into their sound.  If you aren't one of those overly picky nerds that thinks Black Metal is the only legitimate form of metal, then you might find much to enjoy here.
B002WCLG48|3.0|The first time I watched it I was completely unimpressed as both a halo fan and an anime fan, since a lot of things just felt like they didn't mesh, whether because of story fitting with existing cannon, visual/sound not matching up with existing visual/sound established by the game, or even just overall atmosphere (in the case of Odd Man Out, which is by FAR my least favorite).     After being encouraged to watch the commentary version done by Frank O'Connor and Joseph Chou, I caved in and gave it another go and learned the reasoning behind the choices that they made in production. I have to admit that knowing that information has made me rethink my original opinion about how involved in learning about halo the animation studios were during the whole process, but it still doesn't change how I felt about the movie as a whole.    Interesting concept with poor execution. 3/5.    Also in Homecoming I finally realized why the humans almost lost the war against the covenant. We obviously ran out of magic bullets that bend reality and make the elites shields not exist. I knew the original pistol was ridiculous, but one shot killing every elite is absurd.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|If you like Sci-Fi, The Moon, Astronomy, Space, Stars, Nebula's, Black holes, Dark mater or Dark energy, Drama, Action and Visuals or twisted plots, watch this!!!! Best Movie I've seen in a long time!!!! Serious! :-O

B0000029AL|3.0|This is a really odd listen for me because some of the songs on here are some of my favorite among all of their catalog.  On the other hand there are songs which I find very boring.  Lets start with the good, Make It - Dream On - Mama Kin - Movin' Out.  All four of these stand tall among the best of what Aerosmith offers.  The remaining tracks just do not do anything for me.  Let me also state for the record that I only enjoy 70's Aerosmith, so I am not bringing my opinions from the pop albums.  I still recommend this album to anyone who likes Aerosmith or is new to them.  I think I might just not fully \\"get it\\" when it comes to this particular outing.  That doesn't mean it lacks quality, just seems a bit too middle of the road for me.
B0013FNC38|2.0|Good grief, this thing was almost painful to get through.  Fortunately, I borrowed it or I would've been annoyed that I wasted money on it.    The best song (and the reason I borrowed it) was \\"I'm Yours.\\"  None of the rest of the songs even approached the bouncey and fun energy of that and I clicked from track to track in less than ten minutes.    The cover art was awful.  It looked as though it was drawn by a child and the titles of the songs and details (no lyrics, thankyouverymuch) in the enclosed booklet were hand-scrawled and difficult to read.    My advice is to avoid purchasing this (unless you really enjoy Mraz's work) and just pay the .99 to download \\"I'm Yours.\\"  Jason appears to be a one-hit wonder.
B002RKXO5E|5.0|All I can say is WOW, WOW, WOW!  This concert has it all!  Great Music, Dancing, Acrobatics, Incredible light show, Pyrotechnics, Incredible colors, Giant Automitons, and even a Circus!    This is the kind of thing I created my home theater for, and this did it more than justice!  It was like being there.  If you even remotely think you like Take That, you have to watch this DVD!  I am a big fan, and this left me wanting for nothing  (EXCEPT MORE!)

B000V6BE6C|1.0|I got this album for free so I tried giving it an honest listen.  It really does deserve a 1 out of 5 stars.  It is so mediocre, and in many places just downright bad.  You can obviously see that there is some skill present in the musicians, but the final product is laughable.  May I suggest both \\"Colony\\" and \\"Clayman\\" by In Flames instead?  At least this way you can be exposed to some melodic death metal that will almost always lead one much farther into the metal genre than this ever could.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|There is not too much new to say about this recording that has not all ready been said by someone.  Nearly every song on this album is a 5 star hit (and, nothing is below 4 stars)!  I will say that the sound is, very, premium in its quality.  The sound level has been elevated quite a bit from the earlier Beatles CDs that were released in the early 1990s.  And, because of this, the music transfers very well to a Zune or an iPod MP3 player (I find I don't have to keep turning the volume up when I listen to the Beatles \\"1\\" on my Zune, even if I am jarring around in a noisy environment like my car).  John, Paul, George, and Ringo never sounded so good!  STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
0307269981|4.0|When two reporters on the magazine \\"Millennium\\" are killed just before they're about to release a story exposing Sweden's sex trafficking business, fellow journalist Mikael Blomkvist is shocked. But he's even more puzzled and upset when the police find the fingerprints of Lisbeth Salander on the murder weapon. Salander, a feisty girl and a genius computer hacker, is known for her violent tendencies, but Blomkvist doesn't believe she's guilty  of these murders. In the meantime Salander herself, in order to prove her innocence, revisits her dark and frightening past and comes up with some unexpected and totally surprising answers. A great thriller and worthy sequel to Larsson's first book, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\"
0307716988|2.0|The book was pretty weak you can tell that Michael really wanted to go in depth about the music business, his family, and the pressures of being a mega superstar.

I mean most of what he spoke about you already knew W.T.H. Mike ??? but you're still the man R.I.P. \\"King Of Pop\\"
B000001FSU|1.0|If you are an Anthrax fan then you might just be tempted to buy this out of loyalty, or you probably already have it.  This warning is for if you are new to Anthrax, please do not buy this album first, it may turn you off from them completely.  Instead buy Among The Living and Spreading the Disease.  These two will give you a much better representation of what this band is capable of.  This comes off as mostly a dull and boring affair, save for the opening track \\"Be All End All.\\"

0439023483|4.0|Take the best parts of \\"Theseus and he Minotaur\\", \\"The Running Man\\", \\"Uglies,\\" \\"Brave New World,\\" and a few other dystopian novels, mash 'em up, and you've got The Hunger Games. Few writers can hurtle though a story this intense without overworking certain scenes, giving away the climax, or confusing the reader, but Suzanne Collins balances brutality, social commentary, and the coming of age angle as precisely as her reluctant protagonist. I am halfway through the sequel and it is every bit as good, if not better, so this is a storyline worth your time, and I highly recommend it for readers of all ages.
B002P8O29K|5.0|Having recently and reluctantly given a negative review to the overpackaged and underwhelming new issue of  \\"Get Yer Ya-Yas Out\\", I am pleased to report that the \\"Gimme Shelter\\" Blu Ray exceeds my expectations.  A huge Stones fan since my high school days in the early 1980s, I've watched this film many times.  It's never looked and sounded better.  Yes, the source material is very grainy and (for some reason) in 4:3 aspect ratio.  Nevertheless, the blu ray offers visual details unseen in various previous releases.  But the sound is where this disc shines.  Large stadium shows usually disappoint, especially 40-year old shows; but this release makes excellent use of the surrounds to add depth and realism.  The rear speakers are not reserved for crowd noise, as is frequently true; they also reveal musical detail I've never heard, including more of Keith and the criminally underrated Mick Taylor.  The disc exposes an awful lot of squeaky feedback and other flaws but to me, that only adds to the immersive texture of the disc.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, \\"Gimme Shelter\\" isn't simply a concert film.  Live tracks from late 1969 are interspersed with documentary footage about the logistics of setting up a massive free concert; later scenes in the film show various goings-on among the crowd and onstage, culminating in the graphic killing of an armed audience member.  I especially enjoyed the oily antics of lawyer Melvin Belli, whom the Stones hired to con the property owners to agree to an invasion by a zillion hippies.  The hippies themselves are shown to be a lot more violent and malevolent than today's Baby Boomer filmmakers would have you believe.  There's a dark and ominous tone throughout the film.  A fan punches Jagger upon his arrival at the show; concertgoers fight over parking near the site, many others rush onto the stage impatiently demanding the Stones to hurry up and play (a few particularly unattractive ones do so naked), while others engage in all kinds of antisocial behavior.  The PA is constantly imploring fans to move back and get off the stage and scaffolding, while begging for doctors and bandages to come forth to treat the sick and injured.  If you didn't already know how it all turns out, you'd be expecting some kind of disaster to occur.  The Stones repeatedly halt mid-song to push back the crowd and implore everyone against beating the crap out of one another.  Somehow (and this had to be a \\"lucky\\" break for the filmmakers), a camera catches the seminal moment of the event, a killing in the crowd.<br /><br />If you only want to see some great live Stones, there are other choices (my favorite is the hard-to-find \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones\\"), though the actual performance footage shown in \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is excellent (I would have loved to attend any other show on this tour).  The movie also has brief live snippets from Tina Turner, Jefferson Airplane and others, but the Stones are clearly the main event.  But this is more documentary than concert movie.  With a warts-and-all approach by the filmmakers, it's a fascinating look at an overly-romanticized period in American social history.  And it's never looked or sounded better.ocial behavior.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|On the whole I have not been impressed with the latest round of BBC adaptations of Jane Austen's novel.  Admirers of Austen's novels want versions that capture the spirit of the novels, and that follow reasonably close to the plot.  Mansfield Park and Persuasion both failed miserably in these goals. It was an agony to watch them.   Northanger Abbey was a little better, flawed but enjoyable. Better still was Sense and Sensibility.  The creaters felt obligated to add a graphic seduction scene, incredulous that anyone could actually enjoy a love story that lacked this necessary ingredient, but otherwise I found it to be very good.       I was reluctant to watch Emma based on some of the review I read, thinking that it was going to be another frothy confection like Gwyneth Paltrow's madcap Emma.  Jane Austen wrote of this novel that no one would like the heroine except the author herself.  While it is a novel full of humor, it intended as a journey of Emma's education and growing maturity, not a screwball comedy with a charming but silly heroine.  Finally I did succumb and watch it.   To my surprise, I like it best of the four version I have seen (Godwin 1972, Beckinsale 1996, Paltrow 1996, Garai 2009).  There are occasional hints of modern attitudes and a glaring costume error (darts in bodices, a noticeable anachronism to costume buffs), but the creators managed a nice balance of humor and character development.  Romola Garai did a splendid job of showing when Emma was operating on impulse and when she was actually reflecting on her actions.  She portrayed equally well both Emma's warm heart and her streak of self-satisfaction.  As for Mr Woodhouse, I found Michael Gambon's portrayal to be the best I've seen.  The other actors all seemed well cast and turned in good performances.  I did think that Jane Fairfax's famous beauty seemed to be a little repressed by some country-mouse costume choices, but that is a minor quibble.  All in all, I was very well pleased, and this is the version I would recommend.

I felt like they were right on the verge throughout the whole book but I just never felt a real strong emotional tie to Grace. I am hoping Linger gets it right because I did enjoy reading this book and I'm  curious as to what happens to Sam and Grace, I just hope that I feel a stronger pull in the next book.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Currently I'm on day 21 of this workout, which is the first day at level 3. I have seen amazing results. I'm definitely ready for swimsuit season. With two children I had difficulty finding a workout that fits into my schedule and produces results in a minimal amount of time....but this workout is perfect. Jillian really pushes you to your fullest potential in only 20 minutes. The levels get progressively more difficult. I rave about this workout to anyone that is looking for a new routine.

045122499X|1.0|The first book, Pillars Of The Earth, had sweep, epic drama, noble characters, mystery.  But this book celebrates pettiness: petty politicking, thievery, ego, sexual peccadilloes.  The character of Godwyn, the small-minded prior, is particularly unpleasant.  After 5 or 6 hundred pages the book became a skim-as-fast-as-you-can slog.
031606792X|5.0|I fell head over heels for the Twilight Saga. I LOVED Breaking Dawn and THE only problem with the book was the big fat 'THE END' at the close of the book. I never wanted the story of Edward and Bella to come to an end. I could have read on about them forever and like most people I was sad when the story did come to it's end. The books were, however, almost just as good the second and third time around!! Maybe one of these days S.M. will surprise all of us with a fifth book...a girl can always wish! ;)

I will read this book again one day and it will remain in my permanent library.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|I couldn't pass up this collection of the last episodes of Doctor Who with David Tennant. I had already watched them on tv as I had with seasons 1-4 but I had to have the entire set so I could enjoy them at my own leisure. I have enjoyed this series from day one and the specials were among the best of all of them. Even my kids have gotten into the Doctor Who series to the point of going back to watch the earlier Doctor Who series. David Tennant as The Doctor has given myself and my kids many hours of entertainment and a kindred intrest that we watch and discuss and share our veiwpoints. It's normaly hard to find a show that we enjoy and agree on but this is the one we sit and watch together for hours. The shows are well written and extremely well acted and David Tennant is amazing how he can jump from smiling and joking to a serious and dangerous force to be reckoned with. Of course this is all possible with being surrounded by all the actors that have been on the series thru the years. David Tennant will be sorely missed as The Doctor and I wish him well in his future endeavors.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Best investment made ever! I bought this DVD back in October, after quitting the gym which I've been going to for the last 10 years. I am 30 and don't need to lose weight, but I have trouble getting toned. This DVD has toned my arms, abs, and legs in ways the gym never has!!! I am not where I want to be yet, but it's better than where I was before on my own working out at the gym. I've only lost 2 lbs with this DVD but I'm already on the thin side to begin with (not bragging, but just saying you're not gonna lose a lot of weight if you're already at your appropriate weight). Also, losing weight isn't a primary goal of mine as getting toned up is. You know that line muscle definition down the middle of your stomach? I've never had that until now!     I love that it's 20 minutes, and there are 3 levels. Like many people here, I got super bored of Level 1 after a few days so I quickly moved on to Level 2 and 3. I have no way at all mastered Level 1, 2, or 3, but I like the variety of workouts every day and focusing on different parts of my body. I've also gotten sooo much better through the last few months I've been using it. I remember the first week, I could not do a minute of jumping jacks without my calves feeling like they were gonna cave in and now it's not an issue. Same with a lot of the moves. There are moves that will be hard on your knees, but Jillian Michaels shows you how to do modified/beginner moves. I stick with those and still feel like I'm getting a sufficient workout. I think this DVD is great for beginners, as well as seasoned people that work out and just looking for something new. I've done everything--pilates, hot yoga, jogging, swimming, etc. and I think this workout is a good complementary if you don't have time to drive over to the gym (plus cheap, you only have to invest in 3-5 lbs weights!)    For people that complain about going thru the intro all the time, if you watch it on your computer (or even better, your Laptop), you can skip thru the intro and all the commercials. In fact normally what i do is have it play on my laptop w the volume low or off while I watch TV!!! (I place the laptop on top of the TV). I was also able to skip thru the commercials on my DVD player tho, so I guess it depends what kind of DVD player u have?
B000Y7U98C|3.0|This movie invites comparisons with such classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Solaris (particularly the Soderburgh version) and during the first half such comparisons are fully justified. SUNSHINE starts well. The first hour is meditative and moody with various philosophical themes thrown into the mix. The effects and cinematography are excellent and the performances good throughout. The tension is efficiently ratcheted up and by the half-way point, when an important revelation is uncovered, the viewer is eager and hopeful for a satisfying denouement that matches what has gone before. Sadly this viewer was disappointed. The second half invites comparison with movies such as Event Horizon rather than the aforementioned think-pieces. Now I enjoyed Event Horizon but it's a totally different animal to that which SUNSHINE aspires to be. Without giving too much away what begins as a thoughtful movie ends as a rather conventional SF/horror flick. However, even when it succumbs to these cliches it remains creative and well-produced. What's frustrating is that it could have been a much better movie had it maintained the subtler, higher tone it begins with.

B001DJLCP4|5.0|I saw this movie when it was released to the  theaters in the '70s.  In New York City.  In a moviehouse in Times Square.  The theatre  was full of blacks and there were roaches running up the walls and cum all over  the seats and this is the  only way to see this movie:  Sit right in  the  middle  of  the theater  of action  while it  is all over the screen.  I walked out with my friends after  it was  over into the late afternoon sun and none  of us  needed to say anything.  This totally is a New York movie about going insane in New York City and cathartically divesting yourself of the whole mess you find yourself in in a very lethal way and  getting away with  it, then returning  to normalcy, having been cleansed of the demons which drove you into  madness in the first place.  Heavy duty.  Love this movie.

1594202249|1.0|Let me start by saying that I have never read Pynchon before.  I read a book review about \\"Inherent Vice\\" and ordered the book.  The fact is that this book is just very difficult to read.  It could not hold my interest at all. A stoner PI trying to solve a mystery in SoCal in the late '60s??  That is the plot??  The characters are contrived and not at all believable. I gathered that the book is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but it is just not funny. Thomas Wolfe is much better.If you want a goofy book to read that is laugh-out-loud hilarious, try \\"The Stingray Shuffle\\" by Tim Dorsey.

I am a wonderful living being capable of beaming my energy into the world, only because of them. When my bowels move, I cheer my cells for clearing that waste out of my body. When my urine flows, I admire the volume my bladder cells are capable of storing.\\" And so it goes.     There are valuable, interesting sections of this book. Specifically, chapters 2 and 3 when she is discussing basics of brain science and current theories of what hemisphere of the brain controls what thought processes. It is truly interesting that the analytical, linear, quantitative left hemisphere is very different from the calmer, empathetic right hemisphere. How they interact to create a view of the world is fascinating. However, after two chapters of engaging brain science, Taylor says, \\"I encourage you to explore myriad current literature about...the brain.\\" As in, without this book. She then follows with a play-by-play of her own stroke, her loss of the left brain, and tapping into the \\"total oneness\\" of her right brain. The most tedious section of the book is the next 100 pages or so after her stroke describing the pre-op and recovery period, endlessly listing how she couldn't read, so she had to learn; and she couldn't write, so she had to learn; and she couldn't do math, so she had to learn. On and on it went until we came to why she supposedly wrote the book: her stroke of insight.     And what is her stroke of insight? If you feel agitated, morose, angry, frustrated, or stressed-out, simply step to the right and become one with the universe. Simple.     I don't want to trivialize the potentially immense, therapeutic value a person can get from meditation, or \\"quieting the left brain\\" to find a state of inner peace. The search for inner peace is admirable and we should all be so lucky to find ourselves in states oftranquility and ease. But Taylor trivializes how one gets there and she glorifies her own stroke as the key to what lead her to this insight. Who wouldn't feel grateful to see the sun rise another day after nearly dying?!     She then starts to write like a typical \\"New Age\\" spiritual guru (read: above quotation). She meditates (okay), prays (I'll tolerate it), praises her cells for defecating (ummm...what?), loves \\"vocal tuning with sounding bowls\\", and \\"also draws Angel Cards several times a day.\\" Seriously. Angel Cards.     This book is a missed opportunity. She wants to share with the world her knowledge of the right brain and that if we could only tap into it on a given moment the world would be free of war and anger and global warming. Brain science? Cool. Useless, baloney, new age mysticism? Vomit-inducing. Then again, next time I'm feeling a little stressed, I might whip out my Angel Cards while I'm taking a dump just to see what happens.

B002SF9YUM|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the eloquent portrayal of these characters. A romantic story about the young life and loves of artist Salvador Dali, filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and writer Federico Garcia Lorca. Madrid is on the edge of change in 1922. As traditional values are challenged by what is deemed dangerous new influences. Salvador Dali arrives to university, 18 years old and determined to become a great artist. He is a bizarre mixture of shyness and rampant exhibitionism; this attracts the attention of two of the university's social elite - Federico Garcia Lorca and Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. Salvador is captivated by their decadent group and for a time Salvador, Luis and Federico becomes a intimidating trio, the most ultra-modern group in Madrid. As time passes, Salvador feels an increasingly strong pull towards the charismatic Federico - who is himself oblivious of the attentions he is getting from his beautiful writer friend, Margarita. Federico and Salvador spend the holiday in the sea-side town of Cadaques. Both the idyllic surroundings and the warmth of the Dali family sweep Federico off his feet. Salvador and he draw closer, sharing their deepest beliefs, inspirations and secrets, convinced that they have found a kind of friendship unknown by others. It is more than a meeting of the minds; it is a fusion of souls. And then one night, in the phosphorescent water, it becomes something else, something much more.
0307269981|4.0|I liked \\"The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo\\" (the prequel that should be read prior to this one), but I was afraid that I would get bored with this one since the style and theme would not be new anymore. It was actually more interesting and suspenseful though.  The focus of this book is more on Salander, whose character is more interesting than Blomkvist, the journalist. There are a few slow parts but the last 140 pages or so are page turners and most readers will find it hard to put down at that point. If you liked the first one then you will not be disappointed with \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\". The big question is whether one should bother with the final book in the series that will be published in the US soon.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Before I purchased Food, Inc. I always wanted to know the process of the foods I eat especially meats. I wanted to know what cows and chickens were being fed,I wanted to know more about corn and why it is used in almost everything that I eat, I also wanted to know more on antibiotics and animals.      Everything that I wanted to know and so much more I found out by watching Food, Inc.     I really understand the importance of eating meats, fruits and vegetables that are organic.    Thanks to Food, Inc. I now know how to eat healthier and where to shop for healthy foods.
0525421033|4.0|This book about a girl who ends up in a coma from a car accident that kills both her parents and brother, is heartbreaking and beautiful. Mia has to decide whether she will stay with her boyfriend and grandparents, or follow her family in death. Although there are moments when you think it's going to go the other way, I pretty much figured out what her decision would be early on. This is a character-driven book, and they are wonderfully drawn with complex relationships. Highly recommend.
0446401307|4.0|The plot of this book and many of its details have been well-described by other reviewers. I will not repeat their efforts. Instead I will merely say why I liked the book.    Four things strongly appealed to me in the book. First, the entire action of the book takes place over about twelve hours from Bosch's first call out until the conclusion, so the plot is tight. Second, the plot is also credible and so are Bosch's observations and actions within it. Third, Connelly in this story returns Bosch to his cop roots. Here he is again very much a local LA cop, determined to see that an awful crime in his city is not swept under the rug because a bunch of outside hotshots think that bigger issues are at stake. Harry never loses sight of the fact that a brutal murder has happened on his home turf, and nothing interferes with his relentless pursuit of that crime.    Finally, Harry's skills as a detective are very much on display here. His observations at crime scenes are acute and his ability to evaluate what he sees is outstanding. The same is true of his observations of suspects and witnesses. In short, we see again the original Harry Bosch: Tough, astute, unafraid and committed to his city rather than to career or self. This is the Harry who caught the reader's eye in the early books.      Yes, the plot is a bit overloaded with extraneous stuff (especially Harry's mooning over Rachel). Yes, the resolution is a bit forced. But overall the story is crisp and far more credible than Connelly's more recent Bosch outing, \\"9 Dragons.\\"
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I saw bit of this documentary on the Oprah show and was fascinated. As soon as it was delivered to my home, I watched it.  How amazing what goes on that we hear nothing about.  There are a few parts that are somewhat disgusting...but the truth needs to be told.  Farmers can't even be farmers anymore.  They are so regulated by big corporations.  The widespread uses of antibiotics sure explains the current rise in infections that cannot be cured with ordinary antibiotics.  I have watched the movie 3 times now, and am still learning more each time.  If anyone wants to learn more about our food sources, and what goes on behind the scenes...this movie is a must.  I hope it takes home the Oscar.   Fast Food Nation and The Omnivore's Dilemna are also two good books that deal with the same subject matter.       NO MORE FAST FOOD FOR ME!

0385737424|4.0|Everyone told me this was a growing up, coming of age story with a twist at the end, which it is. The characters are very well drawn and the \\"twist\\" is well developed throughout the story. I figured it out way ahead of time, though, so I think that prevented me from loving the book as much as other people did.
B0014YPEI4|5.0|This detailed allosaurus model is great and I do not regret buying it.I think this is good for all ages. The movable jaw is perfect for the kids, and the amazing detail is good for the adults. There is no spot with no detail anywhere on the model. There is also precise detail on the roof of the mouth and under the tongue!i cant keep my eyes off of it, sometimes I put it on my bed side table and it helps me go to sleep.i definetly recommend this for all dinosaur lovers.The tail is stiff, but you can sort of bend the arms a little.oh yeah, i forgot to mention the amazing texture on the sides, down the backbone and everywhere.I also recommend the t-rex papo, which i ordered with the allosaurus. The detail is as good, but the t-rex would never stand that way, so i don't recommend it for a classroom.But if you are just going to buy it for a toy or model, I think it is perfect for children and adults.Here is the link to it:[[ASIN:B000KO7QK8 Tyrannosaurus]].
B00009L1TA|5.0|I loved this movie. Never a dull moment from the moment you start watching. John Travolta has never been better.  Keeps you guessing the whole way through. The ending was a complete surprise.
0307271862|5.0|In many ways this is not the usual thriller - or for that matter the usual crime story.  Rather it reads like an excellent novel with well drawn, believable characters whom, as the book plays out one can identify with and even care about.  At times the writing is even poetic. Yes there are thrills a plenty and danger can unexpectedly smash across the scene, as it does in real life but it is the strength of the characterizations and the beauty of the writing which kept me transfixed so that the books weaknesses as a thriller didn't really matter.  These weaknesses? Two primarily.  The villain of the story is not as well drawn as its heroins and, at the novel's end all the pieces (as in real life) do not all fall into place - most but not all. All in all Henning Mankell has made memorable achievement. It is good enough that I was sorry for it to end.
0446560065|5.0|My husband recently introduced me to Simon's cat on Youtube.  I immediately watched all the videos and wanted more.  He told me there was a book and I hunted it down.  I read the reviews and that some people said it lost some charm without the animation and sound, and that is true in some of the cases, but I still love Simon's cat and am thoroughly pleased with my purchase of this book.  I hope that we will be seeing more of this little rascal and his adventures, whether they are animated or not.

B001QOGYFY|5.0|I totally enjoyed this one. The bluray picture on this movie was quiet stunning. I was feeling the cold while watching this. The frostbite scenes made me cringe.The story was good even though I did figure out the ending prior to seeing the ending. Sometimes it is ok to know you are always right.   Enjoy
031606792X|5.0|This was an AMAZING book!! I loved it! I belived it was the best of the Twilight series. Stephenie Meyer did an EXCELLENT job despite all you book haters out theres reviews. I think the plot is    LIFE AND LOVE WITH A VAMPIRE. This was a great book and I would urge everyone out there to read it. Thank you Stephenie Meyer for writing this fantastic book.... CHEERS to Breaking Dawn!!!
B001GCUO52|3.0|and so was the movie. \\"We know we are going to die.\\" ... one of the memorable lines.   Far over hyped. I sometimes wonder if these movies are actually conceived to have their 3 seconds of movie theators and then go to die on the webstores like Amazon.
0767802470|5.0|Many of these reviews have a decidedly populist slant, and I find people writing here who have a problem with overdubbed English voices, or the presence of subtitles. Apparently, if you make a film in its native language, you can't win with the English-only group--they will be much happier with Wall-E, the latest H'wood blockbuster, and Gone In 60 Seconds. I say to you, you have your reward. Das Boot is the kind of film that you don't really need to know German, or read English subtitles, in order to \\"get\\" what is going on, or to read the emotions of the characters as they are portrayed by this superb ensemble. Jurgen Prochnow is simply one of the most sensitive and strongest of film actors, always underplaying, yet always playing for the director's camera angle and the intent of a scene, and delivering well-modulated evidence of his character's, the Captain's, stresses and ire and enthusiasm with great reserve, poise, and humanity. This is the man you would want to follow into the battle, if only for the glorious honor of dying by his side, if it comes to that. Lieutenant Werner, the embedded journalist (this is where CNN and Fox got the idea) is a perfect foil in his status as a neophyte, a possible snoop for the High Command, as supercargo, and his emotions, and his P.O.V. are, of course, what drive the viewer's journey through this particular cruise through a lower level of hell. The Chief's urbanity, his droll wit, and the rigid Nazism of the first officer, contrasted with the Second's comical and wry take on nearly every situation, make up a complex dynamic as close in its verisimilitude as we could ever hope to get in this deplorable, pressurized, jolting and very deadly environment. The sub's confines provide a very limited mise-en-scene, and yet, with swinging sausages and ubiquitous citrus fruit rocketing like missiles within its heaving confines, we see each character, no matter how minor his part in the action, writ larger than life, and we become immersed, literally, in the \\"welt\\" of this U-boot. The pyrotechnics and heavily-layered sound track keep us bouncing in our seats, sweating down our spines, as we dive ever deeper into the briny depths, as the ship creaks, lurches, and blows its bolts, along with its lights and gauges, and the desroyer's screws grind overhead. People watching this film should also recall that in an environment where a sextant can't be used for several weeks at a time, all those oranges and lemons and limes are a necessity, not a treat: they are there to prevent scurvy, not to provide zest for one's schnapps.<br /><br />This film also becomes an incredible voyage into a slice of life of those we characteristically, in the States, think of as our enemy, and we become a little more equananimous in our opinions of the average German (although these men are far from average, in the main) swept up in a conflict larger, more horrific, and (for the German, at least) more disastrous than any in the prior history of the world. If these men seem more heroic, in a way, then Spielberg's GI's in Private Ryan, it is because the entire thesis and scope of this film, also, is of a much larger and more comprehensive design. It is also important to remember that we can learn a lot more about a war by studying the histories of the losers, rather than constantly falling back on our own laurels, our own hubristic accounts, as their conquerors.<br /><br />All this last I say with reference to Eastwood's \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", which also takes the standpoint of those we tend to dismiss as our opponents, and as the losers, and gifts them with every emotion, failing, sterling quality, and all the heroism we usually reserve for those who fought with the Allies.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the finest films of all time, in ever aspect of its conception and production and final realization. Soak yourself in it. You will not be disappointed, and you will find yourself returning to it, many times, over the years.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0035WTJBG Saving Private Ryan  [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000O77RLE Letters from Iwo Jima [Blu-ray]]]rivate Ryan  [Blu-ray]]]    [[ASIN:B000O77RLE Letters from Iwo Jima [Blu-ray]]]
0316044938|1.0|After hearing all about this book and how great it was, I decided to read it. I'm astounded at how amateurish the writing was. It was like a fairy tale being watched from above. Honestly, I do not understand how this even made it to print. The ending was so anticlimatic. The only real tragedy is I actually spent time and money on this crap.
B0009S4IKQ|4.0|Grand Hotel(released Sept/32)was MGM's biggest film extravaganza to date and featured some of the biggest screen names all together in one film;at MGM or elsewhere.It certainly had a major impact on all future releases from all of the major studios and their usage of their own star power.No matter how else the film may be perceived going on over 75 years now,it is a fascinating glimpse at the power and clout at the disposal of the biggest studio of its' day.<br />The film stars Greta Garbo as Grusinskaya,a Russian ballet dancer,Wallace Beery as Mr.Preysing an industrialist,John Barrymore as Baron Von Geigern,Lionel Barrymore as Mr.Kringelein an accountant,Joan Crawford as Flaemmchaen,a stenographer,Lewis Stone as Dr Otternschlag, and Jean Herscholt as Senf,the head hotel porter.MGM wonder kind Irving Thalberg assembled the cast and put this film into production.MGM owned the rights to the story and had backed its' Broadway play version a couple of years before so its' transition from stage to screen was relatively smooth.<br />The story works on many levels at once.Among the many guests is Grusinskaya,a worn down ballet dancer who is staying at this the Berlin(Germany)property of the Grand Hotel chain.Her performances of late have been poorly received and she is very depressed.More than once she utters(what was to become)the immortal line:\\"I (v)want to be alone!\\".Baron Von Geigern is also friendless,alone and more importantly,broke.He owes some lowly people some money and plans to steal Grusinskaya's pearls.But he inadvertently falls head over heels in love with the ballerina(only in the movies,folks!).Meanwhile a lowly desk accountant Kringelein has come to the hotel to enjoy a final fling,as he has a terminal illness.He runs into his company boss Preysing,who is not only a bully but who is also desperate.He is seeking a merger with some foreign companies and it is not going well.Preysing has hired a stenographer called Flaemmchaen.She has fallen hard for the Baron but her feelings are not to be reciprocated.She agrees to accompany Preysing to England on \\"business\\" but he catches the Baron trying to steal his wallet.Presying kills him and ends up being arrested for murder.Flaemmchaen and Kringelein both grieve at the Baron's demise(the Baron was good to them both)and come to the agreement that Kringelein will spend the last days he has treating Flaemmchaen and himself to the best time they can possibly have,and leave at once for Paris.Gruisnskaya who has been on cloud nine ever since the Baron's admission of his love and devotion to her,leaves for Vienna on the train where she hopes to rendezvous with the Baron;which we know will never be.Throughout all this turmoil and trouble the head porter Senf has had a wife in labour(the longest in screen history!) and at the end she finally gives birth to a boy.Mother a child are doing well,thank you.As the main protagonists leave the hotel new faces arrive to breathe a new life into it,as life indeed does goes on.Dr.Otternschlag has come in and out of the film throughout dispensing tidbits of advice,both practical and philosophical.He was a veteran of WWI who had the right side of his face disfigured due to a grenade and the resulting infection which set in.At the end of the film,as he does in the beginning,he states\\"...nothing ever happens here\\".Filled with obvious irony and a telling testimony to the doctor's lack of perception and to the blinders he carries around with him.<br />Grand Hotel was ably directed by Edmund Goulding,or should I just say he ably assisted the proceedings.These were huge talents put into his hands and I doubt whether Goulding had to give much direction to the likes of either Barrymore or a Lewis Stone or Jean Herscholt;pros all.The newest of the main cast is Joan Crawford.She was at this point still an up and coming actor but she gives a very nice performance and stands toe to toe with all the veterans that surround her.Speaking of which,Lionel Barrymore gives a splendid performance as Kringelein the deathly sick desk accountant.His choice of dress,accessories and demeanor enhance his role beautifully.Then there is his talented brother,the Great Profile himself,John.John also turns in a boffo performance as the desperate but gentlemanly and kind Baron.Garbo,well I must be honest,I have never been a Garbo fan.With her deep throaty voice and less than(to me)subtle acting ability,I have always considered her far over rated.However while she continues to over act here,she at times does hit an amenable mark and is at her best with her scenes with Barrymore.And speaking of her and Barrymore you might take a closer look at the case cover for this DVD,taken from a period lobby card.Notice the couple's embrace;look familiar? It should.It was the self same embrace(and look) of the much played up \\"romance\\" between a younger Garbo and the screen's then leading man John Gilbert of just a few short years before in the \\"silents\\" period.Both were MGM properties then,but while Garbo was getting bigger and bigger,Gilbert had been long disgraced and persona non grata at MGM.He would be dead in about four years.<br />Technically this is virtually the same release print from the 2004 initial release;same picture and same features.The picture,while generally good in contrast and crispness,still needs a bit of work as it can get quite grainy and scratchy at times.There are a number of interesting features included:a featurette on the movie,footage of its' premiere at the Graumann's Chinese Theatre,a \\"warning\\" theatrical film clip of the films' last days of showing in the L.A area,its trailer and a quite funny Warners Vitaphone 1933 short\\"Nothing Ever Happens\\".It's a musical spoof,often scripted in rhyme both spoken and musical.All the minor Warner actors here are made up to look as close to the stars of the Grand Hotel as possible and they did a bang up job,I can tell you.Also watch for the chorines that come in and out of the short;they are like refugees from the Radio City Music Hall!<br />All in all a nice release of a \\"grand\\" old picture,chock full of some of the best stars off the then MGM lot.Though it certainly runs the gamut of emotions,it can easily be perceived as quite melodramatic with a depressing overtone throughout.I find the performances here by the Barrymore brothers to be the scene stealer's throughout.It's a juggernaut of MGM talent and it is little wonder it ended up winning a best picture OSCAR that year.It just shows the tip of the iceberg of talent MGM had at their disposal in the 30s.Look at MGM today and wonder at just how far the mighty have fallen!id performance as Kringelein the deathly sick desk accountant.His choice of dress,accessories and demeanor enhance his role beautifully.Then there is his talented brother,the Great Profile himself,John.John also turns in a boffo performance as the desperate but gentlemanly and kind Baron.Garbo,well I must be honest,I have never been a Garbo fan.With her deep throaty voice and less than(to me)subtle acting ability,I have always considered her far over rated.However while she continues to over act here,she at times does hit an amenable mark and is at her best with her scenes with Barrymore.And speaking of her and Barrymore you might take a closer look at the case cover for this DVD,taken from a period lobby card.Notice the couple's embrace;look familiar?

B000NX1C4M|3.0|This GOODTIMES videotape of STARMAN, which has the same cover photo as a [[ASIN:B000A7BD4K 1993 COLUMBIA]] release, is recorded in LP mode. There's a linear mono audio track (no HiFi) but sound is very strong.<br /><br />Colors overmodulate only occasionally: during a tanker truck explosion and when the mother ship arrives at the crater, but in general this transfer is quite good for a slower speed VHS, as is tracking. Design may be a factor in why the tape plays so flawlessly: both reels have extra-large center spindles, fully two times normal size, and that just could be the secret of their success (no engineer here!).<br /><br />The picture's final scene, with its brilliant orange sky against a bone-colored foreground, is tincturally reminiscent of the album cover of Led Zeppelin's [[ASIN:B00000DOZ6 HOUSES OF THE HOLY]].<br /><br />As for the movie:<br />A superior creature from another solar system that's sent to observe us, shape-shifts and is overwhelmed by the sensation of being human.

B001RJ41EY|2.0|Unless you're really into money matters and banking, I found this book somewhat boring and violent in some spots.  It has an interesting story line as far as some of the characters go, but the author delves pretty deeply into the banking business.  It suprised me because I really enjoyed Mr. Hailey's other books which prompted me to read this one.  To his credit, he does seem to really investigate the operations of his targets, Airport and Hotel for instance.

0618918248|1.0|As I write this review there has been 1521 reviews on this item. So I might as well add my two penny's worth.I like to read books like this because not to do so would be intellectually dishonest.I have always tried to way up the evidence both for and against God's existence both before and after becoming a Christian.I borrowed this book from the library and I would advise any one else that wants to read this to do the same so you are not increasing Richards Bank account .He is using this money to fund militant atheistic propaganda.This book in fact is militant atheistic propaganda. I think the reason why this book has got 4 stars is because for the most part it has only been read by those who have already been converted to the militant atheistic religion.Having read all the 1 and 2 star reviews this books arguments have been thoroughly debunked.Not that there was much to debunk in the first place. If this is the best that the Atheist's have to offer .Then God help them.I would recommend that all those who think that Richard made some good arguments in this book should read all the 1 and 2 star ratings to see that those arguments do not hold water when they are thoroughly and skeptically scrutinized.Richard is very biased in this book. For example when he criticized Mother Teresa. This is like saying(only in reverse) that Hitler wasn't such a bad bloke because he had a sense of humor and loved his dog until he killed it with cyanide tablet.I've seen Richard on You tube debating and comes across as a more reasonable person than he does in this book.In fact if you watch videos you see him retract or contradict some of the things that he asserts in this book.Richard gives some arguments in this book for the existence of God which I had not heard of before and then fails to debunk them. My faith actually came away being stronger after reading this book. I also have to thank Richard because if he hadn't of written this book the reviewers who gave it only 1 or 2 stars would not have been brought together and their recommendations I would not have known about. God works in mysteries ways.For example.[[ASIN:0385509359 Reasons to Believe: How to Understand, Explain, and Defend the Catholic Faith]][[ASIN:0754631907 Does God Exist: The Craig-Flew Debate]][[ASIN:0300164297 Atheist Delusions: The Christian Revolution and Its Fashionable Enemies]][[ASIN:1845502612 The Dawkins Letters: Challenging Atheist Myths]][[ASIN:1905887191 Is God a Delusion?: What is the Evidence?]][[ASIN:0465019374 The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions]]and many more.Atheists should realize that the more they attack the Bible and Christians the more the faith will grow. The faith has been attacked for thousands of years and this has not stopped in growing.This currant attack from the so called new atheist. (There is actually nothing new about it at all.It's the same atheism that Stalin believed and we know that lead to the persecution of the soviet Church). In fact quite the reverse very often. So thank you again Richard.

1591843162|5.0|I've been reading Seth Godin's books since \\"Permission Marketing\\" debuted in 1999. His blog is on my Browser's home page. He's the first thing I read in the morning.<br /><br />There are hundreds of good books that span across the career/self-help/business category. This book defies categorization in the standard sense. If I had to pick three must-read career books, they would have to be \\"Purple Cow,\\" \\"The Dip,\\" and \\"Linchpin.\\" All amazingly written by Seth Godin.<br /><br />Super honorable mentions go out to \\"The Cluetrain Manifesto\\" and \\"Ignore Everybody,\\" (books not written by Seth Godin) which would round out my top 5.<br /><br />If you want to achieve personal career happiness, read the first three books in this order.<br /><br />Purple Cow - understand why and how to be remarkable and/or make remarkable products<br /><br />The Dip - Know when to push through roadblocks and when to move on - a hyper-critical skill<br /><br />Linchpin - Learn how to become invaluable without sacrificing your heart and soul<br /><br />Linchpin is not a how-to book on becoming wealthy. It is not a roadmap or step-by-step guide to fulfillment. \\"Linchpin\\" describes the world of work and how the way of the artist is the way to happiness, and often, unqualified success. Art is the convenience store clerk who calls every customer by name and smiles genuinely when interacting with each customer. It's not the person who day after day enters data into a spreadsheet he was given. It's the person who designs a new spreadsheet that revolutionizes a process and adds value to the company.<br /><br />When you give of yourself and share your personal genius for non-financial reasons, you ironically stand the greatest chance of benefiting financially.<br /><br />If you never strike it rich, but if you are true to your inner genius, and share it with the world regardless of financial gain, you will be happy. And what't that worth?<br /><br />But the artist who toils and tweaks and suffers and retools ad infinitum is not really an artist. Unless the work is shared with the world, it is only a work-in-progress.<br /><br />Now I have to go. I have a product to ship.ld, it is only a work-in-progress.    Now I have to go. I have a product to ship.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|What you would expect from Michael Jackson.  The DVD shows something that most MJ fans have never seen, and that is, the dedication, amount of time, and complexities in putting together a show of this magnitude! The DVD also showed that MJ was in excellent health at age 50!!  He out-danced most of his dancers and sang all the while never acting out of breath or like he had been off the stage for a decade. Great Video...buy it you won't be disappointed!!

0545123267|5.0|I just finished reading Shiver.  It was so good I didn't want it to end.  I was really happy the way it did end though, and can't wait for the next book in the series, Linger.  This story about a 17 year old girl who loved the woods behind her house and the wolves that lived there.  And guess who she fell in love with?   You have to read this book!
B001TH16DS|5.0|Unbelievable quality. I have never seen Star Trek look as good as it does on blu ray. Has anyone noticed the tombstone says \\"James R. Kirk\\" in the Where No Man Has Gone Before episode? Perhaps this error was not discernible in the standard TV broadcast of the day.

031606792X|4.0|So now I'm done with the series.  As I've said a bunch of times before, I really have been surprised just how much I've been entertained by these books.  They're just like candy...I found myself flying through each of them, shocked at how quickly 700+ pages breezed by.  And for the most part, I actually cared about the characters.    This was a crazy book, though.  So much stuff happened, and despite the fact that the whole series clearly requires you to think beyond actual life, there was some true craziness in this one.  But it didn't distract me from the fact that Stephenie Meyer remained true to her story and her characters throughout all four books.    While clearly each of these books are Bella's story, I still found it surprising that Edward's character really didn't do all that much in this book, that most of the heavy lifting was left to others.  But the truth is, as much as Meyer has created a brooding hero in Edward, it seems like she likes some of her other characters more, as she makes them much more appealing.    All in all, a really good ending to a good series of books.
0307266303|4.0|This book addresses two subjects that grabbed my interest, how people run injury free, and the fact that people were born to run. The author's description of running in the Copper Canyons of Mexico was realistic and the danger within were vividly described. McDougall's writing grabbed my interest, probably when he least expected it, by describing his personal regimen for preparing to run the ultra; his diet and training. A man nicknamed the Bear does not fit the description of most distance runners that I have known. I have recommended this book to fellow runners for the enlightenment it delivers regarding diet, foot wear and mental preparedness for endless running.
1416955070|4.0|So I'm starting to wonder if I was a tween girl in a past life. I enjoyed the Twilight series a lot more than I expected I would (some books more than others) and now I just devoured the first book in the \\"Mortal Instruments\\" trilogy, Cassandra Clare's City of Bones.    Much as I said when I reviewed the Twilight books, are they well-written? Not necessarily. Are they enjoyable? Yes. A little melodramatic, sure, but when you combine teenage angst with demons and the underworld, what would you expect? I couldn't sleep in the middle of the night AND I read really fast, but I read the entire book yesterday.     Teen-aged Clarissa (Clary) Fray is at a club one evening when she sees three young people armed with knives stalking another kid. She witnesses a murder and winds up finding out about the world of the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the world of demons. And once her mother disappears suddenly and Clary is attacked by a demon, everything gets just a bit more bizarre.    Sometimes the book gets a little overly detailed, as there are a lot of different classes within the shadowworld, but the action keeps coming. And even if you can anticipate most of what is going to happen, it's still pretty enjoyable. I'm headed back to the real adult shelves now, but I'll be back for book 2.

1594488878|3.0|What I've loved about Nick Hornby's books in the past are two main things--they're uproariously funny (I remember at times laughing out loud when reading several of them) and they're usually populated with characters you care about, even if they're all not completely likable.  Well, after reading \\"Juliet, Naked,\\" I can say that for the most part, Hornby has again accomplished the latter, but the former, well, not so much.    Annie and Duncan are an unmarried English couple who have been together for 15 years.  Duncan is obsessed with Tucker Crowe, an American singer described as being in the Dylan/Springsteen/Leonard Cohen-esque mode.  Crowe achieved moderate success in the music world and then suddenly withdrew, to leave his fans pondering ad infinitum on the internet what made him do so.  In reality, Crowe is a middle-aged guy with too many failed relationships under his belt and he's trying to figure out what next.  And then he releases an acoustic version of his most renowned album, which turns all of their lives around.    I enjoyed this book and the characters did captivate me.  But the overall storyline was a bit more mundane than Hornby's previous books.  However, I'd love to know what happened with the characters after the book ended...too many unanswered questions!
B002U6CJCO|5.0|this is the best of the series it supposed to be part 3 but they kind of ignored the 2nd sequel which on that one he had a daughter and he was freed from the unisol experiment. To me this should be the direct sequel to the 1st one. This is van damme's best direct to video movie ive seen so far i'm not saying i didn't like his other ones (except for \\"DESERT HEAT\\" which sucked) but i like this one the best. Loads of action scenes check it out Van Damme fans.
B001F290E4|4.0|Seal, a.k.a. Mr. Heidi Klum, is one of the most sound forward R&B artists around today, and it took the help of David Foster to come up with this collection of soul classics, and he did a great job of it, too.  His takes on songs such as \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\", \\"Stand By Me\\", and \\"If You Don't Know Me By Now\\" just can't be beat. His version of \\"It's A Man's, Man's World\\"  could even rival the Godfather of Soul himself.  For Seal fans, and at least any sould fan, this album come highly recommended.
0780622650|3.0|Outside of Star Trek, there are not that many sci-fi TV serials before Star Wars in 1977.  Probably the most famous was Lost in Space, about a family of scientists - explorers who get lost in space.  And like all famous TV shows, it was eventually made into a full-length feature film with updated special effects and more depth to the science.  This one came out in 1998, and stars a cast full of well-known names such as William Hurt and Gary Oldman.  I have never seen the original TV serial, so I cannot compare them, but I will say this was an alright movie.  William Hurt was key to the movie as his demeanor and on-screen gravitas carried the script.  Gary Oldman plays a good villian, and Heather Graham makes her only appearance in a sci-fi that I know of.  The movie has some comedy, some action, and believable special effects.  However, there were better sci-fi movies from the 1990's more worth your time; such as The Matrix and Dark City.

0452289963|5.0|After reading some of the reviews, I felt the need to share my thoughts.  Wow, so many negative critics, but that is OK.  Eckhart and Oprah stated many times in the webcast that whatever people felt, good, bad, positive or negative, it is all good, not everyone is ready for this. That said, I will tell you all that over the last year I have read \\"the power of now\\" and \\"a new earth\\" umpteen times along with so many others teachings and philosophies. Yet there was something in the way that Eckhart spoke, that kept me going back to his books. Well I was on chapter 9 this last week,  when I suddenly got a Bing, then a Bing, Bing and by chapter 10 there was that casino style Bing, Bing, Bing in my head followed by a wonderful show of fireworks (also in my head),Yes I am insane, I live in this world of form don't I?  I had finally gotten the A-ha moments I had waited so long for, I now understood what everyone was speaking of, all of the books and different teacher's that I had been reading and listening to had come together, it was like a great wall of tile and Eckhart was the grout that filled in the empty spaces. I cannot tell you how so very well I am since last week.  I also know that this world of form that we live in is tough, people think we're nuts and everyone is so very full of opinions and know-it-all attitudes, but let me tell you, it is all the more reason that I shall continue on this journey with a lighter heart, a very open heart and a VERY open mind.  I can say that for me Mr. Tolle has brought me an inner peace and I thank him and God for this.  Just staying present has decluttered my mind and left a wonderful fresh feeling to doing the simplest of tasks.  Don't stop seeking people, \\"This Too Shall Pass\\".
B0015HZAK2|4.0|As I sit here listening to No Line on the Horizon (digitally), I'm prompted to read and write reviews of other U2 works.  Go figure.  I bought the \\"mini-LP\\" version of this album on vinyl so long ago.  I'd read that the band labeled it a \\"mini\\" to keep the price low since in their minds, fans already had the songs from previous albums.  I'm sure I only payed $5 for it at a mall record store (Bashford Manor in Louisville, KY).      I played the heck out of that record.  Like some others, I noticed the Send in the Clowns chunk missing from the CD version of The Electric Co and I'd read that it was due to copyright issues.  Too bad.  Until I read that, I thought I just had a bad spot on the CD.    Love this record.  I really don't like 11 o'clock or Party Girl, so I always jump past those, but everything else rocks.  Rock isn't only for young rockers, but they're usually the best practitioners.  The energy and passion are at an all-time high in these live performances.      Check it out and enjoy.  I don't know exactly where the vinyl LP is but I do have the VHS version and have converted it to DVD so I don't have to worry about tape degradation.  The tower sequence in The Electric Co is great.
B001AQR3E4|2.0|If you are considering buying this wonderful film adaptation of Anne Rice novel on Blu-Ray, don't bother.  There is no evidence of up scaling, added features, \\"making of\\" documentaries, interviews with a cast...nothing.  I think my DVD version looks better.  The film is one of the best vampire movies ever made.  Tom Cruise is dead on in his portrayal of Lestat, and Kirsten Dunst's  portrayal of Claudia is delicious.  She steals almost every scene she is in.<br /><br />Skip the Blu-Ray and get the DVD if you don't already own it.  [[ASIN:B00004RFFS Interview with the Vampire]]
0375842209|5.0|I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF \\"THE BOOK THIEF\\" A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN LOOKING THROUGH REVIEWS ON AMAZON FOR A BOOK TO RECOMMEND FOR MY BOOK CLUB.  THE IDEA OF A BOOK NARRATED BY \\"DEATH\\" INTRIGUED ME.  THEY ACCEPTED MY RECOMMENDATION AND I BORROWED THE BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY, NOT SURE I WANTED  TO PURCHASE IT.  IT IS ONE OF THE MOST MOVING BOOKS WE HAVE READ.  I'VE SINCE BOUGHT A COUPLE OF COPIES FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN AND RECENTLY BOUGHT A COPY TO KEEP FOR MY OWN LIBRARY.  IT IS A MOVING STORY OF HOW THE ORDINARY GERMAN PEOPLE LIVED AND COPED DURING WORLD WAR II AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE EFFECT THE WAR HAD ON ADOLECENTS. WHILE IT IS CLASSIFIED AS A BOOK FOR YOUNG ADULTS, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL TO GRANDPARENTS.
B000002GVZ|5.0|The first time I heard this recording was in college - 1977. This, James Taylor's Greatest Hits, Linda Ronstadt Vol. I were all the rage. Over 30 years later and this music still is as fresh as ever. I think what makes Carly Simon's music stand out is she wrote or co-wrote these songs from a personal frame of reference. She's writing about her life, and along with the hooks and catchy turns of phrase, she pulls you in for a musical glimpse - sort of like being invited to look into her bedroom or living room window.<br /><br />Hearing her duet with James Taylor on \\"Mockingbird,\\" then hearing her complain of his brutal honesty in \\"We Have No Secrets\\" will give you the feeling of having your next door neighbor complaining of her husband's prior infidelities. Not many songwriters have given us a close-up with that kind of chilling intimacy.<br /><br />This is a survey of her earlier work, and later collections include gem's like \\"Nobody Does It Better\\" from the Bond flick, The Spy Who Loved Me, and \\"Let the River Run\\" from Working Girl and her Arista releases. But this set taken as a whole is a masterpiece that can be enjoyed all on it's own. Treasure it for what is is.  It's one of the greatest compilation albums of all time.

1932100660|5.0|This book outlines the reasonable proof of a better way to eat.  While absolute proof is unattainable, the study suggests eating more whole foods and vegetables.  That should be the take away. Reducing animal product intake would be wise giving the abundence of primary health evidence from many different sources outside this book.  It's pretty obvious if you understand peer review studies that we should eat less meat.

Industrialized farming, with the systematic mutilation, confinement, transportation and cruel slaughtering of animals for economic gain, is one of the greatest daily crimes against our fellow creatures and our environment. //  Reading this book, along with others on similar subjects, should convince all people of good will to support a Humane Farming Act.

1933771690|5.0|`By striving to see through the veil of our ordinary perceptions, we can come closer to understanding our profound relationship to all created things'. So says acclaimed physician and life researcher Robert Lanza. In his book, Biocentrism, he has perhaps brought the reader a step or two closer to that kind of understanding.  Lanza shows that theoretical physicists, who dominate the grand search for a unified theory of life, may well be overreaching in the wrong direction. Biocentrism makes a compelling case that the consciousness that each of us as humans takes for granted is creating its own reality. While concepts like the quantum wave-particle duality and the Schrodinger's Cat paradox play a part in Lanza's presentation, the elements of his own personal story that are woven through this book help very much to make it accessible and deeply engaging. Lanza sees the ultimate mystery of consciousness as the essence of Biocentrism. Our physical bodies inevitably die away but, perhaps in the form of pure consciousness, we as conscious entities merely move on to a new reality. Lanza's message is heartfelt and life affirming, and also grounded convincingly in science...at least that which is knowable.  Scared of the grim reaper? Biocentrism may be the right antidote.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|In the same way that a pattern cannot be discerned with only a few points, the Fringe is a show that needs time to set up characters and build up plot points.<br /><br />So the question is - is it worth the investment? YES.<br /><br />Fringe is a show that starts off with FBI investigators, wacky scientists, a charming rogue, etc etc. But then it starts taking these archetypes and playing off of them, shifting the show from an X-files vibe to something more grounded despite the ultimate SciFi problem the show centers around. Terrorism, corruption, corporations entrenching into government (for good and ill) are issues the show deals with admirably.<br /><br />Rather than White-Hats trying to fight the Black-Hats, it seems we are coupled with a set of Grey-Hats who keep us guessing and wondering what kind of people they really are. Politics of government and corporations play a role, as many people obviously know more than they are letting on or are authorized to say. And some the good guys have spotted pasts, to the point of doing some really disturbing things they might regret.<br /><br />There are some monster of the week episodes mixed in, but these also serve to show a little more about the characters, giving us glimpses and hints of who these people - and their enemies - are beyond the war on/for terror they find themselves engaged in.<br /><br />It all leads up to one of the boldest and compelling finales I've seen at the end of a first season in awhile.

B000BSNPR6|4.0|It has become almost routine now for a number of band to put out a live release of some description for each tour they do. In the case of symphonic metal/symphonic rock crew Within Temptation this is the DVD of the tour of their Silent Force album which took their fortunes to a new level.<br /><br />Split into two discs, disc one comprises 165 minutes of footage of the band treading the boards across Europe - Netherlands, Finland and Belgium to be precise. The bulk of the footage comes from Java Island which with a nice stage, full light show etc and the interesting presence of a large cruise liner in the background of many of the camera angles certainly makes for a visually striking as well as musically excellent package. The sound quality is as good as you'd expect and the camera work is quite nice. Those fans who didn't appreciate the rapid camera angle changes of their later Black Symphony DVD may appreciate this more as there is less jumping around here and more time to enjoy the performance without constantly adjusting to the new camera angle. Extras to disc one are the music videos for Stand My Ground, Memories and Angels.<br /><br />Disc two is the home of the bulk of the extras. All 182 minutes of them. Again there is an air of quality about pretty much anything this band does so many of the interviews are somewhat interesting and some of the making of... sections are quite useful. Also useful are some of the little snippets of life on the road that make the band and their crew more human, if you take my meaning. The problem is however that all this backstage stuff is pretty painful stuff, much of it is stuff you are never going to want to watch again. I mean inside jokes on the bus, chatting while they are eating, sitting around in backstage areas, people getting haircuts.... you get the idea of what I'm on about here don't you? It's not really entertaining and it's a pitfall that so many bands fall into (although watching Jens Johansson blow up a toilet in the Stratovarius DVD Infinite Visions was at least mildly amusing). Disc two is salvaged a bit however by some extra concert footage as well as the abovementioned behind the scenes tidbits.<br /><br />But please don't let my disinterest in the minutiae of life on the road for Within Temptation dissuade you from buying this DVD. The concert stuff really is great and the indefinable X factor this band has shines through relentlessly and as a companion to the more insanely overblown (in a good way) Black Symphony DVD this is pretty much a must have item for your DVD rack if you are one of the bands fans. Dig in.us DVD Infinite Visions was at least mildly amusing). Disc two is salvaged a bit however by some extra concert footage as well as the abovementioned behind the scenes tidbits.

B002T9H2L0|3.0|I give QT's Latest \\"Masterpiece\\" if you can call it that, 3-4 stars. the movie of course is fiction,the end is good. but the movie to get there is all over the place. songs don't match the era even if it is FICTION! too long,no main character like in Quentin's Other movies. I am not by any means a QT fan. but I thought there wasn't that much gore, The Movie is A fun \\"What If\\" Scenario.It's worth renting to see for yourself. Although Valkyrie is a better movie. Would be nice to see the treatment in this movie given to Communists..With Stalin and all the Politburo in the same situation. Highly Doubtful,Hollywood would ever make such a film.

0385504225|2.0|One Line Summary: A murky version of the same kind of thing as The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />This is typical Dan Brown...some mind-boggling, world-changing secret needs to be solved by the world's expert...some really insane evil guy wants this secret for himself/herself and has kidnapped etc people close to world expert and needs help from kidnapped person's family etc, namely a brilliant female costar.<br /><br />It was still an interesting story for the most part. I enjoyed learning a bit more about the Masons and some historical aspects of America's Capital. But overall, it was a disappointment. It was cliche, the story didn't grip me. I pretty much knew what was going to happen before it happened and I never really felt for any of the characters. And the big mystery at the end wasn't that big of a mystery or eureka type moment. I was thinking...that's it? Plus, it was way too long. It could have been at least a hundred pages shorter and the climax wasn't that climatic and the ending kept going and going and going....<br /><br />I was hoping for more after a fun ride with The Da Vinci Code, but all I got was a boring version of the same thing.
0307271862|5.0|This novel is the type of intriguing novel you want while on vacation, on a plane, or sitting in front of a fire or by a pool.  It really keeps you turning the pages and interested in the characters and plot development.   Three people in my family read it, including me, and loved it.   A middle age judge has lost her way.  She is depressed, having health problems and her marriage has turned stagnant.  She becomes intrigued about the mass murder of the residents of a remote Swedish village that she has a distant relationship to through her mother.  She fights Swedish bureaucracy, which she is very familiar with as a judge, to investigate this atrocity.   She does better police work than the detectives themselves and comes up with a suspect.  When an old college friend invites her to accompany her on a trip to China where the suspect lives, she goes.  She is brought back to her idealism as a college student when she rallied behind Marxism and Chairman Mao.   Her story isn't the only one being told in the book as it weaves the story of 19th century Chinese brothers brought against their will to work on the American railroad and one of their later day descendants.   The weaving of these other plots is done very well and isn't obtrusive in the story.  It all relates to the later day quest by the judge to find the murderer.  The reader is moved across the European continent, China, America and Africa with expertise and historical facts and fiction blended together.  Only an excellent writer like Henning Mankell could do this.  You not only enjoy the story but the writer's skill as well when you read this book.  It is with great satisfaction that the judge finds her way back to health, happy marriage, and a solved mystery that has spanned generations and continents.
