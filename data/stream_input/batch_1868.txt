B00A80SHFM|3.0|Honestly, here is the problem. I know that this is a highlight album. I knew that before I ordered and got it and before I watched the movie. Until that time, I was fine with it. However, after now having seen the movie, this album is a horrible shadow of a brilliant musical motion picture. What is here is alright, but even at times, as with Look Down, you get only a bit of the song and not the entire track. It's horrible. I wouldn't be so angry if, as of this writing, there was a complete version coming out, but there isn't. So, we are stuck with an album that is literally the bare bones of the movie song line up. If I had know how extensive the cuts were, I would have ignored this. Unfortunately, I cannot send it back but do yourself a favor and learn from my mistake: if you enjoyed the heck out of the movie, buy the tracks you want digitally, and ignore this release. Until they give us a more complete release, filled with all the songs and reprises that should be on this one, don't buy this. Resist! (I do have to point out that many of the tracks are wonderful, and nice to hear. However the track The Final Battle is a joke. It's filled with noise, grunting, gunfire, and orchestra and, basically, no singing. Why was this track included, when so many superior tracks weren't. Seriously, this release is a sad mess)
B0081SPK0I|5.0|This game gets down to the point, no annoying purchases just game play.<br />It reminds me ALOT of \\"OutRun\\"  The racing game for Sega and NES!!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I was not into it for the first 30 minutes, but I must admit, it was very good. I recommend it
B00170DEM8|2.0|This is a classic in terms of the introduction of Irving Berlin's song White Christmas, but the 1954 retooling as &#34;White Christmas&#34; much better. A reminder that 1940's were a long time ago.
B001EN71CW|5.0|My boyfriend had been wanting this hard to find series for the longest. I decided to get it as a gift, and he absolutely loved it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app. I use it alot. I like that it has the percentage key and that it can keep a running total, helps great with the checkbook.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Got a really good deal, and the trilogy is amazing! comes with all the behind the scenes footage. You won't be disappointed.
B008M721MS|4.0|Decent app. Good for toddler to talk to grandparents. Easy to use, fool proof, not sure why it is making me write this review though.
0307591549|4.0|We succeed because we are happy, not that we are happy because we succeed. A positive outlook and optimism helps us be more effective, creative and impactful. Being optimistic and happy is a learnable skill. This book presents the evidence and science behind the power of positive thinking, and provides seven principles to help guide the reader to a more positive outlook.<br /><br />If you wonder if the power of positive thinking is bunk, or if you suspect that you should try to cultivate a more optimistic outlook, but you're not really sure how to go about it, then this might be the perfect book for you. The author presents basic principles and cites many scientific studies that do a great job of tying it all together into a neat, easily readable package.<br /><br />The book's key points are:<br /><br />- Being happy and optimistic help us succeed - this is now a proven scientific fact.<br /><br />- Happiness is largely a reaction to the world around us - we can use our mind to make us happier despite the circumstances.<br /><br />- To use our mind, we need to train it to look for reasons to be happy.<br /><br />- Then we can turn every set-back into a learning opportunity and literally fail-forward.<br /><br />- When we get overwhelmed, we need to focus on what we can control and set small goals.<br /><br />- To help us build the habit of happiness, we need to make it a habit, not an exercise in will-power.<br /><br />- Invest in relationships at home and at work - they matter more than anything else.<br /><br />- Your happiness radiates and interacts with those around you, so think about who and how you socialize.<br /><br />This book references some others that I have read recently, including [[ASIN:0345472322 Mindset: The New Psychology of Success]], which delves deeper into some of the principles. There is also quite a bit about how to build habits, which are covered more extensively elsewhere including [[ASIN:B005TKD512 Switch]] and [[ASIN:B006WAIV6M The Powerof Habit]].<br /><br />My suggestion is that if you are thinking about a reading a book on this topic, start with this one. It is easy to read and actionable. It may be all you need.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of variety for all age ranges. Its family friendly and keeps you interested in it for longer than most games.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I watched this once and I was not impressed, after watching this movie the second time I caught some of the subtle foreshadowing, and creative development in it's story line.<br />Overall I think it was well put together, from character development, to story-line, to the directing and acting.<br /><br />Legendary comic book hero's have already done it all, so all things considered, the movie is at least very entertaining.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Listening to music with my FiiO E6 with my Audio Technica ATH-M50s makes a very enjoyable experience even better.  So much more detail and power to my music!  The unit is nice and compact and I like that it comes with 2 little plastic attachable clips.  It's got an attractive smooth glossy plastic casing and is very light.  Charging is as simple as plugging in a USB cable.  Have been thinking about getting one of these for a while (was originally looking at the E5), and my only regret is not getting one sooner!
B008Q09K2U|5.0|Once again Nelson DeMille writes an knowledgeable and realistic account of the story he is telling.<br />John Corey is funny, honest and frustrating and each page you are wanting to get through to get to the next as you are taken on and through the minds of the Baddies and the goodies.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was all that anyone would want to read.. Charlie is so sympathetic and anyone would want to be his friend after reading this book. Favorite. Favorite. Favorite
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie was funny for both myself as well as my husband. I love Glee and immediately wanted to watch but my husband cant stand Glee. However, the humor in this movie is what makes it different from Glee.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My grandsons love this movie!  They love the Lorax and I love the concept it teaches them.  Thank you Dr. Seuss!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|First review I've written but this App is so good, I had to respond.  Just an amazing product. It turns your Kindle or other tablet into a desktop computer with all your files, pix, vids etc at your disposal.  Uses your computer to run programs. It changes your tablet into a fill computer.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|What a book!  I have not been able to put it down since I read the opening line.  My kind of story.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had not heard about this series until the Emmy Awards. Once I got the discs, my husband and I could not stop watching it.  The acting is outstanding and script for each episode keeps one guessing what will happen next.
B008BM9L72|2.0|Stupid story with stupid people in it. I dont know what kind of sexlife the author has, but makes me thinking it is just in her fantasy. The real life just works very differently ... and I really hated the poor vocabulary
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book opened my eyes to seeing myself and my husband in a different light.  It helped me to understand why we do what we do.  This should be a \\"must-read\\" for everyone.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have to recommend you read this. Just read it and you will see why what will am talking about.
B001MTENOC|5.0|This is an excellent book depicting the art of hypnosis and what happens before this life - both on a spiritual and previous life level. I found this book greatly comforting for the recent loss of a loved one and illuminating about why my life is about. It's a must-read for anyone looking for answers beyond the typical - and overhyped/misleading - routes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This the second time I have read this book. It is still amazing! Can not wait for the movie to come out
B009HEJXFS|2.0|I really liked MIB I and MIB II. The chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith was great, the humor was witty and intelligent, and the plots moved at just the right pace. I've watched both movies several times and still enjoy them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, MIB III didn't measure up to either of its prequels. It seemed that this movie was made only to cash in on the franchise, not because there was a fun or interesting story to tell. For one, Tommy Lee Jones looked terrible in this movie. He had no energy, and mumbled through his lines like he couldn't wait to get this movie over with. MIB II was made about 10 years prior, and you could really tell that time had passed. The fun back and forth between Smith and Jones that I expected simply wasn't there, and it seemed like the magic was gone.<br /><br />The plot was also a real disappointment. It seemed to have obvious holes and plot devices that felt like they were there just to fill up two hours with content. After about an hour I quit watching this one. I suggest you stick to the first two movies and forget this one was ever made.
075669812X|5.0|My 6 yr old loved the book. He likes to read all the details about his favorite character while he watches the show
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I used to be a big player of these classic style games.  This will take you back and provide you great fun.
B009DT98RK|5.0|Peter Frampton is still the 800 pound gorilla in the room. The guy can run circles around most players and young musicians should take note. He knows how to surround himself with excellent musicians too. The band he has assembled here (Stanley Sheldon - Bass, Rob Arthur - Keys, Adam Lester - Guitar, Danny Wojciechowski - Drums) are all cream of the crop and they mesh together perfectly. A well oiled machine. He even gets is son (Julian Frampton - Vocals) in on the action.<br /><br />The hi def transfer is sharp and I was particularly impressed with the black levels and contrast. I also appreciated the fact that you feel like your at the show and not watching a music video being constantly jerked around. It's shot the right way by Pierre & Francois Lamoureux.<br /><br />The DTS Master Audio mix is well done, smooth, warm, tube like, no shrillness here.<br /><br />All are having fun here and it shows. You will too. Enjoy...
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Never heard about this Goo game for anything previously but after playing I will confirm this is great game.<br />Very well developed, filled with lots of challenges and enjoyment.

B000Q6GUWU|4.0|This is definitely a departure for director Greg Brewer from his previous feature starring Terrence Howard.  It's a Southern tale of redemption in which 2 individuals cure each other by the power of the Creator.  Both Jackson and Ricci are excellent and the HD transfer on HD DVD is excellent and life-like, so the same can said for the Blu-ray as well.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland presents an outstanding storyline.  The cast seems to fit very well together and the acting is just outstanding.  A must see for any 24 fan!
0345803485|5.0|I'm a business graduate student who never gets wrapped up in fictional books. I mainly read informational text, articles, educational textbooks, ect. But my sorority went crazy over this book and insisted I read it. I ordered it since I'm not no longer working as I enjoy my first pregnanct, and I CAN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. It's against my style, but yet I'm in love with the book. I will soon be ordering the other two! And the condition of the book was PERFECT.

B00ARAO0WM|3.0|Te movie was what I expected, plenty of action including numerous chase scenes.  The plot was thin and the characters lacked development, but it was a fun ride.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|It was very good- keeps you reading to the end. I like the author and his characters. I liked it.
B0033TJATW|5.0|1 of my favorite movies from my childhood, they used to play this on MTV all the time..so happy I own it

0547884591|5.0|I really like the was Mr. Ferriss approaches cooking: more of the hands-on way rather than the overcimplicated method used is most of the cook-books. And that's just the cooking part, not to mention all the other goodies inside.

B002KKBV8I|5.0|Geomag was a big hit on Christmas am, the kids played with it all day long. It was a great toy for adults to play with too!
B008G59IBI|5.0|I love Tre! This album really rocks. I can't really add much more than what others have said in more depth reviews except that it completes the triology musically. Without this CD, you may feel disappointed in the album Dos. Dos didn't make sense musically to me until I bought Tre. Now all three fit perfectly into a music trio of perfection.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|thought it would be....<br />Combined enough western ideals with the S F touch.<br />Just one main lapse when it came to the 'arm weapon' idea...<br />They could have gotten tons of them off the dead aliens they killed.....
B008G59IKO|5.0|When I first previewed Dos on Amazon, after buying Uno, I was slightly disappointed. I felt like these songs might have been the B tracks of the triology that they put on one disc. Then, I previewed Tre, and was blown away by those songs, and bought. Feeling as if it would in complete to not own the full Triology, I bought Dos.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did! The songs on Dos completely make sense when listened to in between Uno and Tre! Alone, Dos felt like as if I was reading the middle chapters of a book. After hearing Uno, then listening to Dos, and then Tre, it fits perfect musically.<br /><br />Give it a try, download it, and give it a few listens and you'll hopefully agree :)
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I streamed this movie but it froze at the end. I e mailed amazon for a refund and they are usually really good at this sort of thing. The movie itself was really good, but I had to give it one star because I could not see the ending.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I love this movie and had to buy it! This dvd is jam packed with both the color and black/white version with some extras. 5 stars!
B006QQ77F8|2.0|Although Kubrick was a master fim maker, this film was constrained too much by the moralistic taboos of the time &<br />cinematic conventions. So, despite the courage in tackling pedophilia & incest ,Kubrick's film did not stand the test<br />of time for me.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Amazing book and movie! Had to buy this to be able to watch it whenever we wanted to. So glad I did!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Funny how Al Gore run's around in a private jet, has numerous cars in his entourage, has a mansion that uses more power than a small city and then expects everyone else to believe HIS hype or fictional unsubstantiated claims that have been disproved by some very well know scientists, and the so called facts Gore uses have been found to be flawed and misconstrued / misinterpreted.<br />Global warming based on fossil fuel use cannot be substantiated or confirmed by science but what can be is the fact that governments the world over have poisoned this planet knowingly with the use of Nuclear arms testing - over 2500 thousand nuclear tests since the early 60's, radiation fall out across the globe causing cancers of all types, chemical pollutions not only in and on our food but in the water we drink (fluoride), and of course manufacturing poisons in our water ways and in our food source, recently confirmed in Tuna and other species caught in Antarctica. Sorry Al Gore, the only green you're interested in is the green backs going into your bank account you hypocrite, and that's a fact. Carbon trading is a scheme dreamed up by Al Gore and his cohorts and its the very same people whom are making all the profits from it (Banks etc).
0937381888|5.0|Had just bought this book at a local bookstore, but for twice the price.  Ordered the book from Amazon and took the other one back for a refund.  Great book for the home brewer, is the most cited book by experienced home brewers, and the author is top rated in the field
B001GMH8SI|1.0|I went to watch this Blu-ray DVD for the first time in my Samsung BDE65002A Blu-ray DVD player (with less than 40 hours of use on it).  The movie plays but the speaking audio cuts out part way into the movie.  I bought this movie in advance for a family showing on Christmas Eve.  Needless to say...very disappointed!<br />(Note that I tried other Blu-ray movies afterwards just to make sure it wasn't the player or connections.)<br /><br />*** UPDATE:  Amazon customer service took great care of me.  They replaced the DVD at no cost.  Five stars for Amazon's customer service.<br /><br />As for the movie, two thumbs up.  Watched it a couple times.  Makes me want to leave the rat race behind and head to Alaska and be one with nature.  ;-)
0060531053|5.0|Bought this as a back up for the Palmer book &#34;How yo Brew&#34; mostly to get a different prospective as I am just getting into the home beer brewing field.  Full of good tips.

B004YW4L5K|5.0|I have read this book 3 or 4 times now, and it never gets old. Definitely one of Gaiman's best, Love it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a really good book. The first time I read it it just pulled me into the story!  The reason that I gave this book 5stars is that this boy named auggie was born with his face not looking normal and he has to learn how to make friends and to feel normal. And at the end of the book he learns that any one can accomplish any thing! I think that any one who has not read it yet should!!!!!!!! ¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love this movie so much! The ultraviolet digital copy is pretty cool too..now i can watch it anywhere, whenever i want.
B000001FYL|5.0|Love this album and a must for the Bon Jovi fan.  Another side of Jon Bon Jovi that shows the versatility of a great performer
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and time consuming. u should get it. if you like arcade games then you will love this game. get it! !!!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Was a little skeptical at first but it turned out to be a great game. It's free so it's worth at least a try if one doesn't like it then just delete it. I personally loved it. An going to keep playing it.
1419703692|5.0|This book gives an in-depth comprehensive look at the trilogy. From the script stages to marketing the films, the book covers all the bases with interviews from cast and crew, concept art, and behind the scene pics. It's like watching the special features on a DVD/Blu-Ray, but with more info. Highly recommend this.
B0014BR6KG|5.0|Fabulous detailing.  Ages 3, 5, and 8 all love playmobil sets.  Plenty of items in this set.  Daughter immediately wanted to add water.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|perfect game to exercise your brain ...very easy at first but it only gets harder and even more fun to play ..
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The first 3 are better...hopefully they do another with Jason Bourne.  Renner is good and believable, Weizs is good as well.  But script had gaping holes.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really liked the whole crime solving element to this game. The graphics are great and overall it's just challenging enough. I finished it in a single day because I was compelled to keep going with it. Worth the cost, I bought the full version after trying the free sample and after reaching the cut off point at that needing to keep going lol. Not something I'd recommend to anyone under 13 but anyone older who likes hidden object games and puzzles go for it! Waiting on the next one!
B009K0P10K|5.0|LOVE IT, We started and kept watching from season 1 to 2, finished it on amazon great that we can use this

Let's just say this is nearly as awesome as the movie! Blunt the Knives and Misty Mountains are so wonderfully excellent; it's worth getting the album just for those two alone...then you get all the other songs as a wonderful bonus and the pics and maps in the case. I'm as happy with this album as Bombur is in the pantry.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book is heart breakingly amazing. Full of love true love passion and strength of family. It is a great book and amazing read.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Oh how I anticipated this DVD release since I couldn't go to the theater. The movie is excellent, but I must say I am rather disappointed in the setup. There is a DVD but no special features; whereas the BluRay has barrel-fulls. I can watch some on a friend's, but for those of us who don't want to switch to bluray yet it's kind of sad. At least it was a decent price for the two and the film is awesome! On both BluRay and DVD. I am not too keen on 3D and am grateful they release without (though that digital copy would've been wonderful) and still release them on DVD. As for the movie, buy it, you'll want to watch it over and over. Excellent cast, beautiful scenery and graphics, wonderful adventure story, it features archery, and jeepers is the music Great, and best of all it's set in my old ancestral homeland (with a close tartan)...Scotland!

B007N5YIUS|5.0|I've played every version of Angry Birds, and as much as I've enjoyed playing AB, it was getting more and more difficult for Rovio to come up with new versions that weren't just cosmetically different. Okay, Rio was different, but that was more than a year ago. Now we have Angry Birds Space, and I love it. Having to figure orbital trajectories and the effects of gravitational fields has made it a completely new kind of challenge. I've even noticed that in some levels, birds can get stuck in Lagrange Points (these should be familiar to sci-fi fans).<br /><br />With its 7-inch screen, the Kindle Fire is a great platform for Angry Birds.
B0091574VI|3.0|The movie experienced a couple of interruptions during playback which was annoying. The movie was nicely done and the production really captured well, the chimps, in their natural habitat.

B004SIIBGU|3.0|The ebay app works well for doing basic searches on ebay. However, I can't find things like the special sales (such as the vault sales), and usually end up viewing the regular site in my web browser. Figuring out certain things about the app can be confusing too. I have yet to figure out how to search within a category and refining your search can be a pain compared to the full site.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|I got this because we love movies of this type that might never have made it big but have many great actors and tell a great story, such as A Love Song for Bobby Long, etc.  Tommy Lee Jones and others played wonderful parts, but Levon Helm, former drummer and singer for The Band,  was wonderful in his short parts==and the main reason I bought the dvd
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This was one of the best purchases I've made this year and I'd very well recommend it to anyone into gaming, movies or with a small and portable desktop.<br /><br />It's durable, well made so far as luggage goes and went with me pretty well on my trips out of town for work. The HDMI connection is perfect with my PS3 and 360 and also functioned decently when I needed a second monitor once. (On which note, Windows 8 is pretty terrible and worse when paired with the screen of the G155.)<br /><br />Everything straps down securely and fits well enough. The straps to hold the system down could be thinner and more sturdy.  Maybe a plastic buckle could have been used rather than velcro. Also, where the 360 is concerned, there isn't exactly enough room for the power brick, other cords and controllers. Taking the controllers in separate luggage is a minor inconvenience if you're picky with organization though I suppose we can chalk the problem up to Microsofts' inefficient designs and not the GAEMS system.<br /><br />All told, it does everything asked of it; protects my system from dings, enables play when I otherwise wouldn't get to and it delivered more kangaroos than I ever asked for.<br /><br />I hope everyone got that reference.<br /><br />The system deserved every last star I could offer and I'm absolutely happy with my purchase. I think you all will be, too.
B0093STBP0|2.0|This is a cliche fest from the very start, a light and slight offering about a veteran chef battling the new owners of his restaurant, who want him to offer more modern dishes. He is about to give up in despair when he stumbles across a gifted yet wayward amateur chef, who happens to be a great fan of the old man's. The two of them unite forces and blah blah blah. Seriously. This lacks any sense of originality whatsoever and is marred by some poor performances.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|So Great later I'm buying another one and we got it fast also great job lets do it again yea.
0062068423|2.0|This was my first foray into the new-style popular Scandinavian world of thrillers and must say I was not overly impressed. Harry Hole the detective is a troubled alcoholic and, unfortunately, isn't particularly interesting. This is the first problem with the book. The second is a plot which makes little sense. An aggrieved Norwegian ex-Nazi has plans for murder and decides to draw unnecessary and unwanted attention to himself by ordering a particularly powerful sniper rifle. As Hole starts to peer into the nasty world of Norwegian Nazis, we are taken back to World War Two, where Norwegians signed up to fight for the Nazis. Chapter after confusing chapter follow as a group of Norwegians fight against the Russians and wind up in different parts of Europe causing mischief. As the book crawls along we realise that one of the old Norwegians seems to have two personalities and this causes an already unconvincing plot to take on ever more water. I know something of Norway's wartime history but even that didn't do me much good as Nesbo wanders through clearly significant moments but doesn't really do much to explain why they are important. Another major challenge for the reader is that Hole seems to be working with a murderous colleague and doesn't seem too upset by this. By the time we get to the end we don't really care what happens, to be honest.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv.  Drama, intrigue, romance, period piece.  Its got it all.  There are so many characters to enjoy and the show just seems to keep getting better and better. I can't wait for season 3.
B008B9JSD2|2.0|After 22 minutes this film is perfectly poised: the cardinals have chosen an unknown to be the new Pope and as he is due to step out on the balcony of St Pauls to greet the adoring crowds, he decides he can't deal with the pressure. From this moment on the film loses its way very badly. The main challenge is that we know nothing about the new Pope and don't really care about him. The Vatican calls in a leading psychologist to examine the reluctant Pope-to-be and he decides to spice things up by arranging a volleyball tournament between the various cardinals. The director then decides he is Fellini and the film makes less and less sense as we progress tortuously towards the end. This was a big missed opportunity.
0307887960|5.0|friends recommended this book and diet.<br />it is so easy and so far I have lost 20 pounds.<br />easy to travel have to be careful during the holidays.
B0047VLFS4|3.0|Although the cinematography was very good and mesmerizing, the story line was confusing. I felt like there was a lot missing that I should inherently know. It was as if the movie was intended for audiences that already knew their history of that time period. It's a shame that this is the case because the Alexandria library held volumes of information that was lost forever. I don't think this point came across in the movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|easy to use and navigate. As the weather changes this app stays abreast of all alerts and changing conditions. Great app
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Couldn't stop laughing...hilarious, bawdy, irreverent, witty, and a bit touching.  Definitely for those over 18, but of course, we all know that most teens have mouths that we over 55 never had.  Streamed it via my Amazon prime from my watch list.  The movie quality was excellent as was the sound quality.  For those who enjoy witty adult humor, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.
B0044XRIMW|4.0|The movie quality is really good. I was able to download it and view it instantly. I will definitely use this option again.
B0073PZIBQ|5.0|This is a great movie.  The performances are solid.  Everyone is very funny.  Definitely rent it, you'll love it.  Steve Martin and Jack Black make a funny team.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Great addition to your collection as well as a cheerful christmas movie to watch with loved ones.  Toot toot toot
B004GBFF5Y|4.0|A very funny movie!  Solid cast.  Zach Galifianakis killed it again.  This guy wears crazy like a big fuzzy sweater!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Of<br /><br />Happy that I have Swype and a pickle that looks like a rabbit suck in a stock<br />Merry Christmas
B0095R76EW|3.0|Not his best, but still funny.  Jason Segel seems to pull it off no matter what movie he is in.  Worth renting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use and read. The #'s are very large on it. I was surprised how it looked like a basic calculator.
B008JAG2AA|3.0|Not as funny as the first one, but not bad either.  Worth renting.  Not much else to say about it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was a page turner.  I couldn't put it down.<br />  The book is a true story of survival survivor and I loved it.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|This movie moved slower than turtle riding a snail uphill against the wind!  The acting was terrible and the action was weak.  There was nothing I enjoyed about this movie aside from the cool steam punk outfits!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Its a really good app like it better than any other out there buy best haa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha there are a really good app store and butt head of the movie full of the movie full of the movie full of the movie full YouTube video of the movie is not the only thing that you are a lot of people who eason the movie full YouTube videos on dragon
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|A quirky and fun movie.  Definitely entertaining.  Solid performances by all.  We enjoyed it very much.  You won't regret seeing it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I really liked it because it helped me with a lot of stuff and things I needed to do thanks yall
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|The movie was ok.  Did not blow us away.  CG was pretty good.  Worth renting if you have a big screen TV and decent surround system.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The book is great and very detailed I really like the other book you make I have read almost all of them :)
B0088WFZQG|5.0|What can I say, this thing was a total advertisement for the US Navy, but I loved it!  Ignore the acting...they are real Seals, not actors.  Just enjoy the action.  Looks like a video game in parts.
B005COO1X6|2.0|pace, but a bit thin. Haven't you written this story before?? Buick 8, Christine, Trucks? Great use of syntax, though.
B008COD5UI|3.0|A typical teenage party movie with some pretty funny moments.  Crazy hot girls!  Not exactly the parties I remember in high school, but would love to gone to one like this.  Heck I still would!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think it's it's  a  really  interesting middle school book. Especially to me because guess what? I'm in middle school too.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|A funny and entertaining movie.  I was thinking my girlfriend would enjoy it more than I would, but we both liked it.  Don't be affraid guys...

B004H1V5RU|4.0|I purchased this globe puzzle about a year ago and my kids and visitors have all given it a try...<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Fun to watch and control the ball through the 3D maze<br />-Nice design<br />-Sturdy<br />-Fun<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Although I like difficult puzzles, this one seems almost impossible even after many tries (which is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5)<br /><br />Has anyone completed it with less than 200 hours of attempts ?  :-)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Friend got me interested. AWESOME game reely addictive good game and love raising the dragons. Couldn't be a better Dragon app
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The writing and the actors are amazing.  Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul deserve emmys. The scenery and camerawork are also awesome.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Gooooood book it is good I liked it and I hope you will to you should read the series! Bdjfhfbfkfb @
B007IXWL2C|5.0|what can I say.  It lived up to the hype.  For me the second book was the best book, but this book tied it all nicely in a little red bow. Take that however you would like.  :)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can be a bit confusing trying to keep track of all the characters peogress, but still a very good read for any lover of  fantasy.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|A fitting end to the trilogy.  It's really a 4.3/5 but I gave it 5 stars due to unnecessary ratings from other people.  While it was a little long-winded in some parts it really brought a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Must read for any lovers of the HBO series, it continues the original written storyline which almost seems like an alternate reality to that of the TV series.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Gameloft has done it again! I have bought most games like this and it by far is my favorite. This might become my favorite game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved this book, but wish it would have taken off sooner...  it was hard to get through book one, but after that, watch out!
B004EFYZ1C|2.0|Said could be wallpaper. No where does it show in settings put it as wallpaper.<br />Main reason wanted was wallpaper. Otherwise the moon info is ok. Creator stated not good for a wallpaper on kindle fire when he commented on this review but i didnt read this anywhere is the description when i downloaded it.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|Tracey Thorn hits it out of the ballpark with this CD.  Yes, it's &#34;seasonal&#34; but I'm sure I'll listen to it any time I feel like hearing wonderful songs and music, sung with Tracey's perfect voice.  This sounds like an EBTG offering, in the best sense.  It's been in the CD player since getting it weeks ago.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This novel takes you through the freshman year of Charlie, an interesting and different teen. Very honest and realistic. Setting is in 1992.
B00170DEM8|5.0|White Christmas is one of several great songs in the movie with a score by Irving Berlin.  It used to get a lot of play around Christmas time, but there are portions of the movie that would be considered very politically incorrect (black face song, Mammie that takes care of the Inn), but they speak to the time period of the movie's production. This is one of my all time favorite movies
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love it! Good way to kill some time. I will continue playing it in the future. Fluffy dragons are super cute!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|An easy and interesting read. I couldn't put it down!! A good day read. I admire her resilience. I hope her privacy to raise her family is respected
B005SV9X22|5.0|This dvd concert takes the 'on lookers' inside her world, then when the concert starts, you are THERE....One of many concerts, I own, but this gal, screams....I am the one to overcome and here I sit, as queen....LADY? YES! I LOVE MY LADY GAGA! FOREVER, yours, Lady....I shall, always, love your music and songs, FOREVER!
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|The DVD was in great condition, and the 40th anniversary is a great edition to our collection. If for some reason you've never seen Mary Poppins, treat yourself now!
B009E3EY38|3.0|i bought this box set hoping for great extras on the bonus dvd. all it is them rehearsing the show from a long distance away and some nerd ripping them in tampa, fl in 1973. the cd,s are good but listen to the originals. just buy the blu ray of the show and save your money
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|It was a good update of the effects but not so much of the storyline.  It had a hard time keeping my attention.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|Michelle is just amazing in this movie.  She captures the essence of Marilyn beautifully without parodying her.  And I love Emma in anything and everything!
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas-themed movies.  I think Will Ferrel does a great job capturing the wonderment and innocence of a child.  I wish more of his movies were family-friendly.  The story-line is pretty typical of this genre, but it's infused with enough humor that I found it very entertaining.
0792844890|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for my wife.  She loves the movie, as do I.  Quick delivery!  Haven't watched this copy yet, but assume it' fine.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show! Addicting and leaves you wanting more and more.  Very few shows outperform TV's standard expectations on what makes a show.
B0016MZFXS|4.0|This was a gift for my wife, a Starwars fanatic.  She uses it regularly and seems to really enjoy it.  The sounds it makes are fine to wake up to.
B005IQZB14|3.0|The book was poorly written and arogant.  She made very stupid decisions in her life and on her hike and I don't think she should be glorified over it.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|I bought this because I am a huge Emma Watson fan.  I was really pleased at how good the other two girls in the movie were, and how good the movie, itself, was.  There is a long and fascinating interview with Emma after the movie ends.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|This was a nice collection, however it would have been nice to have the complete soundtrack. Great movie, but go see the theatrical production for the complete experience.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|i bought this as a gift for a friend! very cool blu ray! lots of action and cool stuff :)
B00005JKDR|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie! A great movie that's suitable for kids and adults of all ages! Looking forward to part two!
B0016OMFNY|5.0|When you listen to the mix of voices on The Traveling Wilburys you will know right away that you must this have in your cd collection.  Gentle rocking and easy listening, this is music you can enjoy day in and day out.  This stellar supergroup soothes the soul and helps put aside the reality of the day.  This is a good example of if a few super stars are good more are a constellation.
156224003X|4.0|This book is about silencing your \\"inner critic\\", enjoying the music you play, concentrating on one specific area of playing until it is understood, and believing that mastery is attainable. I feel that this book goes great with the Bill Evans documentary \\"The Universal Mind of Bill Evans\\".<br /><br />I don't think that all of the material or meditations in this book will help everybody. You'll have to read it with an open mind and decide what is helpful to you and what is not. But I'm fairly sure that there's something in here for many, many players.<br /><br />I actually got a lot from this book. I personally see this helping me with my live performances and general anxiety more than anything. The meditations are helping calm my nerves for gigs and my upcoming college audition(s). From time to time, I feel like I'll never be like the top players and there's so much to study and I started too late. Effortless Mastery has helped me see how to remove myself from that anxiety to actually get to work on improving my playing and ENJOYING THE PROCESS. That last part was the real key for me. I'm a much happier musician now.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Great movie inspirational and heart warming. One &#34;I like to watch every year...it never gets old.<br /> You know when a person has said all they want or need to say you shouldn't be forced to add more words.
B006ZZAN60|5.0|If you are a fan of Loreena McKennitt this is a treasure.  I know I will watch the DVD many times and will enjoy the CDs although I already have some of the songs on other playlists.  Enjoy!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Pac man is one of my favorite games growing up so this is totally perfect for me. my children love it too.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone.  This book has helped me to accept death of my wonderful Oma.  I truly believe this book helped me to grasp the meaning of death and to accept it.  It is not a permanent place somewhere else where we won't see our loved ones again, but quite opposite.<br />very good read and spiritually motivating!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have no complaints it is working great and the pictures are so clear. I am totally satisfied, thank you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven  I loved it & think it is his best so far.Will this one be made into a movie? That would be good.
B0086700CM|5.0|they played this on my phone but s way better on the kindle. they couldn't be happier thank you tons
B0017TYPIG|5.0|Great American classic, I have loved this movie for a long time and blu-ray only makes it better. One of Paul Newman's best roles.
B005HSL626|5.0|it is a good app because sit is free and it is called fruit ninja it id a good game
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is crazy amazing! It has been such a long time since I have found a new author that can put out such a stunning world and characters. For any fantasy lover, this book is a sure fire way to lose some sleep, and put off that cleaning for a day or two. Seriously, read it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is an awesome app. I had no problem with this app. It works perfectly and I recommend that you get this app
B006GWO5NE|4.0|sometimes you spend a few more dollars and it delivers over the long list of cheap competitors... this cord does that and more, you could string up a deer with this thing!
B002RZZIXU|3.0|I've read a few William Boyd books and really enjoyed them, but found this one disappointing. I see it's been adapted for TV, maybe I missed something.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I wish I could give this a million stars that is how highly I think of it.<br />I recommend this to any movie watcher who enjoys out of the box, inventive and quirky films. I had some members of my family view it and they didn't admire and \\"get\\" this movie, however; I am completely enamored with it.<br /><br />The story line, the actors, the setting and Wes Anderson's vision is magical, other wordly and provides a view into a more simpler time where technology didn't dominate and control the world. Even though there are many \\"A- List\\" actors featured in this movie, the true focus of the film is on the two young lovers Sam Shucusky and Suzy Bishop. This movie offers an escape from this complicated and ever-changing world to the simple Island of Panzance- an imaginary island that is so quaint and beautiful.<br /><br />I guarantee this film is worth watching not only once, but many times. Please try and have an open mind. Love the characters, embrace the oddities and become a part of the creative genius that Wes Anderson offers in his amazing \\"Moonrise Kindgom.\\"
B004QO9ZVG|4.0|Can't say too much about this book without giving too much of the plot away. I'd love to have given it 5 stars ,but maybe you'll understand why not, when you read it.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I waited a long time before trying out this series, and after a few episodes I was hooked.<br />Fans of Firefly will thoroughly enjoy this series for Nathan Fillion's performance alone, Mal is better than ever!<br />The writing and cast are fantastic, and the overall story arc is so well thought out, dropping you clues and hints along the way.<br />Very engaging, funny, and fun.  Start by watching the first episode to fully appreciate this work.<br />I will be watching all the other series as well.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|My family and I loved this movie, it was just so adorable....My son is a huge dr. seuss fan!!  Great Morals!
B003QCCS36|5.0|I had heard one song at my exercise class and fell in love.  When I got it and played through it the first time I liked other songs a bit.  After I played it a couple more times I absolutely loved it.  His voice is a bit like Joe Cockers (not sure I spelled that right).  It's rather raspy and sexy.  I'm very pleased!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought this for my mother because she recently got a kindle fire and her old cover was awful. She got this on Christmas eve and she instantly loved it. The stand up cover works perfectly. It did not wobble or tip over it was perfectly stable and she said it is the best case she can possibly have for her kindle
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I loved this book for many reasons. It had enchanting language, a wonderful plot, and a depressing outlook. I couldn't bear to put it down until it was finished.
B008M0NDOK|1.0|I bought this to work with modern combat 4 and it doesn't !!!????? So it works with MC 3 but not MC4 ?? I'm so disappointed def would never buy from game loft again
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think people should get this app cause u get to make a playground so I highly think u should get this app it's free.
B005JABSB6|4.0|bought 3D TV but the content is not readily available. i am please that the glasses work,<br />i dislike that the glasses need to be charged with the television.
B004EK926K|5.0|It's very beautiful to watch. The story has added emotion too which is refreshing. It's also funny at parts due to Jim Carrey.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Sweet and full of action.  this movie was better the the first one.  totally charged with the some of the best chases.  The drop down to the ground level with the flying car on the none flyers was sweet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The only game I play on my electronic device is solitaire  and this one responds fast and is easy to program however I wish..Love It...ALOT!!!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|The It's A Wonderful Life Two-Disc Collector's Set is a great addition for your Christmas DVD Collection! I'm so glad I purchased it.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|I love this movie!!  I've seen this numerous times on TV, but I thought it was time to get my own non-edited version.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I've read the first 2 books & just can't seem to get through the 3rd book. Not sure I will bother. I get it...they are in love.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I love this unit for backup during power outages.  Very handy!  If I had a better understanding of the abilities, however, I probably would have ordered one with more power, although I am very satisfied with this unit.  I highly recommend this (or, an increased power unit) to all.
B0086700CM|2.0|okay so I normally love this app but when I downloded it for my zeki tablet, it won't let me turn to get coins. I have it on my mims ipad amd it works fine on there. maybe its my zeki
B005EVVESM|5.0|I love the sound of Maroon 5 and was happy to see this was available on sale.  As with the other cds, almost all the songs are great!
B003BWERF8|5.0|I bought this for use with an iPod Nano and a set of wireless headphones.  Product is small and unassuming and quickly connected with the wireless headphones.  Doing exactly what it was supposed to.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just what I was looking for on my new Kindle Fire! It's extremely user friendly, navigating is a dream, although the download was a little difficult.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Classic gameplay brought to the tablet at last, very addictive easy to play especially when your on the move or even curled up in bed on a cold winters night, adapted very nicely for the tablet market by the developers.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|This years show is really over the top.  Knocked off Breaking Bad for me after it had me for a while.  The sophistication of this production is astounding for a television program.  Beyond the depth of many films as well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Enjoy playing this game.... easy to learn.  I like to play while my family is watching Tv........can be rather addictive!
B007SGM084|5.0|Once you start  you just can't stop reading, you don't want to miss a word and you always want to keep track of what's going to happen with Christian and Anastasia.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought it was a great game and I have been addicted to it ever seen I downloaded it.Its awesome.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Engrossing easy read that kept me reaching for more. Great story that left me satisfied at the end. Didn't want to put it down until I finished  it!
B009O07NDY|4.0|This review is for the CD soundtrack special edition.  I really enjoyed the music, although I can't compare it to what's in the movie, since I haven't seen it yet.  If you liked the Lord of the Rings soundtracks, this has a similar sound, but with some new themes mixed in.  I give the music 5 stars.<br /><br />As far as the way it's packaged, I have two quibbles.<br /><br />  The first, which is just a personal preference thing, is that the discs are in stored in two sleeves, one in the front & the other in the rear of the case. One speck of dust as you slide them in or out will likely result in a scratch.  Since the sleeves are open at the top, (as is the whole case), if you store the case upright,(book-style), that increases the chance that sooner or later, dust is going to get in.  It's just a minor thing really, but it bugs me.<br /><br />The second is that the first time I opened the case, the booklet which is supposed to be secured inside fell out & left two big staple marks in the middle of the map design which runs across the spine.  The case itself is very aesthetically pleasing, but it would be nice if the booklet had been attached with more than just two staples. Perhaps this is usually adequate & mine just didn't get stapled right somehow. (The insert booklet itself is of a very nice quality, with pictures from the movie & notes on the compositions.)<br /><br />Anyway, I give the case 5 stars for looks & 2 for design execution.<br /><br />So if you're wanting this as a collectible, be warned that the quality may not be the highest.  If you're buying it mainly for the music, I don't think you'll be disappointed!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All time favorite novel. Will read again and again! So well written and ending leaves all questions resolved. Incredible and would recommend!
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|My wife and I get the LEGO advent calendar every year.  There's usually a good amount of filler days but this year was particularly bad.  So many odd ships and &#34;weapon racks.&#34; I hope to see better items next year.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This movie was surprisingly good after it got some pretty bad reviews. With a 51% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, I expected it to be a disappointment but this movie was engaging, action-packed, and very similar to the other Bourne movies. Its not a carbon copy of the 3 previous Bourne movies, but it still has incorporated the aspects of them and had it's own little twists. Great movie. I definatly recommend it. I'm a Bourne movie fan myself and this movie is another great installation.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's as good as the first book and has me eager to move onto the third book of the trilogy.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|Great app, not sure if the technology is there yet but with the keyboard and the ability to scribble works fine. Would like to see a graph paper option.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|downloaded this app and immediately found it very useful and easy to use. love that it lets you know how much battery time you have based on which task you doing.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|it looks very good I'm downloading it right now so cool I just cant wait to play it looks cool
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Perfect for someone who loves good music and isn't into the music of today.  Got rave reviews from the recipient.
0156012197|5.0|This book is an international hit. I love it and got it as a gift for a little girl for the holidays.
B007HACDLK|3.0|The book is entertaining but only in a so-so way. The characters are not well developed. Since this is my first Vince Flynn book perhaps the character development was done in earlier books of this series. This book didn't hook me like other authors, Nelson Demille, for example. Not. very believable.
0470913029|2.0|I bought this book because a friend of mine swears by this diet. The diet was difficult to follow for me.  The suggested meals were not things I believe the average person is putting together.  Like crab legs for breakfast.  Some of what the author says makes sense to me but restricting carbs isn't really anything new and there are more forgiving ways to do so than this.  No dairy, no flour, no grains....no thanks.
B0053O89WY|5.0|It arrived quickly and the package was in great condition. Overall, I was very pleasant with this experience especially for the cost (reduced price). I only wish the Blu-Ray was reduced in price.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series just keeps getting better!  Show still finds fresh new ways to thrill us.  word word word word word (stupid min)
B004HX0P2Y|4.0|Funny, fresh and typical Bruce Willis  sarcasm. Helen Mirren is not someone you think of when you think &#34; dangerous&#34; but here she is both beautiful and dangerous. John Malkovich is his usual &#34; cool&#34; funny self ! Mary Loise parker is funny and wow beautiful!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|It's a fun game. It runs very well on my Galaxy S III.<br />The graphics are great, the game play a little slow but entertaining nonetheless.
B005LAII12|5.0|This is just a no briainer! Everyone must own this product! It is one of the best movies for a pure good laugh with friends and family!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|I thought this movie was awesome! The only thing I didn't really like about it was the ending. I wanted to know more about them. Overall a great watch!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The best diary of a wimpy kid book I have ever read.<br />I loved the book.<br />Such a great book everyone should read this book.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The novel brings you intothe world of Cyber Warfare. As only Vlancy can, he brings you into a highly technical enviroment that you can understand.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It shows how our goverment works and if it can be fooled like this that is great.  Even though this is fiction.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|We watched this movie several times during the holidays. We never get tired of it and glad to own it finally!
B002TWWOHE|5.0|Dunno how I heard about this series so late in the game. Pretty good stuff. I watch it free on netflix but they were down last week due to an amazon crash. How ironic.
B0088WGBC8|5.0|My husband liked this. As for me, not an action film buff. But easy to order and had a new movie to watch.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This movie is great for both long term fans as well as newcomers to this sci-fi adventure.I really hope we get to see more of this in the future!!!
B0091XT22O|5.0|Love this movie! I am happy to finally own it. It is very convenient to have in my video library
B005LAIGRS|5.0|I have been wanting to see this ever since it came out.  I love Denzel Washington.  He is one of a kind actor.  Great job Denzel as always.  I am very pleased with the Safe House.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My granddaughter who is 9 loves the Friends Legos. She follows the directions and gets it done! Keep making them
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Cooking Dash works really well on the Kindle Fire. The graphics are great and the new restaurants are new and exciting. This game has always been fun, now it's better. I highly recommend it.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|This was a sweet, fun, well written movie. I did not try and read too much into it. It was just entertaining without having anything too sad about it. I wondered if Bruce Willis wanted to make something his children could watch!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I've read it mAny times before<br />The creativity is tremendously amazing! My congrats to Suzanne Collins on the whole series.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Not only is this book well written, but it absorbs you into Pi's story to the point that you believe it to be real. The ending, as well as learning from outside resources, tells readers the story is not real. Discovery this had been disappointing. But after thinking about the message, the symbolism, and the creativity of this novel proves that the story had not been disappointing but an amazing tale. I highly recommend this novel.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This was a awesome book. GOOD JOB. I give you a  5 stars. Jeff Kinney you are the best author ever.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is a very great set for any fan of the movies. I gave it as a gift and he loves it!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun to play, I enjoy trying to figure out how to best use the birds. Doesn't take long to master.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved all three books by this author.  I can't believe he turned in his manuscripts and died!  I long for more from him.  So sad!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|must see! great film really enjoyed it- mostly appropriate aside for language.. would def watch it again! you should see it
034580404X|5.0|Very easy to read, imagine and intriguing! I can't wait to read the next EL James book. Great price too!
B0076DEJMO|4.0|...the return of the Bloody Nine, Old Feuds re-visited, and a solidly open ending made this for a wonderful<br />read....
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love this app! It is great for the jigsaw puzzle lover.  Would  like to see more puzzles added to this app.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|I got this for the entire family to watch on Christmas Eve. Parents, kids, etc. all enjoyed it. Eastwood was a little bit less cranky than in Gran Torino.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|who dont love yul brynner. My first look at si-fi when i was young. love it then and still love it. Great Great movie
B003274QH6|5.0|Excellent gift for someone who likes &#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34;.  My brother-in-law was thrilled to received this! Tip--this show is not for anyone who dislikes violent, R-rated shows.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|Finally got it!, for $6.  Downloaded it to my computer and I had it play the 3 bonus tracks listed and they are there and they played, despite other people's mention that the three exact same songs weren't there.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Excellent gift for someone who likes &#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34;.  My brother-in-law was thrilled to received this! Tip--this show is not for anyone who dislikes violent, R-rated shows.
B0096DZKZC|2.0|I'm sure I would enjoy this game, but I have been trying to download it for two days.<br />Until I can play the game I will gladly give it a higher rating.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Excellent gift for someone who likes &#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34;.  My brother-in-law was thrilled to received this! Tip--this show is not for anyone who dislikes violent, R-rated shows.
0345529057|5.0|First of all, 20 dollars for this set, is a fantastic deal! Each of these books are around 1000 pages long and they suck you in from the first chapter. Instead of spending 20 dollars on some other book just buy this set of 4, it's worth it!
B009AMANBA|5.0|If potential viewers knew that this movie was about the passing of the 13th amendment to the constitution, it may not have been as compelling. As is, to me it is a most excellent well acted historical drama.<br />Remember the opening scene of that other great wartime  Spielberg epic?  This one starts in the same dramatic way. Lincoln then settles down & that is about the extent of the action. This movie covers the last months of Lincoln's life & the Civil War.<br />  It would be difficult for any actor to portray as indisputably great an American as Lincoln<br />without moving pictures & sound. But Daniel Day-Lewis does it so well & captures Lincoln as I imagine him. Sally Fields does a fine job with an easier task. She plays Mary Todd Lincoln as she rapidly descends into madness.<br />  In this version Congressman & abolitionist, Thaddeus Stevens is key to the passage of the amendment. This difficult part is played by Tommy Lee Jones in what may be the best performance of his often uneven career. He must control his passion & snarkiness,  in what he says & doesn't say as leader of the radical Republicans. He must sway oppositional  Democrats to pass the amendment. Presently our president is a Democrat & the recalcitrant party is the majority Republican congress. See the parallels? In any case 147 years ago things worked out. Slavery was legally abolished in the United States for all time. The bad news was of course, Lincoln was killed a few short days after Lee surrendered to Grant.<br />  I'd say this is the best movie of the year, period.
B0033TJATW|5.0|muy chevere me gusto hay que tenerla  en toda ocacion, la compre mas que todo por que esa era la portada de la pelicula en los ochenta lo original es lo original gracias.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This was a big hit as a Christmas gift for my teenage grandson. He was eager to go try it out as soon as he opened it.
B0059XTV7Q|5.0|Well done film done with superb direction from Madonna and an outstanding Making of the Film feature. Definitely worth buying and a great value,
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I found this book to be predictable from beginning to end but I still found myself interested enough in the main character to keep reading.  If you are \\"blown away\\" by the ending then you clearly have not read or watched that much science fiction.  To me the author tried his best to come up with a unique twist and just came up short.<br /><br />However, I still give it 3 stars because it was an easy read on the plane.
B009EAALII|3.0|Only 14 songs featured out of a concert that had well over 20 songs and only five tracks were featured from Beyond the Sun recording. Performance of all tracks are first rate though.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was interesting however it dragged in several chapters. I would have liked more of an ending. I'd buy it again though.
0452289963|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my  son and simultaneous given to me by a professional peer and first read at that seemingly fortuitious  time. Recently I re-read it and consequently have gifted it to loved ones in hopes that it is a matter of&#34;  &#34;when the student is ready, the teacher appears.&#34;
B000R7HY0K|4.0|It is what it is...Campy, funny, terrorific, and pretty much worth the money...Just don't expect &#34;The Sound of Music&#34; here.  It's entertaining gore, blood & guts, just the way we like it.
1577314808|5.0|Purchased as gifts after firsrt reading ANE. This is written differently- mostly in Q and A format. Not as smooth a read in my opinion but pertainent information is present none the less.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|It is what it is...Campy, funny, terrorific, and pretty much worth the money...Just don't expect &#34;The Sound of Music&#34; here.  It's entertaining gore, blood & guts, just the way we like it.
1878424319|4.0|good.smooth reading.seems to cover several decades of ages of readers gifted to 20 s-things and 40 s-things and read with insight gained by 60 s-thing
B00192IV0O|3.0|Hey, I'm 63 years old and still like what the &#34;youngsters&#34; like...Always have!  But, to be perfectly honest, I bought this CD for a friend as a gift and they like it very much!  That's why only 3-stars...
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|In this book, everything bad keeps happening to Greg. I give this book 3 stars because after a while, all of the bad things get tiring.
1878424505|4.0|I bought this for a friend and haven't really heard much about it otherwise...So, I'll say I like it, maybe ask her if I can borrow it because I've heard it's a pretty good read...Plus, me, along with many others, can use as much help as we can get!!!  Wouldn't you agree!!!???
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book is just absolutely amazing. I read it when I was in the 7th grade a few years ago, loved it then, love it now. I recommend anyone to read this if you love a good mystery :)
B000F3AAUW|4.0|It's a CD I bought for a friend and they like it very much.  I'm 63 now and DO love the current &#34;good&#34; songs the youngsters listen to these days...CB isn't my total cup of tea, however, but that's just me, an old fart, saying what he thinks...lol
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was amazing just like every other  book, I advise you to get it! O<br />It's finishes the series :)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|He did it again!!  I have read most of his books and this one proves to be another GREAT book!!!!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|pretty faithful to the book; just a few incontinuities.  obviously they are planning a second movie because the end was just... the end of the film, not the end of the story.  i'd say read the book first; it will help make the film make more sense.  The Hunger Games series, while I have criticisms, is one of the many good examples of young-adult literature out there these days.
B0018BB20W|5.0|As a life-long Moody Blues fan (and I'm talking their entire life span not just mine) I rate this their best.  Oh sure, Sur la Mer comes close as do stand-along songs over almost 50 years like Deep or Other Side of Life but this concept album stands the test of time.  While it 's true they're not in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame yet - ludicrous - someday that oversight will be corrected.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Can't stop playing this game. Very entertaining, easy to learn, addictive, and would recommend this to anyone. Husband is hooked too.
0425252868|5.0|This is a great book which contains german history, real insight into aviation, good understanding of pilot's emotion. As a former US Naval pilot, the book should be recommended to  everyone.
0761169253|5.0|Student I tutor recommended this to me and I in turn have recommended it to others. I like books like this that help you look at yourself and creativity in a new way.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My son loved it. Don't play it on carpet! lol.....My son loved it and he was 5 when we bought it. We have lost all of the pieces of course.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is sooo much fun.  There are different animals that you can ride on to give you bonus points.  The game has enough different parts to keep it interesting.  Very addicting.
1595828753|5.0|I'm very happy with these books, they leave off right where the animated series ended so they are filling in the story gap between Avatar: The last Airbender and The Legend of Kora.
B000ARFNNM|1.0|The DVD was zoned for England or Europe, not the USA and does not play unless I change the zone; then none of my US DVD will play.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is very interesting. I didn't. think that I was going to like it but I did and I can't get enough of it.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Great cast, excellent script and stellar performances no wonder it won best picture it simply deserved it! Authentic locations, art direction, costume design and mood also make this worth watching....makes you feel like pulling out a smoke and sitting back except fortunately for our generation we realize this kills you. That said loved the smoke filled atmosphere!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I own a blackened of these and love it!  However I kept losing it in my purse and in the dark I couldn't find it cause it was so dark.  So I ordered this one because it's light pink.  It showed up fast and in great condition.  However when I put this on my phone it would not allow me to switch my iPhone from ring to silent and vise versa.  This is a great product and has protected my phone letterman the dumb warranty.  I will still buy another, this was just one bad one out of a bunch of good ones
B009AJD5E0|5.0|I believe a lot of critics didn't like this prequel -but it left me wanting more. I watched the last 15mins over and over again. Ridley Scott really knows how to create tension and fear in a scene and despite everyone saying it doesn't live up to the original in my opinion it doesn't have to, it is a new and thoughtful concept for how it all began. That said I found it as riveting and scary in parts as the original.<br /><br />What I have always liked about his work is the strong female leads and the fascinating way he creates the creatures with this sort of hybrid sexualized male female anatomy and behavior. He always picks fine actors too, Noomi Rapace is great as the lead and Michael Fassbinder is excellent as the villainous but likable humanoid. The visual effects are superb and work to tell the story creating a fascinating environment, mood and space.<br /><br />If you enjoy thought provoking films then watch this, a couple of throw away characters bulk up the cast but  as I said it left me wanting more.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love reading Vince Flynn and his main man, Mitch Rapp's adventures. I'm sure our country has men like this.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This second series is better than the first it seems to fall in place faster and is really well produced with great sets, costumes and atmosphere. Also some good twists and turns, Jessica Lang steals the show again as Sister Jude along with James Cromwell -just such fine actors, -who, no matter how far fetched the story line they become the characters convincingly.<br /><br />The entire cast works really well in this series I have enjoyed every episode
B001NA6096|3.0|With these characters, your own imagination is far superior to the reality of their first romantic encounter.  I liked being able to guess what they might have said, done, thought, and felt about each other over that 10 years apart rather than having it spelled out for me in great detail here.  Watching the specificities of the first movie before the sequel deprives you of the universality of the experience.  Ultimately I liked them much more in their 30's than in their 20's.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|This is the greatest tv show ever!!!!!!  Give you comedy, drama and pure entertainment.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B009POHHRG|5.0|An incredible read that is worth every penny! I highly recommend this book for every single barman fan out there.
B0087ITBT8|5.0|I took my dad to see this movie. A couple years back I lost my mother, coincidentally my mother and I went to see A mirror has two faces the last movie she released where Barbra was the star. In one scene, halfway through the movie an incident happens and it changes the dynamics of this movie. Anyway, I sat there at the end when others were laughing and tears were rolling down my eyes. I can remember similar situations with my mother, I loved her but I'm also a gay male, I wasn't the only child but the distance between my eldest brother and I (I'm the baby) is 10 years. I also was the gay male so I can understand the story plot very well. Would I see it again, I have, this time alone, still cried at the end but it was a good cry. Now don't get me wrong the ending is not sad, but I loved my mother, she was my friend and as we get older they tend to become our friend, just wish I had more time with her. Excellent movie, really!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is a great way to connect with friends and family.And a great place to exchange information and socialize. Facebook is a wonderful way to communicate to the masses.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Keeps my kids entertained more than movies on long road trip's<br />And when I'm able to get my hands on my tablet its a fun game<br />To play
B002DQLGHU|2.0|My friends--all adults, whose intelligence I respect--really liked the movie. I thought it was so cheesy that I won't ever watch another Harry Potter film. Blech.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is a remarkable story of how some rescued ancient manuscripts changed our world and made the Renaissance the revolutionary period it was.  It also is a wonderfully concise and convincing argument in favor of the Epicurean philosophy and cosmology.  If what I write sounds dry and academic, The Swerve is NOT.  Indeed, Greenblatt has made this story into a gripping tale, a page turner.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is interesting to read a book about a kid in high school after going through high school myself and thinking about how different his life was compared to mine or other people I know. I liked the time period I haven't read many novels taking place during the early 1990s. I liked the style it was written in. At first I thought it was a diary but then it seemed he was writing to a specific person. It made it easy and fun to read.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|the book is so thrilling and it's filled with really juicy secrets from the girls in the books i love the series and i have recommended it to alot of nm friends and if i haven't i do recommend it to you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was a great movie I watched it probably five times. They had great characters with all different personalities that meshed together to make a very comical movie. Loved fat amy
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A very fun app. Plays great on my fire hd.  i would say this one is definately worth your time
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Works in a pinch I carry this when I'm hunting for quick touch ups.  Works as expected light and compact great gift idea.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|A movie for all ages showing a strong female role  model for girls. Who stands up for what she believes and is able to have the courage to correct her mistakes.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I bought this for my daughter. She absolutely loves this group ! And from the way she has been playing it, I think it's a good thing !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a progressively challenging and addictive game that keeps your brain working.  My children enjoy the game and so did their grandmother.  This should be fun for a wide range of age groups.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The interaction between the characters is so funny at times you really need to be able to pause the movie to stop laughing.  Good special effects.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day after my husband turned me on to original Cross Me. So addicting; I cannot put it down! Even better than original Cross Me. 5 Star app :)
B007MDB548|5.0|This movie is really cute.  Good famly movie for all ages.  A little romance in this one which was a nice surprise.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I am only 11 and I have kindle fire hd 7 inch and I would definitely recommend you to get this book. But I finished it in 2 hours so... pretty short book.
B00003CX8Y|3.0|Very fast shipping.  Picture quality dragged a little.  I'm not sure if it is the dvd or because it is a remake.  Ok, not great.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love almost anything that Rod Stewart produces. This CD is just another example of his singing talent. I hope that he'll continue to create great music.
1451695195|2.0|This story and Dr. Alexander's belief in the reality of his near death experience is interesting; but quite deceptive. Having read a great many accounts of the near death phenomenon, I was rather put off by his use of the title: \\"Proof of Heaven.\\" He offered no such thing, and now I see he has tried to escape responsibility for it. I doubt he is trying to escape from the royalties this extra bit of puffing has provided him.<br /><br />Without a shred of empirical evidence to give credence to his account, the fact that he is a neurosurgeon provides us with no more basis to believe than if he were a carpenter. The most logical conclusion one can make from his account is that the infection that almost killed him also caused extensive brain damage. He admits as much, and that alone could account for his visit to heaven.<br /><br />I did not give this a rating of one because it was quite well written. I got my money's worth. Did he do that himself?
B006E4QCXU|1.0|Um I just downloaded this app on my kindle fire and there aren't any settings options. I can't change the color or gravity or anything  I was really excited for this but now I'm extremely disappointed.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|The movie had some really good moments.  Not one I would watch over and over.  Overall the movie was okay.
B00A7CF1QY|1.0|The Borne Legacy is copy cat writing that lacks imagination. Is hardly worth watching.Lacks a plot and what it does have is hard to follow. Save your time and money - avoid this one!
B0063GORYU|5.0|good quality spider solitaire. quick, clear, fun to play. be good if showed statistics of players game. makes an interesting change from ordinary solitaire.
145210655X|5.0|Admittedly I've never really watched Star Wars, but my man is a HUGE fan. Got this for him as a stocking stuffer and he  liked it. I read it and thought the pictures were adorable, but of course didn't &#34;get it&#34; like he did.
0345529057|5.0|My husband wanted to start reading this series and this is an AWESOME price for the first for books.<br /><br />He's about halfway through book 1 and loving it already :)
B004XNPQUO|3.0|A somewhat fun game but again, after awhile, became boring and frustrating trying to figure out the angles for the ship. Some people may like it though. It was a free game, afterall.
B009E3EY38|5.0|My husband really wanted this deluxe edition. He loves Led Zeppelin and was super pumped to receive this!!! We watched the DVD and it was awesome.<br /><br />Great gift for a Zeppelin fan!
B009YJEKJK|3.0|It was very nice to hear Olivia and John sing songs again-but it has a lot of talking to each other, very informal type of production. Now the duet with Tony Bennett was Outstanding and very well done. I also liked the Old Lange Syne song at the end. The rest of the album was just so so. Some of the songs sounded like they were talking and no new twist on the old favorites.<br /><br />I did give it a 3 star rating because Olivia's voice is wonderful and the Tony Bennett number. It is worth the money though and do recommend you purchase it-but don't expect a fantastic CD.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|He's already got a built in fan with me, but I'm not one of those that thinks Anderson walks on water or anything.  Not really a fan of Life Aquatic or Royal Tenenbaums, but Rushmore is one of my all time favorites, for instance.<br />I found this to be quite charming.  I love the idea of a child fantasy about young love and adventure come to life, if you will.<br />Odd that so many concentrate on the \\"quirky\\" side of the movie when the story itself takes over in my opinion.  I recommend it.
B003L77G06|5.0|In this day and age, we all need something to laugh about, and Modern Family delivers! Take a break from life and enjoy!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Simple game that holds your attention.  Smaller levels are simple enough for a seven year old while larger grids are challenging for adults.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love HP.  What I would like to know is, when I watch the movies on TV there is much more to the film than the DVDs I own. I would like to know if these are directors cuts or, I guess, complete movies with everything in and nothing left out. With all of the extra film time that I see on the tube? Does anyone know??
B009HEMW4W|5.0|You know, the only way this could have been better is if Michael Jackson were still alive and costarred in this movie as Agent M. But since that's not possible, I guess this is still a pretty cool movie. I gave it 5 stars because they've saved the galaxy from the bugs in the last one, and hell, if I saved a galaxy from a race of giant cockroaches, I'd perhaps want 5 stars too, even if the stars are being applied to a newer movie without a galaxy that needs saving from the race of giant bugs.<br />Let's take a second to mention Prime and Amazon's streaming. I'm an Apple/ iOS guy, and most of my electronics are Apple. I'm also a Prime member and enjoy streaming my Prime subscription on my iPad, my Mac Book Pro, even occasionally my iPhone as well as through my game consoles and Apple TV onto my HDTVs. Amazon makes the process very very simple. You just download the app and use it to store your downloaded movies or to stream free, rented or purchased movies. Because I can use Amazon movies, shows, all video on my iPad, I'm happy to check between Amazon and Apple when I'm interested in purchasing or renting a movie. I like the ability to check between different streaming apps and get the best deal offered.<br /><br />The other little perk which has been popping up on Amazon Prime a lot is the free credit for slow shipping perk. Amazon sometime offers Prime customers who choose it a credit to be applied to video or tv streaming purchases and downloads. For example, I purchased quite a few things during Christmas. I no longer worry about buying my Amazon stuff in one &#34;shopping trip&#34;  since I have Prime. So I may place 12 orders over the course of a couple of weeks. On the orders that would be eligible for 2 day free shipping with Prime, I've been offered a credit if I choose the standard 4 or more days shipping. You know, the one that historically they've always said would be almost 2 weeks but arrives in like 3 days usually. That one. On stuff I wasn't worried about getting quickly I would do it. I racked up $6 in a couple of weeks and used those credits to buy a movie about some aliens that hang out on the Earth with The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Loretta Lynn's husband. Or something like that.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|This is a great new album for Taylor.  She's breaking away from her Country roots a little more, and playing more Pop oriented songs.  Overall a great new album.
0321543726|1.0|This book takes a long and tedious approach. It's hard to learn from. Not recommended.<br /><br />I suspect the problem is because the authors have taken their lecture notes, dumped them into a book and then just kept adding more material. The editors the also need to share some blame.
B008M721MS|3.0|After a recent upgrade to Skype, it has stopped detecting the # key press while in call mode. In some IVR numbers I have to press the # key to make my choices during the call.<br />I have checked the same with the Skype app on my other Android phones, it is working fine. Looks like this issue is with Kindle Fire HD only.<br />Anybody faced this issue? any fix in the pipeline?
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book is AMAZING!!! Cute book I would recommend this book to teens such a good book about a teen romance
B0076DELIG|4.0|I just like the way Connelly weaves his stories and pretty much hides the end result. Bosch seems so real.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|As long as granddaughter is happy I am happy. Would recommend for any child who loves monster high doll and is younger than seven
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|In every other app my kindle orients appropriately except this game. I wish I could rate gameplay, but alas, I cannot get more than 10 seconds in.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Wow 790 reviews... For those of who you said something negative like \\"worst movie, no story line, etc...\\" I'm sure there a few people whom this life is pretty close too. And I think we can say that for a large group of people they didn't see this movie for the story line. For what it is I think it is pretty great, in fact I think they should have added a few more \\"dance routines\\". If you like the cover then you'll probably like the movie...
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Little slow starting, it a good family movie. I brought the DVD after reviewing, I would recommend for family viewing.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read a lot about heaven and near death experiences, and this is the real thing! We worship a loving God, and will be in his presences one day! This author tried to describe the experience, but was at a loss for words. The angels that swirled around him were not formed, they were &#34;it's&#34;, and the swirling  made music. This is the closes description to the bible description I have ever read. This brilliant surgeon chose to share his experience even though it was totally against all of his beliefs and training. Thank you Dr. Alexander!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|i love Kelly , she can sing anything, and sing it well, i loved all the songs on this cd and that is rare
B004LROUNG|3.0|I have always enjoyed reading Grisham's books, but he will never write as well as he did in the beginning. It is as if he is writing as an after thought, just to put a book out to keep his name out there. To me he wrote like he needed the money in the beginning, and now he needs no money. I love details, but he has written so detailed that he even lets you know when a character sigh's! I would tell people to skip this book unless they need an extra light book to read!
B000SEJHRA|5.0|After years of thinking of reading Sedaris, a friend strongly recommended this book to me, and I'm delighted he did. Sedaris had me laughing often, relating to his stories and characteristics. I read this book, and now I'm hooked!!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This wasn't my favorite  book because I like books that are like a story but overall this book was pretty good
B005LAII08|5.0|Very good and pretty movie.  The picture quality is amazing everything is so clear and bright.  The story is a good and unique,  very enteraining both young and old would enjoy.  Great for the family.  Great buy.
B003TNW044|5.0|The perfect christmas gift! My brother is a big fan of friends and absolutely loved this product! I highly recommend this!

B000VHMF0A|4.0|I couldn't believe this cd was priced so reasonably.  Now I have the classic album from the master whenever the reggae mood hits me.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|Final Freeway 2R is a Fun game that has NICE CONTROLS and you can select Driver to race.<br />PROS:<br />1l. CONTROLS can be modified to suite your taste and comfort level.<br />2). The Graphics are old school but very Nice, clear and functional.<br />3). Music is pretty cool and Sound Effects are very good also<br />4). Game Play looks and feels realistic (even the crashes) Ha-Ha.<br />5). Minimal, Safe Permissions and NO INTRUSIVE ANNOYANCES or Ads so far.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1). Car SLOWS down periodically in the middle of game for no apparent reason on my Xoom Tablet.<br />2). It would be nice if the Graphics were a little higher resolution.<br /><br />Overall, a Well Designed app that is Fun to play and has Good Replay Value.  Others have also had the problem of Car Slowing down during race so the app needs a Fix for this.  The car will speed up again if you pump the peddle a few times.  I hope they will Fix this with an update.  I like this game and think it would appeal to most people (who like racing games) of all ages.  I would recommend it.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I really like this.  Its challenging but not impossible.  Somehow it keeps my interest and is also relaxing.  Instead of words, you are filling in boxes to create a picture (like a bunny etc)  Once you get close to finishing you can see the picture and make adjustments.
0060899190|5.0|I am an avid Post Secret reader. I check the site every sunday and love the books as well, this just adds to my collection!
B000FBJEL0|5.0|What else you can expect from Jonathan Kellerman, well a continuous page turner. The only issue was that I could not turn the pages as what I was reading was a Kindle edition :). Not only I would highly recommend this book for all the thrill, simplicity of the characters and the great language but I would also recommend Kindle PaperWhite. I was quite anxious before buying that and was real concerned if it would be able to give the reading experience which you get out of turning the pages but now I can't keep it aside.
1400052173|5.0|Great book.  Although written by a scientist, she had the insight and heart to tell the story of the woman whose cells<br />led to the discovery of many cures.  This is an amazing book with implications for us today as we contimplate privacy issues and what sort of financial repercusions exist in the selling of cells.  It was a great story for our Book Club to consider.
141659521X|5.0|I was very happy to have gotten this book.  It was one of the better ones Vince has put out in a while.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Can't view more than a dozen posts. Rest of news feed does not load. Very disappointing.  Makes app pretty poi fleas.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|It was an amazing book. I'm still trying to comprehend it. Simply amazing and nothing less. Potato potato potato potato
B0076DELIG|4.0|Thought that Michael Connelly returned to very high levels of mystery and intrigue writing .. A real good read that captures you from the very start ... Nicely done
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|This was a gift for my brother and he seemed to like it.  I don't know if he has had a chance to watch it yet.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I received this for no cost when I signed up for kindle,  It is a great book and I am enjoying reading it,  downloaded great
B0037VNX44|2.0|This movie missed the mark IMHO. There should have been more back-story psychologically to be able to flesh out this otherwise sociopathic, egomaniacal jerk. I found it unrelentingly violent and disturbing.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|Was the same price as in Black Friday  ads elsewhere!  It's a really good movie too!  You can't go wrong with a good love story.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|This was such a slooooooooow movie, and full of old people sex, which was just disgusting. . Great movie for really old couples like your grand-parents, horrible for anyone else.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's all here, will provide hours of entertainment over and over.  Good price too!!  Anyone who loves Star Wars will love this!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I sent this cd to my girl friend and she loves this album and she cried because sound garden has finally re-united and made an awsum album
B001KZG99A|4.0|wish it will have cc or subtitles in other languages, will help a lot when ur kids are sleeping and you are up for a movie night.
030758836X|4.0|I haven't read a book so engaging in awhile!  Loved the twists and turns, and the &#34;evidence trails&#34; - but (trying not to be a spoiler!) am hoping that the ending means that perhaps there'll be a sequel to this exciting novel!
B00735HGQ6|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but the extremely narrow focus was a bit boring at points. The narrative is primarily an internal process, as Harold walks and meets some people along the way. There is a brief critique of society, when the media and followers find Harold and idealize him. He begins to unthaw emotionally, as he meets a range of other people and has empathy and compassion for the common human condition. He reconnects with himself, through a process of remembering his own past, both painful and some joy. The main story line is reveiled towards the end of the novel. I found the characters somewhat two dimensional, but I prefer more dialogue, complex narratives and character development. I would recommend the book though. It's interesting.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|I first saw this movie a few years ago as normally find it hard to watch older movies as they are not as exciting as most movies I have grown up with in today's age of technology. I could not stop watching it and it has become one of my favorite movies now.<br /><br />I mostly bought the blu-ray to watch with my grandparents. They enjoyed watching a film that they remembered being new.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lot's of fun!I could play it all day long.  absolutely love the variety of games it has. never gets old.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|I didn't think it was as good as the first two! Too many unrealistic aliens! I would not and have not recommended this movie to anyone.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book gives you a thorough history lesson while keeping you entertained. Great read!  I only suggest that you try to read the series all in a row so you can keep the characters straight.  This isn't possible yet, as the third book isn't out yet. So a re-read may be necessary!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love it.<br /><br />I can't wait for the movie to be out, great read, great end to the trilogy loved it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As I have said above, an awesome book to finish off the series with a jaw dropping ending. I would recommend this to anybody who loves drama, action and romance.
B009FBX5M0|1.0|Received this as a Christmas gift. NO Adele song and no theme to 007! Loved the movie, hate this ripoff. Really I could just cry, so unfair and fake.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Great movie.  Boils down to how we come to terms with getting older and the effect on US! Old school, hands on, in your face, versus using a computer to project a players prospects
0060899220|5.0|I recommend this to anyone, whether you have worked in the restaurant business or not.  If you dine out, good insight to the way restaurant owners, managers and chefs think.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I think this is kelly Clarkson's best.  The music on here is beautiful and she's obviously got some serious talent.
B000MRA5NS|1.0|DVD does not work, very poor quality and packaging was tampered with.  Seems to me to be a pirate dvd
B0091LS07E|5.0|You can't go wrong with this CD.  It is beautiful and has some fun colaborations on it.  Alicia's voice is exquisite.  Highly recommend.
B007THA4FI|1.0|If you are looking for a dismal and depressing view of humanity, this is your book. I was a pre-teen/young adult when the Harry Potter books came out and had high expectations.  I was very disapppointed.
B006O6EOII|4.0|I love how posable the Monster High doll are.  The only downside of this, and reason for 4 stars is that their body parts are prone to falling off.  I think she has really cute features, hair and eyes and I also appreciate that she's not outrageously busty.  The skate wheels actually roll and I like her helmet and safety pads.  Very fun doll!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The book starts off slow but over all a great second book. Ready to read the next one. Really impressed.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|The music is fun and upbeat, just be ready to fast forward due to some language, depending on who is listening.  I really do think this is a talented group, and enjoyed each song very much.  The sound is new and yet reminiscent of a generation of bands long past.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Movies don't get much better than this. I could say more (lots more) but I won't spoil it for you. Just watch it!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very easy read, interesting and sexy. Opens the doors to those who live a life of sadism. I definitely encourage reading it
B00AMBH70S|2.0|one deep secreat government is enough, now we go farther under ground and the motor cycle action to unbelievable, not real story a lot of piece together  from past movies
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Its a great dictionary and it shows all of the literatural parts of life.I would recommend this to the younger generation.What I really like about it all is that it was not only a great dictionary,but it shows all of the most important parts of literature.
B007XB4FPK|5.0|If you are not familiar with the lore of this album or the band's first album start with Holy Mountain.  If you can get lost within the riff  you will love it.  However, it may not be your cup of tea.  A very unique a experience and not for the inexperienced.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This novel is truly a page turner! I fell in love with this book from the get go! It's different from Sparks other novels but surely does not disappoint! It's a wonderful book with well developed characters and a very well thought up plot. It's still the usual North Carolina setting but not your typical love story. Alex and Katie both have scars and they slowly come together with some help from an unusual friend. Definitely a favorite of mine, I just wish it didn't end!
B001NHNG64|4.0|OK I like Jack Reached. He fights the bad guys and wins. But how many times must he be recaptured, makes an error,  misjudge someone, or be confused to make the book last long enough to satisfy the publisher ?  And how far can the author go with a conspiracy nut megalomaniac fat blonde Hitler toward a  character whom we all want to see Reached kill. I can't wait to read the next one to answer my questions.
B008M721MS|5.0|I love it because I can talk to my family and it really awesome to see and talk to people it totally awesome go ahead by this a some app.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|This movie was just okay I could do with never seeing it again.  Thought there would be more to it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book in one sitting, it was too hard to stop.  I felt like if I stopped reading and picked it up at a different time it wouldn't have had as much of an impact on me. This book made me feel more emotions in its 213 pages than in any other book I've read.  And it was so relatable!<br /><br />Best money I've spent in a while, worth the read definitely!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|A very good product for my needs- simple to use and tells time in a very clear manner, wish all watches were as good as this.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I rarely say this, but this movie would have been better if they cut some of the action scenes.  It just went on and on and on... still it was better than  90% of the other movies that came out in the last year, so it gets 4 stars.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading the Wool Omnibus, and I'm floating. Amazing, visceral, powerful characters caught up in an epic search for meaning!<br /><br />The birth of a great science fiction author is a very special event, and WOOL puts its author up there with the greatest Science Fiction writers - those who write (and wrote) books about real characters, searching for meaning, searching for their own truth, fighting and losing and winning and - above all - grabbing readers by the throat and carrying them on an amazing journey.<br /><br />Wool goes up on my electronic bookshelf, along with a few select read-them-again-and-again-over-the-years Science Fiction novels, right between Alexai Panshin's RITE OF PASSAGE and Robert Heinlein's STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND.<br /><br />Thank you, Hugh Howey!<br /><br />Vanessa Grant
B005LAIIJY|4.0|One thing you know for sure when you go see a Quentin Tarantino movie is that, regardless of how good or bad the movie actually is, for sure it will be entertaining.<br /><br />\\"Django Unchained\\" (2012 release; 165 min.) brings the fictitious tale, set in 1858, of Django Freeman (played by Jamie Foxx), a slave who is bought and freed by Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz). Schultz is a bounty hunter and Django can help him track down three brothers. Meanwhile we learn that Django's wife Broomhilda Von Shaft (played by Kerry Washington) is the 'property' of Calvin Candie (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), the owner of a large cotton plantation in deep Mississippi. Django and Schultz devise a plan to free Broomhilda.<br /><br />Several comments: the movie is a blistering indictment of the old South in general, and slavery in particular, and in that sense makes the same points as Steven Spielberg's Lincoln movie (albeit coming at it from a very different angle) about the inherent evils of slavery. In a way one could say that these two movies are different sides of the same coin. At times \\"Django Unlimited\\" is wildly entertaining and outrageous (but outrageously funny), and when it works well, there is no better movie-viewing experience. Yet at the same time the movie is over-long, with stretches in the second hour of the movie that simply drag on and falter. This is as far as I can remember the first time that I have encountered this in any Qarantino movie. The theater where I saw \\"Django Unchained\\" on Christmas Day was absolutely packed and the audience was hollering and hooting at times, when certain scenes played out well, just fun, and you simply cannot get the same experience watching a movie like this at home. Last but not least, there are several memorable performances in the movie, one of them from none other than Don 'Miami Vice' Johnson in a small role as Big Daddy, but of course Leonardo DiCaprio's over the top performance of super-baddy Calvin Candie is unforgettable. In all, \\"Django Unlimited\\" is must-see for any Tarantino fan, but I feel the movie could have been even better with some tighter editing.s unforgettable.

0385536828|4.0|Sweet Tooth is not my very favorite of all McEwan's novels, but this one is interesting and challenging.<br />Lots of British information -- not necessarily easy for an American reader. But fascinating with a great twist at the end.<br />I recommend it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. Good storyline, good graphics. Loved having the zoom feature and no penalty for missed guesses in the hidden object scenes. Looking forward to the next one
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Rovio, you've done it again.  Another great app!  HD graphics and very cool.  My son says thank you for creating Angry Birds.  He's a big fan!
0763644765|5.0|My daughter is starting potty training now and she loves this book. She asks for it and laughs and points to the potty. It has really taken some of the fear out of her and opens the coversation up (as much as that is possible with a 2 year old). I suggest this book for all parents starting the process. Good Luck all!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love this game because it's fun and challenging ( I add two stars so far). The achievements are fun to do ( three stars so far I added one star to the score) the awesome blade upgrades ( I add a star to the score so four star so far now). The Zen challenge which has a fun challenging stuff ( I give one star so five stars!) I give a 5/5 staring
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A little gruesome. But a great read and a great mystery. I have already bought the second book in this series.

B009KUANWG|5.0|I think that Adele did a fantastic job writing this song - but more importantly, Amazon made purchasing and downloading it extremely easy.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie, it was really funny at times. It has a depressive sometimes disturbing under tone, but, isn't taken too far.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Great reading - great story. Easy to read, hard to  put down Glad I bought the complete story - not just the first part.
B001HN6922|5.0|get the movebe for time. the do there job on time. i well buy form them dvd or games. i like them
B006LSZECO|3.0|I downloaded this after reading reviews in EW and other places. Everyone talked about how surprising the end was, etc. While I do think this book is a good read, and written well (as opposed to some other best sellers out right now!), I don't get the hype. I thought it was predictable. I guessed most of the story early on.  Still worth reading, but part of the reason I kept at it was I was waiting for that “shocker” everyone kept talking about. It never happened. So if you start reading it and you think you’ve got it figured out, you probably do. Otherwise, I recommend it as a decent, well-written book.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|do good job on time. well buy wich movies or playstation or games<br />playing games to play like to wich
0894803123|4.0|This book was missing several pages of vital recipes.  Could not just replace, would need to be refunded then purchase it again.  It could take weeks for my Dad to use his x-mas gift.  Great book, but not the complete book.

B00AHTYI5M|3.0|Argo is a good film. It has the kind of tight direction Ben Affleck can handle with ease, but it is also too tidy. Based on a true story about a CIA operation during the Iran hostage crisis, the film hits all the right notes. It features edgy camerawork, period detail, and tense moments. The opening voiceover explains the history and sources of anti-American sentiment without downplaying the destructive state of the revolution.<br /><br />If you are interested in a mostly unknown stint in which a CIA agent posed as a filmmaker, check it out. Prepare to recognize a host of faces. Still, the movie feels a bit pat. Some of Argo's scenes are intercut to build tension, yet they also feel a tad predictable and manipulative. In spite of its searing place in history, I didn't find Argo particularly memorable.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|this movie is just amazing. the story rocks and the action is great! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B004EPZ084|2.0|Horrible Bosses opens with Nick, Dale, and Kurt describing their contentment with their work. Nick (Jason Bateman) works night and day at a high-powered company, Dale feels comfortable as a dental assistant and fiance, and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) enjoys working for a kindly boss (Donald Sutherland) in a family-like work environment. Unfortunately, Nick's boss Dave (Kevin Spacey) is cruel and manipulative, Dale's boss Julia (Jennifer Anniston) sexually harasses and blackmails him, and Kurt's boss dies only to be replaced by his decadent, moronic, and mean son Bobby (Colin Farrell). They decide that, due to their bosses' destructive and deceitful natures, their best option is to kill one another's employers.<br /><br />The talented cast never quite gels due to thinly drawn characters. Bateman is especially good as his usual deadpan self, but Day's edgy naturalism and occasional ham only reminds one of his much funnier television show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Sudeikis's Kurt is fairly likable, yet his character is just another example of how the average guy can get any model to fall in bed with him.<br /><br />The idea that workers submit themselves to bad conditions in an economy is touched upon here, as is the fact that men can be sexually harassed (though the situation is played for laughs). Horrible Bosses had potential but didn't tickle my funny bone.
0061906220|5.0|This book is excellent for toddlers; they love reading it over and over and naming the next pile that Pete steps into to re-color his shoes.  Pete's a cook cat.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is the the most captivating book I have ever read. It sucks you in, and you will never want to leave.
1451695195|3.0|Interesting, rings very true, not an easy read because of the many medical descriptions.  Would be good for anyone with medical training.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|IT takes some time to get used to this Harry Hole, he is out of uniform, more basic, still as complicated. This story leaves too many holes (unanswered questions) about the future, lose ends create an emptiness, wondering if you got the story right...I re-read some parts to make sure I wasn't missing something...<br />A good detective yarn, rekindles some of the early story lines, not as satisfying as prior works, but enjoyable.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I wanted a tablet for travelling; I can check my email; search the web  and read my downloaded books.  Cover is sturdy and still light weight.  Yes, I know you can't have the cover closed when you charging it but that isn't a big deal to me.

B004GYY714|4.0|I used to take lunch in my car and listen to the radio - until my car wouldn't start because I discharged the battery. So... I now select from my TuneIn Radio favorite channels, turn on the radio and there I go. When I am doing yoga, I turn on suitable music (when I don't listen to my uploaded CDs) and do the bliss thing. Too cool...a radio in  your pocket. Let there be Tunes!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Sadly this app doesn't work on my brand new kindle fire HD (logs in,but no newsfeed), so I've deleted it.  Facebook does, however work through the browser.  Just amazing that they make this app available at all.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|As I am getting older I am more attentive to brain activities. I am not into games generally either. This one is interesting because one must visualize how to connect the dots in the minimum number of moves. I can start my day by doing a game or three and feel like I am awake. Simple, easy and helpful. Go for it.

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Great and creative plot to the final step of the trilogy. The Vilan is a very intelligent foe to the Gotham Place Department. Mix of 21 century technology and the reality of a dooms day event in a major metro city.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|The Resident Evil series was okay for maybe the first two movies, but after that it was just beating a dead horse. The plots grew muddy, and the acting considerably worse. But I will watch almost any move that Milla Jovovich is in. Still, I really didn't want to finish this movie because it was pretty boring and lame.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Incredibly amazing! Love the attention to every historical detail and just how the plot keeps getting more and more convoluted.
B000VYNYN0|4.0|This is a cult classic horror starring Bruce Campbell. What more do you want? I like the sequel somewhat better, but this is a really good movie for such a low budget flick.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|This is just a highlights album, and I think most will be looking for a full soundtrack. Hopefully the latter is coming at some point. The singing is great with the exception of Russel Crowe. Jackman, Barks and Hathaway deliver memorable performances that hold up to any others I have heard. While Crowe has a nice voice, it isn't made for this kind of singing, much less for the part of Javert. It doesn't manage to ruin the whole album, but it pretty near wrecks one of the best songs - &#34;Stars&#34;. The new track, &#34;Suddenly&#34;, is very nice and another place where Jackman really shines.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|My wife and i love this show a lot. Watch it all the time when we get of work. Everyone should buy it.

B009SQRL4U|5.0|Great movie for the family to enjoy together.  Fun tale of how the son of Santa clumsily delivers Christmas to the one child Santa forgot.
B008E374PO|5.0|The Owl City CD was bought as a Christmas present (as requested by my daughter) and she likes it a lot.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I really love this book. I have learned a lot about cooking and have tried most of the recipes multiple times. I love the 4 Hour Body Book by Tim Ferriss, and most of the recipes are very healthy that go along with the 4 Hour Body way of eating.
B005LAIGPU|4.0|This was a good movie, based in the Seattle area and filmed from a different perspective than normal, enjoyed it.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I would not have purchased this movie if I had been aware of the aspect ratio shifts, with about half the movie being shot in 1.85:1 and the rest in 2.35:1. I have a 96\\" 2.35:1 screen, so I had to watch the movie with the 2.35:1 scenes reduced to 66% of the normal picture area to keep the 1.85:1 scenes within the screen dimensions. Whoever thought it was a good idea to shoot a movie this way should never be allowed to make another movie. Also, the audio volume of the 1.85:1 scenes was significantly higher than the 2.35:1 scenes, necessitating large sound level adjustments with every aspect ratio change. I enjoyed the movie for content, but I was extremely disappointed in the technical presentation.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a must read. It will even change the heart or the heart of the mind for the most die hard scientist.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|If  you only get 1 app, this should be it.<br />Very fun and challenging.  I cannot recommend this Any stronger.
0060254920|5.0|My six year old enjoys this book, and has read it a lot. As with all children's books, after about 20 readings it tends to stay on the shelf.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I better writtenthink this series is better than the 50 series. The characters are better developed, better written, and more likeable.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|I love this album, when travelling I will listen these songs and they will give me a little of more quiet...
B00846REIS|5.0|This female is a girl I could be friends with. Overall the series is just much better than 50 IMHO.  I can't wait to read the rest.
B00006FDCD|1.0|the ending of the movie is cute off! It goes straight back to the main menu.<br />Great way to ruin a xmas gift jurkfaces!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is such an amazing book the book has a great but a bit shocking ending although it is sad and I wish there was more
B008HK3XU4|5.0|My case was exactly what I wanted!!!  Thank you!!! It was just what I was looking for to protect my new Kindle Fire HD
B009329Y30|5.0|This was bought on my kindle for an airplane ride. very romantic movie which I love. Very touching movie. Not a real long movie either.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|Closes after one pic and cannot reopen...tells me that there is an error and I can't access the app again
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I can't wait to get my two-disc special edition because I believe the b/w version will probably be so much better. But what really REALLY creeped me out was the music they played at the end: DEAD CAN DANCE (Enigma of the Absolute? I could be wrong.) But when I heard that song start when they started the car (phenomenal audio editing! itself overlooked) I just knew we were in for a downhill slide. If you loved the ending song (written in part by Lisa Gerrard - of THE GLADIATOR soundtrack - and Brendan Perry) you will LOVE the group DEAD CAN DANCE, available on iTunes and here also on Amazon. Literally, if you like that ONE song, you will love the group. I just can't wait to see the B/W version...<br /><br />And I purchased this through Amazon.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Works the exact same on my tablet as it does on my home computer, so it was easy to figure out.  Decent free email program.
B005KJZDXK|1.0|The whole CD sounds rushed and the tone of Zooey's voice was very nonchalant.  We were really disappointed.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
0802473156|5.0|I loved reading this books so much that I've read it again from time to time to refresh my memory on all the info and the stories that are packed in it. It's not only inspiring and motivating but also very realistic and understanding that things aren't always perfect for two people. This is highly recommended to anyone seeking to improve a troubled or a perfectly fine relationship. It's eye-opening and is fun to read with your partner.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|My daughter plays it all the time. Love the lesson that this movie is telling for us in this movie.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My 3 year old LOVES this movie!!!  We have to watch it at least 1x a day, sometimes more!  Get it!
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Not what I thought it was going to be??? It was just ok for me. no more to say about this movie
B009FXIICK|5.0|This is a great little application with plenty of fun for a child in the 5 through 8 age grouping. The graphics are excellent, as is the play theorem.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|it was great!!! Lot of action!!! Love all the people in this movie can't wait till the new one comes out.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is by far my favorite application for e-books.Combine this with the outstanding assortment of books from Amazon and you're on your way to reading heaven. There are frequent, non-obtrusive updates that make this application all the more appealing.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Vimpires are the in thing!!! It was very funny!! Love Depp and all his movies watched him for years and years.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Purchased this and the creative bucket of Duplos for my 2-year-old grandson. They are the perfect size for his little fingers, and they snap together easy enough for him. he spends hours building 'castles' and planting the animals on top.<br /><br />I would recommend for anyone who wants to proved a learning, creative experience for a two-year-old.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is such a great way for Prime members to catch up on previous episodes.  Just another advantage to being a Prime member.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|I watch it over and over with my friends.  We all enjoy it.  The art, the story and the acting all all great.
B00APUQRPC|1.0|It was not the movie but the fact that , we watched about half of it and could not finish it until my company had left.  Very dissapointed.
B004JOCU2O|4.0|TENDS TO KEEP YOUR ATTENTION AND IS WRITTEN WITH CLEAR DEFINITION OF THE THE INTENDED PLOT<br />RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY IN THE FICTION CATAGORY
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I couldn't help but recall the original and want for this one to live up to or exceed those expectations. There was potential, but it was hardly reached. If you're just interested in something to be on the tele while you're doing something else, then this will be fine. If you're looking for a thrilling action film, you may want to go for the original instead.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I loved the DVD and anyone who is a history buff would love to receive the set,  Great present for a high school history teacher.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I quite enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to family and friends. I'm glad I stumbled across this book.
B000HF6ZR0|5.0|I liked the ending to this movie, I also thought there were more interesting ways the movie could have gone. I think they should make a sequel, but one that shows the sphere as a success.
B002UZCJP2|4.0|I just like anything with Bruce Willis. This is good but i do like other films by him better so I would give this a three & a half!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Today's sci-fi movies are just not made like this.  Most of the sci-fi action flicks nowadays are all flash and no substance, or rehashes of older stuff, but while extraordinarily pretty, Prometheus is also smart enough not to answer all questions and tie everything up in a neat little bow.  I cannot recommend this enough to fans of serious sci-fi.
B004FEL6GO|5.0|He loves cars according to his parents. He immediaitely started playing with it! He would not let his Father take the packaging materials off it as he really wanted to start playing with it and began to cry. Since I was on SKYPE at the time I told him to calm down as he wasn't taking it away just doing something that Father need to do for their boy. He has yet to discover the dual purpose of this item as a TRANSFORMER
B00A77II0U|5.0|Love this game - great blend of hidden object and adventure! More like this please Alawar - the Snarks are great too.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|The kids, my wife, and I, love this movie and watch it every Halloween.  Bette Midler is classic, and you even get to hear her sing a number in this one.  Sarah Jessica Parker is funny as the dumb witch.  There are many funny parts, and many slightly scary parts.  Not bad for kids 5 and older.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! It has adventure, and romance. What else could a girl want from a book?  Absolutely nothing!
B0091XRTTM|3.0|Not a bad movie, it had more hype but didn't deliver.  The kids liked it, but said that they didn't want to own it.  Most of the funny parts were in the trailer, so we were a little disappointed.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Free, entertaining, and a great romance read. Couldn't put the book down. Great modern romance pick, and very easy read.
B000W7JWUA|1.0|The game was incomplete. 4 red city components were missing. I would strongly recommend to buy a common game like this in a store and avoid the trouble to make a reclamation or return it online.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Same as the other reviews. I get about 10 stories into my news feed and then it goes into some sort of list mode. Seems this bug has been around a while.. No fixes yet? Too bad because it worked great on my older Kindle.
0071373586|4.0|CHOCKED FULL OF USEFUL INFORMATION THAT I NEED IN OPERATING MY BUSINESS AND UNDERSTANDING CERTAIN MOVEMENTS IN THE MARKET PLACE.
0307887960|4.0|Great book and concept-will be beginning soon. He has some really good advice, hints and ideas. Iknow it will be great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is just as good as the movie itself. Interesting to get into the mind of Katniss. Can't wait to read the others.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I like toca hair salon because I enjoy doing hair. It installed perfectly and doesn't freeze at all. It is fun for all ages because my 3year old sister enjoys shaving all the hair off. I love the tools and love the noises the characters make its a fun creative game for all ages and I recommend this game for kindle fire hd. If you love to style hair  this is the game for you.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud in one paragraph and in tears the next.  Although it is in the &#34;young adult&#34; category, I never felt like it was meant for an audience several decades younger.
B000YHG72E|5.0|one of the absolutely best holiday movies of all times. it is a must for any movie collection. my wife and I have had it in heavy rotation this holiday season.
B0076DELIG|3.0|We  have been so spoiled by the suspense in previous Connelly<br />novels featuring  Hieronymous Bosch that this one<br />is somewhat of a let down.  It's an imaginative plot but without<br />too many twists, and all the suspense comes in just one chapter.<br />It's just not up to the five stars I'd give his previous novels.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A documented journey beyond the physicality of the brain, experienced by a neurosurgeon. His experience helps define the mystery of the human consciousness. This is not a religious book; it is a practical book for our journey at the end of this life.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|My first Nesbo book was The Snowman, where the Harry Hole character had already been developed in earlier books.  I was immediately drawn in by this broken, engaging detective, a person that is both charming and disturbing in one complex person.  Shortly after, I read The Leopard, and continued to cheer for Hole, but also ache with him as he struggled with physical and psychological challenges and pain.<br /><br />Phantom takes the character of Hole to another level, with more physical pain, but that paled in comparison to the psychological turmoil that he endures in this latest book.  While some of the 'discoveries' were predictable, the twists and turns were shocking nonetheless, forcing me to continue to read late into a number of evenings until reaching the stunning conclusion.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of the Harry Hole series, I would suggest going back at least to The Snowman, if not earlier (Devil's Star or Redbreast).  You will benefit if you engage Hole earlier in his career than just jumping in with Phantom.
B005LAII12|5.0|What a wonderful whacky movie. You have to be a little on the &#34;sick&#34; side to get the humor of it all, but hey I have worked in Law Enforcement for 25 years so I found it very funny. Nice to sit down and just laugh from beginning to end. Don't take life seriously, get this movie and laugh out loud...For those of you who rated it not funny at all...I feel so very sorry for you.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Lana's voice is so remarkably smooth, that when you're listening to her singing<br />it brings back music from long ago, yet it's current!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I nearly finish all levels then removed it, thinking I was done. I couldn't find  anything comparable to pass the time with. I have reloaded it and starting over again!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This cd was purchased for my husband who has a very different taste of music, and  this is right up there<br />with the likes of Coldplay's sound.  If you or someone you know enjoys Coldplay and other similar groups<br />to them, I would definitely encourage you to purchase this cd, it makes a great gift to give someone who<br />is very picky with their music!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|a greatly needed application for kindle fire hd. makes keeping up with and finding files so much easier!!  ;)  love it
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|This was a Xmas gift for my husband who loves Pat Metheny's music.  When he opened up<br />the cd he was so happy to get it as gift.  He has always thought Pat Metheny is music<br />genius and has always enjoyed his music, I was told that this cd would not disappoint anyone<br />who is a true Metheny fan!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely love the series.  Some knock the content and the writing but I loved it.  Have read the series more than once.
0446554995|5.0|I love the Pendergast books and this had to be best so far. I couldn't stop reading. It's odd I buy the Pendercast books in hardcover and all my other books on the Kindle.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely love the series.  Some knock the content and the writing but I loved it.  Have read the series more than once.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I read the first book, and then I was hooked!  The series is an interesting play on fiction and future, without being too sci-fi.  Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy sci-fi also, but this was just a neat series.  Just got the &#34;First Shift&#34; book, which so far seems to be a prequel to this series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely love the series.  Some knock the content and the writing but I loved it.  Have read the series more than once.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This App is easy to use and very convenient.  I use it on my kindle fire, so the screen is a little larger.  Not sure how this would translate on something small like an iPhone.  I enjoy it.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I am so lucky I ran across this, I wish more people knew! This movie was amazing, in every way...one of the best martial arts movies I have ever seen and I've seen a lot. The action is nonstop, the acting is superb, the martial arts moves are so good. It's a mix of both traditional old school Chinese martial arts movies combines with moves I have never seen. If you haven't seen it already, stop what you're doing and watch Ip Man.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game is pretty fun at first.  But pretty soon it requires multiple and frequent updates.  There are certain aspects of the game you can only aquire by buying &#34;Money&#34;, &#34;Energy&#34;, etc.  It is a fun game, but it got annoying with how frequently you had to download the updates.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I prefer better graphics. Maybe some animation.<br />The weather seemed pretty generic, as well.<br />I would not recommend this to anyone.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is an amazing book that I hope will inspire future video game designers. This is a must read for everyone.
B005LAII3U|5.0|It&#34;s a real different story than the original .it&#34;s really entertaining .i recommend this movie to all who likes action scifi movies
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I was unable to finish this one. Same thing as the other set-up marriage stories. I don't mind reading a predictable book if it is interesting enough to hold my attention. This did not.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I ordered this one for me and one for my daughter in law. We are fans and this one really grabs your heart strings. LOVE IT!!
B008Y2IU12|5.0|It's a great new twist on an old classic! A Snow White tale that's entertaining for adults, both men and women! Has the classic Snow White  romance for women, but enough violence and sword play to hold the attention of men.
B00004RF98|5.0|One of my long time favorite movies and this one was replaceing the old VHS that had gotten ruined. It came timely and well packaged. However the movie skips a lot.  Price was reasonable.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Timeless says it all.  Dick VanDyke and Julie Andrews---I never tire of this classic movie. So very enjoyable!  Grandkids can know enjoy this great movie too!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great fun and very addictive. can't find out how to get more hints though. I have played time trials and the other games. excellent freebie
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love the Batman triology and wanted all the movies on blu-ray. There was really no better value than this set and I am sure I will put it to good use.
B008NEMN0K|3.0|dont waste your money on this, well atleast the 3D version. i mean i love this movies as a whole but the film wasn't shoot in 3D so dont expect a lot of 3D moments.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I had a short in my original plug in.  Amazon was wonderful and &#34;Sam&#34; (a young 24 yr. old woman) helped me and she sent me a newer charger and wire.  Wow! It is fast and works great!  Thanks Sam!!  Thank you Amazon.  If you have an old wire and charger, you will definitly  love this newer charger and wire.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Another great series by HBO and one of the best series out there.  Give it a chance even if fantasy books and movies aren't your thing
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I watched this twice over the weekend with my husband.  The best I could describe it would be Glee, (the college edition) meets Dodgeball.  The music was amazing and the cast was fantastic.  Rebel Wilson is a new favorite of mine, she stole every scene she was in.  Also, I was impressed to see that Elizabeth Banks not only acted in this film, but produced it as well! I highly recommend and will be adding this to my home collection (I think I'll file it in between Dodgeball and Whip it).
B0042X9L6A|4.0|The first one I recieved was defective.<br />The return was simple and the replacement was shipped very quickly.<br />No hassles at all.<br />I love this flash and I am big fan of Nikon.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|wish it wasnt hyped up so much.  was funny at times but predictable plot with an over the top ending that should have been taken out
B008VBYN80|3.0|Fun game, well designed.  One can get away from purchasing gems at first$  But once you reach level 20, there is no way around NOT PURCHASING them$  $ for units, more too upgrade them to be warriors, and of course $ to revive them when lost in battle! Team K&amp;L, I would have paid $ to buy this game, but i guess u make more selling GEM'S!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I normally hate video games, but got an Ipad for Christmas.  My daughter downloaded Angry Birds for me.  Haven't been able to put it down.  I would recommend it for anyone, even for a 70 year old like me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love it. Great show! Couldn't wait to see in on Netflix so I had to get them here and now :D
034580404X|5.0|A great read and a great gift. For any one looking to put a little adventure back in their love life these books are sure to get the motor running, so to speak.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|Bond up to the usual. I am a big lover of these films, and although I don't get very excited over Daniel Craig I do like a good blue ray. Fast two day shipping is the bomb.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|All three of my kids love this movie, my oldest was super excited to get it for Christmas this year!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Wonderful. Such a joy to watch a Dr. Seuss film that Mike Meyers hasn't vamped to the adult viewer. I like his stuff, but this is a Seuss Film Through and Through. Anyone will love this and think a little when your done.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I thought the book would lack substance but was truly surprised. Good work 's James. I look forward to reading more
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Exciting: lots of action beginning to end with all my favorites: stallone,norris,willis, schwartzenegger. I could watch this movie all day!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Collen Hoover is one of the best writers out there right now. I felt like Slammed and Point of Retreat were much more tame than this book and I am glad that she did something different with more emotion and intensity like Hopeless. This book was amazing from start to finish. It was no holds barred and I loved it. There was so much depth to this story and I could not put it down. Just when you thought things couldn't get any more intense she stepped it up a notch and then when you thought things were going to get better everything changed in an instant. Dean and Sky are such freakin strong characters. I love when I know so much about the characters that I feel like I am living their story. You kind of start to piece things together as the book moves forward but you will never expect what happens as the book nears the end! Amazing read from an amazing writer! *Warning, very graphic book that contains sex, child abuse, cussing and suicide.*
1592537251|4.0|Not profound but certainly fun! If you are looking for inspiration for urban sketching methods this is a good bet but in terms of the 'instructions' on how to sketch in the urban environment, I found that part to be a bit cumbersome and unnecessary. But I would buy it again as a gift for a sketcher!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Fun for all ages. I got this for the grandchildren. I also enjoyed playing and getting a grade at the end of playing a song
B001JRB16U|5.0|Perfect for the 7 year old, a bit out of reach for the 5 year old and totally not for the 3 year old but so fantastic all round that I cannot stop singing the songs. I think the kids will want to watch this every Sunday - forever! There is one scary scene when the kids run away from their father and encounter some stragglers on the streets but generally it is a pure, safe, and wonderful family dvd!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very good book.  Many facts that are surprising to a person not trained in medicine.  Being at an age when Heaven is not too far off, I found it interesting and reassuring.
B000JLSM00|3.0|Did not order this movie.  Ordered a different John Wayne - Rio Bravo.  Kept it any way because the receiver loves John Wayne.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I was lucky enough to snag this while it was part of the free app of the day promotion. It has the best prediction out of all keyboards. could be a bit better with correcting misspelled words but it is good enough in that regard.  The only thing that I dont like about it is that sometimes I will add in a word that i dont want when I hit the space bar to put a period.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|A spectacular and moving film with unrivaled visual quality, especially in 3D. There is so much in the film I suppose there was no more space for additional \\"making of\\" etc. or directors comments or anything else. There's just the movie, period. I think they cut parts out of the DVD as compared with the theater version as snippets I recall were missing or in one case added. Does this hurt the film? No. It is just so spectacular we really looked for explanations of how they did it all. If you're curious for more, as we were, get another version.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Its a fun game that promotes thought. You have ti think about stress pressure transference and you have to think out side the box.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|played this game fun but a little hard in spots animation is good easy to understand and install also easy to get
042524489X|5.0|I couldn't wait, this was an exciting, awesome story, amazing capabilities of both the hero and heroine, loved the story!
B001OGWY1W|3.0|My son likes this movie.  I ordered it for  him.  The quality seemed to be good. It was a good price for the product.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This tale of the Batman carries a strong and action packed sequence of events that lead up to the saving of Gotham by the Masked Crusader. Nolan took the story far and this movie reflects his own interest in the crime fighter. This movie could not have been made by someone who doesn't love the Batman. An unusual assortment of criminal elements add to the plot with a twist at the end. Actor Christian Bale has definitely matured into the part and is more convincing than ever as the Batman. I didn't initially like Nolan's choice for the Batman but now I've grown to love Bale's rendition of the caped crusader. Overall I would say that of all the Batman movies this one delivers the biggest bang for the buck and the audience is left feeling very... Good... I seldom raise my arms at the end of a movie but this one gets both arms up... I am sure you will enjoy it.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|Like the hot girls, but it's the same old plot, same old characters, same old story. It's time to put these Resident Evil movies to bed.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|I bought this and the original dixit the cards are nice and the game is real fun, I would recommend it.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|I love this movie and purchased it in 3D for use on my new equipment. It was very good but could have included more scenes in very extreme , right out in the room with you, 3D.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Every American should see this movie. If this movie doesn't make you proud of what these people do for us every minute of every day then nothing else will. Makes me damn proud of the people I know who have served and I am privileged to have come from them. I am a the product of a military family and I hope to one day honor their strength and sacrifice through my actions.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|A very fun game. It provides hours of entertainment. Kind of redundant but it's kind of what you come to expect from these games.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|In my top three favorite Nicholas Sparks books! Love everything about it. When it's over you you feel like you've lost a child. You get so connected with the characters you feel like you're in the story yourself.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Not a great show but good clean entertainment. I will recommend this movie to my friends and coworkers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Overall I think this game is pretty awesome it just needs to be updated ( they should include the following)<br />- muiltiplayer online<br />- Water<br />-Lava<br />-Rollercoaster equipment<br />-Egg Spawners<br />-nether world<br />Also they should allow us to use the furnace and then lighter. This version on the kindle same with the iPod or the phone is nothing like the Xbox or computer plus u don't have the big screen as if u would to the Xbox tv ( Srry if i didn't help u )
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Well made calculator application, which is easy for every day use. Simple and straight forward with large numbers for easy reading with or without glasses!
B00AA36RZY|5.0|This book covers the top design patterns from the gang of four book. It does it with style and makes the patterns easily understandable.
B000HKW7E0|1.0|Don't download it if you are using an iPad. It won't play with the HDMI adapter (airplay). The movie is GREAT. Not impressed with Amazon......My fault for not reading the fine print.
B008NMT684|5.0|My two year old is 3-4 year level and loves love loves these puzzles! They might be her favorite Kindle app.
0307346617|5.0|I love this book . I wasn't to sure I would like it at first ,but soon I realized I couldn't put it down . I was not into the zombie trend that seems to gaining momentum but this is actually a very good read .thank you
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My two year old is 3-4 year level and loves love loves these puzzles! They might be her favorite Kindle app.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Season 1 got me completely hooked and I just cant stop watching this season either! Its like an addiction. Amazing Series, creeepy, but awesome!
B002VX3RCW|5.0|My 3 month old loves his new Sir Prance A Lot. The colors and sounds it makes fascinate him. As always, Lamaze products are well made and easy to clean.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|this is almost too simplistic, thought it was more like bubble town.  My little granddaughters really like it, though. It does work to put you to sleep at night, and that's a good thing.
B0057UA4FY|3.0|When I purchased this for my son for Christmas, I was purchasing under the assumption it was a DVD.  It clearly states under format that this is DVD not Blu-ray, and I didn't look at the case closely enough to note that it says it is Blu-ray.  Thank goodness we do have a Blu-ray player in the house, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to view...other than that, it is a great deal.  Just wish I had gone down and read reviews where it actually states these are blu-ray discs...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The title says it all. I read this book from beginning to end  in five hours and it was the best thing I have  ever read am  I loved it.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I think this album is the BEST ALBUM OF 2012! Oh my God. It's just beautiful. Ellie has a wonderful, soothing voice and it has sort of a raspy tinge to it. Love it! All the songs are amazing! Literally- all of them. Anything Could Happen is everywhere right now and rightfully so. I've never heard a song like that. It is sick. Also, some other highlights are Joy, Figure 8, Dead in the Water, I Know You Care, Hanging On, Explosions, My Blood, okay all of them are highlights. I have not stopped listening to this album since I got it. I will be well played. If this girl keeps putting out albums like this, I'll be a fan forever. Love it.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|The book is good, and humorous,because of the story of Greg and toilets plan of being cool. Jeff you made a masterpiece
B001USHRCK|1.0|We were completely unprepared for a 1601 piece set to NOT come in numbered bags.  I wish I had noted this in the reviews of others.  This is a total deal breaker for my boys.  They are usually very able to do sets far above their ages. They are 6 and 8 and can usually do sets that say 12+, but without the numbered bags, this set is really too much.  The numbered bags to me is what makes large sets so great.  You can still manage a big set, and end up with something really amazing. Not the case if you have to sort through 1600 pieces!<br /><br />We've also noted in another Kingdom set (that did come with numbered bags) that some of the pieces were missing in the first bag.  We are sending both sets back, which makes for a disappointing Christmas.  We have never sent a Lego set back, and trust me, we have gone through many Lego sets over the years. We will now try to purchase at the local store where we can check the bags to make sure they are numbered.
B00005AREQ|5.0|As noted by so many others, this album revitalized Beck's career. As dazzling as his guitar playing was, and as good a band as he had supporting him on this recording, the most impressive thing about this collection of songs was the arrangements, as well as the songwriting craft. It wasn't all just jamming and showing off guitar licks. There were intricate, almost jazz-like arrangements on many tunes. You had some jazz fusion sounds, a bit of funk, a slight reggae vibe, hard rock stylings, and lots of Beck's majestic guitar mastery, hypnotizing the listener. Whether the song exuded beauty and elegance or raw power and upbeat drive, you couldn't help but coming away awestruck by this album. After all these years, I wonder if there are any goodies left in the recording closet to justify a deluxe reissue with bonus or live tracks? I love this era of Jeff Beck's career. If you like this CD, check out \\"Wired\\" also.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Hot bodies and gorgeous faces are not enough compensation for the stilted dialog and horrific acting. This film was painful to watch.
1451662432|5.0|Total Recall is one of the best autobiographies I've ever read. If you're looking at this review right now, wondering whether or not the book is worth the purchase price: IT IS.<br /><br />Arnold (as he is affectionately known around the world) is one of the most famous bodybuilders and actors in history. This book walks you through his life: from his early days growing up in Austria through his political career as the Govenor of California, and beyond.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Arnold uses a clear, simple, and blunt tone to describe his life in great detail. While I've read quite a few autobiographies that seem to avoid touchy subjects (Bill Clinton's autobiography is a great example of this), Arnold takes a full disclosure approach and gladly lays out the details of all his mistakes, which gives the book a very humble feel.<br /><br />Arnold discusses (among other things):<br /><br />- What his life was like growing up (he had a very strict upbringing).<br />- Why he got into bodybuilding, and how it got him out of Austria.<br />- How his only brother died in a tragic accident, and how this effected him.<br />- How he quickly raised through the ranks of bodybuilding to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world.<br />- How he handled business and started to build a fortune (he owned a bricklaying company and invested in real estate).<br />- How he used absolute focus and dedication as a strategy to excel.<br />- How (and why) he shifted his focus from bodybuilding to movie making.<br />- How he ended up meeting famous celebrities, and breaking into the movie business.<br />- How he met his wife, the Kennedys, and continued to grow his influence.<br />- How he built a fortune through his movie legacy.<br />- How he got into politics (through George Bush Sr.).<br />- Why and how he ran for Govenor of California, and what his platform was.<br />- How he governed California, what policies he implemented, what things he did right, and what things he did wrong.<br />- How his marriage ended after his affair with his long time maid came out.<br />- What his plans are now.<br /><br />Overall, the book was extremely interesting. Arnold lived a life where he did whatever he thought was good, and completely ignored others. He tried a lot of things, succeeded at a lot, and failed at a lot.<br /><br />I found the book to be really motivational, as Arnold clearly explains how he did things, why he did things, and how he constantly kept himself motivated and 'hungry' for success.<br /><br />If you're at all interested in reading about an amazing life, this book is a must read.br />- How his marriage ended after his affair with his long time maid came out.<br />- What his plans are now.<br /><br />Overall, the book was extremely interesting.

B008JEJPSC|5.0|Believe it or not this movie is HD all the way, its a great story and a clear crisp picture and sound.
B002RL7W9W|2.0|The child was an army style lego, which it was not.  I thought for the money it was overpriced and not worth it.
B002NZTZ8S|3.0|The movie as funny as it maybe does show a lack of adult supervision as the children ride the train to the north pole.  The movie has certain deviant qualities such as kids leaving the pack to find their presents from santa and the cunductor is a bit on the harsh side. In my opinion this shows children deviance is acceptable behavior. But on the positive side it is an overal nice story, the kids in the movie meet santa clause and have a good time.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|this is the best zoo game their is on the appstore. the animals actually constantly move around and the ones in my zoo tend to even leave their cage. u get to rescue animals too. I read the that one re view said that after level 25 the game starts over. I thot I would take a risk and was happy when I made it to level 26 with a ton of money. well I got to about level 28 with $70,000 (then spent it with $30,000+ left) and when I come back to see if my turtle is done breeding I find the game has restarted. I deleted the game out of frustration. great game but not worth getting excited over once started over.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Quality show - don't miss it!!!<br />If you haven't seen this from Season One - this is the time to watch and be ready for Season 3....you won't regret it!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Very LOL funny! Tina Fey's personality comes through as though you're having a comfortable conversation with a friend. Can't wait for the next one.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|As expected and greatly anticipated, wonderful music. Great seller/delivery & product. Phillip Phillips is always wonderful to listen to, and if you have the chance, watch his video(s). He has a certain magic and appeal when he sings that keeps makes you &#34;feel&#34; and appreciate the music just like he does.
B000006YXV|5.0|I loved it and it had all the songs necessary so I highly recommend this CD. I thoroughly enjoy it
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Hilarious! Not for the faint of heart - when it says unrated it's because it should be - nothing like a trash talking Teddy Bear!
B000JKA1MS|5.0|I got this for my son for xmas and he absolutely loved it. I was amazed by the level of detail you normally don't see.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Alt-J is an excellent example of a group that knows their instruments well.  They also are great sone writers and know how to display their love for music through their music.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The camera work is a little weird here and there and sometimes doesn't stay focused solidly / long enough on the individual players or the band as whole, but the musicianship of the guys from Zeppelin outweigh any weird filming issues.  Those jokers still have it!  Very glad I purchased this.  A must-have for any serious Zeppelin fan.
B0001XAPX8|3.0|not a bad movie. Kinda dragged on though.anthony hopkins is a very good actor. though i dont think comedy would suit him
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The attention to details and story line is great for young and old. Shows how what you have is better than what you may wish for.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|I love action movies, cuba and anthony are 2 of my fav actors. I even learned a couple of things about survival in woods
B009YP9L7U|2.0|It was ok for what it was, which is your run of the mill romance story with the same old boy meets girl, girl loves boy, boy disappoints girl, girl leaves, boy chases girl.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really don't like walking dead type of people and I really didn't like the way they are killed but for some reason<br />the story line just hooked me and I just have to see whats going on from episode to episode.<br />Waiting for new episodes!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A satisfying twist and just as well written as his many others. The racial situations a bit antiquated at times.
1451695195|5.0|I would recommend to anyone. A touching story of this mans life and near death and what he experienced in the afterlife
B005HSL626|4.0|The family enjoys this version of fruit ninja, great graphics, fun for all ages. All four of us would Recommend this game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a book that I could not put down. This book held my interest,very interesting how people start to trust each other and become friends
B001BR7CZW|4.0|I chose this DVD for my son because he loves this type of comedy.  He laughed hysterically watching the movie
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Loved it and it was great. Worth the read and a must for teens and young adults (: do it
B0058YPLA2|5.0|WATCH THE PROGRAM SUNDAYS AT 8 :00 PM  EXCELLENT GREAT CASTING AND GREAT STORIES.  I HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T GET SLOW BUT I THINK IT WILL NOT!
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|The movie is OK but I hate when movie dialog is quieter than shooting and music. The story line is OK and the acting is average. It is worth renting and watching but I'm glad I did not purchase this film
B004YM6JLO|5.0|WATCH THE PROGRAM EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT AT 8:00 PM  IT HAS A GREAT CAST NEW AND GREAT TO WATCH<br />I HOPE THEY DEVELOP A LOVE STORY AGAIN WITH ELANA AND STEFAN
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I Love her music.  The record is a bit different from her passed ones but I like all the songs.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I HAVE SEEN THE SECOND SEASON  ALREADY  I DID NOT READ THE BOOKS THEY WERE TO BE EXCELLENT SO I WAS EAGER TO SEE IT ON TELEVISION  WHAT CAN I SAY MIND BLOWING
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B00910Y1OQ Call of Atlantis (Premium)]] was one of my favorite Big Fish games to play on PC and I am so thrilled to see it available for android!  Super great game.  It has an atlantis theme and I really like the music as it is fun and entertaining in just the right way.  It is a fantastic deal at free today.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absoluteley loved this book. I bought it on my kindle yesterday, and i finished it today. i couldnt possibly put it down for more than haf n hour. AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!!
B007PLRM9Y|4.0|Pleasantly surprised with the quality pressing of this vinyl.Great for anyone who likes easy listening.<br />I usually buy audiophile or actual year pressing.Recommended listening
B009VLX8FS|3.0|If you think I'm going to write a fifteen + word review for everything I buy you have lost your mind!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Not a good ending, sort of a left off part in the ending, other than that it was pretty good
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Great. SO refreshing a talent she is. No smoke and mirrors, fake theatrics etc...all VOICE.  Pure simple with a style that is authentic.  The understated elegance is the cherry on top. BRAVO!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the only problem I have is I play this on my kindlefire HD. So I haven`t figured out how to have  neighbors. if I had neighbors it wud b more fun...or make it to where u don`t have to have em to do the challenges
B009MCRHH6|2.0|I gotgot this for free after having paid for it on the play store. Turns out the play store version doesn't have the same DRM mechanism, which won't let me play this.
B003NGTYPA|5.0|Excellent movie and in High Definition.  Better than the 10 year old DVD I have.  Highly recommended for all ages.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is my favorite TV show. My husband and I watched 12 episodes on Christmas! Best gift I've ever purchased!
B0030B1WBM|3.0|My family enjoys watching movies like this on Christmas Eve. This movie is always a joy to watch, but it's a bit difficult when it stops and has to be restarted at least twice. A bit of a bummer.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|This book gives a brief look into the twisted mind of a bad boy.  If you like bios like these get it for $3 like I did.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I would recommend this scholarly, but very interesting and very well written book to anyone interested in history, in general and/or Abraham Lincoln in particular.<br />It's like taking a very interesting course.
B00A7ZWUJC|2.0|If not for the fact that this purchase was only $1.99, I'd be disappointed.  I guess I got what I paid for.......a stonerstoner soundtrack.
B001706I5I|1.0|&#34;The Grinch hated Christmas - the whole Christmas season.<br />Now, please don't ask why; no one quite knows the reason.&#34;<br /><br />This movie makes the mistake of trying to come up with a reason, and it's terrible and stupid. Couldn't even finish this turd of a movie - and would not recommend exposing your children to it.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Of course it's got a lot of Family Guy humor and you could even see a few FG animated characters personified in this movie, but it made me laugh quite a bit.  Which is a lot more than any other comedy movie I have seen in the last three or four years.  Thumbs up!
B009O07NMA|5.0|Great CD. Every song is good and you want to get up and dance to the whole album. Not a bad song here. Refreshing new country that has a more \\"poppy\\" edge to it. The songs are upbeat and catchy. I can't really compare them to anyone. If you are a country fan and you are still reading this, you are waiting too long. Buy it!
034580404X|5.0|Treated myself to this for christmas as so many friends had said it was a good read. It arrived early and I am very pleased with my choice.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|This is a great game to play with the family or solo.  The birds and pigs are the same size as the original A.B. game.  My son likes to get them all out together.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for a couple who are very interested in history. I have this series myself and loved it. It arrived early and I was very happy with everything.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie for the whole family!  A fun colorful story with a good moral of the story of protecting our enviroment.
0307949486|3.0|Its an acquired taste. It gets interesting and leaves to just want to read the other books or just watch the movie.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Big bang theory at its best! Sheldon, penny, Leonard, Raj and Howard are hilarious as usual! I absolutely love this show!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love it, this show reminds you of your child hood. A twist to the original stories. The End THE End
B009G56RN4|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis is terrific. It's amazing to see him in a variety of roles. Enjoyed watching this rather dark tale.
030759565X|5.0|I love this cookbook!  It is a very weighty cookbook.  The pictures are beautiful.  I love her website and have told friends about it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|All of Jeff Kinney's books are pretty good. I always think that sequels are never as good as originals, but fir one of MANY sequels, this book was pretty decent.
1582701709|5.0|Ordered this for my nephew at his request for Christmas.  While I haven't read the book, he said all his friends thought it was great.  Arrived on time.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|It came very fast. Shrink wrapped..I am looking forward to buying the movie too..I listen to it when I am exercising also.
0316228532|2.0|While I'm sure Rowling would be the first to say so, this isn't the next book for Potter fans to enjoy, child or adult. I so looked forward to reading this, but I had to put it aside. Rowling's writing was just as brilliant as it's always been, and I was quickly drawn into the story. What stopped me short was the incessant profanities. This won't bother some people, and most of time I can look past a few, but by page 15 there were innumerable F-bombs, and a C-word. Ok, we get it J.K., you're not writing for kids anymore. But is it necessary to be so foul-mouthed? Too much for me, and I just wanted to warn other people that might be buying this book for their little Potter fans, who are now a little older...they'll be picking up some new (unwanted) vocabulary if they read this book. Otherwise, I'm sure it's fantastic.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|This book would be amazing in a graphic novel or even made into a mini series on a cable network, the story glows and easy to get into and stay interested in to the last page.  I'm grateful my wife suggested it and I have recommended it to more than a few friends.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Treasure Island is an amazing adventure story!  I read it from cover to cover--it is undeniably one of the best adventure books I have ever read.  Loved it!
B00005AQGG|5.0|It came right before Christmas. It was a great gift, it was cheap and it came fast. good news all the way!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book because it is a mysteryish type of book and I  love that  this book is so amazing
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Excellent follow-up to all the Pendergast stories. Wrapped up the mystery surrounding his wife.<br />If you are a Preston/Child fan, this is a must read.<br />I look forward to their next book as I'm sure we haven't<br />Seen the last  of Alban!
B0098VXE50|4.0|I haven't watched it so I can't comment on the quality of the film but my mom really liked it so four stars I guess.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|When I bought this book, I didn't expect it to be that good, to pull me in and keep me in till the very end. I was hooked the second I read the first word. I'm nit going to tell you want it is about because that spoils the whole book.<br />There were a couple times when I cried, and I don't cry at books or movies unless they really hit home. There were quotes that I highlighted just like most people. There were funny moments.<br />All in all, buy/rent/whatever this book, because it is just that good. These characters will stay in my mind. Especially Jordan, the lawyer.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Rented this movie through my Vizio 60\\" LED tv. Opted for the HD version for $1 more - it honestly looked worse than a standard DVD. Right between VHS quality & coax cable.. But can't complain for $3
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This Batman movie was different from the other movies. In the other Batman movies you have like Mr. Freeze, The Penguin, etc. they are colorful villains but this movie was so much darker. There were light heart comedic scenes but this movie the whole movie was dark. The other movies seems like when it got so serious then funny things would happen but not in this movie. I don't think it detracted I just kept waiting for it to be like the other movies but it never happened. It was just totally different from all the other Batman movies. I still enjoyed it and taken on it's own a great movie!
1401238580|5.0|Excellent shipping...arrived as stated, brand new.  I bought it for a friend of mine as a Christmas gift and he is enjoying it very much.
B000YE3TVY|4.0|So far the product seems great. I love the look and the comfort is nice. Time will tell if they hold up like they should, but to this point all is great.
B00005UO64|5.0|Excellent shipping...arrived as stated, brand new.  I bought it for a friend of mine as a Christmas gift and he is enjoying it very much.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Prometheus is a worthy prequel to the Alien franchise.  However, keep in mind, this is not Alien.  This is a whole new set of creatures, a whole new set of questions, and very few real answers.  This film focuses on the reality behind asking questions that may not even have a satisfactory answer.  It also shows how one answer just leads to a new array of questions.  The film is true eye-candy for the scifi fan in every sense of the word.  From the opening scene to the final moments, you cannot take you eyes off the screen.  Reading the other reviews, it seems like those who don't like this film either do not understand the history behind it, are not intrigued by the bigger mysteries of life, or are just wanting to munch their popcorn to other mindless schlock that Hollywood barfs out and calls movies thee days.  Prometheus is going to make you think and entertain you while doing so.  If you are up for the adventure, then check it out.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|love it!  x x x xx xx x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x. o o o o o o o o o o oo o o
B0079R8KO0|1.0|This  case does not fit the kindle fire hd as advertised, big waste of money. Will be returning ASAP. very disappointed in vague item description.
B0077ATSU4|4.0|I purchased this movie for $9.99 eight months ago and I had not felt interested to watch it until the other day. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />While the critics were fairly right about the slow, depressing and difficult film style, they left out that the movie is extremely realistic and very touching. It is not a big Hollywood movie that cost a lot to make or broke box office records. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close was going more for a subtle emotional connection with its viewer.<br /><br />This is not a movie about 9-11. It is a incident which the movie revolves around, however over-all it is not the main point of the film. This movie is about the love and connection between a father and son and the need for that connection to last after someone has passed on.<br /><br />The directing is top notch and the movie has a very artsy-indie creative feel to it. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and he does have a large role in this film as there are many flash backs. The son played by Thomas Horn does a fantastic job and his little nervous ticks and reactions are phenomenally portrayed.<br /><br />After finally getting up enough momentum to watch this movie, I will keep it in my collection and watch it again one day. It is touching and I did tear up a little throughout the film as the emotion of the son and the blunt reality and realism was outstanding.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B000003CUJ|3.0|The musical tone as the score is interpreted by this conductor/orchestra is muddy. More importantly, the transitions are jarring as though effected by someone not familiar with the music or willing to fit the content into flagrantly incorrect endings (read: cut offs). Better to purchase full operatic and fast forward through songs (if one cannot tolerate the vocals).
B004X75RK4|5.0|I think this movie is a classic 'rom com' - it's like The Wedding Planner and similar romantic movies with a strong female lead character.  Definitely doesn't get boring, even after seeing it a third time!  Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds really play well together!  So cute!
B000HT3PPG|4.0|A classic holiday movie like this is a nice addition for those who celebrate Christmas. We watch is every year and always look forward to it.
B00A9X9VAI|2.0|The acting just felt flat across all the actors.  The script didn't do enough character development; I never really understood the motivations and drivers of each of them. There wasn't really a &#34;good guy&#34; or &#34;bad guy&#34; (per-se) so you didn't know who you wanted to &#34;win&#34; in the end.  I did think the ending resolution was a good call, however.<br /><br />I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't rush out to see it.  It's worth a rainy-day rental once.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|This is a holiday classic that we bring out every year. Since the household split - children leaving the nest and whatnot - another copy was needed. Enjoy!
B0006Z2LH4|5.0|If you liked the first CUBE movie you'll like this one as well. Different twistes and turns, and as strange, as the first movie. If you bought CUBE, you need to add this too your collection.
0618001905|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, for the price of admission (&#60; $10 w/shipping) it was well worth it. If you have any interest in history, read up on this somewhat forgotten period of African colonialism told in such a way I felt as if I was watching a miniseries. Rich backdrops, dubious characters, and a gripping true story await.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|This is a pretty good Disaster movie. I have watched it quite a few times already & it is still enjoyable. The Blu-ray quality is pretty nice for this movie. Not a lot of grain. The color also is pretty nice. As far as the sound goes I can only say that I listen with external speakers hooked up to my regular stereo system [nothing high tech] & it sounds pretty good. I would think with the proper equipment it would sound even better. The aspect ratio is 2:40:1 which means you see more or all of the movie, just the way I like it. As far as special features go you get a couple of commentaries, alternate endings & previews. Overall I really liked this movie & think you will too.
B002S8AGZG|5.0|This film took me back to high school. Simply adored watching it again :D and in bluray now too.. Great buy!!
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Hours of fun for the kiddos who have not yet seen it.  Always provides entertainment for a long car ride.
B0060D3742|5.0|This was a great family movie.<br />it has pets, slapstick humour, shows character development and<br />family values......and yes, it stars Adam Sandler.<br />Have shown it to my kids many times.  it's great!<br />Less &#34;bad content&#34; than some of the Disney stuff, in<br />my opinion....
B00867GHS8|5.0|Who wouldn't love this product???  The recipient was very excited and I have been told that it is watched and watched again and again and again.
B00948EPOQ|5.0|I like the fact that the information about the people were true and was put into a romantic story.  I loved it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Downloaded to Kindle from Amazon for personal use so received timely, obviously, and in format and condition expected as it was electronic.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I have always loved Dr. Seuss and grew up with many of his books...I enjoy the fact that there is not only a story that is entertaining but a message about our planet.  I think the video was well done.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is going to be a simple book review...I loved it.  I read a lot of books from this genre and I don't (ever) leave reviews.  I'm giving a review for Hopeless because I enjoyed it so much.  I loved the characters and felt a lot of emotion from them while reading.  I love Colleen Hoover's writing style and also enjoyed Slammed and Point of Retreat.  In short, I'd highly recommend Hopeless.  It's easily the best book I've read in awhile.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|It was way better than expected due to some of the negative feedback...and ended up buying to watch again thru Amazon
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This app is great! It works perfectly. I have only tested it over WIFI so far and it works flawlessly. I have a laptop connected to a HDTV and I can control and play movies on the TV using my Kindle like a wireless remote. The possibilities are endless and remote video and audio playback work very well. This is by far the best Kindle app out there.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|I am a hardcore Céline fan and have been for years, but I loved EVERY SONG on this album and think it may be her best album yet. I've always loved her best in French, but the artistry in these French songs is just so clear and refined that I can't help but love it. A phenomenal CD. Didn't think she could do better than Taking Chances, but she did :)
B008VBYN80|4.0|pretty good only thing that isn't is the energy and the diamonds that's about it the rest is nice and fun!

B001VLXNLU|5.0|This book is extremely well written and such a great read if you like this kind of criteria excellent book
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Very enjoyable a little depressing for Pendergast though.  I would have liked a little more of Det. D'agusto (not correct ) I cant' wait til the next installment with Alban and his brother.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|Loved the movie! Watched it as middle schooler and decided to buy the DVD since we only have the VHS. Very nice movie.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly is one of the best in this genre.  I found it well-constructed and thoroughly enjoyable and believable. I have become addicted to his work.
B005KELW26|5.0|I love this cover for my Kindle Fire.  My sister has the same one but in a different color as well.  It fits very snug over your device and doesn't come off.  It's also really easy to hold and looks really chic.  Highly recommend this in any color!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|At this point, while the read was an enjoyable one, it's almost become a formula read.  Nevertheless, it offers several hours of enjoyment.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|This was definately not my favorite movie.  It did not flow at all.  Most of the movie did not make sence and the surprises lost it impact by the bad acting and terrible story line.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Couldn't wait to have this movie. What a Great Ending to a Great Series! Delivery was prompt and was very pleased to receive it. Love the Potter Movies!
B005LAIHR2|3.0|Was not my favorite movie.  I was excited about it from the previews but it did not really keep my interest.
1882723007|5.0|Everyone should read this book!  I can't keep them around...someone either needs to read it or WANTS to read it!  It is the most comforting thing for someone that has lost a loved one...or even a pet!  (They DO go to Heaven!)  You will never fear passing from this world after reading this book!  Please, Please, Read it!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is a great movie for parents to watch with their kids.  It isone of those movies that puts scenes in just for the parents to enjoy.  I am nbot big on cartoons and i really enjoyed it.

B0085KGHI6|5.0|In 1981, The Stones set in with Muddy Waters for one unforgettable evening at a small<br />Chicago blues club. This is a snapshot of the state of blues and rock at that time.

0756666937|5.0|What's not to love.  It's a newer Lego book!  My children love to collect Lego's and love to look at the books.  Love that it has LOTS of the newer sets in here!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I bought this calendar for my grandchildren and they loved it.  The price was a little high this year, but they love Legos, and I couldn't resist since I got them a set last year! I'm sure I'll buy one next year, too.  Hopefully the price won't keep going up.
1419705849|5.0|Love these books!  Thanks for offering hardback at such a great deal!  Would love to give one every Christmas!  Keep them coming!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Really cute movie about a girl and her mother.  The triplets are just too funny and my four year old laughs her head off at their antics.  Highly recommend that if you have a daughter, you buy this movie for her.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|From the first paragraph this book pulled me in, broke my heart and left me simultaneously emotionally spent and spiritually renewed. The book is as predictable as you might expect about two teenagers with cancer - one dies and it is devastating - but the writing is so personal and credible that you can't help but give yourself over to the story. I wanted so much for these two kids to live. I could see everything before them that they would never experience! Yet their humor and resilience, and their simple normalness as teenagers....these are the things that drew me most strongly towards these kids. And the adults in the book - especially the parents - all added to the storyline and depth. As an adult woman with a teen daughter, I loved this book. Liz got a copy in her stocking from Santa (he is avid reader as well!) and I am sure (like me) within a few days she will be crying on the couch as she reads the last few wrenching pages of this beautiful, sad and ultimately inspiring love story.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I am so glad that this was put on Amazon Instant! I think I watched all of the episodes in 3 days! What a great and captivating series!
B0083EM24C|4.0|The album was easy listening but upbeat and modern! It was a gift for my hubbyb and he loved it, as well as I did!
B000I8G5NA|5.0|There were some twists in this movie that I didn't expect at all but made watching the movie worth my time.
0199236178|1.0|No answer solutions. Can you believe that? You have to go online or something but that never worked out. This is the only upper level science book that literally has no solutions at the end of the book. So you're left to wonder wether or not you got the questions correct.<br /><br />The font is too tiny. I have 20/20 vision but the font here is way too tiny. The paragraphs are written in a way that complicates the concepts further. I had to go on khan academy or use other resources to properly understand certain concepts.<br /><br />The only good thing about this book is that it had nice quality paper and it had nice pictures. That's about it.
B0053O89XI|1.0|WB really needs to get it together. Their exclusive &#34;flixster app&#34; is total nonsense. This disc does not come with any ability to add the digital copy to itunes. They have decided that it is better for me to have digital content in multiple places...not a fan! I will never buy any other titles in this way, until ultraviolet and flixster allow me to claim it in itunes.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|It is difficult to &#34;enjoy&#34; a story like this as it is almost unimaginable what Jaycee went through in her captivity.  Her honest account of what happened to her was interesting and I hope she can overcome the past and have a wonderful future.

B000YHG72E|4.0|Great christmas movie, enjoyed watching the little bit I got to see.  Not sure why I was charged for it since I have prime.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book I couldn't put down, a friend of mine actually had me listen to some of the music from The Hunger Games, while I was still reading the book & I was able to place the songs with where I thought they went in the book. Usually I don't watch the movies of books I've read, but this one I had to run out & get. Unbelievable Suzanne Collins!!! Thank You!
B003QSOFFO|5.0|Watch it! I guess I have to write more words so enjoy my rambling. Oh whatever this is such a waste of time

B006O6F932|4.0|My 8yr old sister loved this playset. It was the number one gift on her list. It turned out a lot larger than I thought I predicted but that just means I definitely got my moneys worth!!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Wow! The fact that something so precious to kids would be turned into something so foul mouthed. Yeah granted he grew up and became an adult but Damn! The weed smoking could've been left out! This was entertainment for whom?! I was curious and thought I'd give it a chance. Didn't like it, waste of film, hardly funny. At least superman and Spider-Man still follow goodness. These are adult films but we are influenced by what we see just as well as kids. Just my opinion.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good job on your new book I loved it<br />It was really funny I loved reading about corny`s  thank you
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's the simple, traditional and free game that everyone lnows. Works no problems. Good for my free time and it was free!

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love a good detective/crime story, and I don't know anybody who doesn't. And I always prefer those that include a dose of humor, even when they get silly sometimes. My favorite series include Monk, Psych (at least the first five seasons) and Detective Montalbano.<br />Now comes along Elementary!, fast-paced, intelligent, brilliant, educational... I hope it will run many unadulterated seasons for many people to enjoy and be entertained.
B0015AARJI|5.0|All products are of excellent quality and I liked all all are very good and met all expectations I had of them and very good service if amazon.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|I watch this every year at Christmas. I love the fact that it also comes with a digital copy, so I can watch it on any of my mobil devices, while on the go. It is a good quality video and wonderful movie. It has lots of nice bonus features. If you enjoy the movie, it is worth getting.
0060264306|5.0|These stories are always favorites.  If you've never read them, pick them up for your kids,<br />or just for yourself and be trasported to another place and time.  I got five copies of this one<br />to add to the libraries of some favorite children.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I've had this cover for the past four months, and I think it's doing the job well. I didn't use the screen cover simply because I'm not a fan, but the phone cover is great. I've dropped my phone a few times (not too hard, thankfully; I've (sort of) learned my lesson after the screen on my old phone shattered), and having this gel-like cover on the phone is a nice security blanket.<br /><br />My heart still skips a beat when the phone slides from my lap or develops a mind of its own and jumps out of my hand, but I feel slightly more secure with this cover around it. The phone simply bounces on the corner and lands with a soft thud.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Um... I don't sit reading dictionaries very much. I barely understand it. Yeah. I guess for dictionary readers (who understand it) it is ok.  ??
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Be warned, this is a rated R movie and it is vulgar and inappropriate.  That is what I loved about this movie!  Not at all what I expected.  This movie is not for kids but for all of us adults who remember the 80's.  Great, funny movie!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It's okay, but haven't played it much yet. so can't say for sure how much I like it.  So far, it seems fun.
0380977273|4.0|2nd Witch:<br />By the pricking of my thumbs,<br />Something wicked this way comes. [Knocking]<br />Open locks,<br />Whoever knocks!<br />[Enter Macbeth]<br /><br />Macbeth:<br />How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!<br />What is't you do?<br /><br />The above quote from Shakespeare's Macbeth is whence this book takes its title, but it's the character Macbeth's quote immediately following the titular quote that seems to me  more &agrave; propos to an attempt at reviewing the book; for Bradbury, despite the book's ending, is a full adept at exploring the secret, black and midnight thoughts of us all.  The book's fault - in my eyes - is that it presents, in the end, a Manichean, Star Wars view of the world which just doesn't wash with me.  Thankfully, throughout most of the book, Bradbury is more concerned with the dark carnival that comes  into town upon a midnight wind one October and the dreamlike horrors it works upon the townspeople. This is where the magic in the prose lies.  It rather reminds me of Blake's remark about Milton, that he was a true poet and on the devil's side without knowing it.<br /><br />Be all this as it may, it's very difficult to tell the prospective reader what this book is about, because of its wild poetic exploration of the dark corners of the human soul.  But I think it's best seen as a sort of warning: Beware of your dreams and imaginings - regardless of your age or situation - for therein unfathomable darkness lies beneath the gilt surface. This is best set forth by the doomed schoolmarm, Miss Foley, bewitched by the memories of her lost youth:<br /><br />\\"Best skate the thin ice, lightly. Paused, the weight of your attention might crack the shell.  Plunged through the crust, you might drown in depths so cold, so remote, that all the Past lay carved in tombstone marbles there. Ice water would syringe your veins.  Transfixed at the mirror sill, you would stand forever, unable to lift your gaze from the proofs of Time.\\"<br /><br />And the doomed lightning-rod salesman, bewitched by the ideal of the perfect woman:<br /><br />\\"Once, as a boy, sneaking the cool grottos (sic) behind a motion picture theater screen, on his way to a free seat, he had glanced up and there towering and flooding the haunted dark seen a woman's face as he had never seen it since, of such size and beauty built of milk-bone and moon flesh as to freeze him there alone behind the stage, shadowed by the motion of her lips, the bird-wing flicker of her eyes, the snow-pale-death-shimmering illumination from her cheeks.\\"<br /><br />In an odd way, Bradbury seems to be telling us to beware his own writing.  But the obverse side of this coin, embodied in the person another reviewer has dubbed - quite rightly, I think - the \\"hero\\" of the novel, Mr. Halloway,  expounding upon the notion of the \\"soul's energy\\" that these outlandish carnies seem to crave, maintains:<br /><br />\\"How do I know this? I observe.  The carnival is like people, only more so.  A man, a woman, rather than walk away from, or kill, each other, ride each other a lifetime, pulling hair, extracting fingernails, the pain of each to the other like a narcotic that makes existence worth the day.\\"<br /><br /> In other words, there's scarce relief to be found in any domestic bliss.  The way out, the \\"good\\" way, seems to be laughter at the absurdity of it all.  But, for this reader anyway, this - quite literally, towards the end - forced laughter is the scariest, most inhuman phenomenon of the lot!<br /><br />In the end, I'd rather have a wicked but all too human Macbeth than laughter at the meaninglessness of memory, imagination and human suffering.<br /><br />Perhaps, so would Bradbury's ghost.the doomed lightning-rod salesman, bewitched by the ideal of the perfect woman:<br /><br />\\"Once, as a boy, sneaking the cool grottos (sic) behind a motion picture theater screen, on his way to a free seat, he had glanced up and there towering and flooding the haunted dark seen a woman's face as he had never seen it since, of such size and beauty built of milk-bone and moon flesh as to freeze him there alone behind the stage, shadowed by the motion of her lips, the bird-wing flicker of her eyes, the snow-pale-death-shimmering illumination from her cheeks.\\"<br /><br />In an odd way, Bradbury seems to be telling us to beware his own writing.

0440422973|2.0|This has got to be the worst John Grisham book ever.  It wasn't funny or cute or entertaining in any way.  You know the drill:  Nora and Luther Krank (!) have decided not to celebrate Christmas because their delightful daughter Blair will be in Peru with the Peace Corps.  They're going to spend the money on a Caribbean cruise instead, departing Christmas Day.  Their biggest faux pas in this endeavor, at least as far as their neighbors are concerned, is electing not to install their 8-foot Frosty on the roof to match all the other houses on their street.  They even refuse to make seasonal charitable donations, and their promises to donate even more for other causes the following year are scorned by the solicitors.  This is supposed to be satirical, I think, as Grisham cites more and more ways in which Christmas has become an expensive and time-consuming chore for many of us.  He fails, however, to really get our attention, not really taking a stand as he also points out the upside of family and fellowship during the holidays.  Was this book written for Hollywood?
B000KFB4PK|1.0|This is a very cheap item, it's not worth buying I don't recommend this watch. I would like to return it and get my money back
B004HYDL1K|3.0|Rodriguez made this as a tribute to the cheap, trashy entertainment of vintage grindhouse films.  So in that context, it's the perfect film.  That also means that it's really not worthwhile.  It's in exactly the same vein as _Planet Terror_ (though I did enjoy _Machete_ more).<br /><br />So if your expectations are for silly, campy, over-the-top fun (and _everything_ about it is campy, from the dialogue down to the casting of DeNiro, Segall, Lindsay Lohan & Cheech Marin in the same film), you'll have a nice, dirty time watching it.
B00A0HQ9GM|4.0|Lana Del Rey is extremely talented. Her indie-retro style has such a great sound. I recommend her if you're looking from something different from crappy American Pop.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Fantastic read with a great ending. Read it in a day! Moving story with something for everyone. Very well done
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I'm biased towards music from the UK, but Ellie Goulding's talent makes you want to bust a move in your car.
B00A2FSTC4|4.0|Not available to stream on Netflix, Crackle, nor Comcast on demand. This is one of Tom Cruise's last good movies. There is enough satire and irony for people with half a brain, and enough action for the rest of us mindless American movie watchers.
B0099TJ4YQ|4.0|The songs were ok.........not really thrilled at the selection. I should have looked over the CD cover listings more closely.
1451696191|5.0|This book is really worth picking up and reading. It is a very touching story and can be easily related to.
B005LAJ212|3.0|I really wanted to love this show. I watched the first couple of episodes and was pretty impressed. However the more episodes I watched the more disappointed I became. It just became more of a soap opera to me than a cool revenge show. Now don't get me wrong, it's not a bad show. I like the main character Emily/Amanda. I also like Nolan and Jack. The other characters are a little to daytime soap for my taste, especially Charlotte. I hope she overdoses in an upcoming episode because she is annoying as hell. Saying that however, I admit that as much as I wanted to stop watching Revenge I found that I was still interested enough to stick with it as painful as much of the stupid dramatic scenes were. It's too bad this show is weighed down with so much soap drama nonsense. It could be a really cool show. I don't know if I will watch season two as the reviews suggest even more drama and less suspense. If you don't mind drama this is a great show but if you can't stand the dramatic soap opera bull you probably should not bother trying to get into Revenge. A great plot is wasted under way too much soap drama.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I used to love Regency romances but I got tired of them because they're so predictable. Unerringly, if there is a conflict involving a miscommunication or misinterpretation, either hero or heroine goes sweeping off in a huff, and they vow to never speak to the other party, ever, because clearly there is no other explanation for what occurred. This always ticks me off because if the injured party would take thirty seconds to communicate with their so-called soul mate, the entire thing could be resolved in a matter of minutes. But no, someone always has to sulk.<br /><br />So when I reached the point in this book of such a conflict, I rolled my eyes and considered abandoning the book. But I was too intrigued by the characters and their stories, so I kept reading. And to my delighted surprise, no one indulged in an extended sulk. The two characters communicated! and resolved the conflict! without sweeping off in an unholy fit of temper.<br /><br />The writing, the character development, and the conflict resolution really impressed me in this book. I'm now looking forward to reading more of Courtney Milan's novels.<br /><br />One point of contention, though. The author was very vague about the heroine's past, to the point of frustration. I understand being mysterious about a character's past, but the information given was vague enough that it made it difficult to keep the storyline together. I found this mildly frustrating.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was phenomenal. That is the only word to describe it. It was deep, but a rather easy read, in my opinion. The entire time, it had me thinking about life, and I was convinced there was going to be a sad ending. I won't tell you whether or not I was right, so as to not ruin it. I fully believe it earned five stars, and would recommend this to any young adult or adult.

1451695195|4.0|Read this book but afterwards wasn't sure of what to make of Eben's NDE content. He claims the woman guide said \\"he was loved,\\" and \\"could do nothing wrong.\\" I wonder if the gunman from Newtown, CT (26 people dead) or even Hitler got the same warm welcome into \\"heaven\\" as Eben. Were they also able \\"to do nothing wrong?\\" From an earthly perspective we can do things wrong, and often times such \\"sins\\" have horrendous consequences. Thus, I don't think the \\"you can do no wrong\\" rule is an axiom of eternity. Sounds like something out of the New Age movement. I believe that Eben had an NDE and I believe it was a valid experience, thus there's proof of an afterlife. But I also think there's more behind the \\"spiritual\\" curtain than we're seeing. Also, simply because Eben is a scientist does not qualify his experience as being scientific. He proposes no model whereby the NDE phenomenon is made open to scientific inquiry. To be truly scientific there needs to be some model or mechanistic paradigm in which to couch the phenomenon that's able to explain things which the current scientific worldview cannot, i.e. NDEs. That would make it scientific. Moreover,  Eben claims to have learned a great deal of higher knowledge, yet he shares almost nothing of this radically advanced insight with us. I kept waiting for some technically sagacious quantum mechanical explanation of how the spiritual realm interfaces with the physical realm (which I believe there is). You'd have thought this insight would've been included in all he learned. But in the end, I walked away hungry. If he'd shared the concepts while omitting the details, that'd have provided a modicum of satisfaction at least.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game was well put togther. i think this games is very fun and can be very addictive in ways and the best part is that it is one that you really dont end
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I am not a huge fan of Taylor Swift, but the lyrics and the band are fantastic! Overall, the top3 songs, in my own opinion, in this album are I KNEW YOU WERE TROUBLE, RED and 22.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Good smooth old graphic for what it's meant to be. Throw back to the old arcade game i used to play as a young lad. If there is one game that I can't get over and how badly I played and wasted buckets of coins on, it's this one. And after a few races, it hasn't changed how really bad I am at this game. But I will get better! It WILL get a lot more mileages on replay value for those that love the old arcade version like me--The difference is, you don't have to keep mining your pockets for more quarters. And being the free app of the day from Amazon, more kudos! Thank you Amazon!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Pages just flew by as I ventured with Layken through her journey of love and heartbreak. I wasn't ready for the book to end the way it did.....tempting me to search for the next book.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Great app, especially if you are on a go. I love being able to go places being able to chat on the go. Also it's good when you are laying in bed with you're tablet and still be able to talk to your friends instead of getting up constantly to check for messages and to reply. AMAZING &lt;3
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|very fun and somewhat addicting, but boring because there is no risk...you can not lose. Just put it down and let your coins recharge back.
B00684J49U|5.0|Favorite story line in this season was Teddy's Hubby - that kept me glued to my seat and lots of tears shed.  There's some serious tragedies that happen in this season, so it's not for the feint of heart but I appreciate how the writers look honestly at the human reaction to tragedy and somehow still maintain your hope in humanity if not put in a good word for it.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|This was given to granddaughter and her sister gave her the same one.  I am not sure what she is going to do aboaut it
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great series, if you haven't read it, I highly recommend it.  I don't even know why I'm writing this because you've probably heard all about it already! :)
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I gave this to my granddaughter for christmas gift.  she asked for it so she was very happy when she got it
B004VDSWQ6|5.0|I know it won't make me popular, but I own every Dio& Oz Sabb cd& dvd: this is the best ever. Very gothic, excellent setlist flow, well filmed, etc. Since they write & play better than ever, you get ultimate versions of most the Dio years canon & no IronMan or Paranoid. I literally swore off rock for 22 years then discovered this show, so I'm biased. I love this band, more so the new tunes. THE OPENING IS AWESOME!!! It's Iommi at his most lefthanded (in Latin ;)
B008YRVW0I|3.0|everything is way too small and hard to see. please fix. other than that it is just okay. that all.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I could hardly wait for this book and was sorry when it was finished. I lived during this part of the trilogy and can hardly wait for the next book. Very good read.<br />Margaret
B000N2HBSO|4.0|An interesting approach to an iconic man.  The view gives an interesting view into the who and why of Lincoln.
B001P06GX4|5.0|The first time we saw and played this game we were visiting family in Anchorage, AK and my wife asked me to buy one. Ihe best price was on Amazon.
038542471X|4.0|Good Book but then again john Grisham is my favorite author and I seem to purchase all his books to read.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I came into this movie with reasonable expectations, and it far exceeded what I could have dreamed.  I previously had no use for the character of the Hulk, but here he steals the show.  The other characters are just seemless....the dialogue flows naturally and the movie brings you right in.  Until I saw the end credits and saw that Joss Whedon had directed it, then I understood how it could be so good.  Highly recommed.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Thankfully, Ken Follett has left the middle ages and has returned to an age more to my liking. This is classic Follett with a great story. I love the mix of fiction set into a historical context. Looking forward to reading books 2 and 3.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|I found the storyline a little weaker than all of the previous titles in the series.  The plot was so so, but the wife liked the previous movies so it was ok for a movie night.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This does what you want and even has .a percent key. This does what you want and even has .a percent key. This does what you want and even has .a percent key.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm 26 and literally didn't put this game down until I had beaten all 20 games in each if the 5 levels. It's such a great problem solver game for kids...or just a pass the time type of game for adults.
1455502758|5.0|Hitchens had an amazing mind--everything he wrote about was written with intelligence and insight.  His honest and soul baring words written during his final months of life are poignant and provocative--a graceful and elegant goodbye.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Vivid colors, effect sounds are great , once you get use to control the speed things became easy. The only cons , you have to run two menus to exit the game, it should be easier with and exit option on the bottom part. But since its a free game I can live with that.
B000OXHRRC|4.0|Not a &#34;great&#34; movie, but certainly a very entertaining story of a man coming to terms with what is really important in life.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The Percy Jackson series is the best,I love reading it over and over. The mythology and history in this book has always helped me learn the Greek mythology better than any high school class. I highly recommend it!!
B005HSL626|5.0|THIS APP RULES ITS JUST AWESOME AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA IT RULES DONT LISTEN TO * REVIEWS!!!! its awesome I love love love it!
B009HELT3C|5.0|Loved this best because it had the best story line. May not have had the effects and surprizes like the other two but had a more appealing ending.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Though The Bourne Legacy isn't quite as compelling as it's preceding trilogy, it's still a well-acted and exciting action film. Jeremy Renner takes the reins of the franchise as Aaron Cross, a field operative with ties to Treadstone and Jason Bourne. The film isn't exactly a sequel to the the original Bourne films, as it takes place during the same time period as the Bourne Ultimatum. The script is smart in coinciding new plots involving Cross with events that occurred during Bourne's time on the screen.<br /><br />Renner does a very good job with the lead here, displaying the physical and mental extremes we've come to expect from a Bourne film. The supporting cast is also very good; Rachel Weisz portrays a frightened yet brilliant geneticist and Edward Norton is great as the government official that's trying to put an end to the program Cross belongs to. As I said, the story is very smart and I was surprised how well it fit into the events and ideas I had seen in the Bourne trilogy. There's some great action scenes and I'm hoping we get to see a continuation of Cross' story.
B005LAII3U|2.0|I won't say much because there is not much to say because,  if you can't say something nice about something you should make it short and sweet,  It really Stinks.
B000ION23A|4.0|I bought this dvd for my grandson as a gift. He was so excited to watch it. When we opened it to watch, it skipped terribly!<br /><br />OK, after viewing the scratched introductions of the dvd purchased, the actual movie part of the dvd played good without the skips.<br /><br />Soooooo, I am changing my feedback for this product. Thank  you.
B00899E5B4|5.0|Love joe walsh this cd didnt dissapoint. Would be nice to get purchases into my ipad if anyone knows how let me know.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Hallarious!  One of my favorite shows!  Thanks!  Sent it to all my children.  They enjoyed it also.  English comedy can't be beat!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was totally enthralled and can't wait for season Four. It was historically accurate and I loved the fashions.  They were so elegant. Very interesting saga.  Well developed interesting characters.
B002ZG97EC|1.0|I bought this movie that has the digital copy inside which it was expired last year :0( and the case is broken so not very happy with it
0399157565|5.0|I have all of her Scarpetta series.<br /> I am a huge fan, just love her books. cant wait for her to come to Modesto so i can get the first one signed, & hopefully the Jack the ripper.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This was a gift for my best friend -- and she generously let me borrow it.  We are hooked on this series but no longer subscribe to  Showtime so we are having to wait for the DVD release of Season II ... and the waiting is hard.  Damien Lewis and Clare Danes are marvelous, the entire ensemble is top notch, the writing and production are superb.  Lewis definitely deserved his Emmy!
0062124293|1.0|How do these books get popular pray?? I couldn't get past the first few pages and am hard pressed to find anyone in my circle who might enjoy the book so I can get rid of it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was the prefect end to the Batman relaunch. The plot was true enough to the comics to not upset purists, but contained the right amount of wrinkles to not be predictable.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is a fantastic album, you should give it a listen.  I bet you will like it.  I was surprised by how good it is.
B002VZC9CY|5.0|What a fabulous journey through numerous musical genres.  I absolutely love this cd, and bought one for all the young artsy mothers in my life.  I can really imagine raising your kids, singing these songs, and also turning children onto Natalie Merchant's fabulous voice in the process.<br /><br />One thing I didn't realize, though, until too late is that this version of the cd doesn't include all of the poems that she set to music for children.  Merchant also did a children's book, with Barbara McClintock, that features the poems and the entire cd.  The book is pretty sweet.  I think this would be a great gift for the right little kid and mom.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful show, wish that it would air on the channels I have but it doesn't so I watch it from here. Can't wait for season 3!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have been using Yahoo email for years and its nice to have it in more than one location for easier access.
B001PR0YGC|5.0|Great price. Decent movie. If you want a movie review, look elsewhere. I rate the price and it passes with flying colors
1419704400|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. It highlights the collective and individual creative genius that has made Vogue magazine not just a bellwether of fashion, but of art and culture. A very high quality item that can be appreciated for generations to come.
B007MDB548|5.0|My daughter loves this. She keeps watching it over and over. The quality on the 3D movie is spectacular. I'm not so sure about the story line, but my 5 year old daughter seems to think its good enough
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Literally took me a day to read.  I couldn't put it down.  It was my least favorite of the series though.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great price for a great set. The quality on the blu rays left much to be desired. The picture isn't as crisp as I would have liked, but the sound is always top notch. If you like Star Wars and you can't stand DVD quality anymore, get this. Don't ask questions, just get it if you love Star Wars
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a great story line.  Learning more about Mr. Grey is what kept me in this book.  The steamy scenes didn't hurt either :)
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|A little too much magic for our taste.  Witches and wisps and magic spells not what we really like, it is too bad so many kids shows contain these elements.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|This game lacks so much. There are no clear instructions and even after figuring out what to do it was very tedious and boring.
B008MM9630|5.0|Nice graphics smooth play. Nice idea will like to find just a few more games like this one. I just bought this one a few minutes ago
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|More Gore than the first two, slow at first but overall not bad. Not a fan of the epilogue, feel the end would be stronger without it.
0345479092|1.0|The author is quite obviously very anti-breast feeding and is biased regarding her own negative experiences with her daughters' births and feelings about breast feeding. Much of the information she gives about breast feeding is straight out factually incorrect. For example, she attempts to scare women into not breast feeding by saying that if you start out with small breast before pregnancy that you will end up &#34;flat as a pancake.&#34; Many studies by plastic surgeons prove that this is incorrect- it is pregnancy itself that can change your breasts not breast feeding. She also says don't introduce books until the baby is 6 months old. That's very stupid and pointless. At 4 months old, my baby could sit and look at a book. There is certainly no harm in starting reading early.<br />Overall, the author's philosophy and recommendations did not mesh with my parenting philosophy. I don't see how this woman was qualified to write this book and what makes her an expert. She describes her own experience giving birth as overwhelming and how she felt exhausted and depressed.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|This is a great movie well worth watching.  It's just a fun thrill ride and a great action comedy.  My wife and I have watched several times after purchasing it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book after recommendations and hype by my coworkers. I was shocked at how corny and how terrible it was. It seems like people who I talk with who enjoy this book are people who do not read on a regular basis. The main character Ana is so completely annoying- crying, self-conscious, such a loser, etc. The plot is ridiculous. Christian Grey is a 27-year-old BILLIONAIRE- come on! I don't find the love scenes to be a turn on as I am not some weird freak. I find them gross and disturbing. I don't consider myself a prude by any measure. I can't believe the author got rich for writing this crap.
B009EAO38C|5.0|The Piano Guys are some of the most talented muscians on the planet.  I love watching their videos and I love listening to their music.  This is a great CD.  I highly recommend it.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|Having watched the movie a few years ago, I was intrigued when I came upon the book. The story was just as excellent as I remembered, and would make a great bedtime story for children but for a few things. First, the f-bomb is dropped quite a few times, along with a few others, so take care. A few iffy situations that are a bit mature for children, but those can be edited out if you censor the book beforehand. Overall, a great book irritatingly interrupted by those few things.
B001F7MSES|5.0|Great item, perfect for any collector or general fan of Hellboy. The statue is greatly detailed for such a little thing and GDT's journal is just as fantastic.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Although the first book was written to be a series and was a very slow read. This book was excellent from start to finish. I could not put it down.
B00008973A|5.0|Ripped by critics when first released, this superb film was highly underrated. Great dancers, superb dialogue and an intelligent scenario of revising the stage musical to work on film.<br />One of my favorites ( I may be in the minority), it is a must see for Broadway musical fans!<br />Wonderful cast worked hard and Michael Douglas was right in there! Thrilling ending and some new Hamlish tunes!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Both me and my 5 year old daughter love this game. Lots of fun and semi-challenging, highly recommended for any age.
0553386794|4.0|My only problem with this books is the physical size of the book. It is much larger than I expected, and I don't mean length of book/pages. I mean the literal size of the book. It is a bit awkward to hold because it is rather long. Other than that, it was good quality.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|While try to make sure that no child is left behind, our public schools have focused on the head while leaving the heart behind. Tough reminds us that a lot more than knowledge is necessary to make it in this world. An enlightening look into the world of inner-city education and what it really takes to make it in this world.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I down loaded this clock thinking it would be a simple alarm clock with next to no features. I was pleasantly surprised to find that even the free version has several very good features including multiple alarms and several choices of alarm sounds. I highly recommend this clock.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Love Rod Stewart and this is a great CD.  All the traditional christmas songs. Great CD to add to my christmas collection.
B000060P79|5.0|I gave the album 5 stars but this really is a 3.5 or 4, my main reason why can be explained in the following examples of \\"1-star\\" quotes...<br /><br />\\"...this band is just the kind of pop that Mtv wants you to believe is actually Punk.\\"<br /><br />\\"Remember when...'Punk rock' meant Crass, Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Black Flag, Agnostic Front, Bad Religion, etc.?\\"<br /><br />The only reason why bands such as Simple Plan and Sum 41 are labeled punk by the media is because certain aspects of the music only stick out to true music fans in general. For example the Ramones are punk rock and Black Flag is hardcore but to these \\"real punks\\" it all falls under the same umbrella same goes for the media.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|For those who love the Ice Age saga, you won't be disappointed. This part is as good as the other ones and it's a heck of an entertaining movie. Enjoy it.
B00845MRKE|5.0|I haven't seen this movie since I bought it back on VHS. This version of the movie is the best I ever seen. The blu-ray transfer was very well done. The movie itself is amazing. I forgot how good this movie was. The contents of the collector's edition was good the model car was well detailed. The art bool is nice and the bonus content is nice too. It was money well spent.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I love Downton Abby. I hope it keeps on going for years to come. I love Victorian piece periods and the Victorian way of life..
B000HKW7E0|4.0|We rented this movie to watch on Christmas Eve.  Our youngest is 13 years old.  We enjoyed it.  There is a topless scene that caught us by surprise.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I love rock music and you don't hear females often on the radio. So when I heard Halestorm, it's obvious they're something else. After hearing I Miss the Misery and Love Bites - I definitely wanted this CD so I asked for it for Christmas. I was very happy to have received it and am listening to it every time I'm in the car (and my daughter is not).<br />I love this CD. The first 4 tracks definitely rock your socks and it kinda surprises you to hear Lzzy slow down on track 5. But it's a great change of pace and I really like this CD. I recommend it for any rock fan who's looking for a change of pace from all the male vocals out there.
0307341550|4.0|This book definitely kept my interest.  The ending is a good twist that I didn't expect.  I also enjoyed Gone Girl by this author.
B000T433CO|5.0|The british accents, the little house and the big house. The people, the cuteness of it all makes you feel warm and cozy.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This could be a thounsand word review, but heroic and inspiring captures most of the scence of this amazing experience... Band of Brothers was simply both...
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|I purchased this in the hope of listening to a more spiritual Santana composition and was not dissapointed. Very good
B002LFAHBO|1.0|Someone somewhere has used editing software to snip this movie apart, then stitched it back together putting each \\"story\\" by itself instead of having the viewer get each story in bits and pieces over the length of the movie.  There's this thing in moviedom when some producer gets EVERYBODY to be in their movie, and I guess with enough people in it, someone in the film will draw fans.  Multiply the stars by 10 and you get box office, regardless of the movie's quality.  The thing that kills me here is how much women seem to love this movie. I read somewhere that Taylor Swift's favorite movie is Love Actually. Favorite?  Out of all of the movies ever made, THIS is someone's favorite?<br /><br />The first thing that turned me off was how crude it was. The language is gratuitously bad- seriously, it reminded me of Robocop.  The Chubby Girl (Hugh Grant's Prime-Minister-dating-the-secretary bit) decides to throw around F bombs at work, in public, to herself, to the viewer, then near the end she's at home, and Mr PM shows up to Cinderella her off to wherever (not romantic in the least, by the way- it's like a school Christmas play with a ridiculously impossible closing number that just does more to make this movie as over-the-top fake as everything else in it) and Chubby, in front of four generations of her family, rather nonchalantly shouts \\"WHERE'S MY F___ING SWEATER?\\" and no one even turns a head. I can imagine- hell, forget that- go to next Christmas where you're in the family room with the grandparents, mom and dad, brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews and shout that out to the room.<br /><br />Story One: (not in order, because the way this film prevents anyone from having the slightest bit of empathy with any of the characters in it, who cares about the order) Slimy Dude Man From Die Hard and Harry Potter cheats on his wife, she knows, end of the movie: unresolved. Fabulous.  Story Two: Useless, empty, boring couple meet apparently at a porn set, and 95% of their scenes are shot with them butt naked simulating sexual acts while the director tried to liven things up by over-emphasizing the fact that they were actually on a set by having the crew do stupid things like hold a light meter up to them.  Over.  And over.  And over.  End of this story? I think it's possible they might have a date, Everything they say to each other is... stupid.  I try to think of better words than that at my age, but stupid is just so simple and accurate.  They aren't cute, they aren't funny, engaging, charming- nothing.  They are gross, boring, and rather ugly. I daresay they're the two nastiest people in the film, and we have to see 10+ scenes with them naked, talking about nothing. Story Three: Boring Guy's wife cheats on him with his own brother.  he knows, he moves into some villa in Italy to type on an antique typewriter and >>SURPRISE!<< love at first sight with a gross maid that some woman hires for him. She speaks Portuguese, he speaks English, neither the two shall meet, yet they end up being engaged after spending, oh I don't know- a month together, having said nothing to each other that the other can understand.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, a good love-at-first sight story can be appreciated (even though it's BS anyway) but let's not make 6 of them in one film and have each of them ridiculously impossible. It cheapens an already cheap premise.<br /><br />Story Four: Boring Man No One Will Ever Care About In Any Film loses his wife (apparently) and he seems to all of a sudden become a dad to his bobbleheaded little bitty kid.  And thankfully uses the same foul language with him as Chunky uses in front of God and everybody. \\"Hey buddy! Did you have a good day at school? Let's go get some f___ing ice cream, ya?\\"  Come on.  Let's go all-out and chase a sixth-grader that you think you're in love with (because you know- sixth graders are all into love at that age, plus they really understand it) and then later at the airport I'll create adistraction and you run past security and have a brigade of cops chasing you all the way to the gate, where, when they catch you, they simply escort you, hands-off, back to your father, who wasn't arrested either. Awesome.  Remember when Qui-Gon Jinn died near the beginning of Star Wars Episode One?  Yeah, no one else cared about that either. Same actor, same result.<br /><br />Story Five: Scarily Underweight White Girl With A Smile That's Too Giant And Creepy Like A Picket Fence marries a black dude in a heartwarming (not) ceremony and Black Man Dude's best man seems to be the jealous, and we all think he's totally gay and wanted Black Man all to himself, then it turns out he's actually in love (love, actually) with Skinny Chick even though HE has also not had any type of relationship with her other than hanging out with her and Black Dude, but hey- everyone in this movie is impossible- and the resolution for this story is that he rings their doorbell, she answers, he tells her to remain silent while he expresses his love for her with cue cards (and she totally buys it) while her brand new husband is upstairs watching TV and Skinny keeps the whole thing secret, chasing Cue Card Monty down the street to kiss him then going back upstairs to tell Brand New Husband it was just carolers.  Where's Chubby with the F bomb? I need her.<br /><br />You know, there may be another story, I don't know.  This movie was 100% build-up to 7% resolution.  Slimy Harry Potter Guy and his wife's story was the one that really got me- Emma Thompson is the wife, and she's fabulous. She's the only character in the films I liked- and she got hammered the hardest.  The scumbags all won their little battles, and none of them deserved to.<br /><br />If you feel like you must see this- rent it.  Or borrow it.  In retrospect I'd hate to have wasted the trip to Redbox for it.<br /><br />You could wait for broadcast TV and see it, but after they edit all of the foul stuff out, the movie won't lastmore than 40 minutes.  This thing's gross, period.  And I'm not a southern preacher who's all huffy puffy- I enjoyed the hell out of Private Ryan: blood, gore, language, etc- but framed within reality.  I even love the Princess Bride with ROUS's and Miracle Max and his chocolate-coated Massive Pill, but it was clearly presented as a fairy tale.  Love Actually is a fairy tale presented as reality, but it's a slow, boring, pointless fairy tale like The Dark Crystal: I saw it and would rather that I had vacuumed the house. If you've seen The Dark Crystal, you know what I mean.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|No big spoilers here...  Movie starts after she stepped down from being PM.  The whole movie was a series of retrospectives/flashbacks from that.  I just didn't like it.  Thought it would have been more effective if it had been a normal movie without flashbacks.
B00000IQW5|5.0|...and if it is, I couldn't find it.  If you're the type who buys a movie (or even likes it or not) based on the director, you're, uh...weird.  If you don't know the story, don't read about it here and spoil it!  The most memorable part of the whole thing was a surprise to me, and people are blabbing it out on reviews!  Just think: Goodman, Dreyfuss, Hunter, Spielberg.  Just get it- I think the age range for this movie could be 10 and up, seriously.  And by &#34;up&#34; I mean the older you are, the better this movie could be.  I don't remember a lot of language, not anything really inappropriate (like the useless sex scene in Enemy At The Gates) and the characters are engaging right off the bat, while the story gets interesting real quick when The Event happens.  Get it, get it, get it.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Pros: full equipped, 3.0 usb, bios easy to update, a lot of space. Great sound incorporate. Easy installation.<br />Cons: not have PCI express 3.0.
B005HQ5S3G|3.0|What you've heard on the radio is all that's worth getting.  I listened to the samples, but really I skip over 6 of the songs entirely, and it's not like I havent' given them a chance. They don't grow on you- they're just not good.  There's a reason you haven't heard them before.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I chose five stars because the pictures were amazing and just the fact that One Direction wrote the entire book.<br />  I loved reading the favorites of the band members.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fast moving, exciting and it held my attention.  I read the whole series as fast as I could get them.
0671891634|4.0|Thanks......I don't like to be given a certain number of words I have to write in order to submit my review.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|This final book in the series is a wonderful completion to the trilogy.  Incredible plot and so well written.  Thank you!
B00005JNJV|5.0|a freind suggested that i order this so that I can understand the rest of the batman movies. really enjoyed it.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|The story is so compelling from the beginning I couldn't put it down.  The characters are so real and I couldn't wait to see what happens.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|If you're a Sci-Fi buff, or even if you just like watching the occasional space flick, you'll doubtless think 'Paul' is ridiculously funny - incredibly clever references, witty, and a bit raunchy at moments, but ALWAYS a laugh! One of my all-time favorite movies!

B008RXYOKY|5.0|This little adapter allows you to plug a FireWire 800 device into your Thunderbolt port. It does it flawlessly. No speed or capability loss.<br /><br />I've seen a little confusion about this product; it does NOT allow you to plug a Thunderbolt drive into a FireWire 800 port (why would you want to do that anyway?). One direction conversion. Sorry?<br /><br />Very happy with the product! You pay the Apple price, but you also get the Apple quality. Buy!

B001FB55I0|2.0|Believe it or not I think there was actually a chance that this could have worked (outside of James Cameron returning). Although T3 wasn't the best, it stayed much closer to the Terminator formula than Salvation did. Instead of taking a vision of the future that was already created for us by the inventor of the franchise (as seen in Terminator 1, 2 & 3), Hollywood saw this as a chance make a big Michael Bay-eque action, explosion, robot, summer-tentpole movie with a few notable names.<br /><br />The first mistake they made was hiring one of the least competent filmmakers in all the world named simply 'McG'. The Mad Max style desert backdrop really pushed it further from making it feel like a true Terminator movie after seeing what it was supposed to be in the 3 previous movies. To top if off the casting of Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese (basically Christian Bale's father) really didn't make much sense. Michael Biehn was definitely NOT a teenager in the first movie when he went back to save Sarah Connor. Christian Bale really wasn't right for the part of John Connor (and he knows it) his infamous rant will always be attached to this movie and his name. And personally I didn't like the trendy casting of Common but that wasn't as big a deal.<br /><br />It's very difficult for a Terminator movie to be legitimized without Stan Winston's iconic affects. While Winston passed away before the movie was released the lack of his presence was felt and the apparent reliance on CG and digital effects were obvious. Some of the endoskeletons that we are used to seeing are in this movie (T-800) and some that we haven't seen before (T-600, T-700), that was actually kind of interesting, as well as the featuring of the Hunter Killers. However some of the new machines they tried to implement were just too Transformery (motorcycles really?).<br /><br />Finally the music (another trademark of the first 2 films) just wasn't strong enough. They chose Danny Elfman to essentially match Brad Fiedel (who basically retired from the biz in '95) and while he has done some fantastic music in his career he wasn't really the right guy for the job. The music should have been strong and able to stand on it's own like Fiedel's soundtrack for T2.<br /><br />It's hard for me to look at this in any other way because of the fact that it is a Terminator movie, there are certain standards it should meet and this fell far below those standards. Unfortunately there is no salvation in this Terminator movie but I'm sure they'll try again (Terminator Genisys).d from the biz in '95) and while he has done some fantastic music in his career he wasn't really the right guy for the job.

B00267N3DQ|5.0|Disney has undoubtedly produced some of the most successful and memorable classic animated films of all time. Ever since it's first feature, the immortalized Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, made its debut in 1937 the company became unstoppable releasing classic after classic.<br /><br />But it all started with Snow White. Beautifully animated, well composed songs, an innocent heroine and a terrifying villainess. This movie first made kids, and adults, fall in love with Disney's animation and the film itself, both wanting to see the movie again and again. To say that over the past 75+ years the film has just survived would be a serious understatement. Through all this time there is still an audience for it, whether it's children of the 2000's seeing it for the first time, their parents who grew up with the film on VHS or even their grandparents who saw the films first run in theaters.<br /><br />There's just something about the feel of the film that makes you at home, which is exactly the way the late great Mr. Walt Disney would want us to feel watching the film. Having said all this the new wave (since the mid 90's) of Disney Pixar films are great, but sometimes people just forget how good traditional Disney animation is.

B003ZHR6RK|5.0|Whenever films are being discussed and good films are being discussed The Shawshank Redemption has become a benchmark. For example if you watch a movie you think is really good you may consider it \\"Shawshank-good\\", similar to the Godfathers (I & II) but more recent. This is what a truly great film and what truly great acting and filmmaking looks like (so rarely seen these days). If you ever wondered what it is like to be liberated through cinema watch this film and you will understand.

B000PMLFRA|4.0|At least we get to see the original trilogy in blu-ray and luckily the best film in the series (Empire) was the least touched, although Boba Fetts new voice still bothers me. Now to review the actual films.<br />The most legendary and epic piece of science fiction filmmaking ever, Star Wars. These movies have it all, the greatest heroes and the most iconic villains you will find anywhere and arguably the most memorable score ever performed. The composing guru John Williams has done many excellent works but none will be remembered like the theme from Star Wars. Star Wars is for everyone from the very young to the very old, everyone loves it. To me only one version of these films exist and that is the original theatrical version in their purity.

B000JSI7DK|5.0|Considered to be the best sports movie by millions and certainly the best boxing movie, only Raging Bull even contends with popular opinion. This 'Indie movie\\", back when no such genre existed, came from literal humble beginnings like our titular hero. This movie really set the standard for all sports flicks to come, showcasing one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) everyman protagonists on screen. It's almost impossible not to get emotional at one point or another during the course of the movie and the brilliant Bill Conti score helps a lot in giving you that emotion.
B009NW9QE2|5.0|Great Holiday movie!!  A must see for the Holiday season!!!  Perfect for this time of  year and ANYTIME for that matter!!
B0018QCXH8|5.0|One of the most brilliant tales of greed and fortune, this film is a true gem for cinema aficionados. Reverting to the western style of filmmaking this picture is filled with amazing scenery shots (Oscar winner for best Cinematography) and long periods of dialogueless action, reminiscent of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.<br /><br />Adapted from Upton Sinclair's novel Oil! this film is about the oil boom in the late 1800's and a man who decided to capitalize on it. Complete with a terrifying score by Johnny Greenwood, guitarist from the band Radiohead, and an unparalleled performance, to be matched with that of Jack Nicholson or Marlon Brando, There Will Be Blood is sure to become a landmark film.

B008518MOW|5.0|I was kinda let down by Men in Black 2.  It was a good movie but could have been better.  Men in Black 3 was much better.  I wish Rip Torn (Zed) was not in jail when they made this movie.  I think he would have been a little better than Emma Thompson as Agent O.  3D was pretty good but not great.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Got this for Christmas and I have to say 99% of the appeal was this awesome storage case. Definitely worth the money. It already has a nice spot in my living room.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|This was a funny movie. I like both actors in other movies and the pair make a great combo. Extra's on the blu-ray disc are ok, nothing great.  Good movie quality and good sound quality.
B002QP145C|3.0|I was looking forward with great anticipation to an expanded version of this film and I wasn't disappointed.  The disc was another matter.  All of a sudden the scene would 'freeze' and any attempt to forward it would result in it jumping back to the previous scene or even the first scene on the disc.  I did play it on a portable Blu-ray player rather than a standard one but that shouldn't have made any difference as everything else I have viewed on it has played fine.  Perhaps it was just this disc but it didn't break up into pixels or anything like that it just didn't perform up to standard
B00932AA5G|3.0|If you're planning to watch this to catch Nikolaj Coster-Waldau outside the Game of Thrones, he has a relatively small part here. The lead guy (Aksel something) is okay of course, but he isn't the best actor in the cast, which is distracting.  The plot, altho dirivative and over-the-top at times, would probably be fun for younger male audiences and random others.  It's not a bad movie. I gave it 3 stars, but if there had been a scale of 1 to 10, it would have gotten 6.  If it's Waldau you're after, see the series, New Amsterdam, on hulu.  He'll also be in the next Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion, out April, 2013.

B004CEUEWE|4.0|Ben Affleck's &#34;The Town&#34; is based on Chuck Hogan's book &#34;Prince of Thieves&#34; (later released under the name &#34;The Town&#34; to capitalize on its tie-in to the movie), and it is a remarkably faithful adaptation of a truly engrossing book. I read the book just a couple of weeks before renting the movie, and I often find that this is a recipe for disaster as far as the movie is concerned (it is just very hard to compete with a reader's imagination).<br /><br />Instead, however, I found that actually seeing the familiar Boston landmarks brought the book alive in a very different way. The story is very well translated to screen and the constant tension from the book manifests itself very well on-screen.<br /><br />There are a few notable things in the movie: the late Pete Postlethwaite is typically terrific in a small but powerful role, Jeremy Renner plays a slightly out-of-control character that is very different from his Bourne or Hawkeye characters, and Rebecca Hall is nearly perfect in the role of Claire (vulnerable but strong, pretty but not glamorous). It is also interesting to see Jon Hamm (of Mad Men fame) in a current day role as an FBI agent who shares almost nothing with his Don Draper character on the television show.<br /><br />This is the second of Ben Affleck's movies as a director (&#34;Gone Baby Gone&#34; was first and &#34;Argo&#34; is the third), and it is a terrific piece of work.

B008220D0U|4.0|**very minor spoiler on the first 10 mins of the movie only**<br /><br />first off i will warn you. there is a pretty dark violent sceen at the begining where several innocent civilians are shot by a sniper in a lone gunman terrorism attack. it is very graphic and the average person is going to be bothered by it. this is not a kids movie, there is no part of this a child or even really a teen would enjoy.<br /><br />non spoiler review - Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher, a former Army Cop. Tom fights his way through conspiricy and bad guys with help of a defense laywer try to uncover what happened in a mass shooting involving a former military sniper. the movie itself is not a huge mind game, nor is there anything that is really un predictable but the ride to the end is pretty fun anyways. Personally i found a few of the sceens a little cheesy and un realalistic but it is definitly worth a view if you are interested in some of Tom's other movies like the Mission Impoissible's.

B006O6F932|3.0|I chose this Monster High High School Playset to review with the help of my oldest daughter who is a big Monster High fan. The school itself only took about 5 minutes to set up -- just open it and unfold a few pieces. Putting the accessories together took longer than anything else, maybe a half hour total. You also get stickers you can use to customize the look of the school however you want.<br /><br />The overall durability isn't what I'd expect from such a bulky, expensive product. It hasn't fallen apart yet, but it certainly doesn't seem to be built with the craftsmanship of dollhouses from years gone by (you know, back when they weren't all made in China). The floors of the school (which are the back of the house when it's all folded up) are entirely flimsy cardboard, while the rest of the school is plastic. Why couldn't they have forked out an extra cent to make the floors plastic as well? To save an extra cent, I guess.<br /><br />Everything is hinged together for easy setup and take down, which is good and bad. Good because it can be folded up immediately after use and stored nicely. Bad because it makes for instability issues while playing, whereas if it would have had pieces that properly snapped together, it would have been more stable (but take a lot longer to take down for storage). Not sure what they could have done differently here, but in the end I guess I like having the ability to quickly fold it up after use.<br /><br />The accessories included with the school provide a nice touch while playing. The blue cart doesn't stay together very well, not sure why. Everything else has held together fairly well and adds to the fun factor of the school overall.<br /><br />A quick note -- the box shows all sorts of dolls and even a little note about a DVD, but don't be fooled by any of that. You only get the school and the accessories -- no dolls or DVD are included (the box does say this, but you have to look hard to find it). For the price it's my opinion that they should have either included a doll, or given a more durable product (or, preferably both!). As is, it's still a fun toy that's likely to be enjoyed by any fans of Monster High.at they should have either included a doll, or given a more durable product (or, preferably both!).

B009RI4FRU|1.0|Wes Anderson has finally conclusively proven that you can't just rely on stark cinematography and interesting costumes to make a watchable film. This dude needs to dedicate some more time to his scripts. I can't imagine how terrible this movie must've looked on paper. This hour-and-a-half long mess felt like three. I kept waiting for it to pick up and it finally did... About 45 minutes in when I slipped into a coma-like dream on my couch. That dream was a pretty good one. Fueled by my desperate need to escape the abysmal monotony of pointless masturbatory trash that had preceded it. This may be one or the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't let your pretentious friends make you believe you didn't \\"get it.\\" There is nothing to get. This film is as deep as a Katy Perry song without the catchy hook. Whomever is responsible for giving Wes Anderson an unrestricted creative license needs to have their granting powers revoked. Looking at you, Weinsteins. Rushmore was good. Royal Tenenbaums was solid. Everything since has been absolute garbage. Anderson is the M. Night of indie films. Sooner or later I'll realize that there will never be another Sixth Sense. Just a constant flow of The Happening and Lady in the Water. Wished I'd rented Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. At least I couldn't have possibly been disappointed.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I first saw this film when I was aged 12, 38 years ago, and loved the story.  I finally decided to get this, but am perplexed as to why the extra colourised version was ever considered.  Of course I won't watch that disc because it is a crime to do that to films of that era, or for that matter to edit any work of film or animation from its original presented form.  This is why I won't buy any of the animated Christmas shows from the 60's, Rudolph, Grinch, etc.  I've heard too many things about how/what has been removed.  It is nice that &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34; is as complete as I remember, and as far as I know.  The extras on this DVD are quite nice as well.  The rest speaks for itself.  Wonderful.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a good book,  there is more to the story than what it was advertised as. looking forward to the next book from this author
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The blu-ray presentation of this is superb.  I sometimes have trouble with other blu-ray discs in terms of the sound being too highly contrasted to enjoy it.  This is not the case with this version.  The dialogue is clear and the special effect sounds aren't too loud to warrant reducing the volume.  One of my cats was completely startled when the train pulled up in front of the house for the first time.  It felt like an earthquake when played through my Sony ES system with six B&W speakers.  He ran around to see what was coming from the back and was a bit startled.  The visual is superb and I knew I hadn't made a mistake in getting this version over the regular DVD.<br /><br />The story is fantastic, although some of the action is a bit nerve racking and four of the characters I found a bit creepy.  I'll let you decide which one they are.  Seeing around that, its a great story especially toward the end.  The overall impression of this digitally animated film is one of nostalgia.  I ended up in tears because of its cathartic beauty.
B001NA2NM4|5.0|if you have never seen this movie, i highly recommend it. no special effects here, these folks are the real thing. and quite amazing.

0525953728|1.0|This is a terrible book. Talk about udeserved hype !  When the book was published there was talk  that the author should be imprisoned for releasing secrets.  I don't know about that, but I would suggest that he and the co author should be imprisoned for producing such a unbelievably bad book.  The writing is terminally boring, and the plot sets records for thinness. After the author, admittedly to his credit, told us in the intro that there really wasn't anything new in the book and that the names of everyone were changed, a wise reader of which  I apprently am not one should have closed the book and moved on. But, no .  I began reading it.  Now, I have been know to skim towards the end of a book that is running out of steam, but I don't recall skimming after the first chapter.  Yet, it did no good. I gave up well before the author  killed the bad guy.  Save your money !

0156027321|5.0|I read many books every year, but only a few books have made it onto my list of favorites. And out of the four or five that are on my short-list, I do believe this book is still the winner.<br />  I loved this book when I first read it, and loved it even more when I re-read it about two or three years later. I find myself thinking about a certain section or line months or even years after reading it. And as I have told some friends reluctant to read this book, just the story alone is more than worth the time.<br />  I was extremely wary of the movie, although it did quite a better job than I feared. But as always, a movie can't do the book justice. Although I wouldn't call this a light or unemotional read, I would highly recommend this book to anyone.

The HD player did play the file but I could not fast forward or rewind and it would not let me continue from a specific point in the movie if I closed the application.  So I have to give it two stars because it is lacking basic features that I expect from a media player
B007ZXK08C|1.0|The polt had many twists but I didn't like how the characters jump around from past to present expecting the reader to be dragged along (unwillingly at times) through the backstory.
0440241901|3.0|Just finished reading the Kindle version.  I enjoyed the story and the writing style, but the characters lacked depth and credibility.  The protagonist, Emma is the most believable character - young, naive, a bit flighty, and lacking in self-confidence, she is still idealistic and ready to find herself.  Her ex-boyfriend, roommates, co-workers and parents are all one-dimensional, so I found myself not caring about them or their roles to play in the story.  So many more entertaining chick-lit stories out there to read...wishing I had passed on this one.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and stayed up all night to find out what will happen to Travis! I can hardly wait until the release of walking disaster! the book had wonderful multidimensional characters that were all interesting (especially the protagonists) and an unpredictable plot! Worth the read.
B001S86J0I|2.0|When i got this DVD in the mail the case was cracked. The sellers should have used better packing materials.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|since this is a HD tablet you would think the pictures would be clearer and more sharper and it's awkward taking pictures with it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book Hope the movie is good too not like dear john. :( Love nicholas sparks :) .
006117758X|5.0|This was the first Bukowski piece I read, and I loved it! I don't read books leisurely often (what college student has time?), and haven't picked this one up since I first read it years ago, but it was one of my all-time favorite books. If I had to recommend something Bukowski this is first on my list with [[ASIN:0061177571 post office: A Novel]] (a quicker read) in second. I would also recommend reading his short poems.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this would be a better app if they would fix the newsfeed.  i won' t be using it until it is fixed.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is great I love it and it's worth the five dollar  you have to pay<br />To play it
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Watched this movie with my teenage daughters and we all enjoyed it. Recommend it for people with teenagers.  they will love it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought this was a really good book but through out the whole thing I felt as if he had some really bad mental defects... I know that sounds kinda bad but oh well. Also, I really wanted things to work out for him.  Charlie to really come into himself, to blossom. The end just felt so final, that the last thing he ever did was ride through that tunnel. That after that there were no possibilities for him, seeing as so many people thought him an effing freak, and as a teenage girl who has been in a similar situation where all your roads have taken you to a dead end, I don't understand how he could have made new friends as a sophomore. The only reason I did was because I moved.<br />Like I said, good book, but kinda eerie and final
0545265355|5.0|these books are awesome would most defiantly  order again some of the best books I ever read more than happy with them.
030758836X|4.0|This was a really good book. It is full of twists and turns. I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. Definitely a good read.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|this also was a Christmas present we gave to someone and they said it worked great so far and there happy with it .
B000KJT8IG|1.0|I ordered this for my father for Christmas. I received an already opened blu-ray without the paper cover and a broken case. What kind of crap is that? Even if the blu-ray doesn't come with the paper cover, it should have NEVER been open nor should it have been broken.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well, it kind of jumps back and forth in flashbacks and flash-forwards, but the content is a nice eye-opener in how things work on Seal teams. Thanks for the insights!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I bought these for my father in law for Christmas he loved it if you like Sons Of Anarchy must get
B008O9V4C2|5.0|As a fan from the beginning, I have every solo and group effort by Donald Fagen. I bought this on faith and I was not disappointed. Outstanding musicianship and production is a given with Mr. Fagen but this album also brings lyrical songs that have real stories with that New York point of view, written from the perspective of a mature man who has lived and learned. I loved it.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is a must see -  it has excellent production, direction, so real to life.  Draws in to want to know what happens next week.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I had watched this movie in theaters and loved it. Honestly I had never read the books before until recently and noticed that they didn't change it much. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson they deliver. They both give good performances.
B009329Y30|5.0|The story line, romance, actors well performed, you did not want to leave the room wanting to know what happen next.  Well directed and produced.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a lot of fun it. it can be challenging at times but over all I think you should download it.
0240815807|3.0|Although the book is full of information about mixing and sound design concepts, I felt the book turned a blind eye to simplicity. The book's title is MIXING SECRETS, which led me to believe it was more to the point. I fell asleep several times trying to read this (yes, it has happened on other books as well), then just started going to the \\"Cut to the Chase sections\\", as they were quite a bit easier, useful to read and the saving grace to this book.<br /><br />The more I know about audio, the more the book makes sense in a formal way.... which is counter to what I was hoping for. I suppose the publisher was trying to fit this title (home studio) into a broader collection of similar books, thus the title, even though it doesn't represent the books overall vibe. It should have been titles \\"Become a Sound Guru\\".<br /><br />The author seemed to be too knowable on the subject and wrote the book for his colleagues, rather then a new mixing hopeful. This book rarely excites and will not give you the \\"Mixing secrets / Hot tips\\" that you may be hoping for; such as \\"This is how you mix a Vocal for a Ballad without walking all over it\\", or this is how you \\"Create a thumping dance sound using compression\\", \\"How to Mix a Bass Guitar, etc...... honestly, since there is so much in the book regarding design, that the information may be in the book somewhere or everywhere, I just didn't see it.<br /><br />I am writing this review as I look for another book that is frankly more dumb down and more to the point, then this text book on mixing. To his credit I felt very comfortable regarding the accuracy of the authors points and teaching. I found him on Sound on Sound as their mix master guru, such is why I bought the book. I've read it 70 percent through word for word and skimmed the summaries twice, and have retained one mixing secret = to get good monitors! The rest of the advice was far too PC and didn't actually say, this is how you get \\"this sound\\", etc...<br /><br />\\"Cut to theChase\\" = If you want knowledge on concept and why sound does what it does, as well as many or all your technical questions answered in a VERY technical way, then buy this book now! However, if you're a solo artist looking for advice on mixing your own music in your home studio, then this book will only confuse. It is like going to your band's nerd sound guy and asking how to get a better mix and he begins to answer with the question \\"what is sound?\\"<br /><br />EDIT: I found the beginners book on Mixing for the Home Studio solo artist. It's call The Producer's Manual - by Paul White ...<br /><br />The two books may compliment each other
B0017TWUZG|5.0|I always wanted step up to the street 2  when i purchase i now have a complete set of step to the street.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love playing this game and listining to music on my kindle fire.  It's so much fun!  Get this app.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Good movie, a little slow but of rthe most part a good movie to watch. I don't know if I would pay to watch it, just wait for it on netflix
0425263916|5.0|Great follow-up to Bared to You, I loved the characters, am anxious tor the next installment--Entwined in you....very erotic and sensual...
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|I love this series but this had to be the worst ever.  Story line jumped around too much and did not pick up where the last movie left off.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|It was a Christmas gift, but started watching it and so far it is great. It was highly recommended to me. I'm sure I will enjoy all of it as well.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|Not as good as the first one was.  Wasn't bad but not much story line.  Good to watch if nothing else is on.
1439170916|5.0|I'm not a big non-fiction reader - I usually find that they are too dry or tend to drag after a while. But this book was fantastic. Fast paced, edge of your seat excitement about people staring at cell cultures and test tubes: that's great writing!<br /><br />On a more somber note, if you know someone who had or has or will have cancer, this book is a great primer for what questions to ask or think about. Highly recommended.
1451695195|4.0|When a reader gets to 70+ years, any tangible clue about the afterlife is bound to attract attention ranging from mild to intense. For example, will one be punished for past misdeeds, or will they be forgiven when we pass on? Will the non-musically inclined have to play a harp for the rest of eternity? Most of us are not going to have NDE's, so we owe a debt of gratitude to those who return to enlighten us. The good doctor has clearly reported his experiences without significant editorial guidance, and this is understood because he obviously favored accuracy over literary polish. The author's NDE experience rings true to this reader, and the revelation of the identity of the girl on the butterfly wing is the final clincher!
0062101897|5.0|My daughter cannot put this book down! It is very attractive and has great behind-the-scenes photos and information. Great for a coffee table conversation piece.
B004G600A4|5.0|Everyone in the house has watched this movie over and over with our want to be Rapunzel.  No matter that age, male/female, everyone likes it and never seems to tire of it.  Maximus is our favorite character.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|This book is<br /> good because it's really funny and it's just awesome. It's basically a humor book so yeah peace
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|We love the Lion King.  Its a classic that everyone can watch and enjoy.  Have not watched in 3D yet.
B001CZJKS0|5.0|This is a great box set to add to your Halloween collection.  You will have to purchase Halloween II separately it is not included in this box edition set.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Although this subject has interested me for a long time, and I have read several other reports of NDE's (Near Death Experiences), Dr. Alexander's approach was quite different with the inclusion of scientific data and perspectives.  Not only do we get to see the wonders he experienced through his particular filter, but we also have the added benefit of clinical support regarding the physical conditions of his body while he was in Heaven.<br />This book has not changed my mind regarding Life After Death but has provided great food for thought as I continue to grow spiritually.
B0044WUJQ0|5.0|A must have for the horror classic collection.  Great for the collection to pull out at Halloween time.  Much better than scary movies of today.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Watched it with my kids, mom, and sister. We all couldn't stop laughing. This is a movie I would definitely buy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|One of those books that I could not put down - excellent plot twists.  Fynn's development of characters was stimulating and surprisingly believable with each shift in premise.
B009J2VQSK|4.0|I just saw the movie and love the soundtrack. However, I wish the soundtrack was 2 cd's to include more of the songs that were in the movie.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Each book gets more fascinating. great characters, well developed.  very detailed story. hard to put down. graphic at parts so not intended for young readers.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know it was for the sex but honestly it is poorly written and because of that does not keep my interest
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I haven't listened to the CD yet, but I've loved all of her other songs thus far. Plus the album was only $1.99!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|a great movie!  one of the classics, one of the things i really like about it is the songs and kids love to sing with it!!!!  another good movie for kids and even adults!  :)
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I love everything she does, so I'm sure I'll love this too. I haven't listened to it yet though. She's an awesome artist!
B00005JNS0|4.0|Another good movie, i watched it and I thought it was a cute movie!  my neice loves this movie and any movie with cars in it!!  a good movie for any child!
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|I watched the show and loved all of the music. Instinctively, I bought the album on sale. I haven't listened to it yet, but I'm sure I'll love it!
B005DOKIYG|4.0|Wanted the Red One but in Checkout would only give blue. Otherwise great!! Was given as a gift. Thanks Amazon!!
B001O3B2M2|5.0|I think this is one of Christina's better albums and there hasn't been one to top it yet! She's an amazing singer!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book lives up to its expectation. I strongly suggest this book to people of all ages. I would also suggest reading the other two books in the series.
B001BKAEHW|5.0|I went to his Battle Studies concert in 2010 which was Amazing! I just purchased this to and to my collection. I remember listening to it in my college days. Loved it!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I just love to watch the antics of Scratch, there could be a whole movie on him alone!<br />We really enjoyed this movie, even has some adult humor.
B004498KPU|5.0|CD exceeded all expectations from packaging to video quality and selection. It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he<br />watches it constantly.
B005RYF5JA|4.0|Delightful, another great offering of songs sung by these lovely girls who really do know how to sing.<br />Whether you turn it up loud or have it turned down for quiet back ground music it does not matter, this is beautiful music.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Channing Tatum did a great job but the storyline wasn't very strong. The movie would've been better with different supporting actors.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun because u have A time limt and one of them is 30 seconds so I did 5 in that time and I tryed beating it. it just so fun And its worth the cost FREE
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is fantastic for those who love to think just a little when they read. The photos involved in the story really help to bring it alive. Recommended for those with an open mind.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so fun to read! It just sucks you into Greg's world with all the drama. If you haven't read one of these books I strongly advise you do.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Love this game so many things to do in this game too I can battle and play with my monsters!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A great book would read it a lot if a diary of a wimpy kid series read the series a great pass time for young readers
B005LAII1C|5.0|I watched it the other night with my son we both loved it funny with a good story to back it up
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I liked it it was lots of fun to read  read and to see UN to the merry store yay
B009NPKTN6|5.0|A great movie that brought back memories of the bands that inspired it. The music was well-selected and surprisingly very well sung by Julianne and Tom. I even bought several of the songs on MP3 since the versions were so good.  While the story may be cheesy and predictable, it is exactly how you want it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary I is very useful,you will always have it because When you are using the kindle and you find a word you dont have than just pull up the app and TADA! Its there (: plus if the word isn't there just hi-light it than look it upon. Wikipedia
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I chose this rating  because this book is kind of sad.if you like books that are a big cliff hanger then you should read this.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It includes all of your favourite ponies and places! You'll love it!l l l l l . 'll ;) b . H . B . B B-) cu crucifix hubbub
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read this book years ago and just bought it for my Kindle. It's very engaging. You become so engrossed with the characters that it's hard to put the book down.
B0067R0APK|3.0|UPDATE - didn't know the license eventually expires.   Started getting messages that my license is no longer valid.  I'm hoping this is a config problem.    Works very well...radar very useful.  Only change would be to have automatic alignment...portrait vs. landscape - small complaint...definitely worth having
B00571F26Y|5.0|What an eye opening book.  So many things we over look as getting older and really a few minor adjustments to our diets and we are feeling better than ever.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I borrowed this book from the library by looking at the cover and thinking I could really enjoy a good adventure story.  Something light and nothing that I had to think about much.  Just a fun book.  None of that happened.  None.  I almost took the book back after about 35 pages.  The intent of the book was murky and it didn't seem to be going anywhere I wanted to go.  I had just read a book about current the economic structure of America by a Nobel Prize author, \\"The Price of Inequality\\".  It was good but it was not light reading.  I was not prepared for a lengthy discussion of religion and the various branches of religion.  But I got into the rhythm of the story and by 50 pages I was hooked.  This has been called a simple story and I do not agree.  It is a masterful, even elegant, tiered tale that is played out in a small volume of space.  The thoughts and ideas, the issues and the adaptations are rich and dense.<br /><br />I make a connection with two movies.  12 Angry Men, and Lifeboat by Alfred Hitchcock.  Both are about critical survival issues played out in a small, sometimes claustrophobic setting.  Both highlight the way essential decisions are made and how we use natural talents and whatever comes to hand to meet needs.  All three end with an unexpected trust.<br /><br />I liked this small story.  I have just bought the book because it will be read more than once.
142311339X|5.0|it's an excellent book, and arrived in good conditions, as expected. It completely fullfilled my expectations, I totally recommend it
