1250000971|1.0|Jeffrey Archer was a superb novelist. Unfortunately he has turned to writing soap operas. In the two current Clifton Chronicles books (even more to come) he generates serial disasters from which the hero/heroine miraculously escapes, only to encounter a new unrealistic challenge. Every book in this series ends leaving the characters in a precarious situation with the outcome to be delivered in the next issue. It is sad to see this very talented writer lowering himself to the use of bush league methods in order to sell his books.
B000002IAZ|5.0|In the Mid 1960's Buffalo Sringfield burst upon the American music scene blending country and rock music as it had never been done before, or since. Sadly, the band, heavy with musical geniuses the like of Stephen Stills, Neil Young, Richie Furay, and Jim Messina would only produce three albums together before calling it quits. Retrospective is a \\"best of\\" compilation of their all too brief time together.<br /><br />This ablum is a great blend of Buffalo Springfield's earliest hits, from the politically charged \\"For What It's Worth\\", their first big hit, to \\"Sit Down I Think I Love You\\" and \\"Go And Say Goodbye\\" to their more mature selections like \\"On the Way Home\\" and \\"Expecting to Fly\\", both tunes penned by Neil Young.<br /><br />Future Poco founding member Richie Furay writes and sings lead on \\"Kind Woman\\" and his vocals are also featured in lead in \\"On the Way Home\\" which was written by Neil Young but not performed by him; his voice was criticized as too thin and reedy to be marketable. Who knew? Clearly those calling the shots didn't.<br /><br />Stephen Stills' guitar and lead vocals shine in \\"Bluebird\\" the first song he wrote for his love, folk songtress, Judy Collins, and his banjo playing at the end is an awesome treat for fans. He also sings lead on \\"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\\" and splits vocal leads with Neil Young on the latter's offering, \\"Broken Arrow\\", a familiar Young selection that he would often perform live during his solo career.<br /><br />My favorite song on this album is the 2 minute 44 second lively selection, \\"Rock and Roll Woman\\" which is about as kickass as Buffalo Springfield ever gets. Note the vocal harmonies featured in the choruses and you can just hear what CSN will become renowned for. It all begins in this song, I think. This is cleverly followed by Neil Young's \\"I Am A Child', a deeply moving, introspective number.<br /><br />I think \\"Sit Down I Think I Love You\\" and \\"Go and Say Goodbye\\" could have had better sound quality, but that is my only criticism of this cd. The Album wraps with another mellow, Neil Young, selection, \\"Expecting to Fly\\".<br /><br />This is a great cd compilation of Buffalo Springfield's best, IMHO. I've long admired Stephen Stills and am a fan of his music in all it's incarnations. Neil Young fans will not be disappointed either, he's written six of the 12 songs included on the album even if he wasn't deemed worthy to sing lead vocals on all of them he does sing lead on most of them and as always tears it up on \\"Mr. Soul\\" which is also included in this album. If you need every single song ever performed by Buffalo Springfield, then by all means buy all three of their cds. There's a wealth of wonderful music contained within them, but if you sometimes enjoy just the most recognizable hits on a single \\"best of\\" compilation, Buffalo Springfield's Retrospective will not disappoint. Enjoy!t that is my only criticism of this cd.

1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's personal voyage into the world beyond the veil of death is incredibly inspiring. I have long been fascinated with life after death and found this book to be the best one I've ever read on the subject. Her insights and wisdom about what awaits us on the \\"other side\\" are not only comforting, but also inspire us to live the best life we can while we are here. I have recommended this book to my friends and family, and all have loved it. Highly recommended!

B008764ZQ4|5.0|We saw this movie when it first came to theaters and I loved it.  I didn't know it was a musical and I wasn't so sure I was going to be into it, but I just loved it.  As soon as we came home from the movies I went to Amazon to see if they had a soundtrack and I bought it.  I listened to it over and over.  These were the songs I listened to as a teenager and I loved hearing them again.  I couldn't believe that was actually Tom Cruise singing, I thought he did an excellent job.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|i enjoyed the hunger games and catching fire as well. although catching fire did have some flaws. but this book was in my opinion very bad. for the first 2 books i liked them and was motivated to keep reading. but when i started this book, i lost interest very quickly. i would not suggest this to many people who liked the hunger as much as me. its almost like 2 different peope wrote those books. anyway, have a nice day. :)

B005PMNBNG|5.0|I won't lie, I look back on the 80's and sometimes wish I could go back.  Not that it was any better/worse than today, but my childhood memories tell my emotions that it was awesome.  I love the music of that era, love the movies, love the more carefree attitudes.  For me, this is the first modern album that I've ever heard that takes me back to the 80's!  I've got tons of great 80's music that are great reminders, but this is something completely new and yet it still takes me back in time.<br /><br />Well done M83... I am now a huge fan!!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was ok. It does not deserve all the hype it is getting. The storyline was more like soft porn . It is an easy read. I am not interested enough to read the other 2 books. I am glad though that there are books that inspire people to read even if they are not good books. I would have happier with the book if there was a little less love story and more about the characters themselves.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I'm not going to do any spoilers, or even go in depth as to what the the story-line is about. There are plenty of reviews that have already taken care of that. I will mention my thoughts on the premise though.<br /><br />This movie had already been out from quite awhile before I saw it. I hadn't seen a trailer or even knew what it was about. Perhaps that is why I enjoyed it, I had no preconceived expectations. I rarely enjoy Hollywood movies anymore. I watch mainly foreign an independent films. The reason for this, those films have a higher satisfaction rate of getting what you expect. Not over-hyped movies featuring overpaid actors where everything good to see in the movie is pieced together into a 30 second trailer!<br /><br />Bradly Cooper does in outstanding job in this \\"what if\\" film. What if I could be a success? What if it were possible to have my dreams come true? What if I became a different person ... good or bad? Most of us has experienced these what if or if only moments. If we had a magic pill that helped us achieve our dreams, would we take it? If we did, would it change our personality or affect our moral decisions? Bradly Coopers character gets to ask those questions and receive the answers. Will he like the answers he gets? Will he fly like Icarus or spiral out of control? Where will this sudden realization take him? Will he stay on that road or take another one? Will it change him for better or for worse? What happens when other people want what you have?<br /><br />This movie highlights what are each of us may be capable of under the right circumstances. How the choices we make and continue to make shapes our lives.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, please vote. Thank You.

B008645YEE|4.0|First, let me start by stating why this is a 4-star review and not a 5-star. I remove one star for three reasons. The first is the loss of James Newton Howard. He bowed out of this project because he felt like a \\"third wheel\\" to Zimmer and Nolan's collaborative relationship. I appreciate this, but I feel that his influence on the scores for \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" were integral to the evolution of the overall composition. His loss is deeply felt here. Second, this soundtrack is simply not as innovative as either of its predecessors. It does wonderful things, has wonderful cues, but never feels like it is truly going into new territory the way the last two soundtracks did. Finally, Zimmer once claimed that the Batman theme would evolve over the course of the three films. Even on \\"The Dark Knight\\" he claimed that the theme was not complete. However, I find very little change in Batman's theme from that soundtrack to this one. Given the leaps the theme took from \\"Batman Begins\\" to \\"The Dark Knight\\", it is a shame that it wasn't developed further. I wonder if having Howard on board would have changed that.<br /><br />Now, aside from those points, I have little to complain about with this album. The first half of the soundtrack builds towards some of the most foreboding atmosphere I have ever heard from a film score. I haven't seen the movie yet (it is released in 3 more days) but already I dread Bane's presence. His theme is not as individualistic as the Joker's. Rather, his presence is felt in a choir of chanting voices and deep brass and drums, no doubt reflecting the criminal occupation of Gotham depicted in the film. Bane is a character built up by the people he represents, by the cause itself. It is as if his character is, by nature itself, socially constructed. Therefore, the choral approach seems entirely accurate.<br /><br />We can only assume from the myriad hints given by the cast and crew over time that this movie ends on a positive note. Therefore, it is not surprising to have Batman's theme becoming more dominant over the latter half of the album, finally ending in a rendition of the overture from \\"The Dark Knight\\" (which appeared on that soundtrack as the title \\"A Dark Knight\\"). It provides a nice, easy ending to an otherwise jarring album, resolving the foreboding tone of the early tracks. Nolan's liner notes claim that Zimmer's score captures the \\"rising evil\\" depicted in the film and I would fully agree. This is certainly the feel you get listening to this score, the feel that good is triumphing over evil against insurmountable odds.<br /><br />I bought the CD (not mp3) so I received bonus tracks from a website listed on an insert inside the case. The three tracks include two more score tracks and one remix (typical of Zimmer's albums). The remix is fairly humdrum, as they often are. It will appeal only to those who have a liking for house/techno. The two score tracks are very good, though a bit long and repetitive. Was it necessary to cut them from the final album? Perhaps, given how long they are. But having them provides a bit more to the hope-end of the album, giving us another (approximately) 12 minutes of Batman triumphantly fighting evil.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this album. I felt that given the way these films have evolved, this is a fitting end and it only makes me look forward even more to seeing the film.<br /><br />Addendum (2 weeks later): After seeing the movie twice, I think the soundtrack (as an album) works great, I stick by my original review. However, I don't think it worked nearly as well as it could have in the film since they interspliced it with many old cues from the other soundtracks. This dilutes the power of this album and makes the soundtrack seem less interesting in the context of the film. On the other hand, listening to the CD now allows me to visualize in my mind the scenes that correspond to each track, making them that much more poignant.<br /><br />Also, it turns out they (again) released a deluxe digital version of the album with two more tracks. To specify, if you buy the CD version, you get a link to the tracks \\"No Stone Unturned\\" and \\"Risen From Darkness\\". The deluxe digital bonus songs are \\"The Shadows Betray You\\" and \\"The End\\" and these are different tracks. Both bonus sets include that remix track though. The total collector can decide if (s)he wants these extra tracks, but I am glad I have them.<br /><br />Finally, Zimmer has composed a tribute song for the victims of the Aurora CO shooting simply called \\"Aurora\\". All proceeds go to the victims and their families. The track is available on Itunes and Moontoast. The melody of the track is the \\"Dark Knight\\" overture in case you were wondering.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I've seriously read this 10 times. I wish this were a trilogy or similar because I can't get enough! Love the plot, characters and the style in which the author writes. I didnt want the story to end. Very addicting. This book won't disappoint you.

B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is awesome because you can look up videos in an instant. the best part is, is that a lot of the good music costs money when you have a device, right?  not when you get this free app. just type in a song you want to be on your device, once you have founded it, long press it, and click &quot;download as MP3&quot; and wait for it to download, and you've got that song on your device!

B003VANOFY|2.0|Here's a link to photos of the break - [...]<br /><br />I was watching a movie with the headset on. Took it off after the movie and the ear cup felt wrong, looked at it, and saw that the plastic had broken. Apparently just from the \\"stress\\" of being worn on my admittedly big head.<br /><br />I paid the full $160 MSRP when I ordered them from Dell (had to burn some gift cards up). For $160 I expected better.<br /><br />Honestly, for $40 I would expect better. It doesn't matter how good they are in other ways (and in other ways I'm happy with them) if they're not even going to last a year.<br /><br />I'll call Logitech in a bit to see about getting them warrantied (I hope). Even if they replace them, I'd still give it 1 star. Eventually the warranty runs out.<br /><br />(And no, these were not abused. Not dropped, not dropped on. From my desk to my head and back again, a few hours a day. Nothing more. And for $160 and as heavy as they are... they should be able to take some abuse.)<br /><br />Edit: Logitech replaced the headset at no charge and without making me jump through hoops. I sold the replacement rather than chance another break, so can't modify that part of the review, but I've bumped up a star because Logitech handled things well. I continue to give Logitech preference over similar products because I trust them to stand behind their products. Good service matters.

1469984202|3.0|I'm not saying this isn't a good book but I'm surprised by all the 5 star reviews. When I saw how many 5 star reviews this book had I was shocked and had to have it, I even made my friends aware of it (check out how many 5 star reviews this book has! It must be awesome!). I just knew it was going to be AMAZING. It is a good book but it's not really worthy on almost ALL reviews being 5 stars. It's not really that exciting and it's not a book that I can not put down. I kept waiting for it to get to 5 stars but it never really did. 3.5 stars maybe and I think I'm being kind. I really wanted to love this book but really it was just okay. I was glad when it finally ended!
B007HPO3CC|5.0|Love the Game of Thrones DVD, and the seller did a great job getting these DVDs to me right away.<br /><br />So what's the problem?  The inner product that holds the DVS in place were detached within a few minutes, and this was a sealed new product.  The DVDs ended up on the floor.<br /><br />I'll need to buy new DVD sleeves or jewel cases for them, as I sure want to keep the DVDs for viewing.<br /><br />Great story.  Great seller.  Poor inner packaging! At this price, sure expected at least more than an hour's worth of inner product.
0765316994|1.0|The first two chapters showed promise.  Once they mentioned star trek it got really stupid really fast.  The book was boring and trite.  The dialog was absurd.  It was the first book that I have abandoned in two years and I've read some pretty bad stuff over that time.  One last thing, I like occasional swearing in my science fiction, I think it adds to the setting.  The swearing in redshirts felt childish and sophomoric.  This book was so bad that I felt compelled to write this review.  It's my first and hopefully my last.<br />Oh, and yes, I bought the book.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|This movie was sooooooo awesome! Some other reviewers said that it was lacking a storyline? I couldnt disagree with that more! This movie was so good and funny and touching. I actually teared up a few times! I thought it had a great storyline! I could have done without the bare butts and major cleavage but if it had to be done, Id say it was done in a tasteful manner. I will buy this movie ASAP, its for sure a movie that can be enjoyed over and over and over.
030758836X|1.0|I don't know how this book is getting such rave reviews.  It started out as a very good page turner but then the surprise twist and continued saga ruined everything.  For me, it lost all credibility.  But I kept reading, wondering how the author would end it.  And it was't worth the effort.
B005FISBTO|3.0|Love dexter as always but this season is kind if weak. Watching Dexter and Colin together reminded me of watching Tom hanks and Wilson the volleyball in castaway. I liked Wilson's acting better than colin hank's however.<br /><br />Hard to believe there was not better talent available to go head to head with Dexter.<br /><br />The writing was much weaker this season. Dexter was not in danger of being found out.<br /><br />Many plot lines with no meaning to the main theme. Debbie, quinn, dexter's nanny etc. who cares? I miss Dokes and lyla.

0393088774|5.0|Professor Krugman does a terrific job highlighting the ability of the federal government to use more aggressive fiscal and monetary policy to end the depression.  Ideas such as a higher inflation target from the Federal Reserve and easier access to mortgage financing are spot on, but they are not enough.  The economic hole we have dug for ourselves is too deep.  For example, we shouldn't make refinancing easier we should require the lenders to refinance everyone without an appraisal or a credit check.  For those wanting to see bolder ideas to restore the economy check out [[ASIN:0578015358 How America Can Escape the New Great Depression]].
0060936223|5.0|I found much to like about Patti Smith's \\"Just Kids\\"--the time-capsule of New York in the late 60's and beyond, the descriptions of the artistic process, the depictions of coming-of-age struggles, the in-depth look at Robert Mapplethorpe (who I'd known little about) and even the physical aspects of the book itself, with its parchment-type pages, the sturdy built-in jacket cover, and the (mostly Robert's) photographs, so beautifully displayed at appropriate intervals. (Try getting that tactile experience from an e-book!) I came away with a deep respect for the author, who is so adept in so many mediums.  I am not qualified to judge the presentation on historical accuracy or any technical criteria, and in any case, this is clearly Ms. Smith's story to tell.  Tell she does, in a way that is a treat for the senses and the imagination.

B005FVNIW6|5.0|This book is a sci-fi classic, and a must read for those who appreciate the genre.  I'll put this one at the same level of Asimov's, aside the difference in style. There's rumors about a movie coming out soon, then I got to read the book first.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|I am a huge fan of biographies. I am also an avid reader of military themed books. So when I saw this book I knew I would love it because it offerred me the best of both worlds. I was not disappointed. Fearless is a story about a man who overcame addiction and an aimless life to become one of the US military's elite special operators. More than that, this story is a testimony to the fact that no one is too far gone when God enters the scene. His grace is strong enough to save even the most depraved, and His plan can take a person that many thought was worthless and use them to impact thousands of lives.  The last few chapters of the book were absolutely gut wrenching. As I read them I thought of my friends, family, and the families I see everyday who deal with the horror of war. This book is a great reminder of the sacrifice and bravery of our nation's warriors. Even though the news would want us to believe otherwise, there is still a war on. You need to read this book. Pick up a copy here.<br /><br />The folks at Waterbrook Multnomah gave me a copy of this book for review. I am under no obligation to post a positive review.

1402210795|5.0|I love good books with amusing, well-written dialog, and this was a real treat. To begin, there are four chapters of witty dialog as Lord Sherringham proposes to the local Incomparable, with whom he grew up, in an attempt to get control of his trust money. The Beauty spurns him melodramatically, prompting him to declare that he will marry the first girl he sees- and does he just that. Coming across the young Hero Wantage sitting on a fence by the road, contemplating her plan to run away rather than become a governess as her aunt wishes her to do, he tells all to the young woman. She has loved \\"Sherry\\" ever since she was a very young girl (who followed him around, to his annoyance) and thinks being married to him will be a great lark.<br /><br />A marriage of convenience, he says, as he sports Miss Wantage off to London to solve his money woes. There is a hasty, but legal, wedding, and Hero quickly charms Sherry's buddies, young men as immature as he, and becomes like a sister to them all...including Sherry. New to society and London, young Hero quickly gets into one scrape after another.<br /><br />As with Ms. Heyer's books, terrific secondary characters abound and in Friday's Child we have a great cast to fill out the story. There's a pickpocket servant, distraught mothers, fashionable but not-too-bright young men, a love-sick swain, and a sort-of villian, among others. What is different about most of Heyer's books is that nearly everyone is young and immature. This makes the story very lighthearted; it reminded me of PG Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster and his friends as they would have been when much younger. So, do not expect mature characters or anything serious.<br /><br />I liked several things about Friday's Child. The dialog, as noted, is terrific and the young men had me laughing at their foolishness. I also liked how the plot did not bog down or drag, but moved along quickly. The misunderstandings and problems were not so contrived to make me groan, and even though you saw them coming, they were done with such humor I enjoyed watching the situations play out.<br /><br />Friday's Child is a light romp with delightful characters and a fun plot. While not one of Heyer's very best, it made me laugh, kept me up late at night to see what new scrape Hero got into, and me sad to see it end.ough you saw them coming, they were done with such humor I enjoyed watching the situations play out.<br /><br />Friday's Child is a light romp with delightful characters and a fun plot.

B007ZBWJXS|2.0|I am a huge fan of ASIA and I was expecting something more progressive, resembling ASIA, ALPHA or ASTRA. This one is definitely no better than PHOENIX or OMEGA. Huge disappointment
B008ASLNN2|3.0|RDJ and Jude Law acting all smart. Worth seeing. Better than the critics reviews but not as good as the first. Could be a good transition for a third. Richie should get a little more lock stock in there.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Great game.  Tons of choices and ways to challenge yourself.  Have not had any issues of game shutting down.  Great clear tiles.
B004HMQ7AE|5.0|I love this movie. Underrated outside of Reese Witherspoons performance. She was great but the movie aside is probably one of the best music bios of all time.
B007NR9WBG|4.0|I hadn't seen this in years, I had it on VHS years ago and might have seen it at the theater. Basically this movie lead to things like the Matrix etc, since it dealt with bypassing one's consciousness with another persons, or a artificial reality. It's more a science fiction drama for those who have never seen it. ONE thing that did puzzle me, the aspect ratio presentation... it's split between wide screen for the \\"brainstorming\\" technique sequences and it drops down to a standard ratio for effect for the everyday normal perspectives... while that wouldn't be so jarring if it was fullscreen it isn't, it features letter boxed picture/black region above and below, PLUS black regions on either side but this does keep the picture centered but to me since the picture is warping for the brainstorming sequences anyway, it would have been better to fill more of the screen with picture than black regions to lessen the transitions. At first i thought there was something wrong with the disc, then i googled and remembered it was a feature of the film to warp perspectives for effect, but I think they handled is wrong for this release or they should have offered adjustments via the menu to choose presentation. Perhaps they will release a better version later? seems a waste.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I never thought this editor would be really good but it is. I love it I can now make all of my pictures better even though they r pretty good
B008JGSM6G|4.0|really fun game on my kindle fire... I would regimens for people who want to be challenged. also for kids or teens
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Good stuff.  I recommend it for anyone who needs a remote control solution. Wish they had a desktop to desktop control tool.<br /><br />Update!  They now have desktop to Desktop control.  The tool is now completely awesome.  I highly recommend.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|I love this movie like I love no other. I can watch it on repeat at least three times in one sitting and still not get tired of it. I can easily recite so many parts of it from memory.<br /><br />The Limited Edition provides new content not seen in the original release. The most notable of these additions is more back-story for the Casse Family, such as Troy's illness, Miguel's distaste for his father, and new love for Alicia. I got to see more of this family that we only got teased with in the original release!!
B0002VFXFE|4.0|First time buying thermal paste so I can't compare it to anything else but it does its job, CPU runs at 30C
B005USZML4|5.0|This was a very good book really great for young readers as well it will keep you very interested, I love all most of all of his books there were some that I didn't care for buy otherwise he's a great writer
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is so amazing everyone should try it be pa or ma and better yet its free yay yay
B004LWZW42|4.0|Now to any well-informed X-Men fan, this movie did change a bit of canon. But if you've watched the other X-Men movies, then you've probably become used to these changes. Regardless, the movie was pretty good considering how I only recognized 2 actors in it.<br />There were a few things that could have been done differently but I'd recommend watching it, if not buying it when you can pick it up cheap.
1469984202|5.0|Every review that I read before I got this book said how great it was...and they were correct. This is a book that I will keep for many years. The story is excellent with only minor plot holes, and the characters are also very intersting.<br /><br />If there was any weakness to this omnibus edition, it would have to be the last book. This is where I felt that the story became the most confusing and the holes in the plot became a little larger.<br /><br />As for the review that said that they did not understand the title of this book (wool), all I have to say to you is that you obvously did not even read the book...it is very obvious as to why the book is called wool (its what they use to clean with (you'll understand if youve read the book)).
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I'm thrilled with this app. I bought it specifically so that I could sync my Kindle Fire with my desktop Google calendar and it works perfectly. It is also really helpful that I can access and add to the calendar in Calengoo while not connected to the Internet but then when I am connected it automatically syncs up with my desktop Google calendar. It's extremely easy to add new events, reminders, and calendars to the app. I have ten different calendars that track everything from social engagements to bills to work deadlines and I'm able to track all of them easily on Calengoo. I definitely recommend this app.
0307887448|4.0|This book is a typical adventure book that does not sway from the normal to much. If you are not from the 80's, or do not have an vast knowledge of everything pop 80's then half of the book will just fly over your head. I felt like if all of the 80's refrences were taken out then the book would only be about 50 pages long.<br /><br />There are so many possiblites with this story because they are in a world that does not really exist, so almost anything can happen. But I felt like this was not explored enough and left me wanting more.<br /><br />Besides those two big problems I had with the book I actually enjoyed it and would reccomend it to someone who does not have anything else to read. I would not reccomend to someone who has a long list of books that they are reading for fear that this book will be forgoten a few days after you read it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Finally a game that makes you think! Wish it had a hint button though. Also maybe a 3D cube level would be fun...
1475143389|5.0|I really enjoyed the information I gathered from this book. I am a thin male, and I am trying to bulk up. This book had ways to bulk up or if you prefer, cut weight. The work outs are pretty much the same whether or not you choose to bulk or cut weight, but the meal plans are very different, as they should be. If you are a fan of the \\"gimmicky\\" supplements they sell at superstores and waste all your money on them like I used to, then you will be happy to know this book shows you which supplements your body will actually use and will save you money, in the long run. I try to buy my protein in 10 lbs tubs because if you calculate it, it is MUCH cheaper per serving. We are talking $.70-$1.00 per serving if you don't buy in bulk, compared to $0.40-$0.50 if you do buy in bulk.<br /><br />I've went to supplement stores before. The people seem to know what they are talking about so I do some of my own research to make sure what they say is true. Recently, I just went a supplement store (that I won't mention), the salesman seemed very intelligent on the matter and supposedly even a certified nutritionist. I went online, and read some books, but I couldn't find that this person's information was consistent with what I read. So the best part of this book for me, was that this book was consistent with other resources such as my sister's college textbook about nutrition and fitness. Finally, a book that is consistent with other material!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow free is fun addictive game that challenges your mind by giving you different puzzles to solve by connecting colors and trying to fill in the board you can choose either free play or time trials. I personally like the time trials for a challenge. but the free play has levals that get harder as you advance. I would reccomend this to anyone who loves puzzles and a challenge c; good luck!!! have fun!!!
B007BZM30M|4.0|Good beats, enjoyed the song. Makes good listening while travelling, especially on long drive. Would like to hear more of this type.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this has to many adds after each game we play. I like yo play the game because it is fun and there are multiple games in one
6301777387|5.0|I was a small kid when I watched this with my dad. My dad was a Korean War vet & had been wounded. He spent time in an actual mash hospital. He loved the movie & the tv series, but said the hospital were he was treated was not like the movie as far as the funny stuff. But the care he saw Hawkeye & his friends give was first notch, just like the care he recieved. Years later I saw it again & realized what a great anti war movie it was. It teaches us alot about the bad side of humans & does it with humor. I think it's the best anti war movie ever made.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Got this as FAotD, well worth it's actual price...large number of puzzles, and they are not that easy...I love that these are actually challenging, not just something you click through, done, over. Soothing oriental music in the background, backgrounds like ricepaper drawings, very attractive. Works well on KindleFire, requires frequent pinching and zooming, especially for larger fingers...cannot imagine playing this on the comparably tiny screen of a phone...<br />Definitely addiction potential, have spent hours doing \\"just one more\\"...if you like having to work at solving a puzzle, give this a try :)
6303014100|5.0|Gettysburg is one of the most important battles ever fought by Americans. This movie recreation of it is fantastic. There is alot of accuracy in it. And the special effects are good as well. A relative of mine who is an active civil war re-enactor gives it the thumbs up. Can you put yourself in the front lines behind the stone wall (union) during Picket's charge or in the ranks of the confederates making that charge? I can. And the movie helps to do this. The best war movie about the civil war.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|at first when I wanted a free bible,I looked in the book<br />store,but all they had were gosples.but when I was looking for another game I found it. I think its the best!!!!!!:)

B006KX3GXO|5.0|it is a great way to edit photos and really have fun doing it too I like it and it's just fun.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My Kindle power cord was disintegrating to my dismay.  I called Amazon and spoke with Richard.  I explained my problem and he was extremely helpful.  He was VERY patient.  I got the cord I needed, and when I inquired about other issues with my Kindle, he was able to help me with those, too.  Their customer service is tops!  Thanks Richard!
B001U5V03U|4.0|There are now several choices available of this opera of which this review considers three contrasting productions. They are the 2008 Royal Opera/Mackerras, the 2001 Zurich Opera/Harnoncourt and the 2002 Aix-en Provence/Harding productions.<br /><br />The Royal Opera production under Mackerras listed here has received conflicting critical reviews resulting in both enthusiastic and damning comments to be found on Amazon. This also reflects the previous press reviews that accompanied the original performances. The DVD issue is generally more enthusiastically reviewed than the Blu-ray version but for no apparent reason to do with the different format.<br />This Keenlyside Giovanni figure is portrayed as particularly driven and is the most controversial figure in this production. Importantly, there is no real sign that he actually likes women - surely an essential requirement of a seducer. He is also shown throughout in somewhat sleezy attire - again, seemingly a rather unlikely attraction for the women when initial appearance is likely to be an important key to his success. Don Giovanni's charm therefore seems to be an unimportant consideration of this production. Given these concepts, both the singing and the acting are well done. However, bearing in mind this characterisation, it becomes difficult to believe that either Elvira or Zerlina would fall for such a man although it is obvious why Anna would hate him.<br /><br />Elvira comes over as rather strident in this production and this particular portrayal of Ottavio as a character is unlikely to be a serious physical threat to Giovanni even though the part is sung well enough. Both Zerlina and Masetto are excellent with Masetto being a satisfyingly stronger character than usual. Both Leporello and the Commendatore parts are well done.<br /><br />The setting of the opera is loosely in period but there are inconsistencies in staging that have to be ignored if this is to be enjoyed. The final hell-fire is rather tame though and the nude Giovanni apparently happy in hell and holding a naked woman in his arms at the very end seems doubtful as it undermines any idea of retribution. This concluding image of this opera's production is consistent with the portrayal of Giovanni more as a rapist than as a seducer and the ending seems a rather gratuitous use of nudity for non-musical ends.<br /><br />The orchestral contribution under Mackerras is totally outstanding with every detail making its mark and with good pace throughout. The sound in Blu-ray DTS seems vocally recessed and the volume needs to be turned up several decibels in order to achieve the required bite - then it is OK. This issue gives dramatic and musical satisfaction within marked constraints therefore.<br /><br />The Zurich production under Harnoncourt also features lively orchestral contributions and a good forward pace. The setting is traditional and does not contain any obviously worrisome inconsistencies as at the Royal Opera above.<br /><br />Don Giovanni as portrayed by Gilfry has the necessary charm as well as enough youthful vigour. (He portrays the part of Danilo in the Merry Widow, also at Zurich, with much charm too). He is thus very believable as a seducer of women. This therefore adds credence to the roles of both Anna and Zerlina. Sacca as Don Ottavio is in better shape both physically and vocally than Vargas in the Royal Opera production but it still remains rather a weak role - however this is mostly to do with the character as written.<br /><br />Both Zerlina and Masetto are well performed and convincingly portrayed. Leporello acts and sings well throughout and is a good and strong foil for Giovanni. The concluding scene with a strongly portrayed Commendatore and a markedly more dissolute, long and greasy-haired Giovanni builds well to its fiery end with a clear sense of final terror, but not remorse, clearly communicated by Gilfry. Donna Elvira, as portrayed by Bartoli, is more a matter of personal taste. There are some who find her `over the top' in her acted and sung levels of outrage and stridency. However, taken on its own terms, this is still acceptable and musically spot-on.<br /><br />The recording is good visually and sonically with clear surround sound (Dolby 5.1) while not quite being up with the latest in high definition technology. Overall, this is preferable to the Royal Opera production simply by not portraying Giovanni in such a deviant manner.<br /><br />That leaves the production at Aix-en Provence conducted by Harding. This is staged in the most minimalist terms - wooden poles and benches which are moved around to take on different meanings and totally devoid of time or place - intentionally universal therefore but with the message of the essential character types being applied to modern times by means of current clothing. The crucial destruction of Giovanni at the end with such limited means is extraordinarily effective.<br /><br />The performance is clearly on an outdoor stage at night with dark backgrounds. The stormy weather adds to the drama with hair and clothing blowing in the wind and including real thunder!<br />The singing and acting throughout is simply superlative by a young and highly skilled team. Peter Mattei as Giovanni exudes charm in abundance coupled with extraordinary physical vigour. Delunsch as Elvira manages to chase hard but avoids stridency - in fact the whole cast is inspired resulting in a truly memorable experience.<br /><br />The director defends his minimal staging on the grounds that it focusses everything on the drama of the interaction between the characters. It does - and it works. Harding, conducting the fine Mahler Chamber orchestra, keeps a cracking pace and sense of building electricity. The whole thing is well recorded both visually and sonically (Dolby 5.1). This is a terrific performance of considerable musical and dramatic electricity.<br /><br />I would suggest that the Aix-en-Provence production leads this particular group, followed by Harnoncourt at Zurich with the Royal Opera production being mainly considered here being in third place. This is, without doubt, the most extreme and therefore controversial interpretation of this opera and those aspects will need to be considered carefully if this version is to be considered the finest over the other two briefly considered above.<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />I am less fortunate, being 'plagued' very early on by Furtwangler's 1954 black-and-white DVD with Cesare Siepi as the Don and Ottomann as Leporello, Lisa della Casa as Elvira, Inga Bergman as Zerlina.<br />The cast is simply unsurpassable..  (U.S. review)<br /><br />I take your point entirely and generally I try to avoid commenting on such loved mainstays of the catalogue as reactions can be very complex and conflicting!<br />I would still recommend the Harding version. Many people have found that it really gets to the core - it would certainly give you a benchmark alternative to enjoy and different enough to avoid the issue of 'best'<br />Ian Gilesd sung levels of outrage and stridency.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 is a excellent read even though it's not typical King. The use of documented history and fiction is very refreshing and entertaining. I hope to see more like this in the future.
B003O2RQKS|4.0|The first thing to say about this recital is that it gave a great number of people in Vienna a lot of pleasure - and the disc will equally give similar pleasure to a great number of people world-wide, and I include myself. I found the technical side of the presentation to provide excellent visual and sonic reproduction.<br /><br />However, like all artistes, Lang Lang has many strengths to offer but equally he is not yet infallible. Consequently this recital is at its best when he plays to his strengths and is at its least effective when those same strengths do not naturally serve the chosen music so well.<br /><br />Lang Lang is essentially a very emotional player and plays everything as he feels - and he feels everything very deeply. One could summarise this by describing him as a romantic. His playing contains a great deal of expression from loud to soft and especially, enormous fluctuations of tempo almost moment by moment. The most successful parts of this recital are therefore those that respond best to such a romantically emotional approach.<br /><br />The two Beethoven sonatas, coming from a composer writing at the transitional stage progressing from the more formal classical period to the freer romantic period, are well able to sustain such an approach. Indeed there are many breathtakingly beautiful moments in these interpretations, especially in the slower sections. The Chopin encores respond equally well to such an approach.<br /><br />The Albeniz is more of a mixed bag. The slower sections are effective in these ways but the faster sections lack the rhythmic discipline required to capture the Spanish dance elements being portrayed - and Spanish dancing is nothing if not tightly rhythmical. Anyone who doubts this could refer to recordings by either Larrocha or Hamilyn who are both able to incorporate the freer romantic elements with the tighter dance elements.<br /><br />The same problems are to be found in the Prokofiev sonata where strict tempo is essential almost throughout. If this is not maintained the slow central movement loses shape and direction and the driven outer movements fail in their dramatic drive. Interestingly it is the most motoric last movement, a toccata, that is undoubtedly the most successful here and why? - Because Lang Lang plays it almost entirely in strict tempo. Unfortunately he does not do this in the preceding two movements. There are numerous examples on disc of the benefits of playing this music with more disciplined rhythmical control. Lang Lang himself quotes his admiration for Richter and Sokolov and to this I would add the benchmark Pollini CD and Lang Lang's contemporary Yuja Wang to his recommendations. Sokolov can be seen playing the Prokofiev on a fine recital DVD and there is an alternative excellent recital by Gavrylyuk on DVD containing Prokofiev's 6th and 7th sonatas as part of a technically astonishing recital.<br /><br />I am aware that this review will not please many of Lang Lang's countless fans who will resist the provisos above. However the job of a reviewer is to try and give an honest appraisal without bias and with a view to being helpful, giving supporting reasons for the opinions that are expressed. That is what is being offered here.<br /><br />In conclusion therefore, I will return to the opening comments that `The first thing to say about this recital is that it gave a great number of people in Vienna a lot of pleasure - and the disc will equally give similar pleasure to a great number of people world-wide, and I include myself.'<br /><br />I would suggest that if you are attracted by this concert and the manner of the performances within, then this disc should warrant your serious consideration.

B004SJ3AXI|2.0|i dont like the intrusive placement the ads and i can only play this game in airplane mode. the ads affect how the birds launch, freezing them or making them jumpy. it could be a fun game if development was better.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Let me start by using a totally over worked term, OMG!!!  Never a dull moment, when I'm not reading, I find myself wondering what Christian and Ana are doing.  I'm actually reading these books for the second time.  I completed the series and started re-reading the same day I completed it.  I just wanted \\"MORE\\".  You will understand what the caps mean when you read the books. These books will send you on an emotional roller coaster, it will make you want to curl up and hug yours and someone else.  Christian is so broken, and Ana heals him.  They are so good for each and the ending is fairy tale perfect.  I would say this is a must read, just don't give up on Christian you will love him in the end.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|The Amazon quality was excellent, but I did NOT like the movie!!  I enjoy the availability of quality new movies provided by Amazon, and thought thi would be a good movie!  Not so!!
0345803485|1.0|A big disappointement.  Repetitive and poorly written.  I'm no English snob but I couldn't even finish the book because I couldn't take it any more. Not only becuase it was redundant but the characters were annoying. The heroine was whiny and immature and the \\"hero\\", if you want to call him that, was abusive.  No woman should have to put up with that control freak.  Skip this one, folks.  There is alot better erotica out there.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Mostly shovels albums($10+ USD), and then a few tracks at a time for $0.99 USD.<br /><br />Missing ALMOST EVERYTHING of what I'd like, kinda sad for a digital brokerage, although I'm sure that the M*FF*AA played the MAJOR role in that.  Hey they gotta make money off their shit talent somehow...
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I can listen to this album over and over again.  Adele has such a wonderful voice and all of these songs are produced so beautifully.  This is just one of those albums that everyone should own.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|great action and graphics it was entertaining and good story. it kept my interest from beginning to end. It ia my favorate movie series.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I'll admit I might be a little biased about the book since I'm from Arkansas; grew up about 45 minutes from the town Adam grew up in. Setting that bias aside, I loved this book. I'm an avid reader and I read everything, except romance novels:) I'd read this book again and again and again. It's just that good!
B0034G4ORC|4.0|The while this movie isn't \\"Henry V\\", it is not a bad movie at all (perhaps the critics were thinking of \\"Battle of Los Angeles\\", the crappo direct-to-video effort rather than this particular production).  There are a few equipment issues, such as M4s changing to M16A4s and back again or UH-1D Huey helicopters standing in for UH-1Ys, but the thing that stood out was the sterility of the language (i.e, the lack of \\"colorful metaphors\\"): only one (1) F-Bomb was dropped during the entire movie. If these were real Marines, soldiers, sailors, or airmen, \\"colorful metaphors\\" would abound and the \\"f-bomb\\" would be used in ways that one would not think possible ;)  Other than that, it is a good action movie and if I had to give it a letter grade, I would give it a solid \\"B+\\".<br /><br />In my opinion, those who have a problem with this film probably have a problem with a film portraying any branch of the military in a positive light.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it!!!!  it is a fun mind game that I reccomend.  very addictive and fun.  5 stars for sure no doubt about it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little sharpener is all you need in the field.  I put a perfect edge on my USMC Ka-bar with just a few strokes and was cutting cardboard like butter.
0061730335|5.0|This inspiring TRUE story follows the life and ambitions<br />of a young person who changed his third world community<br />forever.<br />This book was given to each first-year and transfer<br />student at Purdue University as part of the Common Reading Program.<br />The campus-wide reading program aims to help new students connect<br />at the University.<br />With an atmosphere of scientific research and programs aimed<br />at developing professionals in all aspects of science, selecting<br />this book surely is a step in the right direction!

B008645YEE|5.0|My fellow Amazonian seekers of The Dark Knight Rises soundtrack:<br /><br />RISE!<br /><br />That, my friends, is the triumphant call I hear over and over in my head as I valiantly listen to this mind-blowing soundtrack.<br /><br />Now don't let this review fool you -- I am no \\"experted\\" aficionado of music, as many other reviewers appear to be. With my ill-knowledge of all things music theory, rather than write individual track reviews, I'll write this review based off the roller-coaster of emotions this soundtrack has PUNCHED into my soul. That's right -- PUNCHED. I hope this unconventional review won't offend you or embarrass Amazon. Fingers crossed.<br /><br />To start, I am a fanatic of the Batman series and franchise. If I told you how many times and how many hours I've spent listening to the first two films' soundtracks, you would probably call the police. Seriously.<br /><br />Almost every darn-ed day for the past many years, I have valiantly blasted Zimmer's darkly sweet and sweeping crescendos into my mind and soul. They've brought me through dark times of life and light times alike, and always end up bringing me back \\"home\\", so to speak.<br /><br />So on the cusp of this most recent and final addition to the Batman trilogy, I have eagerly anticipated the soundtrack release as giddily as a little child on Christmas Eve, frantically hopping back and forth in front of the fireplace, waiting for Santa to come plunging down that chimney with my soundtrack. Only for me, Santa's first name is \\"Hans\\", his last name is \\"Zimmer\\", with his middle name possibly being \\"THE BIG MAN\\" -- that's how much explosive hope and excitement I've held for this soundtrack.<br /><br />With the movie's trailers building up to this soundtrack's release, I've eagerly gobbled up and savored the bits and pieces of music from this coming soundtrack. And the one piece that's gripped me the most from the trailers is the track I've most anxiously awaited:<br /><br />\\"Rise\\"<br /><br />But alas, dark times befell me when the 30-second samples from the soundtrack were officially released onto the net a few weeks ago.<br /><br />\\"Was this it?\\" I worriedly pondered. \\"Was this what this grandly epic soundtrack was going to amount to?\\"<br /><br />I was scared, I'll tell ya, having just those 30-second samples. I knew we were going to need this soundtrack in the dark times ahead.<br /><br />When the one-minute samples were released, I was even more scared. \\"Oh no... Please Hans, please say this isn't so...\\"<br /><br />I'd say it in my mind, almost afraid to keep listening. \\"Please Han-sy, please just say this isn't so. This isn't how this soundtrack can turn out. Not this. Not now.\\"<br /><br />I almost cried. Almost.<br /><br />But while I couldn't see it at the time, I would be soon to realize that my fears were unfounded, and merely my own personal \\"dark night of the soul\\".<br /><br />When the full soundtrack was officially released for streaming online, I cautiously, solemnly pressed play and awaited. And I'll just put it simply by saying:<br /><br />MY. MIND. WAS. BLOWN.<br /><br />K, here's where the review may start to get a bit crazy:<br /><br />I have listened to this soundtrack 40+ times over the past week. I know you don't believe me. That's ok. Most people don't. But seriously. I listen to this soundtrack about 8-10 hours a day, every day, eternally looping:  In the car. At work. Walking around town. Swooping through the park like Batman.<br /><br />You may think that last one is just an allusion. But it's not. Stay tuned.<br /><br />This soundtrack is a beautiful conglomeration of the first two movies' soundtracks, swirling together the previous melodies, rhythms, and themes, but with plenty more bombastic-blastic action and grand, sweeping, up-and-down emotions battling out on an epic scale before us.<br /><br />The soundtrack builds up slowly, like a thief creeping into the night. It's dark. It starts real dark, alright. Ominous. As in \\"Oh my gosh, what is going to happen to Batman when this movie starts??\\"<br /><br />It begins to speed forward like a runaway freight train. While \\"The Dark Knight\\" soundtrack personified the movie's villain, the Joker, with harsh, chaotic, \\"electric\\" cords of gritty insanity and disarray -- like nails shredding chalkboard -- this soundtrack's villain, the almighty Bane, is just as well-paired with the movie's score.<br /><br />Bane, the movie's villainous monster of godly strength, is (assumed-ly) personified with monstrous, low-pitched,  and booming brass horns, and pounded together with the thunderous drums, all in staccato-like frequency. While listening, I imagine myself clad in the black bat-cape and cowl, deftly dodging and somersaulting in-between the thunderous, elephant-stomps of Bane's tree-trunk-like legs, pounding the earth's ground with echoing tremors. I tread lightly and dodge quickly in rhythm with the violins, all while keeping a watchful eye on and dodging between the crushing blows of the horns and drums.<br /><br />It's ominous, it's powerful, it's scary. It's like a symphonic earthquake of good and evil in my mind, leaving me worriedly wondering if I'm going to be crushed in my cubicle at any moment by the ominous and shattering slams of the trombones.<br /><br />But alas, we're accompanied with just as triumphant and heroic moments as the previous soundtracks. Gosh, I just get excited thinking about it.<br /><br />When the hero's violins come sweeping in, I literally have to start moving around quickly as they sound; sometimes I even start running (if I'm outside). And believe it or not, sometimes (often) I not only have to jump up and throw a couple fist-pumps of victory into the air, cheering on what Batman must be heroically punching through in the movie's moment, but I also just have to break out my air-violin and start rapidly sweeping my bow back and forth in time with our hero's symphony, even to the point of sweating.<br /><br />Crazy, yes.<br /><br />Goodness, the violins just sweep you up and away! Dare I even mention that between the fist-pumps and bow-swings, I've even swung my arms fully out to the sides as my imaginary \\"bat-cape\\" and gone soaring through the imaginary winds of \\"Gotham\\" under the wings of my cape, keeping a watchful eye in the public park for any trouble below. Or someone calling the cops on me.<br /><br />Last of all, but absolutely not least, we have the final track... \\"Rise\\". Simply put, and in my honest opinion, this track is so beautifully, mournfully beautiful, taking one through the whole gamut of emotions -- from triumph to sadness to mourning to victory - it's so legendarily-awesome that I feel it should be titled in all-caps and have a handful of exclamation marks tacked onto the end of it, like this:<br /><br />\\"RISE!!!!!!!!!!!\\"<br /><br />And even that wouldn't do it justice. Good golly, that's how much it moves and sweeps me through my own imaginary Gotham of emotion.<br /><br />It's composed of moments from all three films' soundtracks, ranging from the triumphant, bat-swinging melodies of fast-moving violins and drums, to the sad, soft, solo-grieving voice of when Bruce's parents died, and then descending slowly, mournfully, upon the grand finish line of our Dark Knight's trilogy, a closing anthem of darkness, but also hope -- one that surely will leave us wide-eyed with bat-like wonder.<br /><br />I kid you not -- I'm listening to \\"Rise\\" right now as I write this review, and even now after I've listened to it oh, so many times, I still get teary. I get teary almost every time. Not afraid to admit that. The slow, drawn out tones of what has previously been the hero's theme of valor and courage -- particularly, the ending theme of The Dark Knight -- but now in the slow-motion of sadness, as if one were slowly sinking toward the bottom of the sea, looking longingly upward to the dimming light, one hand reaching for that light as they slowly, sadly descend into darkness.<br /><br />That's the image that comes to mind when I listen to this, seeing myself as the one slowly sinking through that dark, beautiful ocean of sadness. (Again, I don't know any happenings in the movie, and I'm not alluding to any actual scenes. I'm purely sharing what plays out in my own mind as the emotions sweep me away.)<br /><br />But all is not lost, friends. All is not lost. The track slowly begins to pick up momentum, slowly, ever so carefully transitioning back into the hero's anthem that we've come to know and love. As the pace picks up, hope begins to restore. Faith begins to alight once more. I start ascending through that dark ocean of sadness, swimming upward toward the light, clawing through those dark waters as the light begins to brighten around me, until I finally explode up from that black sea and up into the sky, bat-cape extended, streaming upward to higher realms, finally reclaiming the all-seeing height above as Gotham's silent guardian... watchful protector...  DARK KNIGHT.<br /><br />(Don't worry, I haven't actually acted this last one out. ...Yet ;)  )<br /><br />In conclusion, buy this soundtrack. Please. Please buy this soundtrack and just never let it stop playing. Let it sweep and swoop and swoon you along its concluding journey, finally leaving one and all to...<br /><br />RISE!!!!!!!!!!!/><br />Goodness, the violins just sweep you up and away!

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I went to see the Beach Boys at Saratoga Springs a few weeks ago and they were nothing short of spectacular. They played 45 songs from their vast catalog, including two from this album. Brian has been touring the last 12 or so years with his current band which includes The Wondermints,  Jeff Foskett and others, and this is now the same band that has added back Mike Love, Alan Jardine, David Marks and Bruce Johnston (all from the original BB's). So, what you are hearing on their current world tour and on this album is a polished, lush, beautiful sound, rounded out with at least ten people harmonizing quite wonderfully.<br /><br />The album has some filler for sure, but the high quality of overall writing, producing and performing is great. There are at least 5 songs by BW that are as good as anything he's  written since the early 1970's.<br /><br />It is so wonderful to see Brian supported by the other bandmembers (Jeff Foskett and the Wondermints in particular). He is still the leader and the inspiration for the Beach Boys.<br /><br />Brian, keep making more music!<br /><br />Album is highly recommended!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This was probably the worst book I've ever read. Sadly, after a very average read of the first book, I got caught up in the hype and bought all 3 and so have felt obliged to finish them despite the painful journey I've had to make with Ana. I'm not sure how these books went to print, never mind how they've become such a popular read! I'm no expert, but I'm fairly sure the quality of writing is pants. Did anyone else get the niggling feeling that the author had a theasaurus with her all the way to help her make this painful book sound more intelligent? It irritated me that I had to go the effort to look up words every second page, which I then found sat very 'obtusely' in the simpleton text they were written. I don't think that she herself knew what half of them meant because if she were that intelligent she would have had the ability to write a half decent book instead of this megalorubbishness that she HAS produced. Never again do I want to visit the apex of Ana's thighs, because I've been there what seems like a thousand times. All the 'cupping' and 'nipping' and 'giggling' and 'blushing' and 'heady' this, 'smirky' that would drive a girl insane!!! If you really want to use a theasaurus lady, then stop REPEATING yourself OVER and OVER and OVER again...bla-de-bla-de-bla! And what is it with trying to make Christian's pet name 'Fifty'?? What rubbish. Clearly an attempt to 'subtly' link the book with the title, but please lady who are you trying to fool? This book makes me angry. I hate that I had to read all three. And all that terrible stuff that the author tried to create with Ana's ridiculous subconscious and inner goddess. Please, it was offensive to read. Also, I very much hated the way Ana kept saying 'Oh!' and 'Holy Shit!' and 'Shit!' and 'Gah!' What a toolbag. I sincerely urge anyone who wants to read this book to not read this book. It will ruin your life for the duration of the read. It could have been good, but it was really really bad. Anyone who says otherwise is lying to you and is probably trying to share their pain.
0143121006|1.0|This NOVEL is a DRAMATISATION of a murder that happened in the late 1930s when the Japanese had invaded China, and the Chinese left and right wing factions were fighting each other for control.<br />If you want history,or even historical atmosphere, do not bother with this book. If you want a murder mystery, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The NOVELIST (do not be deceived- this man is no historian)has used notes made by the father of the murdered girl, and has based his NOVEL around this. If anyone, it would be the father, that has \\"solved\\" the crime, not this NOVELIST. But neither of them have.<br /><br />This NOVEL is cliched and repetative.The expats are described as wasters, drunks, womanisers, \\"bright young things\\", \\"old China hands\\", \\"fast set\\", pompous, stiffupperlip....you name it, it is there... and on each page these people are taking tiffins or propping up bars. This NOVELIST pads out the book by such repetition you wonder if an editor ever went near it.<br /><br />Clearly the NOVELIST is writing for a screen play, not for history, as why else would he fabricate dialogue, private thoughts, pass off rumour as truth, try and construct a conspiracy theory, and describe scenes he did not see. These parts are not even well written: \\"who does a dentist's dentistry?\\". Tiresome.<br /><br />The NOVELIST might find his \\"research\\" exhausting, but absence of footnotes, biased sources, omissions, lack of fact-checking makes it all untrustworthy. Fitzmaurice returns to China as consul despite the threats to his family and also becomes prisoner of Japanese. The Kings Royal Surrey regiment has never existed!<br /><br />Crime must be solved beyond reasonable doubt. Supposition, and there is alot of it here, is not proof. It is also handled clumsily; pages and pages of \\"what could be more likely\\" -type exposition. The NOVELIST is selective in what he presents. Werner, and therefore the NOVELIST, becomes the hero. Of course.<br /><br />It is dishonest of this writer to:<br />1.pass off someone else's (Werner's) work as his own<br />2. claim status as a historian, analyst, reporter, when he fabricates, and fails to corroborate suppositions, is biased, and cannot get basic facts right in a \\"factual\\" account<br />3. hide behind the \\"novel\\" title and yet passes this dross off as \\"history\\". Or vice versa.<br /><br />If you want history, read \\"Wild Swans\\" , or the biography of Mao by the same author. Try \\"Empire of the Sun\\", for semi-autobiography of child caught up in the japanese prison camps. They are all gripping, well written, and the research is there.<br /><br />The NOVELIST is quoted as wanting this book to be like \\"In Cold Blood\\". (Penguin is quoted as saying to the author: \\"You are no Capote\\") This NOVEL is supposition. There is no resolution. There is no eloquence.<br /><br />This book is like squeezing a corpse for cash; just cant figure out if it is the father or the daughter who has been screwed the most.

0061692042|4.0|This story moves forward very slowly.  On the first page you learn about the crime, but it doesn't actually take place until halfway through the book. It is a moving story about how a young brother and his twin sister deal with the unfairness that life throws at them.  They take very different journeys.  One is a rebel; the other is malleable.  It is well worth the read.

B00867GHS8|5.0|Possibly the best animated Disney film in decades. As much as I know Toy Story and others were box office hits, this movie was truly made in the spirit of Walt Disney himself... creative, innocent, funny, environmentalist, story of devotion, and of course superb animation.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|I began reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein ill-informed of the story of this classic novel. My conception of it as a pioneer of science fiction was the chief attraction of the book to me. I didn't even think of it as a horror story before my reading. Perhaps this is partly due to the popular imagery of `Frankenstein' the monster as square-faced with deep sunken eyes, a figure which doesn't look particularly terrifying to me. On this account, I was rather taken back by surprise to find that in reality, the book is an immensely dark, depressing and tragic tale of broken dreams, misunderstanding, unfulfilled desire of love, revenge and murder. In the end, everyone in the story is a loser.<br /><br />The chain of tragic events started with Victor Frankenstein's daring and ambitious experiment to create life in the form of a human-like creature. Unfortunately, the good intention in the pursuit of science was not accompanied by careful anticipation of the consequences, and the young scientist was absolutely unprepared psychologically for the outcome of his endeavor. This led him to abandon his creation on the night of its awakening. The creature, with features hideous and detestable beyond description, possessed superhuman agility and endurance. It turned out to be extremely intelligent, gaining knowledge and learning the human language. It was capable of eloquent speech with the power to persuade others to sympathy. The creature was also overly emotional. Initially having a benevolent heart, all its actions were motivated by a desire of love, companionship and acceptance.  However, its rejection by humans due to misunderstanding and its physical appearance led it to plunge into what would be the darkest of human nature --- selfishness, malice, and wish to deprive others of happiness simply as a revenge for the lack of happiness of one's own.<br /><br />The tale of Frankenstein is truly a classic horror story. It tells of the horrendous effect of the lack of love. It portrays the evils of a depraved mind. The reader is left either chilling in despair, or pondering how a tiny bit of love and compassion towards the unlovable might have changed the course of the story.trays the evils of a depraved mind.

B007VCNFDO|4.0|For a bona fide classic, the album has its faults: the sprawl of it, \\"The Sprawl,\\" the \\"hilarious\\" Mike Watt cameo.  Perhaps its iconic status comes in part from indie's need, circa 1989, for a classic expansionist rock masterpiece.  I contend it was a little larded up, though no more so than Exile or (why not) After Bathing at Baxters.  Nevertheless, the best parts are as good as it gets anywhere: \\"Silver Rocket\\", \\"Eric's Trip,\\" \\"Kissability.\\"  And at $4.99, you have no excuse, kids.

B006Y9BULE|5.0|I ordered this watch looking for an economic tool watch. I was afraid of the size because I was used to wear standard size watches, up to 42 mm case. After receiving the watch I was happily struck by its look and quality, similar to much more expensive watches. Despite the size and thanks to the shape of the case and lugs, it sits very well in my standard size (7') wrist.<br /><br />I find the bracelet good enough and fitting the purpose. I would have liked a wider one, around 22 mm, but it isn't a big issue. In summary, this watch is a keeper, and I will proudly wear it quite often, in rotation with other Rolex and Omega watches I have.

0345803485|1.0|This is not a 'romance novel'. It's not even a good sex novel..it's just plain bad writing with an insipid main character in Anastasia and a total controlling weirdo in Christian Grey.  Virgin naive young girl meets 'hot' billionaire guy, he whisks her away to his apartment in his private helicopter and then proceeds in telling her he wants her to be his sex slave and shows her his \\"pain room\\" complete with hooks on the ceiling, whips, chains, collars, anal toys etc. He even shows her the contract he wants her to sign that features some pain, lots of toys, some 'interesting' sex acts (one in particular that I cant even type here for fear of being censored) among other things that no virgin is even going to know what the heck that is.  The wonderful character of Anastasia finds him so 'hot' all the while biting her lip that she actually decides she's in love with him and is considering signing his contract - after knowing him about 2 weeks. She's crying, she's miserable, she loves him, she leaves him for a weekend - he charters his own plane to follow her and shows up at the same restaurant, he knows when she's having her period, and promptly 'helps' her with that (eww)- he knows everything  - he's crazy! NOT a love story - its junk. While I'm aware this is merely fiction, it's still a horrible, unbelievable 'love story' or 'romance' as it's been classified.<br /><br />I borrowed this book from a friend who insisted it was 'captivating'. I skimmed it. I could barely read an entire page. Everyone is right - its repetitive, he gasps, she gasps, they murmur to each, they mutter, she bites her lip, the inner goddess part was just stupid, Jeez, He's hot, Holy crap were said about 100 times.. everything about this book is horrible. I can go on and on. If you feel you must read it...borrow it, don't buy it.<br /><br />What's more disturbing is that so many people are really taken in with this book and think its 'all that'. Totally disappointing experience with this book after so much hype. I am not even bothering to read the next ones in the sequel where I hear they get married even after on of his ex-bondage girlfriends shows up and tries to shoot everyone. How awesome. If THIS is the \\"face\\" of women's literature - it's not saying much about our expectations as a female audience seeking quality literature. There are SO many better books out there - even better erotic books out there than this one. (Any one of those Fabio covered cruddy romance novels that my aunt used to hide under her bed in the 80's are more sexy than this book. LOL!)  Save your money!
B004EPYZUS|1.0|The DVD case was crushed when it arrived, very disappointed.<br /><br />The CD itself appears good, but to be honest, part of the fun of buying a new DVD movie is being able to look at the cool packaging.<br /><br />Would not buy from this seller again.
0345803485|1.0|There is nothing much I can add to other reviews that describe this book as dull, unimaginative, repetitive, with shoddy writing and poorly developed characters. I don't mind erotica a bit, but this book doesn't even come close. I expected an engrossing story along with the \\"soft-porn\\", what I got was a simpering school girl's fantasy interlude with a less than dominant billionaire boy-toy. Nothing surprising here, just lack-luster sex scenes one after the other. What I can't figure out is how this garners even one 5-star review. Evidently some readers have never ventured into this genre before or don't require a plot in the novels they read. I predict this type of novel will become the new \\"chick lit\\" fiction. Woe is me.
1936891026|5.0|The War of Art is written from the viewpoint of a writer, but applies equally to anyone fighting \\"Resistance\\" with a capital \\"R.\\" It (Resistance) comes from deep within and supplies us with plausible justifications for why we shouldn't do our work. \\"It is the dragon that guards the gold.\\" He addresses the act of committing to something and acting in the face of our fear. Some of the pearls that he drops: The chick pecking at the inside of the shell... the giving birth to our genius. Not selling out, but doing what we're meant to be doing. If you were meant to cure cancer, write a symphony or crack cold fusion and you don't do it, you not only hurt yourself. You destroy yourself. You shame the angels that watch over you. Invoking the Muse or unseen intelligence is part of the process. And doing the work for its own sake, not for fortune or attention or applause is key. Great book, great author. Highly recommended.

0345803485|3.0|A chance meeting for the young innocent Ana Steele with the attractive successful entrepreneur Christian Grey leads to a strong attraction, but when Grey warns Ana that he is not the right man for her and to keep her distance from him, Ana just can not resist.<br /><br />As Ana gets more and more involved with Grey and they begin a passionate affair, she learns of Grey's deeply hidden secrets and his need to control. Just how far into Grey's darker side of life is Ana prepared to go into to keep her man?<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is the trilogy that everybody is talking about. It would seem this book is like Marmite, either people love it or they hate it. Even the people who have not read the books have an opinion about it. So I decided to read the book for myself to see if I could find what is so special about this particular book and what could be behind all the hype that as propelled this book into popularity and is making people go out and buy it.<br /><br />Yes it is full of sex scenes and my first thought is this why the book sells? But when you actually read the book there is nothing too shocking about these scenes. It reminds me in the eighties there was a lot of hype about the film Nine and a Half Weeks, all sorts of stories went around about the content of the film and then when you watched it, it was not that exciting really. Well it is the same with this book. There is not a great deal of storyline, the main theme seems to be if two people can compromise, if Grey can conquer is demons and how far Ana is prepared to cross the line, not very exciting really. I could take or leave this book. I did not love it or hate it. Would I rush out and buy book two in the trilogy? The answer is no, but I will probably get around to reading it sometime in the future.<br /><br />The positive side to Fifty Shades of Grey is that it is getting people reading. I think it is through people's curiosity that the books are selling and if that brings forward more readersthen that is what the best thing about it is.
0307279189|5.0|I am currently training for my first marathon and my sister got me this book.  Super inspiring and an interesting read that is part history, part journey, and always interesting.
B007X15GRQ|4.0|We enjoyed this movie.  Mark Wahlberg is a good actor and did well in this one.  There was plenty of action to keep you interested even though the storyline was a little bit lame.  Overall a good movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've never heard of Hugh Howey before.  A friend recommended the book to me and I figured, for $6 I'll give it a shot.  Very glad I did, what a tremendous book!  There are many other reviews that say what I want to say better so I'll just finish by saying, get the book, you won't regret it.  Very good story and characters.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I also bought the kindle book after having read so many good reviews about it. I cannot believe that this book was so popular, I stopped reading it about a week ago, just after the pathethic gift from Christian to Ana after her graduation, a \\"brand new car\\". I am very disappointed, that I wasted time reading some of this book,and I am not a prude, however it is not a clever well written book, its just about an immature girl Ana, and \\"Fifty shades of Grey\\" ( I assume all the colours in Christian Grey's eyes)a pathetic guy in all senses. I have given up on this author and will in future read book reviews of any new proposed purchases. I do think it was very badly written, and just did not flow, and I didnt give a .... about the life of Anastasia. I think thats enough.
0345803485|3.0|This is an easy casting call as far as I am concerned. Ryan Gosling should be a lock for Christian Grey (if you saw him in Crazy Stupid Love - which I thought was really cute movie and he was HOT) he can totally pull off the macho, rich, good looking, Christian Grey, complete with soulful looks. I am not too sure about his whip skills, but I am certain he would look outstanding in a pair of black leather pants (or soft, soft blue jeans)  holding the whip, with those AMAZING abs on display.  A lot of women would say give me that contract! Haven't read it! Don't really care, signing now!! Maybe the part would be too weird for him...but I think he could totally pull it off Christian Grey. Maybe all that whipping and painful stuff can take place off screen and the audience can just hear it. A lot of us really don't want to see all that hard core stuff, just Ryan looking buff, deliciously sexy,  and fabulously wealthy.  Please say yes, Ryan.<br /><br />And could there be a better actress for this part of Ana than Courtney, the idiotic model who won Bachelor Ben Flahnik's heart in an amazing display of soulful eyes and a lot of lip chewing that made women everywhere want to slap her face as she gnawed away at her lip in front of  in every Batchelor TV episode last year?  She even has the right hair color. She probably wouldn't be much of an actress, but she can just play herself.  Courtney clearly was willing to put up with ANYTHING to get close to a millionaire vintner! She is just perfect for this role. The fact that she was completely obnoxious to the other women contestants in the show makes it even more perfect, because she can play her own \\"inner goddess\\" as an evil twin. Everyone I know who has read this book wanted to do something violent to that incredibly annoying inner goddess.  She's more persistent than the Ghost of Christmas Past!  So, In the movie, could Christian whip that inner goddess about five or six times for readers everywhere? He's doing a lot of whipping anyway, it doesn't seem like too much to ask.<br /><br />I am getting ahead of myself on the sequels, but Christian's Mrs. Robinson? Salma Hayek, I hope you are not too busy to play Elena. She can surely wield a mean whip. Unfortunately she would completely overwhelm everyone else in all scenes, but everyone would see why Christian was so fascinated with an older woman.<br /><br />Beau Bridges could be Ana's dad, and Diane Keaton, would be great as Christian's mother. The young Hispanic actor from Rock of Ages (sorry, no idea of his name) looks just as I imagined Jose, Ana's photographer friend. As Christian's ex girlfriend (the looney one) can we say Lindsay Lohan? Lindsay, it's just a small scene, but you would rock it. John Travolta, I am casting you as scary publisher, Jack Hyde.<br /><br />There are several actresses I can see as Ana's roommate, including Alyson Hannigan from How I Met Your Mother, or maybe Chelsea Handler (she's a little old for that part but she's so funny). But that makes me think of how much fun it would be to have Neil Patrick Harris in this movie. He can play Christian's brother and,  I think in the movie version,  he should get a bigger part.  I realize that Ana and Christian are very serious most of the time, just having the occasional lighthearted moment as they text and email each other flirty, sexual texts nonstop instead of working. So if you are a serious, serious fan, there should be a message up on the screen at the end that says, leave the theater NOW, because the next part will make you mad.  If you are one of the rest of us, I feel strongly that Neil Patrick Harris would be hysterical if he could come in at the end to hog a long movie outtake, making fun of the text messages and emails, the Red Room of Pain and little comments about Ana's inner goddess, her lip chewing, and Christian's sexual contract, plus many other dramatic moments.  There is a lot of material to mine here. ...this outtake could run at least 15 minutes because there is a lot of opportunity to lighten up this BSDM angstfest with some comedic relief. For a lot of people, it would be the highlight of the movie.<br /><br />I just wish I could think of a part for Charlie Sheen.

0345535421|4.0|I found this book, the second in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series to be very good. It moved the plot along and maintained interest even though it is quite a ponderous volume. I did find it a little disconcerting that the major players seemed to take a backseat to the supporting cast. With one major exception, even the battles--the clashes of kings--are reported on after they happen. Still, Martin creates a world and spins a web of characters that is remarkable. It is only when compared to the first volume in the series that I give it four stars.
0345803485|1.0|Oh my....what possessed me to read this garbage?? I'll tell you what it was: the fact that everyone is talking about it and it is in the #1 slot at every major bookstore. Okay, so I had a morbid curiosity to see what it is all about. I don't have much time to read, but I thought I'd give this book a shot because it was so highly recommended and I needed some summer reading.<br /><br />I wish someone would have shot me first.<br /><br />I hadn't read any of the reviews of FSOG prior to reading, but now that I have, I find so many others shared in my opinions. This is, by far, the WORST piece of writing I've ever come across. It reads like really bad fan fiction (and what do you know? Come to find out it was originally a fan fiction) and I feel like I am reading a 16 year old's diary. My head actually hurt trying to make sense of this mess. Every time I read about someone blushing, flushing, biting their lip, or saying 'oh my', I roll my eyes. And what the heck does 'breath hitches' even mean?? When I was half way through chapter 4 one night, I got so frustrated that I literally tossed the book on the floor and went to sleep. E.L. James lacks the basic writing skills needed for such a hot genre book. The author tries to overcompensate for her lack of skills by throwing in a large word here, a sophisticated phrase there, but all are completely out of place. You just can't do that. Besides, college students just don't talk that way! The editor should be fired.<br /><br />When I bought this book I was expecting, and hoping for, a mature erotic romance. This is a childish infatuation story about a young girl, Ana, who lacks maturity who is more annoying than anything. She is naive and childish, and a poor excuse for a woman in today's society. Her character is disgraceful and insulting to educated and successful women today. The male lead, Christian, is a fantasy character that someone thought up in high school who does not exist. This book is so unrealistic on so many levels, and as a career woman in my late 20s with a satisfying boyfriend, it is downright insulting and embarrassing. The sex scenes lack any sense of realism and are less than steamy or satisfying.<br /><br />I'm sorry if this insults anyone, but it seems the only people who enjoy this writing are sex-starved middle-aged women looking for their handsome Christian Grey (who does not exist) and who are not deterred by poor writing. I'm so sorry I wasted my time on this. Please don't waste yours.

B000002SE0|5.0|In my opinion this, the earlier RCA Nilsson/Bjoerling/Leinsdorf, and the most well known Sutherland/Pavarotti/Mehta recordings of Turandot are must-own material for fans of this opera and virtually equal in their different ways.<br /><br />Birgit Nilsson IS Turandot. Singing all over the world opposite Corelli in the title role she captures the ice princess better, I feel, here than her more reserved performance on the RCA recording. Franco Corelli IS Calaf as well. He doesn't have the lyric phrasing of Pavarotti or the calmer beauty of Bjoerling, but neither man comes close vocally in size, passion, or heroic abandon that this role calls for. Scotto, through no fault of her own, keeps this from being the greatest Puccini opera on record. I think Tebaldi was able to better capture the sweetness and innocence of Liu and Monserrat Caballe is the number one reason to own the Sutherland/Pavarotti set. Francesco Molinari-Pradelli and the orchestra are about equal to that of Erich Leinsdorf, but I felt the sound was sharper and clearer on this recording.  Mehta's score is larger and somewhat muddy in comparison.<br /><br />What sets this version above the others is the Timur of Bonaldo Giaiotti and the Ping, Pang, and Pong trio of Guido Mazzini, Franco Ricciardi, and Piero de Palma. People can argue about the principals and the conductors all day but Turandot will fall flat if you have three legendary principals and a legendary conductor and terrible singers in these four roles. That is not the case here . Here I think these men are the absolute best on record in these particular supporting roles. Add to that the two best leads for this opera and a fine conductor and you are left with quite possibly one of the best Puccini recordings ever made.
B004C6QCXW|5.0|For me A Love Supreme has become a bit of an obsession...like Beethoven's 9th Symphony. So this review is merely for this particular incarnation of what I consider to be the greatest jazz album ever.<br />Now, if you are not going to take the advice of my friend and throw away all your CD's and invest in some ungodly expensive tube amplifier and turn table so you can listen to the vinyl versions of these classics - which he says is the ONLY way to listen to recorded jazz.<br />THEN...I would highly recommend this release by Analogue Production on Hybrid CD.<br /><br />Just a comparison to the versions I own on disc (excluding vinyl):<br /><br />Original US Pressing (1986) - Very good and fairly easy to find [MCAD-5660 JVC-464]. A good balance, even if slightly dull (when compared to the present edition).<br />German Release (1987) - Excellent [254 557-2]. A tad better than the US pressing.<br />The 1998 remaster available in the GRP box set: The Classic Quartet: The Complete Impulse! Recordings. Good, but not great.<br />The 2002 \\"Deluxe Edition\\" 2 CD set remastered by Rudy Van Gelder.[[ASIN:B00006K06N A Love Supreme]] There is a bit of controversy here. Many people do not like the RVG remastered works. Others LOVE the. I do not necessarily have a dog in this fight, however I can say I did not care for this particular remaster. Was there a band with Coltrane? After listening to this I couldn't really tell if there were drums and piano there. The only reason to get this (IMHO) is for the second disc, which has the only live recording of A Love Supreme, but the remastering is poor.<br />I have never liked any of the Japanese remasters - either the SHM or the 24Bit remaster[[ASIN:B00005L8Y7 Love Supreme]]. The Japanese seem obsessed with trying to make a CD as loud as possible without distortion. Soundwise I think they fail most of the time...with rare exceptions.<br />In 2008, Kevin Reeves remastered the release of the \\"Originals\\" [[ASIN:B0018RWD6I Love Supreme (Dig)]]. This is very nice, although as of 2010 there is the present remaster by Analogue Productions that is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!<br /><br />The balance and tone and volume is so natural and in a word...perfection. Even if you own many different versions of this disc (as I do), you should not pass up this release.]. This is very nice, although as of 2010 there is the present remaster by Analogue Productions that is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!<br /><br />The balance and tone and volume is so natural and in a word...perfection.

B00498PKJK|4.0|I love all 30STM - unplugged, live, studio, covers, originals .... Most of this album is great, however SOME of THIS particular CD brings to mind a band my sister was once into, Bono with U2.  When I saw the vid for CTTE, I was taken aback to see that someone thinks the Echelon consists of little kids.  I like this one less than any others I have ...then again, it may have been the CTTE video that did this to me. gahhh .... I'll still listen to 30STM and hope that the effect of the CTTE vid gets out of my mind.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|This was a very disturbing series in that an impressionable young woman is infatuated with a great looking guy who has a perverted sense of sexual activities. I would not recommend it unless one just likes to read about strange behaviors in an otherwise traditional love story gone amok. I would hope that young women of today do not indulge in this twisted version of love.

0099579936|3.0|I wasn't planning to buy this book but as everyone knows this everyone has been talking about this book so i decided to buy it and see what the hype is all about.<br /><br />Christian Grey - This character is too good to be true, he is 27 years old, billionair, very good looking and is good at EVERYTHING. Ok how the hell can you be good at everything, everyone has good points and bad points, but this guy seems to have all the good points. Now to me it seem like this guy has got crap personality, where ever ana goes he will turn up, he will be sending her emails and text like 24/7 (serioulsy doesn't this guy work) he will tell her what to do what to eat how to dress and if ana tells him no he gives her this angry look, really he expects ana do whatever he tells her to do. Ok if i met a guy who is so good looking and has that kinda personality that would put me off i would not wana know that guy.  Also how many times does this guy needs to have sex in one day ...doesn't he ever get tired or maybe thinks he should take day off and maybe relax lol. So overall i found this guy psychopath, stalker, control freak and he expects everything should go his way. Also him going after 21 year old who is a student ... yeh that does not happen in reality, if he can get models come after him why would he go after 21 year old girl.<br /><br />Ana Steel - i found her character ANNOYING. At the start i did like her, infact i found her funny she came across funny clumsy girl who really doesn't give a shit lol but when she met christian her character got annoying. I don't know how many times i read oh he is so good looking he is that he is this ...(ok chirstian might be very good looking but you don't need to keep saying it) What i found funny was when she goes to his place for the first time she sleeps with him and she has only known him for like 3 days ...and here's me thinking she comes across \\"good girl\\" ...and why does she sleep with him straight away ...because he is good looking lol ...Also whatever christian does ana gets turned on ..omg i lost count how many times this girl got turned on lol ...he looks at her ana get's turned on, he touches her hand again she gets turned on bascailly she just gets turned on all the time lool .. and also how the hell can you fall in love in just 3 weeks ...she hasnt really gotten know him all she knows about christian is that he likes sex. So overall ana's character is annoying and weak and desperate. Whenever she is with christian she does whatever he tells her to do. If only her character was shown strong and doesnt take all that shit maybe i would have liked her.<br /><br />Book - Am not gona say it's a bad book but then again not a great book it's ok, she could have made the stroyline more interesting. Mainly all you read is them two doing it all the fricken time.

B005LAIGF0|4.0|Its not that I like Anna as my favorite actress. I like Samantha. I think she acts different than other actors. Its real but than its stilted. She is touchy and peculiar in this film. She has a style of acting that is her own. The thing I related to was Lisa wanted the bus driver to feel some of her pain and guilt that she had experienced from the accident. She saw him as shut off and unemotional after the death of the walker. I think her life had changed dramatically after what she had witnessed. It triggered lots of anger in her dealings with others, especially, with mother and possible father figures. I felt something inside after her truth with how it was being settled. The things I liked in the film, I liked the channeling, the intelligence, the connections that she followed without much artifice, she dealt with people being blunt or negative without folding, it wasn't a colorful film but it was rich in a different way. I decided to write more on this film. Maybe the film wanted the viewer to see how a person can shut off from their world and set of experiences. Like the bus driver, he ultimately chose to push or not really connect with the trauma of the accident. We only see one point of connection of this driver, who knows what he does in the night with what happened to him that dark day. Maybe he crys to himself or he has nightmares, maybe he is coping with it the best he can, maybe he shuts off to the girl because he is afraid, afraid to show his vulnerability, maybe it hurts to much. Thats the thing with movies, we just see that frame not the whole life and the moments that make the total instead of just parts. Its sad because we tend to judge and don't really know the truth of a person. Well, thats what I think. Maybe he was just so afraid and pretended because he didn't know what would happen if he opened his heart.

And don't bite your lower lip as you read this because you know what that does, but in all likelihood, I will read this entire trilogy as well. I just have to know what happens. It's not even so bad it's good, it's just bad, but I still can't stop myself from reading. I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe I need to see Dr. Flynn too.

Blood, sex, fighting, sex, blood, sex, arenas, sex, more blood, more sex, realistic fighting, realistic sex ... and an enticing and exciting storyline to go with it. What more can one ask for? This blows character-driven movies - you know, the ones with stupid people doing stupid things so the storyline writers have something to write about -  out of the water. This is EXCITING and it moves as if it has a life of its own.

The fact that woman find this so erotic and are starting to believe that his behavior somehow a2cceptable\\" as long as it's under the pretense of him just being dominant is scary. I wouldn't be surprised if abusive men \\"cash in\\" on the success of this book, and our society sees a higher rate of abuse because of it.<br /><br />Everything in this book is wrong. Everything.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The books were well writen and kept me wanting to read more..into the wee hours of the night. I think the second book was the best but the third book kept me more spell bound closer to the end. The  personality change of Christian Grey was wonderful.
1595827684|5.0|What can you say about the stellar breathtaking artwork of such an amazing saga, and to see the amazing concepts that shaped what we saw in game truly feels like a privilege.  I keep it on my bookshelf for all to see, that's how great it is, and so far everyone loves it.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|They refuse to add a block button do children are exposed to cussing sex talk and very bad harassment.  Not to mention reporting does no good they just delete the bully's posts and he's back again stalking our children. Yes the age for the game is 14 and up. Gem traps lots of glitches costing real money. Want nice items in game be prepared to spend hundreds in real money. The worste support system I ever encountered. I'm shocked amazon endorses these crooks who have a bad rating with the BBB  and yelp. Patents be warned this game is a pedophiles dream. Avoid it
B0052WKZZ6|5.0|I recover the beauty of their performances, I have the original vinyl presentation, but this CDs remastered and includes bonus track of one of my favorites musicians, The Great Mike Oldfield. Thank Amazon for it.
B007N85ZXY|4.0|I would not call myself a Neil Young fan exactly, and I don't know from Crazy Horse.  I like some of Neil's old old stuff from the Crosby Stills days.  My impression of him recently is that he puts out an album every 3 months or so slapped together from basically what is on his mind.  (I could be off track - like I say, not a fan.)  But I do enjoy the spirited debate surrounding this particular CD and after having listened through a couple of times, I would have to say I kind of like it.<br /><br />He is hardly the first to come out with a CD of old folk tunes - Greg Brown for one, has done it at least once - but this hard-rocking, no-holds-barred approach is new to me.<br /><br />So I listened to Oh Susannah a couple of times and it is now irrevocably stuck in my head, just the way it sounds on this album.  It is sooo infectious.<br /><br />The problem I have with the next few songs is that they sound a lot like Oh Susannah but not as much fun.<br /><br />Get a Job is definitely a departure and a return to fun.  And if you can resist singing along to This Land Is Your Land, you definitely have more self-control than me.<br /><br />So, for me, about 3 really good to great songs, a couple of clunkers (Wayfarin' Stranger is way too subdued, I can barely hear Neil singing), and the rest are just OK.<br /><br />Let me just say here that I am a sucker for a good set of liner notes, and these are great.  Some of the songs have verses that we don't often get to hear, because they are too dark for a song song by children, or for whatever reason just don't get sung any more.  Also the notes give insight on the arrangements, whether new or harking back to someone who did the song in 1964.  So this album really is a valuable piece of Americana.<br /><br />I can't listen to this one every day, it gets a little loud and boisterous for driving in traffic and trying to come down from a tough day at work.  However, everyone should give it a listen at least once, and take a look-seeat the liner notes.  Pretty cool.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|been playing this game for months. the updates are wonderful. you basically have a village and you buy animals and you breed them and complete each family. you can buy decorations. you get a daily bonus of coins. there is a little game that you can play with scratcoins. you get a coin everyday. the game gives great rewards. sometimes acorns that you use to buy stuff sometimes a rare animal and sometimes coins. I have won millions...yes millions of dollars playing scratgame everyday. items are not hard to obtain. the challenges are fun and nothing costs actual money unless you choose to spend it. I have never spent a dollar and the longest I have waited to finish something is 24 to 48 hours. that is for breeding and the latter is rare. no glitches either on my kindle. you can use facebook etc and log in to visit friends but not neccessary if you don't want to. download! awesome and very enjoyable!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|This a personal opinion, I have read only 19 chapters and could not continue, I think it may be a fascinating read but definitely badly written.  It is now a 'must read' for most women only because it is overly talked about and people do not want to miss out.

B007UXTG8M|3.0|SHAME was a very strange film, but yet interesting.  director/writer steve mcqueen explored sex addiction on two fronts - cerebral and visual; both done very well.  in the story telling there were a couple of loose ends,  but overall, it lived up to some of the hype. while, michael fassbender was brave in his display of his body, not so sure his performance should have earned him an oscar nod. it is worth renting; not sure i would buy for my movie collection.  can't wait to see more from director steve mcqueen.
006088732X|2.0|Why read: I wanted to check out the book before watching the TV series.<br /><br />What impressed me: Sadly, not much. It just did not work for me.<br /><br />What disappointed me: I love YA, but Pretty Little Liars was way to young for me. The secrets these girls have are, well, lame. I expected a much larger does of scandal to carry an entire series, but their shameful, hidden pasts aren't so awful that I can see continuing the secrecy when being tormented about it. Maybe I would have felt differently as a teen, but I doubt it. I've never been much for secrets and shame and had q really hard time grasping why these girls would let someone hold these things over their heads instead of just owning them.<br /><br />Recommended: No, at least not for adult YA fans.<br /><br />Continue series: No.
B003SNKBXW|2.0|Amazon should be ashamed to sell this on Kindle.<br />There are so many OCR mistakes that it becomes hard to read at times.<br />For instance, every single instance of \\"rain\\" in the book is spelled \\"ram\\".<br />Lots of missing punctuation that often causes you to double take as well.<br />There really should be some sort of quality control as they rush to convert<br />all their books to Kindle.<br /><br />By the way, the story is good. I hate to give it a bad rating, but I feel something must be said.
0141439831|5.0|Note: This review is from a Thackery collection for kindle.<br /><br />I'm not going to sum up the plot. Many others here have done so quite effectively. But I do want to address the book's length, it's detailed in in the eyes of some, and its overblown narration. Yes, this book, like many from the nineteenth century, is much wordier than what we're accustomed to today. But consider what you're getting from Thackery. The following sentence, from late in the book, describes Jos, the obese self-absorbed bachelor brother of our more respectable heroine (Amelia) going to the place where Becky, the bad-girl protagonist, told him she was staying. Jos and she had one disastrous \\"date\\" early in the novel and now, Jos is back after having spent many years in India and he runs into down-on-her-luck Becky at a gambling party the night before. Naturally (because when it comes to women, he's got nothing better going on in his life), he's intrigued by this old but way-to-brief flame. Here's the description of Jos going up to Becky's room (this is all one sentence):<br /><br />\\"In consequence of the fetes the house was full of company, the tables in the street were already surrounded by persons smoking and drinking the national small-beer, the public rooms were in a cloud of smoke, and Mr. Jos having, in his pompous way, and with his clumsy German, made inquiries for the person of whom he was in search, was directed to the very top of the house, above the first-floor rooms where some travelling pedlars had lived, and were exhibiting their jewellery and brocades; above the second-floor apartments occupied by the etat major of the gambling firm; above the third-floor rooms, tenanted by the band of renowned Bohemian vaulters and tumblers; and so on to the little cabins of the roof, where, among students, bagmen, small tradesmen, and country-folks come in for the festival, Becky had found a little nest--as dirty a little refuge as ever beauty lay hid in.\\"<br /><br />OK. Yes, it's long. But is it something that should be skimmed or skipped. Consider what Thackery is doing for you. He isn't just telling you that Jos climbed up to the top floor and found Becky occupying a dirty room, which is pretty much the way many contemporary writers would have given it to you. With Thackery, you're trudging up right alongside Jos, feeling his reaction to the chaos around him. Speaking for myself, I felt a bit out of breath by the time I - oops, Jos - reached the top floor and felt a bit squeamish by the whole environment. A modern writer might have told you that Jos was panting and felt squeamish. Thackery doesn't waste words telling you that. (Amazing! Thackery is actually thoughtful about his word choices) He doesn't have to. You FEEL it yourself. This is what a writer like Thackery does for his readers.<br /><br />There are so, so, so many sentences, paragraphs, etc. like this. This is not idle description tossed in as a matter of formality. This is an IMAX-type experience generated by words, instead of technology.<br /><br />This is a very long novel. Count reading time in weeks or longer, as did its original audience, who read it in serialized form. But that's OK. You don't want to rush something like Vanity Fair. Play along. Jump into it. Allow yourself to enjoy the full experience of what a literary master like Thackery can do.

We don't have HBO on our TV so I just rented the series.  What an entertaining last couple of days I've had, watching the first season straight through.<br /><br />Cinematography, special/visual effects, writing, editing, costuming, historical validity, musical score, setting, mapping, sound - all are fabulous.<br /><br />And the casting - wow! Each and every person was perfect for their role.  Like everyone else, I think, I loved Peter Dinklage in his role as Tyrion Lannister.  There are definitely many reasons he won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for this role, plus was nominated for and won many more. Sean Bean as Eddard Stark - perfect.  Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen - gorgeous AND perfect for the role. Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon - slimy and perfect in the role. I don't think I've ever seen a production of this size that was cast as well (thumbs up to Nina Gold, casting director).<br /><br />This is definitely an adults-only production.  Lots of nudity, sexual situations, incest, foul language, violence - it has it all. But it doesn't feel gratuitous.  It feels like I was plunked down to wander these kingdoms and was seeing life as it really was back then.<br /><br />I don't know how well this show follows the books.  I have heard and read from others that the producers/director, with the author's help, did a superior job.  I am anxious for season two and I am also very excited to read the books myself.<br /><br />Do whatever you need to watch \\"Game of Thrones\\" if you haven't yet.  I can't believe you will be disappointed.r /><br />Do whatever you need to watch \\"Game of Thrones\\" if you haven't yet.  I can't believe you will be disappointed.

Well, maybe a little adjustments here and there, but basically talent is when you don't need to work for something.

0425263908|3.0|This book is not an exact replica of 50 Shades but its eerily close to it.  If you're looking for something after 50 Shades, to keep the idea of a rich \\"megalomaniac\\" who obsesses over a girl going, this is your book.  It was a good read, and left a lot to be explained in the second book, which comes out this Fall '12.  Either way, its a good book, entertaining, with a few mysteries, because it is so similar to 50 Shades of Grey but in a more NY feel, you almost know what is going to happen.  Its a \\"classic\\" story, so for me, I didn't mind.

It really only annoyed me to read this book to be honest.  The ending was not cathartic and was actually really depressing.  The book is dark and twisted and really wreaks more of a horror movie - all that was missing was the crazy \\"Jason\\" music in the background.  Not sure how this is a best seller, but sure.  It was not for me at all, but hey, to each his own.

Its a college setting so of course it's going to have its \\"immature\\" moments, always remember the setting and time period.  Remember when you were 19 and the jealousy and love and hate that almost happens exactly at the same time.  It's a great book, an easy read, and a lot of details.  It is laced with a few turns that are fun and leave you smiling.  Who doesn't love a story where the girl actually does change the bad boy ways.
B007Y30OQ6|4.0|[[ASIN:B001KMRZ0U Whitmor 6351-1234-JAVA Fashion Color Organizer Collection Hanging Accessory Shelves, Java]]<br /><br />For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \\"fanboy\\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.<br /><br />Physical Characteristics<br />The iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.<br /><br />New and \\"Improved\\"<br />Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.<br /><br />The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \\"new\\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.<br /><br />The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />Smart Covers aren't really \\"smart\\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.<br /><br />Multitasking Support<br />One of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.<br /><br />Apps<br />One thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.<br /><br />Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.<br /><br />Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use yourtablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.<br /><br />Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.<br /><br />HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.<br /><br />No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.<br /><br />If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It took me a while to get into this story, mostly because I had already heard SOOOO much about this story and the upcoming movie that it was just harder for me to jump into everything. I did eventually though, the world is lush and fun and dramatic. I am starting to see why this young girls are all Jace crazy, he's kind of a bad boy, but on the good side. I did like the characters I really liked Alec, even though I don't think you're supposed to be a big fan at this point. I think Clary is a bit annoying and daft, at least in the beginning, she is on a mission to save lives and kick butt, without learning really how to kick butt, but then again she doesn't do must of the kicking...Anyway, yes characters were done pretty well, the pacing was great, and I liked the Mythos developed in the world, and I can't wait to read more about The City of Glass. I liked the Silent Brotherhood, they were creepy but not in a bad way, I don't actually think that anything was terrifying or suspenseful, but it was written well. Ok, I know that I just said the world was great, and it is, but there is still not much explanation of how things are or were. I honestly feel like we are supposed to know as much as Clary or Simon, and we'll learn as we go. Oh my there was one big thing I didn't like a plot device that they gave away in the first few chapters and I was like, yep already know where this is going. Of course most young adults are predictable in a lot of ways, but there were still a few surprises, and there was a lot of humor thrown in which made reading this story much more enjoyable. Oh the Luke and Leia moment in the book as grossed me out... I've order book number two already, so maybe I'll have the whole of the published series finished prior to the movie release.
B0086700CM|5.0|fantastic game! I love how it is different everytime! great challenge and neat graphics! very addictive! my daughter and I play it all the time.
B007TBCTRK|2.0|not a disaster, but this soundtrack is yet another standard and average sounding score. the music does little to improve on what was a disappointing and lackluster movie and when listened to without prior knowledge of the film...one could easily associate it with any average sci-fi from the last decade.<br /><br />which to conclude makes this a very poor effort.

1936608898|5.0|Like many Americans I have struggled to find a \\"healthy\\" diet for years. I tried low-fat diets, portion control, Zone etc...and all of those approaches have their benefits, but none really taught me about my body's reaction to food. This book gave me an understanding of how food affects my hormones, my digestive system and my immune system. And they did it all in a way that was easy to understand for a non-science major! There are hundreds of citations in the book to back up their claims, but it read like you were getting advice from a live nutritionist. There is a bit of tough love, but looking at the waist lines of most Americans, we need it!<br /><br />I have been eating Primal/Paleo since February but have struggled with the \\"sugar dragon\\" and eliminating dairy (which we finally did about a month ago and saw amazing improvements in my son's sinus issues). I am planning to take on my first Whole30 next month with my sister, for whom I bought the Kindle edition of this book.<br /><br />A lot of my family and friends are interested in our new healthy eating habits and I now have one place to refer them for all the information they need.

0545265355|5.0|I bought the box set trilogy and started reading. The books are impossible to put down. I absolutely loved them. They're full of suspense. The love story blended in well with all the action packed adventures through out the books. The way the author wrote the book made me feel as if I was actually there,running with Kaniss, feeling her emotions. Its a must read!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game it was interesting and has cool games (lots of cool games) for free the only drag is that u have to earn money tor lots of them
0345803485|1.0|I was talked into buying this book by my coworkers. The book is poorly written and it does sound like a crazy teenage fantasy,as the other reviewers said. Meeting a billionaire after college, having him make you his sex slave? buying fancy presents for you? seriously? a 21 year old virgin? and Christian Grey sounded like a serial killer that tortures women to death. It has no depth to the story, no surprises. Just detailed sexual activities for the sexually deprived.<br />Apart from the book being terribly written, the quality the book was horrible. The pages were from some kind of recycled paper.<br />Overall,If thats what you're into then get the book. To each his own.

B008B0WOQO|5.0|Lianne La Havas is a singer/songwriter/guitarist from the UK and her debut CD \\"Is Your Love Big Enough?\\" sounds just as lovely as her name. It's a blend of Soul, Jazz, and Folk, acting as a perfect backdrop to her feathery vocals which recall Erykah Badu or even Amel Larreux.<br /><br />The album opens \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" opening with a wall of multi-layered vocals before morphing into a spacey guitar-driven ballad. The title track is a guitar/hand clap-driven affair, while \\"Lost & Found\\" is a piano ballad with quivery emotive vocals which would do Adele proud, as would the spare piano ballad \\"Gone\\". \\"Au Cinema\\" is a soft ballad with twitchy sounding guitar, while \\"No Room For Doubt\\" is a tender duet with Willy Mason. \\"Forget\\" features skittery percussion and the angry lyrics \\"Waste all your time writing love songs, but you don't love me\\", while the unfussy acoustic \\"Age\\" is a spare Jazzy/Bluesy piece.<br /><br />Every song stands out really; \\"Elusive\\" is a groovy ballad, \\"Everything Everything\\" is a lush Jazzy shuffle, \\"Tease Me\\" is an acoustic ballad, and closing is the catchy sunny \\"They Could Be Wrong\\", jangly Indie Pop with Havas tenderly teasing and caressing with her voice.<br /><br />The album has already debuted at #4 in her native UK. Glad to see that good music can still find an audience sometimes. This album is an absolute delight!!

B005D6O0IO|4.0|I bought these for my 12 year old daughter who is very fashion conscious.  She needed something that would work for a family trip.  The shoes needed to be equally effective as shoes to wear with a skirt for dinner, and also to walk on the beach or on flat trails in the redwoods.  So far the rose has stayed attached, which was an area of concern for me.

B005HJU7HA|4.0|Honestly, if you are interested in reading these book, get it. Its a great price with some minor problems.<br />Now yes, it does have some bad reviews, but thats because not everyone knows what it is they are reading, has never read the Book of Mormon, and so therefore when ever a mormon comes up it must be religious texts from the Book of Mormon. Not true. Just a warning. Do not write a bad review because this \\"has parts of the Book of Mormon in it.\\" It does not.<br />But other than that, some grammatical errors(easily looked past), formatting, order, and a few other annoying things. Thats why I find this hard to give it a 5. But still, it is well worth it.

0439023491|4.0|Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have survived the 74th Hunger Games by outwitting Capitol and those who control the Games.  But in doing so, both Katniss and Peeta have put their lives in grave danger.  Because of their stand at the end of the first book to either both die or both survive the Games, those around Panem who do not like Capitol's iron control over the districts view the actions of Katniss and Peeta as a chink in the armor of the totalitarian government.  One in which these people -- a growing rebel movement -- wish to exploit.  But the government of Panem -- and its leader, President Snow -- has other ideas.  Knowing Panem is on the brink of a full scale rebellion, President Snow orders a crackdown in each of the districts.  Where a meager existence and the threat of starvation have been the norm in many of the districts, now Panem's military -- the Peacekeepers -- are in full crackdown mode, with beatings and executions becoming frequent events.<br /><br />But for Katniss and Peeta, the events take on a much more personal note.  President Snow has directly threatened not only their lives but the lives of their families if they do not play ball and do everything in their power to help prevent the growing rebellion.  Katniss and Peeta sparked the rebel movement, now they must do everything they can to extinguish those flames...or they and everyone they care about will suffer.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a satisfying middle installment to Collin's Hunger Games trilogy.  There is plenty of adventure to keep younger readers engaged while the story's arc about a totalitarian government inflicting horrible cruelties on its people is easily enough to keep more mature readers turning pages as well.  As someone who is no longer in grade school, the biggest irritant for me was the intermittent romantic confusions of Katniss.  How does she feel about Peeta?  How does she feel about Gale?  Does she have a future with either?  While Katniss's underlying feelings for the boys are certainly relevant, the whole romantic entanglement comes off rather puerile and well...so \\"middle-school\\".  I kept wanting more about the machinations of President Snow, his government, and various other groups that seem to be involved on the periphery...perhaps in the final installment?  Nonetheless, I am very eager to pick up the final book in the trilogy and see how all of the conflicts are resolved.  This book is most certainly recommended as a fine follow-up to The Hunger Games.for the boys are certainly relevant, the whole romantic entanglement comes off rather puerile and well...so \\"middle-school\\".

B00632HWOG|1.0|I used to use this application all the time on my Android phone. But today I found it has a VERY DISTURBING problem. I cannot look at my yahoo email at work, so I have been depending on my Android smart phone to stay in touch with my email. Today my husband (who also reads my email) called to let me know that I received an email from a friend that I had been looking forward to getting. THIS EMAIL WAS NOT LISTED ON THE YAHOO EMAIL APP ON MY PHONE!!! My husband went over the messages he saw on my home computer, one by one, and almost half of the messages were missing on my phone!! Just not there!!!  I have no idea of how many, possibly important, messages I have been missing all the while I have used this application.  This is ten times worse than having to ignore ads. This is a complete deal breaker for me. I feel betrayed by an application like this that just pretends to show you all your email. (In case this has something to do with my particular phone, I have TMobile's Prepaid Samsung Exhibit II 4G and version 1.4.4.12415 of Yahoo! Mail.)
B004SKJTY6|4.0|Very nice movie:  The cracks in our armor, even when we don't want them to show, can make us humble and the advancement of who we are,even needing to humble ourselves more in needing that help, can make us better.  This movie, \\"The King's Speech: Road to the Throne,\\" can help us to remember that our weaknesses not only affect us, but also those around us and perhaps we need each other to get to that place of service which is truly human!
1439127700|5.0|As someone who enjoys reading about Presidents and their lives, I really enjoyed this book.  The authors by focusing on the Club rather than just the individual administrations provide a new dimension to a much trod path.<br />It is very readable and has a lot of personal anecdotes, and insider information.  I will admit to being somewhat surprised to learn of how things really work as opposed to how they told us it worked in eighth grade civics. I think five stars is about right.

B007IFZU5A|5.0|I've been a long time fan of PL, and I equally like Icon, Draconian Times and One Second or Host too. Since Believe in Nothing for me they somehow losing their unquestionable greatness. There was one or two standout tracks on every album since that, but something is missing. Until their previous work Faith Divide us... It was a masterpiece, a road back to their iconic sound, with full of great songs. And now they've managed to an album even better than that. I think Tragic Idol easily the best work they ever done, what's more, this is one of the greatest rock/metal album I ever hear! I totally agree with the other 5 star reviewers, it's blew me away. every track is memorable, but To the night is a song that makes me happy that I have ears. I don't know what happens with this guys in the last few years, but they are unable to mistake. No poses, no trends, radio hits or anything, just pure magnificient music. PL forever!

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I wasnt going to read this. Too much media hype, too many people raving. The last time I fell for that I read two of the Twilight books which were terrible in my opinion.<br /><br />Then my sister buys me the first one, Fifty Shades of Grey, as a birthday gift.<br /><br />Sadly I'm not someone who can leave things unfinished.<br /><br />I read the entire trilogy and it was so redundant! As other reviewers have stated, I wanted to send the author a dictionary and a thesaurus! It started out promising, but soon became almost unbearable to finish.<br /><br />I skipped ahead and doubled back. I find it hard to believe this is a best seller. Grown women rave about this? Pure Romance created a product line based on this? Its hard for me to understand. The \\"erotic\\" scenes were poorly written and surrounded by so much other redundant drivel I had a hard time finding any of it \\"exciting\\". Im not a prude or a whore but the sex scenes were terrible! I know she was a virgin but still! By the end of the first book I was sick of them having sex.<br /><br />And what country was this based in again? And dont get me started on her inner goddess, the lip biting, eye rolling and palm twitching mess!<br /><br />The plus side is that the authors writing ability seems to improve the more she writes. She did focus on other characters and attempted to create a plot in the FINAL book! Perhaps her next books will be better.

0425221806|5.0|I am already a big fan of Dean Koontz and I absolutely love the story.  That said, I like the dog better than anyone else in the book.  This is one book I could read a couple times a year whether I need to or not.
0385335997|3.0|Includes Some Spoilers:<br /><br />I love the characters of Claire and Jamie and loved the original Outlander and its sequel. I'm not sure why the author chose to move the story ahead 20 years and skip over the prime years of the character's romance. Yes, I understand that those 20 years were unstable and unsafe in Scotland, but everything else she writes is utterly implausible, so why not have them survive together rather than apart? Jamie and Claire's reunion is anticlimactic and unsatisfying, Together (mostly) they have one adventure after another but do not have an overarching story that ties the small adventures together to craft a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Yes, it's natural that people change in 20 years, but Claire and Jamie are now far less appealing than their younger selves. The fact is, they are old. In life, that is wonderful; in literature, it is dull. The passion and magic has fizzled. I can deal with the Loughaire debacle, and actually enjoy John Grey, but the William story just makes me sad. I feel that rather than create obstacles and drama, Gabaldon just sullied the beautiful love story. I don't like her choices and feel she squandered great opportunities with wonderful characters. I also miss the fabulous characters of past books, like Dougal and Colum, and the fun members of French society. Brianna and Roger feel very forced on us and are not particularly compelling.<br /><br />I was taught that good writing ~shows~ rather than ~tells~. Well, this story tells me over and over that Claire and Jamie are still youthful and beautiful and very much in love, but it shows me the exact opposite. It's disappointing and a little confusing. I'm giving it three stars because at least it wasn't boring, I did feel compelled to keep reading (out of hope it would get better) and will continue reading the series.

B001FKKLNK|4.0|Instead of distilling the very best of what was recorded on that sacred musical Sunday at the Village Vanguard (June 25, 1961), this disc provides an arbitrary \\"slice\\" from the complete three-disc package.  I'm afraid that many listeners who are new to Bill Evans and who, moreover, are not impressed by single discs with multiple takes of the same song, will express impatience upon hearing this collection.  I would recommend, instead, the earlier disc (which, to my ears, even captures the piano more faithfully) that shows a close-up of Bill's face (excluding his upper torso) and is entitled, simply, \\"The Bill Evans Trio at the Village Vanguard.\\"  It selects 10 highlights, including \\"My Foolish Heart\\" and \\"Waltz for Debby,\\" and drops the \\"retakes.\\" In addition, some of the equally critical nuanced material is included--\\"Gloria's Step,\\" \\"All of You\\" (Bill's voicings of the melody of this Cole Porter tune--recorded later by Keith Jarrett's Standards trio--are extraordinary and extremely subtle, unmatched by any other pianist), and Scott LaFaro's \\"Jade Visions\\" (which grows on the listener, exerting a mesmerizing hold).<br /><br />To the uniniated I would recommend at least one other Riverside recordings by Bill with LaFaro--\\"A Portrait in Jazz.\\"  From there, I would suggest the radical and unexpected--the 2 composite discs representing Bill's 16 discs' worth of material recorded at the Keystone Korner in San Francisco one week before his death on September 15, 1980.  This music has Dionysian currents along with bursts of emotional abandonment that take us into musical territory untrespassed by any jazz artist before or since.  Like Debussy and Ravel, Bill absorbed the influences of \\"early Romanticism\\"; but like late Mozart, Schumann and Shubert, Verdi, Moussourski, Shostakovich, R. Strauss, and even Rachmaninoff, he came to a point in his musical life (for the Romantics, inseparable for \\"life\\") where nothing but the fearless passion of the late Romantics was adequate to express the consummation of his musical vision.<br /><br />In the present millennium we hear much about the arrival of new musical brilliance in the jazz world, of young artists bypassing the entire period of the Romantics (1798 to World War I) in favor of quantum mechanical physics or mathematical series of the 12th century mathematician (Leonardo of Pisa) known as Fibonnacci or of a more systematic assimilation of ragas into jazz than that achieved by John or Alice Coltrane.  Nevertheless, it is from Wordswoth and especially Blake and Coleridge that writers, painters and musicians took an entirely different course--exploring the interior regions of the self in search of a microcosmic, truer picture of reality than the one constructed by the previous Age of the Elightenment.  Shelly was preocuppied with the ethereal, ineffable songs of the skylark while Keats found a closer identification with the song of the nightingale.  Byron occupied himself with the pursuit of replacing politics with poetry, an ever restless wanderer, exiled from his homeland while fighting for freedom in other countries, as if to prove Shelley's assertion that \\"poets are the true legislators of the world.\\"  But it is the humble Keats who made the lasting, memorable discovery, arriving at a definiton of his art that both proved itself and gave purpose to his limited life--the briefest and yet the most productiove of any of the Romantics:  \\"Truth is Beauty, and Beauty is Truth.\\" That is the most that any of us can hope to know on this earth.<br /><br />Shortly before he died, Bill Evans is quoted as saying much the same to Tony Bennett.  Whether or not he had been reading Keats' \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" is beside the point.  He was an artist, and his music--both early and late--offers ample proof that he thought much like the poet whose \\"negative capability\\"--or the ability to create beauty where there's no apparent reason for it to exist--elevated him to a spot second only to the immortal Bardof Avon.of Avon.
0345803485|2.0|Mostly I'm CONfused--like a lot of people--by the popularity of this book.  It looks like most everything has already been said in Amazon reviews, and I found some of the reviews more enjoyable than the book.  I have not, however, run across anyone counting the times that \\"bemused\\" and \\"amused\\" were used, though, of course I didn't read all the reviews (I'm not a masochist).  Let's just say they are a very \\"bemused\\" couple.  Perhaps James should have replaced those two words with the word \\"stupidly.\\"  i.e., ...he cocked his head stupidly ...she looked at him stupidly.  I'm already feeling pity for the actors if they have to follow this stage direction in the movie version.  I have given this two stars because the author managed to keep me curious enough about the ending to keep reading, even though the writing was mind-numbingly bad.  Thankfully it was only a Kindle Library Book.  No, I would not have rented this if it was an actual bound book.  Pun intended.
B007N5YJWK|4.0|I did a comparison of the new Criterion Blu-ray transfer to the old Criterion DVD transfer (I don't have the old Image DVD to compare it to).<br /><br />One big improvement I see between the Blu-ray and the old DVD is that the image is much more steady on the Blu-ray presentation. There is more bounce to the picture in the old DVD.<br />Near the beginning as the camera pulls up to the ticket window, look at the posted notice, it bounces around as if floating separate of the background on the old DVD, it is steady and seems attached to the background on the new Blu-ray.<br /><br />BUT there seems to be some fluctuation in the blacks in the new Blu-ray transfer that was not in the old DVD. This was a little annoying, why did it turn up now? Has the original film started to deteriorate since the last transfer?  This fluctuation, or flicker starts right at the beginning as the British Film Board Certificate fades in, and it remains in the picture, most of the time unnoticeable but other times it stands out.<br /><br />Even though the new transfer is still soft, the Blu-ray has no compression artifacting that was noticeable in the old DVD. I can not vouch for the new DVD.<br /><br />The bottom line: is it worth upgrading to Blu-ray?  I would say only \\"maybe\\". I was a little disappointed that it did not look sharper and that the blacks flickered.

0307744434|5.0|II just wanted to write a review for this book, simply to congratulate the author on such a magical work and to criticise those who head books and develop a bias about them, this book is at times a bit slow and the story lines are twisted in confusing sorts but the point of the cool is to saint a magical landscape of circus wonder and to invite the reader into a world of the impossible, for those of you who gave the book a bad review I suggest what I always suggest when one tells me that he/she did not find one thing compelling about a certain work, READ IT AGAIN! Books are meant to touch the reader in ways that even the reader sometimes cannot describe, I do not believe in giving a book a bad review after only reading it once that that goes to show that one does not appreciate the written word, perhaps next time those who do not like a certain book should try writing there own novel and see just how hard it really is to paint a perfect picture, not all books are perfect at.

0307165485|5.0|As others have stated, I, too hold this book as one of my greatest childhood treasures.  It's well-worn and tattered from being read countless times, again and again!  I always loved the \\"busy\\" pictures, so many fun, silly and interesting things to find in them.  \\"I Am A Bunny,\\"  \\"Country Mouse, City Mouse\\" and the bear cub riding on his father's shoulders (forget the title) are long-time favorites.  Now my twin toddlers love to look at all the pictures - trains, trucks, food, colors...all the things they are learning about every day are featured in this book.  It is not just a book of stories.  It has short stories, but it also has something new and interesting on every page.  I am thrilled to see that one of my favorite books has stood the test of time and is being discovered by a new generation of readers.

1469984202|5.0|I bought the Wool Omnibus set of books on a whim, and I am very glad I did.  My initial concern about Wool being another diatribe about man's destruction of the environment was completely off.  Wool is far more, and far better than that. The most impressive aspect of Wool is how Hugh Howey deftly melded character development and the process of showing (not telling) the reader the ins, outs, and rules of the world the book creates.  He did so while revealing plot twists and new viewpoints in a way that felt natural and wholly believable in the context of the book's world.<br />Having read science fiction and fantasy for decades, I honestly echo the comment of other reviewers that rate Hugh Howey as a welcome, rising star in the genre.  Needless to say, I will be picking up more of Mr. Howey's work, hoping it is just as good as Wool.
031620157X|5.0|This book is utterly fantastic! Colfer's voice shines through. A great addition to the genre, kids are sure to find it a wonderful escape. However, despite its appeal to a younger audience, it's really a novel for all ages. Some parts really made me think. I'll definitely be re-reading it!
1567184855|5.0|One of the most interesting books I've ever read about the other side. The level of detail he goes into is astonishing, I recommend reading it if you have any interest in the subject, it's an extraordinary piece of work!
0143119680|3.0|As a lover of all things Harry Potter, I was intrigued at the idea of an adult book about witchcraft and wizardry.  However, once I read the book, I was a bit disappointed.  The first half of the book is a thinly veiled attempt at targeting all YA reading adults and they may appreciate it.  As another reader described, the author goes way into detail about what the main characters as wearing.  Also, there is way too much discussion on wine and the various attempts of wine the characters drink.  The second half of the book gets better and picks up the pace but I started to see similarities with other vampire books.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|This product is extremely flimsy and poorly made. They should really do some QA before put a product out like this. I ordered from Amazon.com and the product came with a HUGE dent on the ball, which makes is impossible to play with. I went through the process of ordering a new one, surprise surprise, it came again with a HUGE crack on the ball, the product has very poor quality, it seems that if you press it a little bit, you could easily form a dent. Please save yourself the headache of buying and returning and DO NOT buy this product. If you really want, at least buy it from a physical store so you can pick an undamaged product! I have returned both faulty products and will NOT buy again, at least NOT from AMAZON!!

0670022950|5.0|The Angels of our Better Nature provides statistical evidence that the world, on average, has gotten less violent.  Some of my friends have objected to this view, citing recent examples of violence between people, populations and/or nations, but the objections tend to be quite anecdotal.  I have given the book to those (i.e. one) of my acquaintance I thought might benefit by reading it, but have have yet to see the outcome. [In extenuation, my friends here are on the fragile side and this one is slowly dying).  Give it to your friends!
B002ZG980U|1.0|This movie (Inception) is not novel nor is the \\"dream within a dream\\" and/or \\"inception\\" concept new. In \\"Ship in a bottle\\" episode of Star Trek The Next Generation this idea was already played out decades ago. Inception is merely a rehash of old themes, a different variation on a similar theme. Nothing new or groundbreaking here. Lucid dream is a well known concept. This movie brings nothing to the table.
030758836X|3.0|Among the abundance of multi-layered literary suspense novels that flood the market today, the trick to success, it seems to me, is to not only be clever with the plot but to develop characters that supplement the expressed ingenuity and then build a tale that enhances both. This work by Gillian Flynn, an apparent noted suspense writer, starts out with a variegated story with suspenseful turns and a unique presentation from both a missing wife and a suspicious husband perspective and for two-thirds of the book this approach seems to work in a meaningful and positive way...most readers, I'm sure, will find the themes and characters here relatable and the work satisfying.<br /><br />We are introduced to our husband and wife team, Nick and Amy, seemingly happy together until Amy goes missing under suspicious and apparently violent circumstances. Continuing with this he said/she said perspective, we find that not all is as well in paradise as we're initially led to believe. Onerous nuances are supplemented by significant plot turns that, at this point, make the pages fly by.<br /><br />Suddenly though, the story seems to descend into an abstract, mind changing and character altering mess making the last third impossibly implausible. Characters seem to be floating rapidly from one end of the emotional spectrum to the other with no means or explanation and the whole foundation of the story falls apart at its most important point.<br /><br />It's a shame really because it's evident that Flynn possesses talent in this medium and, armed with a competent story to tell, would surely pull off a sensational work. This work is not it, however. My impression of this book is that she struggled for a poignant ending and could come up with nothing so meandered for a hundred pages or so...her protagonists at the beginning absolutely do not match those at the end.<br /><br />Certainly a talented mystery/suspense writer, I'm given to try other works by Gillian Flynn just for completeness...'Gone Girl' unfortunately is not that `complete' work
B005USZML4|4.0|I like Grisham stories of all types. This was a good story, but the kid was way beyond his years.  Grisham had a difficult time keeping Theodore 13.  Nevertheless, if you are willing to suspend your disbelief, you will get a pretty good read.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I've been looking for books for my almost 14 year old to read.  I like to read them first so we can talk about them as she is reading.  There are some big issues in this book, but they will create great discussions. I can't wait for her to read it.  We went to our first Poetry Slam this past spring sponsored by the local library.  I had never taken part in anything like it.  The emotions were huge, just like they are in this story. The Slams are such an awesome way to vent and share. I think it's really cool that the author included them. I'm looking forward to reading the next book.
0345803485|1.0|\\"Crap,\\" \\"double crap,\\" \\"biting her lip.\\" That's really all. These words and phrases are repeated over and over, squashed together with some below average erotic storytelling, and this makes a mega seller?! This book is horrible and an insult to what I'm sure must be a plethora of at least satisfactory erotica writers out there.<br /><br />And, don't get me started on character development. There is none. None of these characters are likable because they are ridiculous. A twenty-two year old English Lit major that doesn't own a computer and whose virginity is intact? A gorgeous, outrageously wealthy twenty-seven year old entrepreneur/philanthropist/helicopter pilot? Oh, please. I keep reading these five-star review writers and wonder how they not only managed to read the entire book straight through, but loved it? I just don't get it. One may argue that she didn't read the book for its worth as a piece of literature, and that's all fine. Then do yourself a favor and watch some porn instead.<br /><br />I am so grateful that I was able to borrow this book from a friend rather than having to waste ten bucks on it. Please, please, please, find some book more worth while to spend your hard earned money on. There are so many more deserving books out there.

I found the storyline exciting with a good pace - gave up all my spare time to finish reading it.  It takes place in post-apocalyptic United States after a major uprising.  Suzanne Collins did a terrific job bringing the reader into this new world, with all of its evils and excesses.  Way to go Katniss Everdeen for taking on the Capitol!  It is a must read for anyone who likes a suspenseful novel.

B000FC146C|4.0|Okay, I'll cut to the disappointment portion of my review.  I use the Kindle app on my iPad to read ebooks and didn't have any qualms about paying $9.99 for this particular book.  What was disappointing to me were all the typos and punctuation errors that proliferated this format of the book. Clearly there was no proofreading involved to check for conversion errors before Amazon tossed this one out for sale.  So, my advice to anyone interested in buying this book it so get the good old fashion print version.<br /><br />Now, on to the positive portion of my review.  Given the quantity of reviews already posted, I'll spare a book report and just say what moved me to enjoy the story.  I love romances and this one kept me very much enthralled from the beginning until the end.  I enjoyed the writing style and I also enjoyed learning about Australia -- enough so that I was flipping over to Google unfamiliar terms, etc.<br /><br />As for the characters, I didn't fall head over heels in love with any of them but did feel empathy because of the positions they placed themselves.  Meggie and her siblings were a catastrophe at the hands of their ice-cold mother.  Fee's detachment wasn't any kinder than her sister-in-law, Mary's, cold, miser heart.  And I don't know squat about the Catholic church but can't help but think that one can remove himself from his lofty priestly position if he really, really wanted that to happen -- at any cost.  Clearly Father Ralph's love for Meggie was not as strong as his love for prestige.  What a pity.  And frankly, I didn't really care for her daughter Justine and so I wasn't moved when she finally had her epiphany at the end of the story.  Her Raine was such a long suffering fellow and I didn't really see how he, in his maturity, could be excited about an immature and self-absorbed Justine.  What a long road ahead for this couple.<br /><br />I'm giving this story 4 stars because it did entertain me to the level that I had a hard time putting the book down, but I don't see myself ever re-reading it again.he book down, but I don't see myself ever re-reading it again.

But with practice and motivation you can become more balance, have a stronger core, and move gracefully thru her lessons. The combination of yoga while learning tribal movements is extremely helpful.  I have taken 1 session (12 hours) of private instructions and for me it was easy to follow novice that I am. The best part is rewinding and practice a particular sequence until you understand.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|On a recommendation from a friend, I downloaded the Wool Omnibus Edition to my kindle. I am so glad that I found this short series after the first five books were written. It would have been torture to finish one and have to wait for the next one to be published!<br /><br />I enjoy apocalyptic/ dystopian plots and Wool has this in large supply. I managed to read all five \\"books\\" in about three days. I'm a fast reader, but Wool is an especially easy read. The thing I liked the most is that I would day dream about the story line in between readings. I would ponder different scenarios and theories of the cause and effects of the story. I couldn't wait to keep reading to see how the tale would unfold.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the fact that there is little to no foreshadowing in this book. The reader discovers the facts along with the characters. At one point the reader may have more information than a particular character, but it is never clear what will happen or how that character will behave.<br /><br />In dystopian stories it is easy for an author to create two dimensional characters. The good guys and bad guys. In Wool, it initially appears this way, but once the \\"bad\\" guy was more involved in the plot line, I found myself not hating that character, but more philosophizing over his actions and situation. Would I act any differently if I were in his place? Are the actions by the \\"good\\" guys helpful or hurtful to the cause? What the hell is the cause, anyway?<br /><br />I will be pondering Wool for a long time and suggest you do too! Can't wait for more books in this series to come out.

B0073LWEXK|2.0|The Lost City had great graphics and lots of puzzles to solves. However, it would have been impossible to solve with hints from this site ([...]). The hint guide included helped some, but the game required you to jump around 40+ screens, in random order, back & forth, back & forth. I could never have done things in order without that website. To do it alone would have required wandering around guessing for hours until you finally found enough items and clues to go back through. Fun, but would have been better if the screens required had more sense or logic to their layout, then I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.

This was a journey that the reader can feel good about. It is inspiring, comical, deeply sad and best of all memorable.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I too, wanted to see what the hype of this book was, so I borrowed it from a friend.  I managed to make it through this whole book and now I feel dirty... gross... unclean, and if I could wash my eyes out with soap to get the horrific pictures out of my head, I would!  I also feel used.  I actually was intrigued by the characters, and found myself pulled into this horror story.  I didn't want to read it, but the book took hold of me and wouldn't let me put it down.  I want her to fix him... I want the fairytale ending.  I hate myself for it, but I want to read the next book!  But if I read it, I'm afraid I'll once again be one lightning strike from hell!<br /><br />This book was a rollercoaster ride.  I hated the language, I hated the graphic, totally unbelievable sex scenes..., so one star.  Yet, the author was able to keep me coming back for more; I liked the characters, I liked the story line, so I upped it to two stars.<br /><br />Even if I do succumb to that unreasonable desire to read the next book, I won't recommend it to any friends as I wouldn't want to pollute their souls, like I feel mine has just been.<br /><br />** REVISED **  I stand by my review, but I had to change my rating to 3 stars, because though the subject matter was difficult to read about, it held my attention and I became invested with the characters.  I enjoyed the author's style... Just wish the sex scenes were fewer and farther between and the f word wasn't in it 4,392 times!
1439152799|1.0|It has taken me days and days to force myself to get halfway through this 'library' book,and I have decided that I am wasting no more time with it.<br /><br />It started out pretty good,but then it just bogged down and went nowhere. Except for repeated mentions of a childhood book about \\"The Mudman\\" there is no story here at all,that I could ever see. Tediously boring IMO. Glad I don't own it.
B005OK721G|5.0|For some this film may be a bit too violent.  For others who love action, it will be the cream de' la creme of action movies.  It is jammed packed with heart-racing scenes.  And through it all you somehow come out actually caring about the main character.  Sometimes women in the part of the kick-butt action star comes off as being \\"just too much\\" and rather unbelievable.  This film does a better job than most of NOT coming across that way.  Though a few of the hand to hand fighting scenes were a bit stretched.. all in all this film is a must-see for those who like the action genre.

B005LAIGN2|5.0|Though the film Tuskegee Airmen was one that should be considered a classic; this film is too excellently made for a younger generations telling of the story.  This film too captured the bravery and intelligence as well as the integrity of all the men who flew missions during this time.  Great teaching tool to familiarize the youth of today with the struggle of Black (especially men) to be recognized, held in the same high regard as their counterparts, and counted!  This account of the story also gave a little inside of the personal nature of some of the guys.  Entertaining film all around.
0062059882|3.0|THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE AUDIOBOOK VERSION<br /><br />In Neil Gaiman's American Gods, every immigrant to America brings with them the gods of their homeland. As the country has grown, however, these gods have been forgotten. New gods--the gods of railroads, cars, media and computers--have arisen and taken their place and their power. But the old gods--stuck in this land that isn't made for gods--won't go down without a fight. Mr. Wednesday is attempting to organize the old gods for the coming battle with the new gods. To help him, he's recruited Shadow--a man whose release from prison coincides with the death of his beloved wife Laura. With nothing left to lose, Shadow agrees to work for Wednesday and finds himself embarking on a long strange trip to some of the holy places of America--all the while catching glimpses into the \\"backstage\\" world of the gods.<br /><br />I've been hearing about Neil Gaiman ever since I started blogging and made a mental note to try one of his books. So when Audible had a special on The Tenth Anniversary Edition of American Gods with a full-cast recording, I decided to take the leap into Gaiman land. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this long rambling book wasn't it. Perhaps it was the fact that the book was too many things at once: a long road trip, a fantasy book with every mythological creature you've ever heard of, a murder mystery, a love story, a commentary on America, a history lesson.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of the book was the incarnations of the various gods in their \\"Americanized\\" form. If nothing else, the book made me want to run out and purchase a book of myths to learn more about the various incarnations of the gods that immigrants brought with them to America. I'm sure that a really good background on various myths from a variety of countries would greatly enhance the reading experience. (Note: After typing the previous sentence, I found this web site which provides basic information on the gods referenced in the book. Reading through it, I realize that having this information would have made a real difference in my appreciation and enjoyment of the book! In fact, just reading through the web site and seeing what Gaiman has done, is now retroactively making me change my opinion about the book.)<br /><br />I know that Gaiman first came to prominence with the Sandman graphic novels, and if ever a book cried out for illustrations, American Gods is it. In fact, I think this book would have totally rocked as a graphic novel. The visuals were easy to conjure up in my mind, and as I listened, I was almost picturing such a book in my head.<br /><br />In the end, I think a really good grounding in mythology would make this a much richer and deeper read/listen. You cannot just go into this book without any knowledge or you'll find that, on the surface, it is a long and meandering book that can begin to get frustrating. However, if you have a good grounding in mythology (or at least browse through the web site I linked to above before reading), the book might come alive for you in a way that it didn't for me during my 19 hours of listening.<br /><br />ABOUT THE NARRATION<br /><br />I love listening to books that have multiple narrators. It makes the book come alive in a very different way. Also, in a long listen like this one, having different voices added variety and interest. It also helped me keep track of who was talking as I got to know the voices of the main characters. Still, all things considered, I think I would have preferred an annotated and illustrated print version of the book (not that such a version exists--but what an awesome idea for the 20th anniversary of the book!!!)nced in the book.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book is well written. The probability of the story being a true one is, unfortunately not a small one. Anything can happen to anybody and they better prepare for it. The blind faith of the parents is understandable but lacks the insight into their son. The part dealing with the almost ending the marriage is well expressed and understood. In short, it asks the question: How far will I go to protect my child and what will it cost the family as a unit?
0345803485|1.0|Though I love a good literotica when its placed in front of me I would rather pull my own teeth with a pair of rusted pliers than continue to read this.  The sad thing is that this book was given to me by a friend and now I can understand why she was so inclined to get rid of it.  The plethora of grey references bordered on down right annoying, the story line was weak at best and the expanse of the authors use of crap as a life expression astounded me to the point that i wondered if this was the work of bored teens with a laptop thinking about their \\"dream guy\\".  The \\"sex\\" scenes were tantamount to a cheesy porn if written by the creators of South Park and Family Guy during a rousing game of beer pong.  I can't blame the author for using a pseudonym because I personally would be embarrassed to lend my name to this.  It simply saddens me to think that this is the mental level that publishers think we have been reduced to.<br />My advice if you are pondering cracking open the cover is to save yourself the time , money and energy.  I wish someone had warned me, I would've paid my friend to have never given me this trash.
B007X4ECLY|2.0|Hey Luc I have an \\"original\\" idea to graft escape from NY, virtuosity, fortress, the death star and whatever cgi space footage is laying around, and call it \\"block out\\" because you'll want to block out most of it.<br /><br />I had low low expectations, and this film didn't quite live up to them.<br />Its was a patched together predictable mess with cardboard cut out set pieces. While it does somehow manage to make the main stupidest idea in the movie(a prison in space where the prisoners are in suspended animation) seem logical, the rest is full of holes.<br /><br />Other than a couple of snarky comments by the star it has nothing new to offer in the realm of action or sci fi and has no signature Besson moments. Another mean spirited romp down the road of bad ideas and increasingly crass characters with no time for cinematography editing or filmatic scope.<br /><br />you can actually feel your brain dying while watching the movie. Kind of like hal in 2001, \\"my brain is going Dave, I can feel it, i can feel it\\"
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Having seen all the previous Mission Impossible films (and being a fan of both the original and the revised Mission Impossible tv shows); I must say that this last one was most enjoyable.  The action and stunts done were great.  And the suspense (and sort of twist) in the storyline were very refreshing.  It wasn't just bullets, blood, guts, with a little bed-room action thrown in the middle of the plot like some so-called action films tend to be these days. This one has some substance!  Actors didn't OVER act.  Just a fun film.
0743277708|5.0|THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE AUDIOBOOK VERSION<br /><br />BOOK DESCRIPTION<br />A small group of rabbits leave their warren in the English countryside when one of them (a small rabbit named Fiver who has the gift of prophecy) foresees bad things on the horizon. The book chronicles their adventures as they seek a place to build a new warren. Under the leadership of Hazel, the band of rabbits faces many obstacles--from how to cross a river to the lack of does to the penultimate battle with a warren run by the evil General Woundwart.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br />I cannot believe that I didn't read this book until this year!! Originally published in 1972, Watership Down has been sitting out there my entire life and yet it took me until 2012 to read it. All I ever knew was that it was a book about rabbits. The simplistic book description is also deceiving. Yet it took only an hour of listening for me to realize that I was in the presence of greatness--a true 5 star read. Watership Down was an incredibly satisfying, rich and magical reading experience--the kind of book that transcends age and time. In my opinion, it deserves a place on the list of best books of all time, and it certainly has earned a place on my list of all-time favorite books.<br /><br />What makes the book so satisfying is that it works on multiple levels and that Adams strikes the perfect balance between reality and magic. Not only will the book satisfy children looking for a gripping adventure tale and rabbit folklore (the book grew out of a series of stories that Adams told his daughters), it will also satisfy an adult reader, with the rich personalities of the rabbits (we all have a Big Wig in our lives, I'm sure) and how well the rabbits' lives translate into our human lives. Although Adams talks in the introduction about how the book is not an allegory, it is not difficult to see the differences between the leadership approaches of Hazel and General Woundwart.<br /><br />Perhaps the best choice that Adams made is that, although these are talking rabbits, he makes them grounded in reality. In the introduction, Adams talks about how he never has his rabbits do anything that a real rabbit wouldn't do. These are not rabbits who build little houses and wear clothes like Peter Cottontail. They are wild and natural rabbits and they live as such. When faced with an obstacle such as how to cross a river,  they come up with a solution that felt realistic, plausible and yet seemed like a huge leap of logic for a rabbit, which is why Blackberry (the \\"smart one\\") had to come up with it.<br /><br />Adams even gives the rabbits their own language (Lapine), which I found myself easily adopting. (Their word for tractor or car is hrududu, which, when pronounced by an awesome reader like Ralph Casham, sounds just like a vehicle engine as interpreted by an animal.) It became commonplace to hear words like silflay (going aboveground to feed) and know exactly what they meant.<br /><br />Another wondrous touch was the rich folklore and mythology that Adams creates for the rabbits. One of the ways the rabbits keep their spirits up and adapt to their surroundings is by repeating the stories of El-Ahrairah, one of the first rabbits, whose exploits and trickery are woven throughout the book. I adored these stories about El-Ahrairah and enjoyed seeing how the rabbits would adapt the story to their present situation.<br /><br />The other thing I loved about this book was that Adams doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of life. The rabbits face real danger, including death and injury. Yet these moments are leavened by moments of triumph, peace and sweetness. There were also moments of comic relief (the pidgin talk of the gull Keehar and Big Wig's take on the world just tickled me). In addition, Adams writes one of the most beautiful and satisfying death scenes I've ever read in literature.<br /><br />Nothing I can write can really capture how wondrous and satisfying and pleasing this bookwas. If you've not read it yet, please get a copy (either in print or on audiobook) and read it as soon as possible. You don't want to miss this book like I almost did. It is brilliant on so many levels, and I applaud Adams for creating such a wondrous work of literature that hits all the right notes.<br /><br />ABOUT THE NARRATION<br />Ralph Cosham was the narrator I listened to, and he was pitch perfect. He captured the voices of each character perfectly--from Pipken's timidity to Big Wig's warm-hearted bluster. At 15+ hours, this was relatively long listen but I never once tired of it and could not wait to immerse myself in this world over and over again. It was with a real sense of loss that I finished this book.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED FOR<br />This is as perfect as a book can get and I recommend it to everyone. If you haven't read it yet, I strongly urge you to do so. I shall definitely be reading/listening to this one again, and I cannot wait for my son to be ready for it.was.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. love the new update...if u haven't  downloaded  it yet, do so it's great. the only criticism I have is we need more acorn and scrat coin rewards. maybe on the next update they can put that in.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was an amazing book! I, being only eleven, had to skip through the more, innapropriate parts. Although what I did read was absolutely fabulous! I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!

B006MW3V6U|3.0|The program is fantastic and that's why I was very happy to be able to buy Season 2 on Amazon.  I saw Season 1 on Netflix but they don't carry Season 2.  I was very disappointed to discover that there are no subtitles in English in the Amazon version.  The sound quality is okay but the variety of English accents make it hard to understand some really subtle details which are often said quickly.  With the Netflix, the subtitles can be turned on so it makes viewing a lot easier.
0345803485|1.0|This book is a joke. It is laugh out loud worthy on every page. The intimate scenes are nearly identical and there is no creativity. This book promotes a sexual way of life that is degrading to women. Christian Grey demoralizes and belittles Anastasia at the turn of every page. Don't waste your money on this book. Don't read it for free, either.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I love this book.  At first, I thought I wouldn't - what do I have in common with an 18 year old girl?  I forced myself to read the first 20 pages - and then I was hooked.  This book made me laugh out loud - and also cry, with tears down my face (not in a bad way)  I love it when books teach you something about life.  I'm going to buy this book for all my friends and family I loved it so much :)
B0086700CM|5.0|great fun, kills HOURS of boredom... honestly the best 3d platformer I have played. if it were a paid game, I would probably buy it. :)
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I am a 66 year old grandma and I really love this game.  I purchased it for myself after playing it on my grandson ipad.  It is a lot of fun to play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought all three of these books and they are wonderful.  They're FAST reading and i must say i had problems more than once putting the books down at night and then getting up in the morning for work!<br /><br />I absolutely love the surprise ending in book 3.  I didn't see THAT coming!
034580404X|5.0|I am very happy with the book set.  It arrived in perfect condition, at a great price, and arrived fairly quickly.  I've already read the books now, they are FANTASTIC!
1401225756|5.0|This is not just a comic book or a graphic novel. This is a very important work of art/literature and every thinking person should read this!<br /><br />Preludes and Nocturnes introduces the reader to the eponymous hero of Neil Gaiman's excellent Sandman series. P&N, which includes stories 1-8 of the 75 Sandman stories begins with Dream (aka the Sandman, The Dream King, Morpheus, etc) imprisoned by humans for 70 years. His escape, and subsequent journey to reclaim his possessions form much of this collection, and the reader realizes that Dream is a wounded, imperfect hero. P&N concludes with the exquisite \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\", where a brooding Dream is confronted, and eventually comforted,by his charming and sexy older sister, Death. It's remarkable how, just with this one story, Gaiman succeeds in making his version of Death one of the most lovable and enduring characters in modern fiction.<br /><br />P&N, and indeed the entire Sandman saga, is a reality check for anyone who thinks that comics or graphic novels can't be serious literature.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Loved it!!  Now waiting for the next book in the trilogy to arrive.  Good story and great history combined....and super characters!
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Wow, with the all star cast its sad that this movie was this bad. When you name a movie \\"Haywire\\" people expect to see action at every turn and this movie didn't deliver.
B004021H60|4.0|Overall this is a great shoe, especially in the summer.  It is really good for kids with wide feet like my daughter and its the first pair of shoes that I have purchased recently that have not immediately fallen apart.  Downside, blisters.  This may or may not be because the shoes are a little too big.  Its also great because my daughter can put the shoes on herself.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game.!!!!  I just don't like how hard it is to get investment points..<br /><br />The bird is the word....
0345803485|2.0|I am really not getting all the fuss around this book. I tried to like it. Really i did. But it simply doesnt speak to me. Even the sex scenes would need to be seriously reviewed.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is super fun but sometimes it does not sense my finger swiping and I fall off a cliff or crash. other then that its a fun and addicting game. Also sometimes its choppy.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|When we saw this in the theater we knew we needed this on DVD!  RDJ is an amazing actor.  There aren't many movies that I am excited about the sequel, but this is one great show!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This was made in a time when story telling was more important because special effects were at a premium, so they wouldn't look too hokey and laughable.  The story was taken from Shakespeare and the acting is a bit wooden, but I still get lost in that time when I was 9 and the first time I seen this -please realize I saw Star wars just a couple of years earlier in one of only three times my father ever took us to a drive inn movie, - and it was still cool with Robbie, the animated monster, and other worldly sound track. The end is a bit of a disappointment but this happened I'm sure mainly cause of the lack of quality special effects.  The extras on this are worth the price of admission.  It doesn't rate high on my favorites list, if I had one, but I still like going back to that place and time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are so many games.I cant stop playing this game no matter what. the quality is great and its so addictive!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I'm not a avid reader but this series has really kept my interest. There were times I just skimmed over sex scenes as there were soooooooooooooo many, but all in all, a good read!  Starting book three :)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds Rio is the best game ever !!!! The download might be slow but its worth it . Every things worth it .I what I mean it's fun there is the new characters funny comic books and a new boss and storyline.
014241493X|4.0|I was expecting a lot from this book, mainly because everyone who read it said it was awesome. Although it was a good read, I think because my expectations were so high I overestimated how much I would enjoy it. However, it was still nicely written, some parts felt like they took too long, but other than that, I would recommend this book!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a very fun the only is its hard to play in the car, it would also be cool if you could change scenes.
B00005B36H|5.0|Yes we all know schism is a great song but as an abum lateralus delivers a pretty powerful message. You will bang your head one song then ponder your existance the next. Great for everyone even if its not your usual cup of tea. Great buy!

0525476881|5.0|This is a great book by John Green. I highly recommend it to young adult readers. I really enjoyed the footnotes and how involved the reader is in this book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game but it frequently messes me up like one time I went to friends and it showed that all of my friends from facebook had one (254 friends) so I'd try to see their village but it wouldn't let me so I hadto shut it off
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a great game.  I do not have to worry about if there is anything inappropriate.  great for the whole family.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Very annoying that graphics wouldn't fit on screen.  Unplayable until this is fixed.  Using razr maxx with ice cream sandwich.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its interesting and is like a time management game.  with each game you play the more points you get making you come even closer to buying another game on this app.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I love the fact that I can get kindle books and read them on my phone, but after a recent update (around Apr 2012) the app takes way took long to load (anywhere from 3-5 minutes) on my Motorola Droid.  Previously, I had no complaints whatsoever, and because this was a new problem introduced over 2-3 months ago, I'm totally surprised that this hasn't been fixed yet... hoping someone from Amazon reads these ratings and fixes the problem.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|i like this game. i think its better than router aqua. but honestly only because its easier. but overal GREAT  ! (:
B007KZY1YY|2.0|The first book was exciting but this one just got boring very quickly and I cannot even face reading number 3...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I started playing this and just couldn't stop!!! love it!! it reminds me a lot of Mario. if you like Mario games install this app!
B000BTGY1O|5.0|The movie shipped fast and easy! It came sealed and awesome! Watched it the day it came in and the movie was great! Brand new and looked good! The screen was a little vintage looking but that was great since it was made generations ago.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome my brother plays this all the time it is addictive and fun he plays it until my kindle fire has a low battery
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun and hard at the same time bfhgdgh I recamend it for every one of those fans of old fashion games.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I loved more than any game for a handheld ever period. But when are there going to be DOORS? I mean really I need a door so I don't have to dig down a dirt door when trying to escape a mob in a hurry!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I absolutely love games like this. It's really good and worth the $2.99. You have nothing to lose because if your not sure they have a free version that is a sample. That way you can try the first chapter to see if it's for you. If you like puzzle games, you'll love this.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is Soo much fun and its even cooler to play on the kindle fire Cuz its a bigger screen than Ann ipod

0894803123|5.0|Simple, yet delicious recipes. I made six of their recipes the first week I purchased my ice cream machine and they have all been hits. You can also take their \\"base mixes\\" and do any number of things with them. The best part is that their base mix requires no cooking! I literally can make a little over a quart of ice cream from start to finish in a little over an hour. Great book that I highly recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has all kinds of cool stuff on it I got a ton of points its the best game in history all the cool choices. it is awesome I love it
B008CP93S0|5.0|Wanderlust was better than expected. There were some fantastic one liners and some very funny pieces--particularly if you know people who are into the whole intentional community thing. Kerri Kenney was just spot on and Alan Alda was great as usual.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|Even though it was the last of my items to be shipped it was the quickest to get here I love this Movie very Much! I'm Very Happy I bought this product
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is so fun! I always played normal solitaire but when I got the hang of it I was hooked!!!  I highly recommend this game!!!
0345803485|5.0|These were great books. I could hardly put them down.  Read all three in 5 days.  Erotic reading but also romantic.  Very different from most romantic books.  Will read again. Has a good story line.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My whole family enjoys this app. We compete to see who can get the farthest. It's great for teaching logic and reasoning, too.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. If you did not live in the south in the 50's and 60's you may not understand how it was back then. But this movie pretty much sums it up. There was a cultural difference in blacks and whites and this movie does it justice. And I'm sure there were worse things happening that was not shown, and I'm glad it wasn't.<br /><br />I thought all the girls/women that played the parts of the maids did a wonderful job, stayed in their place like they were suppose to back then. I can remember my aunt having a black maid and she was like one of the family, but that was my aunt's way.<br /><br />You really see a bad side of how they were treated in this movie and freedom like they've never known as an added bonus I thought which was for all the maids from back then. Please watch or buy this movie, I plan on watching it again and again.
0670023329|5.0|Every free person needs to read this book in order to better appreciate  the freedom we enjoy. Should be read in every high school.

0843189673|4.0|I picked this set because it was less per book than other ways of buying some from this series.  It was fun to give these away to friends, some who knew this series and others who did not.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fantastic book. I really enjoyed it. I can see how its not for everyone but its so erotic, suspenseful, dreamy, crazy. TEAM CHRISTIAN GREY! Im on the third book and it just keeps getting better!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I think we're all familiar with those who insist an American version of a movie is lesser than the original movie. I've not yet read the books, but my girlfriend has, and says that the American movie actually is closer to the book than the Swedish movie. I've seen both myself, and I will have to say that the American version certainly is NOT watered down. Trent Reznor's music is suitably expressive in this movie, and the actors play out their parts very well.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|Martin must have been in a trance when he wrote Book 5, I would advise anyone to skip the read. Purchased from amazon, never again.
0062068423|3.0|This story is a mix of old and new and leaps back and forth in the telling. Part war story, part crime fiction. The war story involves the Norwegian's fight against the Russians which leads up to the creation of a neo-Nazi movement in Oslo right around the turn of the 21st century.<br /><br />In the present day, Officer Harry Hole accidentally shoots a secret service agent and is given a \\"promotion\\" which basically means that he is assigned to a glorified desk job. However, when he realizes that the shell casings from that day appear to be from a weapon that is no longer around, he digs deeper and what he finds goes all the way back to WWII.<br /><br />The Redbreast is the third book in the series featuring Detective Harry Hole but it was not my first time meeting Harry. No, I started with book #5 The Devil's Star and have been reading them out-of-order ever since. The books are wonderful but they have been translated out-of-order which makes it impossible to read them in order. In fact, the first two books are not available anywhere so you make do with what you can get.<br /><br />However, the evolution of Harry as a person is what keeps me reading and I don't mind taking these trips back into his past to see how he started out. The latest books in the series seem tighter and more fast paced whereas the older books include quite a bit of set-up. The first half of The Redbreast was very slow and tedious for me, but once I passed the halfway mark I was in familiar territory and loving every minute.<br /><br />Nesbo's books contain a sophisticated air that I don't normally detect in American crime fiction. The tone is a bit different and although I can't quite put my finger on why, it works for me. If you enjoy well-written crime fiction, you cannot go wrong with this series. Even if you have to read them out-of-order.
B007XNAOS0|5.0|Yellow & Green is the third full-length studio album by the Savannah based Progressive/Sludge Metal band Baroness, it was released in the summer of 2012, produced by John Congleton and is a double disc album.<br /><br />Like the band's previous albums (and indeed some other Savanah based bands, including Black Tusk and Kylesa) the artwork was created by singer John Dyer Baizley. Furthermore, like the band's previous two albums Red Album and Blue Record, the discs are each given a colour theme.<br /><br />Both discs open with a musical intro-theme, one for each of the two colours. For example, the first track on disc one is `Yellow Theme' which is a brief instrumental piece using some of the notes and rhythms from later on the disc.<br /><br />Then, it bursts in with the ridiculously catchy single `Take My Bones Away,' which features brilliant melodic guitar lines and a memorable chorus, some keys and a brilliantly dynamic form where things build up, cut out, speed up, slow down and come in and out of effects loops. It may be shocking if you are caught off guard, but it's a phenomenal track that's every bit as memorable as `Teeth Of A Cogwheel' `Wanderlust' or `A Horse Called Golgotha,' if not more so.<br /><br />Everything about the album is just a little bit bigger and better than the previous two albums. The production job is fantastic, the songwriting is a little bit more distinctive, John Baizley's vocals have improved immensely and of course there is a full seventy-five minutes worth of music to enjoy this time around.<br /><br />You'd imagine that trying to absorb something so dense as a seventy-five minute album may be difficult, as with some other 70-80 minute albums, but the decision to both split the albums in two and also to lead with the more energetic stuff and let the second half hang back a bit more really works in keeping the listener's attention and gives you a logical pause point if you need one.<br /><br />Stylistically, the band have actually gotten pretty far away from Sludge at this stage, and in parts far away from Metal in general. Its way less heavy than their earlier stuff, so approach this album with caution if you only want that one type of sound from Baroness.<br /><br />Stylistically, there is a clear prog influence in as much as there are a lot of brilliant clean or acoustic sections, atmospheric background noises and touches of both synth and piano, as well as a few sections that center around multi-tracked vocals or chopped up passages (specifically `Psalms Alive').<br /><br />There are a lot of sounds and tones that the band have explored on previous albums and EPs used too, but there are certainly a lot of surprises and things you wouldn't expect. Over the course of the whole two discs there are a diverse range of musical styles, and yet although the album as a whole is their least heavy outing to date, it still sounds unmistakably like Baroness, since they've always had at least one foot in this musical direction.<br /><br />The great thing about the album is that while the album is more interesting as a result of the grander scope and prog influences, it is never obnoxiously difficult or overlong and a lot of effort has gone into still keeping the songs concise and easily digestible. Nor is it a rehash of anything that anyone else made, or any one set of genre tropes in particular, it is simply exciting and new music made by creative and talented individuals.<br /><br />Highlights include the hypnotic `Back Where I Belong,' which almost evokes the spirits of both modern-Radiohead and Gentle Giant without actually sounding like them, as well as the tracks `Sea Lungs' which has an almost `Knights Of Cydonia' by Muse-esque sound in parts, the somber `Mtns. (The Crown & Anchor)' and finally `The Line Between' which along with the `Green Theme' recalls something of Thin Lizzy in the guitar department. Understand however, this record doesn't sound like a collage of other band's work or anything,those musical references are only subtle hints put through the filter of the existing Baroness sound.<br /><br />Ever since the band offered this album up for streaming I wasn't able to stop listening to it and pre-ordered it pretty much instantly. It's an exciting sort of record that you can just listen to again and again, and have a new favourite track every time, as well as hearing bits of your old favourite track that you didn't pick up on the last time around.<br /><br />I already liked the band's previous work a lot but this album is an improvement on that again; it may bare little resemblance to them at their Sludgiest, but it is simply such a great album that this shouldn't be a problem to all but the strictest fans. In fact, if they only put out Yellow, it would still be an amazing album and the fact that Green is as good as it is really makes this a stand out release. Just listen to the beautiful `Strechmaker' if you need convincing that Baroness made the right decision.<br /><br />In summary; this is a superb album that has an awful lot to offer and one that is more instant than their previous work, but which also grows with repeat listens. If you are new to the band, I'd actually recommend that you try this album out first and work your way backwards, unless of course you only like heaviness and can't stomach anything clean, spacey or atmospheric. If you are already an existing fan and don't mind a little change in musical direction, I'd highly, highly recommend this album, its not something you want to miss out on.those musical references are only subtle hints put through the filter of the existing Baroness sound.<br /><br />Ever since the band offered this album up for streaming I wasn't able to stop listening to it and pre-ordered it pretty much instantly.

In fact, if they only put out Yellow, it would still be an amazing album and the fact that Green is as good as it is really makes this a stand out release. Just listen to the beautiful `Strechmaker' if you need convincing that Baroness made the right decision.<br /><br />In summary; this is a superb album that has an awful lot to offer and one that is more instant than their previous work, but which also grows with repeat listens. If you are new to the band, I'd actually recommend that you try this album out first and work your way backwards, unless of course you only like heaviness and can't stomach anything clean, spacey or atmospheric. If you are already an existing fan and don't mind a little change in musical direction, I'd highly, highly recommend this album, its not something you want to miss out on.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I started reading this book, I absolutely could not put it down! I got my whole office hooked on this trilogy.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Okay so this story line is kind of predictable, i really dont think im the only one that figured she would get pregnant and that they would get married and basically live happily ever after in there kinky twisted world, as i said before the love story in this book was what made me continue reading but as i got to this one i just couldnt read anymore, yes i finished the book and after there was a few chapters from christians pov night i actually wouldnt mind reading his books if there was any made from his side because hearing ana cry all the time about how scared and confused she is gets kinda boring when its in every book, like i said im here for the romance not the sex lol a big part of me likes this series but the other half is probably just as creeped out as everyone else is i mean come on its not everyday you find a book that has a hot guy in it with a sex room \\"red room of pain\\" lol whats weird is if the author made more books about ana and christian i probably would read them but at the sametime i would probably be bored because everything would repeat itself, i gave it four stars because at least the series ended no clifhangers or anything like that it just ended not that many books are like that..
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|The game was in perfect condition, easily installed, the game must be played while the CD is in the computer -- I'm glad I got the Alienware that had a CD slot!<br /><br />The game itself if the legitimate version of both games.<br /><br />Both games are on 1 CD so if you lose it... Well.. Dont!<br /><br />Other than that, enjoy hours upon hours of quality storyline and replaying all the scenarios

B00866H7SS|1.0|DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. READ 50 SHADES OF GREY INSTEAD (And if you already have don't bother with this because it will only frustrate you).<br />My problems with this book are:<br />1) It TRIED to be like 50 Shades of Grey, with the character's and event's shamelessly echoing their superior 50 Shades of Grey counterparts. There is literally NO originality. Further it's not even a good version, which was frustrating. The saving factor was that there was no mention of S&M which I thought was this books point of originality (i.e it wasn't a story of S&M but two twisted, abused people trying to find love). Unfortunately 1/2 way through Gideon reveals he's a dominant completely out of the blue and that's when you realize the authors riding the 'mommy porn' gravy train. S&M SHOULD have been left out.<br />2) Not much happens in the book that doesn't involve Gideon and Eva TOGETHER - there are practically NO events that occur where they aren't obsessing over each other. They argue, bonk, make-up; this cycle repeats over and over and over again. Even small events they attend together I kept hoping something would happen that involved other people but nothing, more than superficial conversations, occurred.<br />3) There were some REALLY interesting characters I wanted to see more of that didn't get to feature: Cary, Nathan, Christopher (Great villain but I wanted to know more!), even Magdalene (Who was a pretty terrible villain-what made her more interesting was the conversation her and Eva have at the event where Corrine is introduced. Now THAT Magdalena I want to know more of).<br />4) The 'torment' they both suffered wasn't really gone into. Apart from the sex all serious topics covered where only done so superficially (e.g. the feud between Christopher and Gideon, Gideon's abuse, Eva's need for boundaries).<br />It's hard to articulate now exactly why I didn't like this book mainly because I JUST finished reading it and I am VERY frustrated by how much of a rip off it was!

B0042RJWTC|5.0|This series is one of the best that has ever been made for television and it was great to watch all four seasons in sequence.  The cast members were superb, the costumes, the ambiance, everything was high class all the way.  I'm not sure of the complete historical accuracy of the show but what a great story!  Johnathan Rhys Meyers was excellent as the king and his performance never waivered from start to finish.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank Ocean's album \\"Channel Orange\\" is what R&B should be.  Its production is creative, the lyrics tell a good story, and Ocean has a good falsetto and soulful voice.  Too much R&B nowadays is generic and/or features uninteresting lyrics. The beats here are original sounding and ambitious, and the story telling here is atypical in urban music.  The story telling is more typical of what you'd hear on an indie rock record.<br /><br />From the start, I admired Ocean's talents as a singer and producer. Ocean is the only member of Odd Future whom I'm a fan of. I have mixed feelings about Tyler and the rest of the group. There's a lot of creative production in their work, but the sadistic lyrics spoil it (that's a whole other story).<br /><br />The style of \\"Channel Orange\\" is comparable to some of Prince's earlier work, in that its R&B music with beats and production that are unconventional.  A modern comparable work would be Drake's \\"Take Care\\" album. Like most of \\"Take Care\\", \\"Channel Orange\\" is always reflective and melancholy. There are no fun, upbeat, poppy songs here.  Sometimes the songs deal with love, sometimes with socioeconomic issues.  Vocally, Ocean follows the style of slow jam singers.<br /><br />I don't think there was a single song that I dislike on this album.  My favorite ones: \\"Thinkin Bout You\\", \\"Bad Religion\\", and \\"Forrest Gump\\" are ballads that reflect on relationships. \\"Super Rich Kids\\" tells the story of hedonistic, aimless rich kids. \\"Crack Rock\\" tells the story of drug-addled lady friend. \\"Pyramids\\" is probably the best song on the album. It is a 9 minute, guitar flavored track that probably mixes seven or eight different genres.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the album is slow and mellow throughout and could have had a few more upbeat songs.  Prince is an idiosyncratic R&B artist, and his 80s albums included lots of upbeat songs. Drake's album included several club tracks.<br /><br />To those who say that R&B is dead, this album proves you wrong.you wrong.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I often find myself disappointed after reading all the hype and critical reviews of a \\"great\\" new book.  Not this time!  The book is told in two voices, Nick and Amy, and each alternating chapter is imbued with enough character to know from whom you are reading.  I literally could not put this book down and read it in two days.  I dare you to read it and not get caught up in the superbly tangled web.  You will see familiar character flaws that you may recognize in yourself or others as you watch this marraige melt down.  I will say no more to avoid spoilers, but do yourself a favor and buy/borrow this book.

B004B32500|5.0|Jodorowsky's films EL TOPO and THE HOLY MOUNTAIN were recommended to me by another reviewer a few months ago. I realised then that one of his movie SANTA SANGRE, was on my list to buy for a very long time, Aside from the perfect rating made by Roger Ebert and the other good critics, the reviews here on Amazon convinced me that this was something special, something out of the ordinary, something worth seeing if you like movies, especially non-commercial movies. To be honest with you, it took me a very long time to understand what was going on in this film, the tone was serious and violent but at the same time it was also funny and sometimes loaded with dark satire, almost complete non sense sometimes, but everything finally came together and once it was over,  i was stunned!  Wait, what was that ? What is it that we've just seen...was that real? The 2nd time i watched it, i knew this was a cult classic, something unique, something way above your regular horror movie, or B movie or any other movie....<br /><br />Writing a plot summary for this film was way too complicated, almost impossible but here's what i found that made the more sense:It is the story of a young circus performer, his parents and his journey through life and what traumatised him as a kid in that circus. The young man, now older,gets confined in a mental hospital, which is how the movie starts. Through several flashbacks and old circus memories we can see what happened to him and his parents: he saw his father cut off the arms of his mother, a religious fanatic and leader of the heretical church of Santa Sangre (\\"Holy Blood\\"), and then commit suicide. Back in the present, the young man escapes the mental facility and rejoins his surviving and armless mother. Against his will, he \\"becomes her arms\\" and the two undertake a grisly campaign of murder and revenge. -Written in most part by Marty Cassady for IMDB Movie summary as I just couldn't find the right words for it, sue me!<br /><br />I know this plot summary sounds completely crazy, but the movie is still a Masterpiece. It goes through a whole set of different emotions and bizarre imagery while building an unexpected tension until the very end to finally explode in a spectacular finale which stills gives me goose bumps and figures in my most impressive horror story conclusion acts/scenes. The cinematography, the concept and the music are all amazing and were never tried before. This movie has a lot of ambition on its own, its violent, surreal, bizarre and sexual all at the same time. It is simply outstanding and probably one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. A grower, not for everyone but definitely deserves to be seen. The DVD also has a ton of special features including several interviews with Jodorowsky himself and a few documentaries about him, his work and his beliefs<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!ot summary sounds completely crazy, but the movie is still a Masterpiece.

B007SGM084|1.0|This is written like a bad Porn Flick. With repetitive sex. With repetitive sex. (oh did I repeat myself) It appears as though the author just did a lot of copy and paste with little or no imagination. The Story is weak at it's best and completely dissappears through out.

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|A tornado flew around our world in the summer of 2012.  They called it channelOrange.  The storm began with a poetic revelation and grew into a torrent of speculation and anticipation.  When the tornado finally hit, a week earlier than we expected, it upended long held notions of black maleness, mesmerized everyone in its path, and introduced a new musical star to the universe.  The man who unleashed the tornado is aptly named Frank Ocean.<br /><br />Start to End, chO is a raging musical and lyrical storm.  Once caught up, it's hard to escape.  Window-rattling bass, dreamy organs, and other stereophonic treats creep through the speakers and carry you off to a world of cheetahs, crack heads, and cotton candy.  Andre 3000 shows up to make us wonder why other rappers even bother.  Ocean's buttery vocals narrate the journey, and he consumes every juicy lyric down to the gristle.<br /><br />When he sings the chorus on Thinking About You (...I been thinkin' bout forever), or moves from pleasure to PLEASURE to PLEAsure on Pink Matter, or is brought to his knees by Bad Religion, you FEEL that shit.  Tears threaten when he sings the last few lines of Forrest  Gump: \\"This is love/I know it's true/I won't forget you.\\" You forget who he's singing to because you're nearly overcome by the love and pain in his voice.<br /><br />Echoes of Prince (Lost, Pilot Jones), Musiq Soulchild (Sweet Life), Curtis Mayfield (Sierra Leone), and D'Angelo (Crack Rock) ring through chO, but like any great artist Ocean takes what's old (everything) and makes it golden.  Hang out on the roof and listen to Ocean and Earl Sweatshirt pity Super Rich Kids, or spend 9 thrilling minutes with Cleopatra at the Pyramid to witness chO's devastation of the current musical landscape. Frank Ocean ain't playin'.<br /><br />On top of killing it musically, lyrically and vocally with chO, Ocean also whisks away all previous notions of what it means to be an RnB dude in the 21st C, i.e. one who pops no bottles, stacksno paper, and sees women in more than 1 dimension.  Like Stevie, Marvin and Donny Hathaway, Ocean is way wider and deeper than that, making thoughtful, finely crafted music that moves us inside and out.  And it just plain sounds good!<br /><br />On the flip, I would've added another uptempo mixtape track (maybe Whip Appeal or Dream Killa) to brighten the collection just a smidge, but that's an infinitesimal quibble.  When the tornado finishes raging, and the hype and muck have settled, channelOrange will still be running on our minds, boy. The music gets inside you and takes over, like love.  All you can do is close your eyes, fall into it, and let it give you pleasure.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I purchaed this book because it was on the \\"best sellers\\" list on my Kindle.<br />The writing style is easy to read and the author describes her characters well so that you know them and empathize with them early on.  However, the lead female character is presented as beautiful, innocent, well educated, and deprived of strong family ties.  Her mother has presented her with several step fathers and her mother does not come to her college graduation.  So the heroine is fragile emotionally.  The stomach turning part of this novel comes when she accepts whipping, beatings, humiliation and domination as part of her first intimate relationship.  I am also concerned that this venue is so popular.  Let's not go backwards in our society and become slaves to men again.  The villain gets away with his domination and beatings because he is so handsome and rich.

B007U1FEJE|4.0|If a little hyperbole is acceptable, than I would say this is an album by the Beach MEN, not Boys. It's the BB album I didn't think they'd ever be capable of making again, the one where there's a dollop of wistfulness and sadness thrown into the \\"fun, fun,fun,\\" and where those gorgeous harmonies have a slight tinge of age...but that only makes them more special. Oh sure, the title track, \\"Isn't It Time\\" and \\"Spring Vacation\\" all move with the deathless teen spirit usually expected from Mike Love's vantage point of the band. They aren't anachronistic and they bring a smile to the face, but it's what Brian Wilson and Al Jardine bring to the album that truly keeps you listening. That's especially true of the last three songs here, \\"From There To Back Again,\\" \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" and especially \\"Summer Is Gone,\\" as lovely and lonesome a song of time passing away as \\"Caroline No\\" was 46 years ago. THAT'S WHY GOD MADE THE RADIO feels like an album-sized suite about finding renewal, even as you age closer to \\"the end.\\" It's a great return to form, albiet with a tear in its eye.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Love the variety. The games are lots of fun. Well worth buying the deluxe version!! I would recommend this to friends and family.
030758836X|5.0|After reading all the hype about Gone Girl, I couldn't wait to get started. As luck would have it, we had a unbearable heat wave when this book arrived so I sat on my couch July 4 and read the entire book. I found the book to be extremely well written, crafty, genius, devious - a million things will run through your mind. Twists and turns, superbly written,thought provoking...really enjoyed the book. I admit the end had be a little deflated but still a huge fan of this book.

0345803485|2.0|I was lured in by the popularity and was disappointed. The writing isn't great, but I did enjoy the eroticism in the first book. There was less sex (to me) in the second book and therefore much less interesting. It's too predictable. Anastasia is damn annoying and babyish. As others comment, it is a straight up teenage fantasy in every way. It was hard to finish the second book.
B007KQ6XYY|2.0|please update the damn app for please, it starts to run and then drops to the loading screen. the app was updated awhile ago on the play store so what's the delay Amazon?
B006CHMRAG|5.0|Watch works great and seems to keep good time.  The size, quality, look, and feel of watch and the band are good and in keeping with the price.  This is my first self-winding watch and still learning how long I need to wear it as a minimum for it to have enough stored energy to make it thru the nite.  It has stopped before I wake a couple of times when I didn't wear it all day long the day before.  Would recommend it to others and would buy another one myself.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I hope there's a sequel! Love the characters. The story flowed nicely. It was a great distraction from my Fifty Shades withdrawals.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After all the hype I read the reviews on Amazon about this book.  I was warned it was erotic, etc, but thought maybe it had such a great storyline and since everyone was talking about it I'd give it a try.  I am an avid reader and I guess I have higher standards when it comes to a story.  This one was average in the storyline and the erotic parts just got to be too repetitive and too much.  I read about 75% of this book and have stopped.  It made me feel a bit gross to read it.  I know some see it as a guilty pleasure, and I'm by no means a prude, but I just felt like I was reading porn.  I think I could've overlooked all the repetitive stuff if the storyline were more compelling.  I told a friend that raved about all 3 books how I felt and she said the story gets better, so maybe it does in the rest of the trilogy.  I doubt I'll be reading those.  I may finish this one since I purchased it, but I can't see spending another $20 on the other 2 books.  I guess I feel there are better things to read and do with my time than read smut, and that's what I kept thinking as I read this book.
0312641893|4.0|Review featured on my blog, The Lost Dragonfly Chronicles<br /><br />Cinder is one of those books that you instantly fall in love with. When people ask why all I can think to say is because it's amazing. So let's hope I can say more than just that. The cover confused me a bit at first. I thought that the book had something to do with The Wizard of Oz because of the red shoe. Reading the title and summary I was excited to see it was a retelling of Cinderella. Cinder was my first futuristic book and I enjoyed it. The story was a crisp and innovating retelling of Cinderella.  I feel like even if you haven't read the original Cinderella, you would still enjoy this book, with how unique the book was.<br /><br />I enjoyed the setting and hearing about the eastern commonwealth. I think I would have liked more detail, but I did get to envision what it was like. I thought it was interesting to see that there was civilization on the moon. The world really changed in the book and the possibility of it happening in real life is scary. It seemed that the world was at peace, but the sickness and the constant worry of a war with lunar would not be a world I would want to live in. Also the overcrowding, with people practically living on top of each other would not be appealing.<br /><br />Cinder was a likeable character, but not my favorite. Her interaction with Iko was my favorite thing to read. I loved the junkyard scene and the \\"clunker\\" they found. I did enjoy how Cinder evolved in this book and really grew into finding out what she really was. Her strength was beautifully written and her courage was admirable. I loved that she was outspoken, even with a prince, and would do things most people wouldn't dare do.<br /><br />I have to admit that I liked that one stepsister was nice. I did wish the mean one had gotten sick, but the storyline with peony just made the book deeper. Even though Iko wasn't a main character, she is probably my favorite in the book. I loved that she was an android that wanted to go to balls, talked about shopping and boys, and liked pretty things. Her \\"personality glitch\\" is not a mistake in my book.<br /><br />The plague was an interesting part in the book. To find out how the plague was started and how to get a cure was shocking. I found myself grossed out at one point in this book because of it. The way the medic-droid acted towards those sick was just sad and slightly disturbing.<br /><br />I was not fond of the ending. I felt like it was to short and very rushed. I would think you wouldn't give such vital information and then end the book. I didn't like that it ends on such a major cliffhanger and life changing moment. I just hope that the next book, Scarlet, gives some answers.  Cinder was really good, I didn't expect all the twist and turns that happened. Some that were very heart aching for me. I can't wait for Scarlet and the Lunar Chronicles to continue.

0345803485|5.0|I heard about the book on Dr. Oz TV show and how it helped women in menopause.  I was curious and bought book number one and have now read all three.  WOW!  I know most women are probably buying this book for the sex but it was so much more for me.  My husband has many personality traits of Christian Grey and when I read how Ana or Dr. Flynn responded to his behaviors I tried some out on my tempermental and stubborn husband.  Our marriage has taken a 180 degree turn for the better.  We are now communicating so much better and our house is so much less tense.  Yes, our sex life has improved too but I will always be Grateful for Grey because it has improved our marriage soooo much.
B003Y5D776|2.0|This device, despite the description, does NOT have 1/4 inch jacks.

B008BYXQJY|5.0|I wouldn't consider myself a huge Maroon 5 fan, but this album blew me away the very first time I listened to it. The enjoyment of music is very subjective, and I will go from loving something to having a \\"what was I thinking\\" moment in a short time.  So to make sure my opinion wasn't based solely on one listen, on one experience, I listened again and again and again. It only got better. This album is a little darker than previous ones, but it is really well done.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|VERY poorly written, repetitive, and juvenile.  With all the hype about the book, I really expected a lot more.  God forbid they should actually make a movie about this book... it'd be extreeemly boring.  Being a mature person, the sex pages don't really surprise or intice me... pretty pedestrian.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|These stories caught be by surprise!  The plot and the characters are very interesting and I am yearning for more! The short, but exciting chapters are very engaging.  Even though the plot involves a dystopian world, the author keeps it from being depressing by focusing on personal lives and action.  The strong female character is awesome.  This is a must-read for sci-fi fans.
B007WE6REA|4.0|Jacqui Naylor is one of the best jazz stars around. She has a unique characteristic style and has evolved greatly over time. Lucky Girl would seem like a documentary about the making of her album of the same name. It is and it isn't.<br />  Lucky Girl, the film, shows Naylor as reflected by those around her. They include her first music teacher, her band, her husband, and the engineers behind the album. Intermixed throughout are segments and live performances. The photography is sometimes beautiful, but doesn't stand out.<br />  The film is far from a standard \\"making of\\" film. When talking to people you find out how they met Naylor and what effect she has had on them. Rarely do you see Naylor in the studio. You do get some glimpses of songwriting but the film is not a step by step of how the album is made.<br />  Lucky Girl is designed for fans of Naylor. There is no introduction to either Naylor or to Jazz to set things off. It is assumed you know what you're getting into. If you're a fan of Naylor, and you should be, it is well worth the money to get to see more of her world and the people who make it up.

B006JPS1OM|5.0|its a mysterious. game I thought it was going to be boring but not really so if you like adventure that's the game for you
B006LSZECO|2.0|I loved this book up until the end.  Loved the suspense, how Amy weaves her web, and Nick never had a clue until it was too late.  How Amy was able to manipulate everything around her.  I figured out what had happened about 20-30 pages before it was revealed, but that didn't matter, I had to know how Nick was going to get out of it, what Amy was going to do.  I gave it 2 stars because the ending was absolutely horrible!!!  It left me unfulfilled, like there really wasn't an ending.

B002BFBAWO|5.0|yes i recive my item and am very pleased that it arrived on time and im enjoying it very much thanks
B007UW9VWO|2.0|First, the treatment of the subject from a visual perspective was quite well done - like the food network on Japanese acid. 2 solid, o-toro stars for that. As to the rest...<br /><br />Jiro is an exercise in ego-inflation for a man who has sacrificed his friends, family and customers to his art...and in the process has created a unique reputation as a Sushi Master (Taisho), and Shokunin (Artisan) extraordinaire.<br /><br />Jiro is the ultimate \\"eye\\" and \\"mind-candy\\" for pretentious westerners, and high-end, fawning Japanese who all are keenly aware that they prefer status over Omotenashi (hospitality) Spirit...over Jingi (chivalrous behavior) and essentially the most basic form of etiquette. In Jiro's world, he doesn't exist to serve, or even connect to his customers. Rather, they exist for him. And not in the Howard Roark (\\"I have clients in order to build\\") sort of way. Jiro is at the end of the day, a one-track and one-trick pony, master of a stifling, uncomfortable, patriarchal, dictatorial environment which Gai Jin would naturally worship...unless they understood Japan from the inside out.<br /><br />A \\"Mr. Miyagi\\" for a new generation of Americans...finally, they realize...sushi isn't a spicy tuna handroll...NO...it's a 65 dollar bite size piece of tuna served by a pissed off 83 year old man! I look forward to the \\"Jiro-style\\" copycats which will soon open all over New York and LA. (aside from the ones that have or already exist - Nozawa, Urasawa, etc)<br /><br />The directors here missed the mark in offering zero criticism, or even a critical eye on Jiro. At least not intentionally. Bottom line, this is a glossy, obsequious commercial for a man who is not deserving of half the praise being showered on him. My sense is that Jiro has never learned the concept of proportionality and neither have the directors of this documentary. You can see it in the aesthetics of his restaurant, the way he treats his children...his friends...and life itself - and in the wonderful cinematography that screams \\"wow - shiny happy sushi!\\" to the audience.<br /><br />Jiro is a quite brutal man in many way, brutal to himself and others all for the sake of that singular aspect of the Samurai spirit (Kaizen) that he clings to, while disregarding all the rest. One just need look at his son's faces to recognize the mess that this man has made of their self-esteem and essentially - their lives. And to his wife...oh...we never get to meet her but we can imagine can't we. Jiro follows one half of Zen Buddhist Shunryu Suzuki's admonition about \\"burning oneself up\\" in one's career but he has forgotten or ignored the rest. If you're familiar with the story of Musashi...what Jiro needs is a monk to hang him from a tree for 3 days or so (well not now, but about 40 years ago).<br /><br />Not for the sake of humility - no. I can admire a perfectionist and a great artisan/master in any craft. Jiro is a machine who would be the ultimate work of art (and this is what I initially thought) if not for the fact that he has burned up those around him to fuel his own internal fire. He is a man who sacrifices others to himself, and along the way lost something so essential to Japan, to food, to the culinary experience that I am afraid that he is the opposite of what these filmmakers strived to illuminate - that is...Jiro is not a hero. And while he does dream sushi, he does not understand the connection between a wonderful meal, and life itself. He only understands the single act of eating, tasting and then...get the f-out. He is, at the end of the day, a performer first...and a chef second. And so this film was the perfect medium to see Jiro in all his glory, if you can call it that.<br /><br />The most telling scene for me was the unacceptably rude and humiliating treatment received by a far-away visitor to the restaurant - by Jiro's son, no less. That moment summed up the whole film for me. The anger and pain within Jiro's son, along with false PRIDE in essentiallyanother man's life and accomplishments transmitted as a slap in the face to an eager patron...what a ruin of an existence...more than living in a shadow...\\"living within the shadow\\" is more like it...<br /><br />Next time you're in Japan...go to the Tsukiji fish market, and have an unforgettable 35-60 omakase lunch and leave Jiro, his biographers and friends to their 600 dollar a head experience.<br /><br />Bottom line - this film is lacking significant objectivity, and will leave you mesmerized by the beauty of Jiro's work. And if you're a little sharp, it will also leave you horrified at the means with which he achieves it.another man's life and accomplishments transmitted as a slap in the face to an eager patron...what a ruin of an existence...more than living in a shadow...\\"living within the shadow\\" is more like it...<br /><br />Next time you're in Japan...go to the Tsukiji fish market, and have an unforgettable 35-60 omakase lunch and leave Jiro, his biographers and friends to their 600 dollar a head experience.<br /><br />Bottom line - this film is lacking significant objectivity, and will leave you mesmerized by the beauty of Jiro's work.

B003B96AOW|5.0|This Deadpool figure comes fully loaded with weapons and an awesome display base! He comes with his 2 trademark swords which can be stashed on his back (Awesome!) 2 pistols (hip holsters) 2 sai daggers (no stash place, no bueno) and an M16 assault rifle. On his details are super cool! Hes a good size compared to most other Deadpool figures. His articulation could be better, but for the rest of the figure being so awesome it's hard to be disappointed w this one. He could be great as a kids toy to play with and for collectors like goes great with the rest of your collection. His display base resembles an alley with bullet holes in the wall behind which he stands. Bullets shells on the ground an grenades on the ground as well. This Deadpool is a MUST have for Marvel Select, Deadpool fans or collectors. Another great job done by Diamond Select!

B004FQX59I|5.0|Look, I am not a liberal or a conspiracy nut, and yes, Stone's film blurs the lines between fact and fantasy, between speculation and evidence. I have no love for Oliver Stone, and I feel he has a track reccord of playing fast and loose with details to suit a political agenda. I sort of see him as the Howard Zinn of film making; that is not a compliment.    However, with that as a caveat, I think it is also fair to assume that JFK was never intended to be 100 percent factually based. Rather, it was an effort ( and a darn successful one in my view ) to point out how many holes there are in the \\"official\\" narrative of what supposedly took place that horrible day in Dallas.    Some people say that Walter Cronkite panned this film. So what? I could give a rats you-know-what about his opinion. In fact, if Cronkite didn't like it that tells me we may just be on to something here.    So many questions left unanswered, but here is one issue that truly puzzles me: It is the height of the cold war, JFK is in hostile territory politically speaking (Texas) , and he is riding in an open top limo down streets lined with highrise buildings. Are you kidding me? What, did they WANT him to be shot? Some would say the answer is yes.    I don't know what really happened that day any more than you do. I do, however, recall my dad saying right after the assasination,\\" Why the hell did he (JFK) have the top (of the limo) down?\\" My dad was a WWII vet with an eighth grade education. If HE was asking that question, you really have to wonder how JFK's security team could have screwed things up that badly by putting the president in such an obviously vulnerable position. Kennedy was a sitting duck, and it is very hard to believe all the professional secret service and law enforcement people assigned to protect him didn't know that all too well. It raises MANY red flags.    A great movie.
0345803485|1.0|Many people have written about the book itself. I don't need to say the same thing again.<br /><br />I got the book without reading the reviews because I knew it was popular with teenage girls. Luckily, I previewed it first. I can understand an audience of young women wanting to read an introduction to relationships, especially if the characters are immature enough that the reader can recognize herself in the character. But there are enough girls and young women accepting abuse of all sorts in the hope that the man will change. In my opinion it is nothing but criminal to put this message in a book aimed at this age group. Young women should be told that they do not need to put up with abuse. They should not hope to change an abuser.<br /><br />The central message to this series is damaging to those who read it. I think it should be avoided at all costs.
B007B5EDEG|3.0|A book that I'm enjoying thoroughly and am glad to have all books in one. Great read.<br />The characters are intriguing and compelling. I want  to read more and more. Sometimes I don't want to continue because of the plot but then I don't want to put it down.

0307730697|5.0|If you can read only one book this year, let it be this one!<br /><br />Eric Blehm has written a wonderful tribute to fallen Navy Seal Team Six Operator, Adam Brown. Once I started reading about Adam, I couldn't put the book down. Adam lived life to the fullest. Even as a child, he showed determination and daring beyond his peers.<br /><br />Adam's story is one of courage, steadfastness, love, devotion, and plain old stubbornness. He was willing to go above and beyond the call of duty in every aspect of his life. He volunteered for the toughest jobs, even those that seemed foolish. If there was a job that needed to be done or a dare in the air, Adam was the first to volunteer. His extreme living took a toll on his body, but he never gave up striving to reach the next goal.<br /><br />Even with all his toughness, he was a loving husband and father; gentle and thoughtful. He was a role model for his fellow soldiers and the Afghan children he served.<br /><br />The only thing that came close to conquering Adam's spirit was his craving for drugs. But once he turned his life over to God, and with the help of his wife, family, and friends, he was able to conquer even the demon of drug addiction.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about one of God's and the United States' heroes. I was awe struck by the sheer grueling training the Seals undergo on a daily basis. I can understand why they are some of the United States' finest.<br /><br />I received a copy of Fearless from WaterBrook Press.
034580404X|1.0|The content didn't really bother me, although even that got boring.

0345803485|1.0|I just had to see what the hype was all about - what a waste of time and money. The skill level of the writing seems to be as that of a teenager, the characters are minimally fleshed out (cynically I believe, so as the reader can imagine themselves in the role of the protagonist), the plot is basically non - existent, and the sex, well the sex is pretty vanilla. At one rather salacious point I actually started laughing - not the desired effect, I'm sure. The really disappointing part is that you can see the potential of this book, if only it had a great writer. If you want to read this book, borrow it, otherwise you'll just be disappointed. On the plus side, if you have a habit of chewing on your lip, reading this book will break it!

0307352145|5.0|I think many people who are introverted walk around thinking that they're just not good enough or lacking something because they don't light up a room when they walk into it or don't exude confidence and control when giving a presentation.  This book tell us exactly why this is wrong.  First, our culture has converted from one that focused on character to one that focuses on personality.  This occurred near the end of the 19th century, as consumerism began to grow as a result of the success of the industrial revolution.  What became important was not substance but style.  We all needed to become salespeople, not only of products, but of ourselves.  Needless to say this type of environment was not one where introverts, who tend to like solitude, quiet and introspection, could thrive.  The big men on campus became the big men on campus - the outgoing, backslapping, people persons.  The rest of us would feel as if we were second best.  Not so, says the author because introverts have a lot to offer - they are the ones who come up with innovative and creative ideas because these are more likely to come in introvert environments; introverts can be better leaders because they are more cautious and take more perspectives into accounts, for example.  So if you are an introvert, stop feeling bad about yourself because you're not the life of the party or a charismatic speaker; instead, feel good about yourself because of all you have to offer.
B006X3ALFC|3.0|John Barth speculated in 1967 that 'it may well be that the novel's time as a major art form is up'. Prose, printed prose, he called in any case 'almost an aberrant way of telling stories' (though he roguishly concedes 'one way to handle such a feeling might be to write a novel about it'). Can Franzen's tumescent novel of ideas for the 21st century prove him wrong? Nope. It scores 2.5 recurring - and one of those marks is for effort (mine)<br /><br />It's not all bad.<br />' \\"I'm not going to be the person who wrecks my best friend's marriage.\\"<br />  \\"No! God! Of course not!\\" She was nearly weeping with disappointment. '<br /><br />But then we get this: ' ****, seeing himself through ******'s eyes, couldn't bear the uncertainty in his own face. ' Say again?<br /><br />Is this chicklit, written by a fella? His men are totally unbelievable - \\"It's good to cry,\\" Richard said, \\"although I can't say I've ever tried it myself\\" - but no, it's not, because his women, comic or serious, carry conviction (to a man!) plus there's some prime satire on page 200; chicks don't do satire, right? The muscle power's impressive - a more nuanced Balzac without the turgid scene-setting. I'm no fan of Balzac ('prosaic straightforwardness.. is characteristically duplicitous' (Barth again) or more simply, 'realism' is an unconvincing trick); this, though, I can read, as I pick my way between all the negative copy you've posted and the seven absurd puffs on the back cover<br /><br />If Franzen's trying to make his characters loathsome, he succeeds. Your average head-in-the-sand optimist will cast this impatiently aside, while your realist will say 'We know this, dude; lighten up'. 'A masterpiece', the New York Times informs us. Of what? By the 400s we're wondering if it's soap, saga or soft porn. '[The check] had the curve of her ass and was impregnated with her ass's sweat.' I don't think so. Do asses sweat? (Horses don't count.) By the mid-400s it's cheesy grand opera - sex scene succeedssex scene ('she was a bottomless well of anguished noise', p467) with diminishing returns - then bedroom farce, then, well, farce. '[H]e did finally come, without fanfare, in her hand.. She pursued him on her knees. \\"I just want to see you. I'm so greedy for you\\".. He rushed around his desk to put his arms around her, but she escaped to the outer office.' No escape for the reader, alas. But did you notice the two 'arounds'? Obviously Franzen's editor didn't. Thank heaven we were spared the fanfare! As for that 'braying' comedy Englishman on p425/6, doesn't Franzen realise that it is Americans who are now the international loudmouths, specifically New Yorkers; they may not bray - but they don't 'arf quack. (Though our restaurants are louder; we get raucous in our cups.) Franzen ups the ante in the dense - rather Balzacian, in fact - Mistakes Were Made section near the end, but by then it's too late<br /><br />Who is Franzen writing FOR, the Brooklyn claque aside? A fan refers to his 'remarkable vocabulary'. As compared with whom? Is this perhaps a heavy read for light people? As a borderline depressing page-turner it would make a sobering beach read; literature it ain't. We get 'concealing her own inner turmoil' - that's as opposed to flaunting who else's? - a 'tiny sliver of hope' - rather than what other size, exactly? - and the tautological carcrash of 'the first austral early light of morning'. Don't they have creative writing classes for this kind of thing? Yet in the modest personal disclosures of The Discomfort Zone Franzen showed he can write really engagingly (and carefully, and modestly, and with humour) when he chooses. Ah me.. I wonder where John Barth goes to seek bedside solace

Even though it took years Dominique and her family were able to weather through it and come out on top and have a happy ending. It takes courage to put a book out there about your life, not knowing how it's going to be viewed. Dominique rose above and met the challenge head on.<br /><br />The part of the story that touched me the most was finding out she had a secret sister. Being the oldest out of three girls myself, I would have been shocked beyond belief also if I found out 20yrs later about one of my sisters. Very inspirational book. Definitely well worth the read.

B00013F38K|5.0|When you think of the great TV westerns of television most people would probably think right off the bat shows like \\"Gunsmoke\\", \\"Bonanza\\" or \\"The Big Valley\\" or a host of other westerns that can be found now on ME TV. But there was one western that was sooooo different then all the others. So unique and original that brought westerns to a new level. That show was \\"Kung Fu\\". Starring the late David Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine the show introduced eastern philosophy to the west as well as showing them the martial art form of Kung Fu. It certainly made for an interesting confrontations every week on the show between the rugged individualistic shoot now and ask questions later cowboy against the mild mannered Shaolin priest with his different ways. Talk about a clash of cultures!<br /><br />But that is way \\"Kung Fu\\" was and still is one of my personal all time favorite TV shows. There had never been nothing like it before and nothing like it since. (Unless you count the \\"Kung Fu: The Legend Continues\\" series that was on TV back in the '90s and starred David Carradine) While to story lines could be fairly predictable they could still leave viewers glued to the set watching how Caine lived and reacted to this new land that was so vast and so different from the world he knew in China. At the same time Caine would change how the west saw him and understand the principals he lived his life by. Throughout it all Caine would have flashbacks as events occurred reminding him of simular events that occurred to him when he was back in China at the temple. These flashbacks helped Caine to deal or at least understand the situation he was facing at that moment. And then of course there was the fighting. Not your typical barroom brawls either like you see in westerns but fighting moves with kicks, throws, punches and chops. One of the best parts of the show was seeing how these rough tough cowboys reacted as they started fighting this skinny \\"Chinaman\\" who didn't look like he could punch his way out of a wet paper sack only to find themselves on the ground wondering what just hit them.<br /><br />In addition to Carradine the other stars of the show included Philip Ahn as Master Khan, Keye Luke as Master Po and Radames Pera as Caine as a young boy (aka \\"Grasshopper\\"). The show usually attacted some great guest star appearences as well including Jim Davis, Gregory Sierra, Roscoe Lee Browne, Gary Bussy, Chief Dan George and a very young Jodie Foster are among them. Of coarse if you are a fan of this show there is no need to recommend you get this box set of season 1 (or season 2 or 3 for that matter). You may already have it or planning on getting it. But for those of you who don't know of this series or where too young at the time to watch it when it was on then consider getting this. Especially if you love a TV show that is not like anything else on television. I think you will find you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The picture quality is very good. I don't know if it has been remastered while going from tape onto disc but I have no complaints. Also I read a couple of reviews for this where the reviewer said the pictures had been cropped to widescreen. Why anyone would do that to something that was specifically made for television makes no sence to me but I can say that my copy of season 1 appears in normal screen format. It does sound like if you are going to purchase yourself a copy of season 1 you will want to make sure how the picture has been formatted.<br /><br />Season 1 is short compaired to the other two seasons. The first season was only 15 episodes but it does include the pilot movie that helped get the series started.

B0074MZSWW|2.0|First off, that's a woman singing...? Oh. Second of all, listening to this album was a frustrating experience for me. The first few tracks start the album off strong, but then you've got a cluster of tracks toward the middle which sound virtually the same. I've got no qualms with hearing one lumbering throwback pop melody here and there, but five in a row is excessive. This band has definite potential, but I'm disappointed with the way they chose to structure this debut. Less repetition and more variety, please.

0767836324|5.0|In this film Robin Williams stars as Peter Banning, an adult who grew up and has forgotten what's important.  His kids try to play with him and do things as children do, but he is too grown up to remember.  Peter and his two children Jack and Maggie as escorted to Neverland to help Peter remember what's important in life.  While resistant at first, eventually he does remember how to have fun and enjoy simple things.  He becomes closer to his family as a result of doing so.  Would highly recommend.  Happy thoughts.
B008645YEE|5.0|*Note: I have officially changed this review's rating from 4 stars to 5. Reason? I bought the Amazon, iTunes, and physical store bought CD version because all 3 have different bonus tracks. Does that seem like I'm welcoming a ploy by distributors to get screwed out of $30? Maybe. Fact is, I'm privy to the trick and have absolutely no problem throwing down on this particular product. Turns out, I made the best decision possible because the best track on any of the three albums is the bonus track \\"No Stone Unturned\\". Additionally, three of my favorite 6 tracks of TDKR are bonuses. My decision has been vindicated and my rating for this overall album just went from 4 stars to a strong and solid 5 stars. Amazing stuff.*<br /><br />I won't give you a track by track breakdown, simply because I genuinely think people absorb music individually and differently. But I will say that after listening to the entire album, straight through, without having seen the movie or knowing the plot (other than my knowledge of the comics and what I've seen in the trailer) I have this to say:<br /><br />Clearly there is some serious business going down in this movie. The sheer force of the music is overwhelming, intimidating, and completely indicative of the stakes. Whereas the battle between chaos and order for Gotham were on the line in TDK, TDKR must be returning to Begins territory: an unequivocal struggle of two unbelievably powerful forces (Bane and his army vs. Batman and, for his sake, his) with nothing less than the very life of Gotham in the balance.<br /><br />This is my only assumption having just heard Zimmer's soundtrack. It is that powerful. It screams desperation, mourning, power, anger, and finality.<br /><br />Any Nolan Batman or Hans Zimmer fan must have this album.<br /><br />Is it better than Begins or TDK? I don't know yet. I probably would not say so right now. If for no other reason than the fact that Hans has subtly shifted the tempo and instrumentality of the signature two-note rising crescendo horn Batman motif (I'm officially calling it Bale's Batman theme) as well as the sweeping heroic and pulsing action Batman themes easily recognizable in Begins (Molossus) and TDK (Introduce A Little Anarchy, and especially A Dark Knight). This may or may not be intentional but I don't love it. It feels different in a way that I'm not quite welcome to. I'm guessing that watching the film may change this feeling.<br /><br />**Note #2: What I was really listening for to put this album above Begins and TDK was this: a synthesis of Bane's music, Catwoman's music, and Batman's signature heroic themes as well as cues from previous tracks Molossus and A Dark Knight, along with some evolutions of those signatures to really round out the finality of Batman's journey. The standard 15 tracks, seemingly, did not contain those specific things and thus seemed disjointed and unfulfillinf in a \\"truly great album\\" kind of way. I didn't want these because I'm some music stickler. It's because those elements, coming from Hans Zimmer, would make me feel things that one can only feel with truly great music. As it turns out, after buying all three versions and listening to the album straight through again 3 more times, Hans actually did bring it. No Stone Unturned, Risen from the Darkness, The End, Rise, and Imagine the Fire all bring it. And they bring it in big ways. This is officially the best soundtrack of the trilogy. And it is a truly great, all-time, 5 star type album, when listened to, in entirety, with all bonus material. Hans, if you're reading this, I apologize for underestimating you. And album distributors, if you're reading this, go self-fornicate with a steel spiked rod for making me doubt the Zimmer by spreading the best tracks across multiple albums so that I had to engage in a Horcrux hunting adventure just to get to the best stuff. End rant.**<br /><br />In any case, the album is well worth getting and listening to straight through a few times.<br /><br />Enjoy The Dark Knight Rises. If it delivers the way most believe it will, then it will almost undoubtedly go down as the end of the single greatest crime drama, superhero franchise, and possibly greatest film trilogy of all time (yes, that includes the Godfather, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars).<br /><br />P.S. Bane's Earth shattering chant: De-shey, de-shey, ba-sha-rah, ba-sha-rah = \\"He rises, he rises\\" in Morrocan Arabic.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is rare, an app that does what it says, and works as a stand alone just as it is. The Pro version is great, but the FREE version is completely functional and completely works! It provides clear information that you don't have to dig for, and that information is relevant to what you are doing. I wish all apps were written this way!<br /><br />OK, so what does it do? It tells you how your battery is doing and projected drainage based on application types (ie...your battery will run 4 hours in video mode while lasting 20 hours as a Kindle, or 5 days on standby). Simple and perfect!
0792164903|5.0|While this film is slightly darker than most others I watch it was very enjoyable.  Depp stars as Ichabod Crane who is investigating headless horseman.  While this film was a bit too much for me as it has a fair amount of bloody scenes, I still enjoyed it.  Depp investigates all deaths in this story to find out who is controlling the headless horseman, all the while falling in love with Katrina Von Tassel.  I would recommend this film, but also caution it at the same time.  A must see.
0385344228|5.0|This is a \\"mind\\" novel, not a high-action, high-tension thriller, but it's a page-turner just the same. Landay's writing is impeccable, his characterization is phenomenal, his use of writer's tricks is masterful. It was wonderful to simply turn off my editor side and enjoy a gripping, exquisitely crafted novel.<br /><br />Readers will love it, writers should study it.
0385534639|4.0|Comparisons to Rowling, Gaiman, & Clarke puzzle me: all were more artful and, um, \\"colorful\\".  No Faerie here.  I found elements of \\"The Circus of Dr. Lao\\", a smattering of Pullman, a bit of Bradbury.  Criticisms about flat characterizations are well-founded, but I can appreciate a story that gets my own imagination going.  There is an interesting mind at work here, and some of the shortcomings (if we are unwilling to overlook them) are in the editing. The black and white are ink on paper, and the circus wins the adoration of those who \\"red\\" it.  I will read it again, and can imagine that it will appeal greatly to a slightly less-seasoned reader.
B00008L3U1|5.0|This movie features Robin Williams starring as Jack, a boy who ages at four times the normal rate.  While his body looks like he's forty, he's really only 10.  When I saw him in this film I though he was very convincing.  I've never seen anybody else be able to pull off what Robin Williams does.  Because he appears to be so much older, it's harder for him to make friends.  I would recommend this film.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|sometimes tedious but definitely worth while.  You have to stick with it for max benefit.  save it for future reference.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book takes you on a journey of one woman who could be anybody. We all have something to learn from this book and from Ms. Moorjani. She is an extraordinary inspiration to all.
B000Z8GZYW|4.0|Bill Murray stars in this film called Groundhog Day.  The choices he makes turn out to be the wrong ones, so when he wakes up over and over again it's always Groundhog day.  Eventually he learns and discovers things and that leads him to making the choices he should have made all along.  I thought it was a good movie, as we all have things we wish we could do over again, but rarely do we ever get the chance to.  Would recommend for a good time.
030758836X|5.0|This is honestly one of the best books I've read in a long time. I read this book in three days. I couldn't put it down! I loved the twists and turns in it and I am actually sad that it's over and I finished reading it. That is how you know a book is good. Stop reading reviews and just READ IT!
B00821OW8K|3.0|Maybe it picks up, I hope so. The first episode was very overly sentimental for a first episode. It reminds me of the original Batllestar Galactica, vs the faster paced Star Wars. They need to develop the chars before we can care too much. The way they did this just seems very cliche.
630587493X|5.0|Robin Williams stars in this film as Andrew the robot.  As named Andrew by his family, he progresses and learns things just as anybody else would.  However, after witnessing the deaths of the people he cares for, he decides he wants to become human.  And in the process he comes across somebody to help him with his wish.  He wants to be deemed a human but is told he cannot because he was made as a robot and will always be thought of as such.  Eventually he has blood infused into his system, which is when he starts to age.  I did greatly enjoy this film and would highly recommend it for any Robin Williams fan.
B00782O7IY|5.0|ALRIGHT! Before some people go around attacking me for rating this 5, let me make a few things clear: whose not a film critic, just a movie fanatic, and is in his 20's?<br /><br />BOOM! THIS GUY!<br /><br />The Artist is not the movie i wouldve picked to win best picture 2011(harry potter 7 part 2, my best winner in case ur wondering), but the movie, even as a black and white silent film, is anything but stupid. The movie taking place in the 1920's, the long finished era of silent movies, follows George Valentin who is a silent film superstar who enjoys his life in the kind of movie world he revels in, but has time moves forward, a new era of movies is born: movies with people that talk(ya, ya! stating the obvious lol). George feels the talking movie generation is a bad joke that people arent going for, and then a new actress Peppy Miller, who is actually introduced in the early going of the movie, is the new face of the talking movie industry.<br /><br />The intro of the talking era pretty much sends George into self-destruction, and the movie makes u sympathize with his issue, becuz the world around him he once knew is slowly falling away, his wife files for divorce(loveless marriage anyways, so who gives a rip), he soon fires his agent. It just sucks what happens. I wont give anything on the outcome of this, but i will say what happens toward the end of the artist did hit me hard.<br /><br />My suggestion if ur on fence of watching this is to just rent or buy like I did. Again, Im just a movie fanatic who gave this a 5 becuz i really did enjoy the movie, and i still enjoy those other cool movies we get like the avengers, the batman movies, all that good stuff. Any naysaying comment i get on this is just telling me the naysayer is superficial, and cant even bother giving this at least 1 chance. So what if its B&W? Its a damn movie!! I would say not to attack my review if u dont agree with my opinion of the movie, but if u dont agree with my thoughts, well what thehell are u doing reading this anyways?!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Awesome puzzle game. Starts easy and gets very challenging. There are 100's of puzzles, so this game will keep you occupied for a long time.
B006ZGDC26|5.0|f inally someone release the philly sound great artists and great writers and producers. some many made music on  the label  like the jacksons patti  labell lou rawls.their own artists billy paul jones girls mfsb list go on thanks gamble& huff.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My grown daughter gave me her DVD of \\"Courageous\\" to watch.  The film is incredibly touching, brave and \\"spot on\\" with what so many families are lacking.  I returned the film to my daughter and ordered two more--one to keep, and one to give away.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I particularly liked this bit of non-fiction.  Some very interesting thought material in here.  The whole business about the rats and how they formed habit was interesting.  Nothing earth shattering here, but a really good read.  The author stays away from pop -feel good psych and just sticks to the knitting of how and why habits are formed.  At the least the author proves how and why habits form such a huge part of our lives.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun and I just cant stop playing it. I love getting new games and getting a bunch of coins
B007L3BMGA|2.0|After all the hype I expected so much more. Disappointing story line on the whole and no depth. A 'fluffy' easy read but nothing that gets the reader thinking. It was really just pron in a new genre (written rather than visual)and there was so much of it that the sexual exploits of the main characters ended up taking away from the plot - the reader just becomes desensitized to all the sex after a while. This could have been a reasonable narrative but half the book was devoted to telling the story and the other half was just detailed #######.
0553386794|4.0|I generally lose interest in epic fantasy novels, due to the habit most writers in the genre seem to have of including WAY too much dialogue about nothing, repeating the same ideas, concepts, and emotions again and again, simply for the sake of filling up a few extra hundred pages. For the most part, Martin does a great job of avoiding that pitfall. Although there is a ton of dialogue in this novel, most of it is actually quite interesting, and it likewise serves as legitimate character development and plot advancement. It still got a little slow for me toward the middle, but overall, this is a great ambassador for the genre. It's intelligent, deeply layered, and written with a gifted hand. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" starts strong, and finishes REAL strong. Looking forward to the next one.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This CD is full of some great Springsteen music.  My favorites are:<br /><br />1.  American Land (it sounds a bit like the Pogues)<br />2.  We Take Care of Our Own<br />3.  Wrecking Ball<br /><br />All of the tracks are good in my opinion but these 3 are really good.<br /><br />Can't wait to see him in concert at Gillette Stadium in August!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I received a text for a free RedBox rental last night, and swung by the ol' Market Basket to redeem it. There was a pretty lousy selection of available Blu-rays, but this one was there, and I figured I'd check it out. Turned out to be a great choice!<br /><br />I've seen the first three movies in the series, and they all were relatively forgettable for me... I don't recall much, other than that they were spy movies featuring Tom Cruise. For Ghost Protocol, the series has made a quantum leap in its production. This is the best action movie I've seen in recent memory, and Cruise is one of those actors who seems to get better with age. Rather than be hampered by his reduced physical abilities (which comes naturally in your late 40s, no matter how hard you work out), he somehow appears more athletic and at ease than ever, and his charisma is on full blast, as per the usual.<br /><br />The audio/video presentation of the disc itself is outstanding, among the best I've seen on Blu-ray. I got sort of queasy  during the Dubai free climbing session, and I was only watching on a 40\\" screen... I can only imagine what this must have been like in Imax!<br /><br />The true beauty of this movie, however, is its excellent pacing. It knows exactly what it is, and what it should be doing at all times. This is not a philosophical movie that will make you think real hard, or challenge your views of the universe. It is simply an action vehicle designed to thrill and entertain, and in that regard, it excels. It moves from one great set piece to the next, with just the right amount of dialogue from the characters to create an attachment with the viewer and maintain the sparse plot. It never takes itself too seriously- at one point, Ethan Hunt even makes fun of his own cliched dialogue with an old ally (fans will enjoy that scene).<br /><br />Unless if you are really jaded against the film industry, Cruise, or the series, I feel that you will have FUN watching this movie! Best served with friends, loud volume, and a cocktail of your choosing. Peace!friends, loud volume, and a cocktail of your choosing. Peace!
B005LAIGYQ|2.0|***Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />Let me start off by saying the action is great, which is its main purpose of showing off US seals. Overall, I think the action was a bit too much. Basically, what happened is the story got drowned out in the all that fighting.<br /><br />The story in any case did not make sense, a rich Russian Jewish drug smuggler who is a nasty person who tortures people, is helping an old friend who is somehow related to Chechnya. Why should this drug dealer do something like this is not explained leaving me thinking the story is stupid. Furthermore, his friend is a converted Muslim who for some reason wants to commit terrorism in the U.S. Why? A Chechnyan's enemy is not the US but Russia. Chechnya would see the US as an ally against Russia. Surely, it would make more sense for this plot to become a movie of Russian Seals.<br /><br />Another problem with the story, is that it is obvious from almost as soon as we see the scene with the coming baby which seal will die. As such when he does die, we are robbed of the tragedy as its expected.<br /><br />It is also full of patriotic fever. Which maybe off-putting to some people.<br /><br />The acting varies from very good, for example, Alex Veadov to very poor. Probably, as many of the actors were picked for their ability to do action then their acting ability.<br /><br />The characters because the story is so poor, do not come out well.<br /><br />Overall, this is another story that the writers let us down.<br /><br />Update: Since the Boston bombing, if I wrote this now, I would reconsider my comments about a terrorist from Chechnya wanting to commit terrorism in the U.S.
0525478817|5.0|This isn't your typical book about people with cancer who die. This book will make you laugh,take you on an adventure and let you in on a beautiful story of love between Hazel and Augustus...the worst part of this book is....your broken heart afterward.... :(<br /><br />Loved it so much
145162445X|3.0|After reading a number of books on the subject of the universe, its creation/origin, and scientific research to determine or question certain basic factors of physics, etc., the book was longer than needed to get the author's point across. I am always concerned with parallel agendas and in this case, trying to eliminate the existence of a higher authority (God or otherwise by another name)from one of the explanations for the initial creation of this universe . . . or others for that point.<br /><br />As far as his writing style, I found it interesting, sometimes funny, and full of good analogies or comparative statistics. However, like many scientists, he often devolves into trying to quantify theories (some old and some new - some even bordering on the absurd), that seem to justify future research dollars, whether logical or not.<br /><br />Would I recommend reading it? Yes. Would I prefer to have read a much shorter version with less \\"preaching\\", absolutely.
B0036FOGTW|5.0|Congratulations to Ms Moyo for kicking off a long needed discussion regarding the western imposed development model for Africa. She clearly has identified all the pieces to the puzzle but although I don't agree withvhow shevre assembles them I am in full agreement that they need reassembling. Very informative and insightful. No question a leader has emerged.
B008CP93S0|1.0|--And not even worthy of one star (but Amazon forces you to choose a rating, so hence--my one-star feedback). Oy. What a disaster. Unless, of course, you're Ms. Aniston or Mr. Rudd who are laughing all the way to the bank with their this-script-beyond-sucks-but-holy-crap-you'll-pay-me-how-much paychecks. This lame piece of junk is just a bunch of tired cliches tied together with continuous punches of look-at-how-vulgar-we-can-be that is being marketed as \\"clever.\\" I'm no prude, but this is not even good bad humor. It's just ... TOTAL BLAH. Bottom line: When will Hollywood figure out that even with dirty comedy, you still need to employ writers who can actually write. Otherwise, it's just dirty schlock.
1402786360|4.0|For a cake, cookie & desert book with artistic license this is a great book.<br /><br />For starters despite the lovely and elegant look of all of these deserts each and every one of the recipe/projects is completely within the realm of realism for even a beginner to create - and feel pretty darn proud of the results.<br /><br />Ms. Baird provides a wonderful & easy to understand primer for even the luddite baker: providing decent foundation recipes: Madeira Cake & Almond cakes which are easy to sculpt. and tips for simple tricks with elaborate results: stamped impressions on rice paper to create the sophisticated postcard cookies and a bottle neck to make realistic mushroom cookies. To sculpting simple but eloquent hardy candy desert bowls and decorations.<br /><br />Most desert decorating books are overwhelming and can leave me feeling wistful rather than inspired. Ms. Baird gave me an entire book of lovely options that excited me and left me believing I can totally do anything in this book.<br /><br />Loving this book from beginning to end and highly recommend.
0345803485|1.0|OK, the book is a terrible POS--don't, don't buy it! But instead, read the one-star reviews. These give me hope that the literary world is still alive, and not totally dumbed down. Here's the deal, skip the book (like overlooking vomit) and spend a few hours reading the reviews. There you will find entertaining, literate, creative and imaginative works--I laughed my Fifty Shades of Grey off reading them. There is hope now, there are hundreds of readers who call crap crap, and in so many delightful ways! Love these one-star reviews, and want to thank their writers for giving me a bit of reassurance that sanity and taste are not gone. My message to all: be pitiless here, the mound of steaming offal sold here is so deserving of condemnation, such a grotesque parody of writing that we should all rebel. Thank you reviewers for returning my sense of dignity. I am not alone!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love it ... very addicting.. Can't get enough of this game... Love the different challenges. Even my 8 year old loves it!<br /><br />Review UPDATE! 12/20/12<br />Still loving this app.... Just added new levels... Awesome on the I pad too... I have it on my android and beat all levels, so I put it on the pad just so I could start from the beginning... And still challenging, but love it... You would think, why filling up a grocery bag with food is fun? Seriously though, it is... It's a crap load of challenging puzzles that really gets your brain going.... You have to have a good memory also.. To remember how many milks can u stack before its too heavy... And  how can you place those bananas correctly to hold up a watermelon and then some? It's really a great exercise for your brain! Good job!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Ok at first this game may be pretty boaring but when you get good at it it is so ADDICTING and so much fun(even though uour friends might not like watching you play it)

B002VWNID6|3.0|Received the movie in good time frame, however issue with movie not playing all the way through. I have found the same issue 2 previous times purchasing this movie at Walmart. Think possibly bad batch. At this point returning it will only cost me more money out of my pocket. So I just give up with this movie. Bummer.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I remember playing the original growing up ... this game stuck with the concept however it reminds me of farmville on facebook which I do not like but congrats to gameloft for recreating a classic
B008EQIEWS|2.0|This is a remake that shouldn't have been done. While the special effects were better the story is essentially the same and the acting is no better. If an HD version of the 80's movie were available I'd recommending watching that instead.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so amazing.  Just like the temple run i've none and loved. Overall great app I recommend it to everyone who likes fun.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|If you liked the other MI's, then you'll like this one. Bigger and more outrageous action that fun too see. I thought the story was engaging and I cared about the characters enough for the action to be exciting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids play it on my kindle fire and have no complaints. I have not personally played but they enjoy so cant give a bad review.
B008ASLNN2|3.0|I really thought that this movie was a let down after the first one. It was ok, but \\"ok\\" does not justify over two hours of movie.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|crappy since on smallest board i cant see whole board on my phone and board wont move to be able to see it.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|This is a beautifully done blu-ray edition. The colors are rich and the sound track seems to be even better than the original. While I think Madonna was miscast in this role-she did a good job of embodying the persona but does not have the voice of Patti Lapone!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I've had the opportunity of reading the cons of this album prior to writing my own review.  The first and second times I listened to Illuminations, I felt disappointed in the simplicity of this album.  I was used to having all of the orchestral background and chorus.  With this album, it is quite simplistic, almost to the point of thinking this should have been his first album.  I continued to listen to the WORDS as well as the music, and I am fully in love with this album.  So much so that I have not put on the other albums.  The only song I can't really wrap my head around is the last one on the album.  Other than that, I feel that this album is giving us Josh Groban's heart -- not David Foster.  #7 - \\"just don't tell me that it's too late for me to love you\\".  This album is beautiful!!!  Take his past albums out of the equation and listen to the words and music of Josh's heart.  BEAUTIFUL!!!
B004UNEK1I|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK. One of the best pieces of anti-war literature I've read since Irwin Shaw's \\"Bury the Dead.\\" Kurt Vonnegut is the KING of black humor. This book was definitely worth the time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, I couldn't wait to get the next book.  The series was fascinating from book 1 through book 3.
B000OIBY4Y|5.0|As soon as you read up to the first chapter, you are struck with the mystery of the protagonist's mental state, and develop a sort of awe for the character. You read on and on and are continuously hooked on Camus's egregious words. So hooked in fact, you may be able to read it in one sitting (as I have). Camus is an astoundingly captivating novelist whose (in my honest opinion) greatest masterpiece is \\"The Stranger.\\" This novel has left me nothing but breathlessness, a new favorite book, a new perspective on not only France's, but most of the world's legal system, a new perspective on a not-so-innocent mind, a peculiar love for both Camus and this book's main character, and this review. This book is overall, a heart-wrenching classic.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a sweet game and it was free.  As you progress through the game, you'll learn each bird's strengths, the characteristics of the materials protecting the pigs, and how to trigger chain reactions that destroy the pigs and generate high scores. Snuff out the pigs with the fewest number of birds and the most damage possible to achieve three gold stars for each level.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The movies look very good - but even better are all the extras that come with this. There is a lot of honesty in the interviews with the people involved in making these films on how the franchise has changed - what is good, and what is bad. I still haven't seen all the extras, but all that I have seen has been great - lots of things I haven't seen anywhere before.  Definitely a must-have for the Alien fan.
B003B02O0A|5.0|A great book. I think this might be is best. It started strong, and as I am nearing the halfway point the book has changed courses several times already. This is important; I don't like when the ending is obvious.
0345803485|1.0|As a longtime fan of both romance novels and erotica, I was excited about these books as I thought they had the potential to put romance novels in the mainstream. Thus, I decided to purchase all 3 and give them a try. I can't even get through the first book let alone the whole trilogy as the writing and the plot are really that bad. Since the plot has already been revisited in several reviews, I won't discuss it here; however, I think readers should know that if you are fans of either genre of book represented here or new to these subjects, please do yourself a favor and pass on 50 shades. The writing is poor and neither main character is well developed which makes the plot feel like it stalls in several places. The sex is even poorly written as it feels forced as a plot element and I did not get the vibe that attraction felt as intense as the author wanted the reader to believe. As unrealistic as the plot is, which isn't even the worse of it for me as it is fiction, after all, it is that characters are not developed enough to feel like people I can connect to. Although Christian Grey is standoffish and seems to be a bit of an odd duck, the female lead was much worse. With all her hang-ups and uptight behavior, it is impossible to believe that she would so readily comply with most of the stuff she does. Since I have a large paper and ebook library of books, I put down 50 shades and moved on to all the books I actually want to read.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|After having watched both seasons of this show, I feel confident that I can say that Downton Abbey is one of the greatest period pieces I've seen.  The deep character development causes the watcher to become invested in the story line in a way that few other series have, and the plot itself will keep you enthralled from start to finish, with touches of romance, grief, comedy, intrigue, and so much more.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Average game. Glad it was free would not have paid for it. Will keep playing for fun but do not buy
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I watched and rewatched that show everyday for about a month before the fever came down. Blu-ray is a must collection item in my library.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Some games are more challenging than others but the fact that you have to clear levels to open new ones is! fun. Kids as well as adults can e enjoy this app.!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|First I would like to say that I don't usually buy book on my Kindle at this price. I am so glad I did! The way that Deborah Harkness writes keeps you captivated. I read this one in less than a week and with its length that was fast. It was a beautiful and well described story. Thank You Deborah Harkness. If you liked Twilight Saga you will definately enjoy this book.
0670022705|5.0|I bought this book after listening to the podcast of the same name. (You can visit the British Museum's web site or iTunes to find it). This is a fascinating romp through history. The descriptions are thought provoking and really take you back to the period in your mind. I have read a few of the descriptions and they match what I had listened to, so I can say that the text is quite enjoyable. I bought the book mainly because as I listened to the author describe the objects, I kept wanting to see them. The book includes a photograph of every object. It is a terrific little collection and I quite enjoyed it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hi I'm 14 and I love this game I play it all the time It works great with kindle fire
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is sick. I remember twenty yrs ago playin Oregon trail...fun fun. new and improved fore sure. a must play
0345803485|1.0|I read this book based on hearing how much everyone loved it and couldn't put it down. Well, I put it down half way through and not picking it back up again. It was way to slow to pick up and I just never connected with the characters. It was poorly written. It's not a good book, but people like it, I don't understand why.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is an very cool and fun game I think it is the best and I play it every single day because it is so fun.awsome
B0074PNCRM|5.0|I purchased The Fault in Our Stars simply because I wanted to read something for pleasure after a long school term. I  began not expecting much, but after reading the first 50 pages, I was enthralled. I loved John Green's witty prose and his flawed, but extremely lovable characters. Less than 24 hours after beginning TFIOS, I had finished, and was left sobbing at the thought of the book. I think the most fantastic element of this book was that, yes, the premise of the book is sad and, yes, it has a sad ending, but it avoids being sentimental or contrived in any way.<br /><br />The existential questions in TFIOS were so well presented, and truly made me think about the 'capital-B big' questions, such as the necessity of mattering in this world, no matter how long we will be around.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is more than just than the type of book that will make you both laugh and cry, it is a book that will make you laugh and cry simultaneously, so much so that it seems to defy categorisation in any genre.<br /><br />Ultimately, I cannot recommend The Fault in Our Stars more, it has gone down in my list of favourite books, where I think it will remain for a very long time.<br /><br />P.S. When deciding whether to buy this book, I noticed a lot of reviews claiming that many of the favourable reviews on Amazon were due to a bias that some reviewers had due to being 'nerdfighters.' I can truthfully claim that my review was free from any such bias as when I purchased The Fault in Our Stars I had never heard of John Green or 'nerdfighteria.' However, a month after reading it I am now count myself massive fan of John Green and his vlogbrothers You Tube channel, and have gone on to read his three other independently written books; Looking for Alaska, An Abundance of Katherines and Paper Towns, all of which are [almost] as good as TFIOS.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Buy this movie!! Meant to be seen in Blu-ray!! Intact packaging.. wasn't too in a hurry to get it in the mail
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I read Paper Towns after falling in love with The Fault in Our Stars [Green's most recent novel]. Whilst I didn't love it quite as much, it is still one of the best books I have read.<br /><br />Green's writing, like always, was the perfect blend of laugh-out-loud hilarious, intellectual and thought provoking. His characters were fantastic, even if they didn't feel quite as real as those in TFIOS. I loved Quentin, and his mission to uncover the truth of a girl he barely knows. Lacey, too, felt extremely real to me. I read in another review that it didn't make sense that Q and his friends would give up everything to chase after a girl they don't know and/or like. But I think that was what made this book so great, especially when it came to the perceptions of Q and Lacey in relation to Margo.<br /><br />Margo creates this illusion of herself, intentionally or otherwise that Q, like all her peers, define her by. However, at the end of the day, when they do find Margo, the value that they have placed on their mission to find her disintegrates into nothing. I think one of the great strengths of this book is that it shows just how far people will go to ensure the safety of those around them but, at the end of the day we go back to 'idolising them as gods or dismiss them as animals.' In my opinion, Paper Towns has so much to say about what it means to be human, especially what it means to be a teenager in a world in which the notion of human identity is so elusive. One of my favourite quotes from the book is; 'Margo was not a miracle. She was not an adventure. She was not a fine and precious thing. She was a girl.' For me, that really defines what this book is about, our expectations of one another, and the way in which we can never truly understand other people.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|It was interesting.  Showed the link between Freud and Jung and explained their falling out.  Didn't know about the arrogant, deviant and self indulgent nature of Jung.  His poor wife!  By the end of the film I started thinking he was a real jerk.  Thought Knightly was good in some parts but awful in others.  All that twitching in the beginning made me cringe.  Wouldn't watch it again but it might be OK for fans who like historical pieces.
1611133866|2.0|A woman carries her heart in a purse. A dopefiend in drag snatches the purse. The woman screams 'He stole my heart!' Two cops observe the incident. One says to the other 'Must be one of those alternative lifestyle couples.'<br /><br />A man kills himself by cooking his head in a microwave oven.<br /><br />A man watches a film so entertaining he eats his hand rather than interrupt the film and make himself a sandwich.<br /><br />If these sound like stories out of Urban Legends, it's because Infinite Jest is in the same intellectual ballpark. Despite his verbal calisthenics, DFW had the intellectual depth of a fourteen-year-old. Yes, TV is addictive and drugs are bad, but does one really have to write 1000 pages to get that message across? There are some great sentences in this novel and a couple of really funny anecdotes, but as a whole Infinite Jest is juvenile and vapid. Silly gag acronyms, federal agents in drag, terrorists in wheelchairs, suicide by microwave -- most of this stuff is quirky just for the sake being quirky.<br /><br />jmooney89 says:<br />I hate to sound pretentious by suggesting that you didn't understand what you read, but I do not think you understood what you were reading. I will, however, entertain the notion that it was ME who didn't understand and thought the book was genius. To me this book is much much more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />(Since the reply-to-comment function is mysteriously broken, I'll answer jmooneys89's comment in this edit.)<br /><br />What do I make of Harold Bloom's evaluation of David Foster Wallace: \\"He can't write and he can't think\\"? I agree with the can't-think part and disagree with the can't-write part. Sentence by sentence, DFW is a competent prosaist, if not necessarily a good writer. There's hardly a sentence in Infinite Jest that doesn't come off as hip or slick. Intellectually, DFW is a juvenile. What is the point of the Organisation of North American Nations other than to justify the ONAN acronym?Who but a twelve-year-old would find an arbitrary reference to masturbation *inherently* amusing? Why is Hal interested in \\"Byzantine erotica\\"? Does such a thing even exist? Does it fill any narrative function, or did DFW use the phrase simply because it sounded hip and esoteric? \\"Experialism,\\" anyone? \\"Après-garde\\"? Do writers saturate their prose with unlikely antonyms because they are smart or because they are running ot of things to say? No, the onus is on you, jmooney89. It's up to you to show us how a sum of silly parts makes a meaningful whole.
B006QVRVJK|5.0|This DVD was great.  Had seen the stage play and this movie was absolutely true to the play.  Wonderful acting (except I thought someone other than Jodi Foster should have played her part). Loved it and would recommend it to anyone.

0785162348|5.0|I ordered this art book mainly as a way to continue to enjoy the Avengers film after seeing it.  I rarely buy art books, but couldn't resist this one as a companion to the movie.  I expected it to be mostly character designs, with pictures from the film complementing the artist renderings.  Happily, it is much more than that, and truly is a journey through the film.  There is a lot of concept art for props, vehicles, and general world-building, in addition to character design.  The book has a lot to offer for any film enthusiast to enjoy.  The section on the design of the helicarrier is particularly well done, as the book goes into depth on how they wanted to base it in reality while still being true to the comic origin.  Physics, visual appeal, set design, and more were all taken into account. The exposition (text) enhances the art and photos rather than taking away from them (as I have noticed in other art books).  The text incorporates quotes from the actors and filmmakers, as well as tidbits of Marvel comic history as it impacted the film, and more. I found I enjoyed reading the book as much as looking at the gorgeous imagery.<br /><br />The production values for the book are top notch.  The book comes in a hard slipcase with the cover art printed onto it, without dust jacket, as issued. The pages are thick and glossy, and the book is well laid out.  The designers were careful not to have images broken across pages (one of my biggest gripes with art books), and there's a nice balance of screen shots from the film to contrast against the artist images. This turns out to be a great book for film fans and art fans alike.  And I fully intend to get [[ASIN:0785153322 The Art of Marvel Studios]], which collects the art books from the previous films in one set. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Please see my pictures of the actual book I received, with slipcase.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it. Simple but addictive! Make sure you try the high levels like 16 x 16 to really challenge you.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Movie was kinda slow in beginning but got better the whole chick falling in love with the best friend was messed up. But it's a long movie must be willing to sit liked it all in all though
B0086700CM|5.0|I love how it doesn't work on a lot of peoples kindles but works fine on mine.  I've played so much that I l've unlocked all the characters and all the powerups. ducks for all 200 of you that doesn't work because mine is perfect
B0086700CM|3.0|I think temple run is sort of fun but it makes weird annoying sounds but it is fun and there are a few cheats and I think that needs to get fixed!  the tourial is good for beginners but I also think there could be more people to unlock and stuff would be a lower amount of coins. but you know some people love it some people don't and so its okay.
B007FZ7R7W|4.0|I was a tad nervous about Fortune, I thought it would be full of a bunch of pop/dance songs(which I like but I wanted more R&B from Breezy) and I was pleasantly surprised that it isn't.  This ablum is a great mix of dance, pop, hip-hop, and R&B.  Some of my favorites are<br /><br />Touch Me<br />Don't Judge Me<br />Biggest Fan<br />Mirage f/Nas<br />Don't Wake Me Up<br />Turn up the Music<br />Trumpet Lights<br />4-Years Old<br />Party/Cadallic<br />Sweet Love<br />Strip<br />Til I Die<br /><br />I know its a lot but these songs are what stood out the most for me, they have been on constant repeat.  Lastly, after reading some reviews its seems some people are biased because they don't care for his personality (Lame) and for some his music it not their cup of tea (FAIR) but no need to bash him just don't listen to it, there are some many other artist you can choose from no need to put the man down, be nice.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|engaging and fun game.  addicting though and great to play on a larger screen like on the kindle fire.  I would definitely recommend to others.
0297859390|2.0|BEWARE OF SPOILERS:  I have to join the negative reviewers simply because after getting caught up in reading it, it left me absolutely cold.  In most dramas, there is a \\"payoff.\\" That is, after (admitedly) skilfully drawing the reader in to this interesting narrative, one is left still waiting for the payoff.  Let's face it . . . even readers who consider themselves to be \\"sophistocated\\" critics still look for the good guy to overcome overwhelming adversity in the end.  The bad guy should get his -- or in this case, her -- comeuppance.  In this area, Gone Girl falls miserably flat.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This is a pretty good book, not too intense but interesting enough to hold my attention. I found the story and the writing easy to follow. It's the story of one woman's journey to find herself, to overcome her fears, and basically, to grow up. An amazing accomplishment for anyone, let alone a solo young woman.

B006FO3ERQ|1.0|My Kindle edition has many, many highlighted portions--a few very positive, but many more that were quite negative.  The themes and setting interest me, and the voice could have enhanced the book a great deal but instead was distractingly, irritatingly inconsistent.  This pulled me out of the story once every page or two and made it a very dull read.<br /><br />The narrator is a retirement-age schoolteacher recalling events from fifty years before.  But the voice is not that of an educated adult.  It's also frequently not the voice of a fifteen-year-old.  Instead the narrator often sounds like a small, inarticulate child.  When he talks about the possibility of his parents' divorcing, for instance, he says that he fears that they will \\"go apart.\\"  I guess the idea is to come up with a phrase that sounds naive and fresh, even if no American adult or teenager would ever use it.<br /><br />And that is the least of my problems with the voice.  Ford obviously wants to create dramatic irony in the way that one of my favorite books, The Remains of the Day, does.  But that book is narrated by an adult about adult experiences recalled in journal-like form over a very short period of time.  The voice in that book is consistent.  In Canada, the narrator has spent fifty years living with and reflecting on the experiences he describes, but describes them in the voice (and with the repetitiveness) of a mentally handicapped seven-year-old.<br /><br />If you try a sample of this book and like the spare setting and tone, by all means buy and read Home and/or Gilead by Marilynne Robinson.  Her control of the same tone Ford fails to achieve is masterful--flawless.  Canada is one of the few books that I think will improve as a movie, unless there's a voiceover narration that reproduces the awful original.

B00843TZJM|4.0|...and get the Blu-ray version of CSN 2012, available with the 2 CD's of the concert, only available at Best Buy, and it is less expensive than the Blu-ray alone from Amazon (sorry Amazon!).<br /><br />Still listening to it (audio version on my computer) for the first time, but definitely agree with the other reviewers.  Stills' voice is no longer what it once was, but it's better than it's been, C&N sound great, the band is awesome, and I love that they reached into the Manassas catalog for some of Stills' best writing.<br /><br />Long live CSN!  Really wish they would finish the covers album.

B006AX6ONI|5.0|I really only knew of Mark Cuban from the Mavericks and always loved him. Then saw him on some TV shows but love his spirit and enthusiasm for life. I saw this book and took a chance and boy was I happy I did. Not the most professional book but he isnt the most professional guy. But after twenty plus years with the Fortune 50 this guy is right on both from a personal success point of view and from a corporate point of view. Most of what he says I've seen or felt that way. It has something for everyone. An easy read with short chapters of high powered wisdom. Well worth it.

B00843TZJ2|5.0|This set is the best. They sound as good and even better than ever. The band is great and the harmonies are robust and full. There are 25 songs on the DVD including some new ones - there are some long standards that may be missing such as Delta but that makes room for songs that are rarely performed in concert. There are interviews with the band and CSN. I bought it today at Best Buy for 16.99. Someone made mention of the audio but believe me the material and performances overcome the means. Stills sounds better than he has in years and also looks like he lost weight as does David Crosby. It appears they may be taking better care of themselves. Hopefully this will help them stay around longer. The two CD's of the material are the big bonus here. A great bargain for one of the best groups to last through so many years. Love IT !

B006M4RN3U|5.0|I will start this review by admitting that the only song I knew was \\"We are Young\\" when I bought the album but it had a good star rating so I thought I would give it a listen.  I was amazed at the quality of the album as a whole, I thought it was very well put together in terms of song placement, a majority of the songs were very good (only one was bad), and the singing was very good.  I would recommend this album to anybody.

B00846REIS|1.0|Both I and a friend had read 50 Shades of Grey. Then in our conversation about that book, she recommended I try this book. I read it on an electronic reader device and this is my review.<br /><br />I did not like this book. It barely has any resemblance to 50. The only thing that is similar is that you have a HOT, YOUNG, CORPORATE Billionaire that is in love with a young girl. And that's where the similarities end.<br /><br />The male in the story, Gideon Cross comes on strong, even frighteningly aggressive, as though ready to take the girl (forgot her name) by force. She resists him at first, but then gives in rather quickly. And then they have sex. And after that he becomes a puppydog, chasing her down no matter how many times she runs away. Both Gideon and the girl have bad things that have happened in the past, and as far as this book goes, she tried fixing it, but he has not. Because of their issues, neither can keep a steady relationship. They try to \\"Cure\\" each others emotional traumas through, what else? Sex.<br />At the end of the story, the man becomes the mush and the girl stays an angry bitch. With no real cure in sight.<br />There is no character depth or development. And the story is boring, they work, go to the gym, go to rich-people functions, and the go home. BOOORRING.<br /><br />There was no real plot. They get angry, that have sex, she runs away, they have sex, he can't think of anything but her at work, they have sex. And the sex wasn't that great. I'd call it a 2-second quickie. She sees him, gets immediately totally and completely, on edge of O, hot, and he pleasures her, and they have sex, and it's over. There is no romance, no foreplay, no sensuality. There are no real embraces or sense of comfort between the characters. For and erotic novel, this book doesn't live up to our fantasy expectations.<br /><br />Also, the general tone of the book made it very hard to read. \\"Anger\\" is the word to describe it best. She's angry at him, angry at theworld, he gets angry at her, the roommate and Gideon get angry at each other. Gideon gets angry at the gym trainer, and the mom gets angry at the girl. And even though the main characters say they love each other, there is too much anger and negativity to make it feel like it's gonna last.<br /><br />Finally, for an erotic novel, this book is missing many things. There is no real lust, no passion, no fantasy, no happiness, no satisfaction, and no sensuality. There is anger and orgasm.<br /><br />I really don't recommend this book to anyone. Especially if you've read 50 Shades.
B007HP2KK4|2.0|I bought this 3D/BluRay/DVD set with digital copy. However, upon attempting to perform the digital copy download, I discovered that the included code was only valid in Canada!!

0345803485|5.0|As a Twihard who fell in love with Edward Cullen (I never thought you could fall in love with a fictional character) and swooned over Edward and Bella's incredible love story, I found myself doing the same thing with Christian Grey.<br /><br />Christian Grey is nearly as perfect as Edward Cullen.  I can see a lot of Edward in Christian, and since it started out as a Twlight fan fic, I suppose that makes sense.  But don't get me wrong - Christian Grey is definitely his own man.<br /><br />BDSM, which figures heavily in Fifty Shades of Grey, is not my cup of tea, but reading about it is kind of fascinating.  The writing isn't the best, and Ana and Christian's breaths sure hitch a lot, but I see Fifty Shades as a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />It is the love story that I see developing between Ana and Christian that keeps me so enthralled.  He's said she is his -- he wants her, she wants him -- but can this kind of relationship surivive?  He wants to control her, and she wants him to, but she has some reservations (way to go, Ana!).  He's told her that he's not a 'hearts-and-flowers kind of guy', and that he never sleeps with any of his submissives (in the same bed), but he breaks that rule with Ana.  There's something about her that fascinates him, and since I haven't yet finished the book, I can't wait to see what I haven't yet found out -- I think I'm most curious about Christian's past - and seeing if the L word might be used.

0553386794|5.0|I didn't have the opportunity to read the books before I had seen the HBO series but because of my love of the show I knew I had to read the books.<br /><br />It's impossible to give a short synopsis of the book because there are so many interweaving storyline. There are several story lines that are highlighted more but the real genius of this book (and the series in general) is how well each strand interlocks to create a unique world.<br /><br />In this parallel reality the world is marked by the seasons, Summer doesn't mean that everything is hot and sunny, Summer means that it's not Winter. Winter can last for several years and have snow falls up to 100 feet and Winter, my dear folks, is coming.<br /><br />Each city of the kingdom has unique traits and their own major Houses. Each House has a unique sigil that represents the spirit of its family. The sigil of the Stark House of Winterfell is a dire wolf, the sigil of the Lannister House is a lion. There will come a time not far from now when the lions and wolves will clash.<br /><br />Across the Narrow Sea, a boy seethes in anger at the thought of a Baratheon on the throne. The kingdom rightfully belongs to a Targaryen and he will stop at nothing to reclaim the throne, even selling his only sister to gain an army. But his sister is strong than he thinks and proves to be the true heir to the Targaryen name.<br /><br />In the far north, on The Wall, rumors have reached the Night's Watch. Something is killing the Wildlings and some whisper that it is the returns of the White Walkers. Jon Snow is training to take his vow to The Brotherhood and finds himself face to face with one of these dangerous monsters.<br /><br />In King's Landing, the city is abuzz when the Hand of the King is killed for discovering a secret that could ruin the queen. Ned Stark is pulled away from his wife and dying son to take over as the Hand but his search for the same answers that killed the old Hand may lead him to the same fate. Around the city everyone has their secrets but two men seem to know everything and conspire to suit their own agendas.<br /><br />These are just a few of the many storyline that take place during this epic novel but they all mix together to create one of the best contributions to fantasy novels. This is a novel that has earned its spot next to the likes of Tolkien.e city everyone has their secrets but two men seem to know everything and conspire to suit their own agendas.<br /><br />These are just a few of the many storyline that take place during this epic novel but they all mix together to create one of the best contributions to fantasy novels.

Of Mice and Men was the shortest of his books but displayed his writing ability at its very best.<br /><br />It's a heartbreaking tale about Lennie, a man who is unable to realize his own strength and tends to give people the wrong impression about him. The complete opposite of Lennie is Charlie, intelligent but small, and together they make a perfect pair. They attempt to settle down and churn out an honest living but fate doesn't always care about the best laid plans of mice and men.

0061122416|4.0|This is a book that hold mystical qualities but it was never meant to be an in-depth novel with flowing descriptions. Anyone who has picked up this novel should realize how perfunctory the book will be just by how small it is.<br /><br />The Alchemist reads like a fable about a modest man named Santiago who finds himself on the journey of a lifetime. The underlying message of this book is about pursuing your dreams even if it means taking a risk and making a change. I also felt like there was a Christian theme to novel.<br /><br />In the end this book reminded me a bit of Candide by Voltaire, not in the message but in the writing styles. A lot of things happen in a very short time but the real stars of the book were meant to be the messages it carries, not the characters.<br /><br />It wasn't a particularly unique book but it is a quick read and worth at least a glance.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is soooooooooooo worth all the hype surrounding it. Now I will say it took me a while to get into the whole sotryline but if you can just keep reading long enough you'll find yourself unable to put it down!
0307341577|4.0|When Libby Day was 7 years old her brother Ben killed her mother and two older sisters in what would be called the Kinnake Satanic Murders. Libby would have been next but she escaped out of a window and hid until morning. As the lone survivor, it was Libby's testimony that sent Ben to prison for the rest of his life. Now nearly 25 years later Libby is a troubled adult, she's unable to get a job and barely has any acquaintances. She knows that there are women that believe her brother Ben is innocent but Libby figures these are just lonely homely women who write to men in prison because they can't find a boyfriend.<br /><br />Then Libby receives a strange proposition from a man named Lyle, he will pay her to come to The Kill Club, a group dedicated to solving unsolved murder cases. For the first time in her life, Libby is surrounded by people who are convinced that Libby lied in her testimony and that Ben didn't murder her family. These people are willing to pay Libby to talk to people and find out who the real murderer may be.<br /><br />Unconvinced, Libby takes the job because she needs the money but soon finds herself wondering if maybe Ben could be wasn't to blame for the murders. As she delves deeper, Libby finds evidence that her brother may not have been the harmless but misguided boy that she had known him to be but could he possibly be innocent? And what about that male voice she heard? Libby's search for the truth ends up placing her in danger once more.<br /><br />Dark Places is a definite page turner. There are so many times while I was reading it that I thought I had it all figured out but then my theory would turn to dust and I'd be lost until something else seemed like it solved the case. The actually story flips between two story lines: the present day Libby Day and her Mother and Brother on day of the murders in 1985.<br /><br />There are several things that gave this book merit, namely that there was no romantic subplot. I am tired of novels that always feel the need to make everyone fall in love. Libby's character was unlikable but in a very understandable way. Not everyone who sees their entire family get slaughtered grows up to be a motivational speaker. Sometimes they just become an adult that never really grows up all the way and who can blame them? Also Libby's mother was a very realistic character. Had we just heard about her from anyone else, she'd probably be an unlikable character but we grow to love her namely because of how she is painted through Libby's eyes. The way Flynn presented each potential murderer in the book was effective. Through the present day storyline we see each theory as Libby is presented with a new person to speak to but during the other storyline we are left to draw our own conclusions from the interactions that Ben and his mother have throughout the day.<br /><br />All in all this is a great book and comes highly recommended from me despite a few flaws (I felt that the writer glossed over some things and Libby was able to talk to Ben WAY too easily. If you think someone killed your family for the past 25 years, it would probably be MUCH harder to just stroll in for a chat). You will not be able to put this book down once you get going so it's very fast paced and engrossing.ays feel the need to make everyone fall in love.

0061743526|5.0|There isn't much I can say about this novel that hasn't been said by a few hundred other reviewers.<br /><br />Harper Lee created a classic novel about a little girl named Scout growing up in Alabama with her brother Jem and her father, Atticus Finch. Through the eyes of Scout we encounter the injustice and hatred that lives in her small town. Scout uses her father's wisdom and her own intuition to decide for herself what's right and what's wrong in the world.<br /><br />Mayella Ewell was caught by her father trying to seduce a colored man. The only way to protect herself from her father's wrath is to accuse the innocent Tom of raping her. The instant the town hears that a black man raped a white woman, they can't wait to execute him. Atticus, a local lawyer, is asked by the judge to take the case. Both the judge and Atticus doubt that Tom is really guilty but in the Jim Crow South, they fear that his case was decided long before it came to court.<br /><br />Taking this case ends up becoming dangerous for Atticus and his family because Mayella's alcoholic father doesn't like anyone who doesn't play by his rules.<br /><br />To Kill A Mockingbird is an incredible look at pre-civil rights Southern living where facts are often skewed by blind hatred. One of the best books of all time, I think every child should read this book. Even beyond being a book about racism, this is a prime example of learning for yourself the difference between right and wrong.

0142410705|4.0|I'm not even sure where to start when it comes the An Abundance of Katherines. I enjoyed it, but I didn't connect with it in quite the same way that I did Looking for Alaska. But, I don't like to compare an author's works unless they're part of a series and this book is not part of a series so onto the regular review!<br /><br />I really didn't think I'd like Hassan or Colin when I started reading, but the two definitely grew on me. Colin is one sad guy. He's always getting dumped which doesn't do much for his already low self-esteem and his child prodigy status is one the decline. How does one cure all these problems? Road trip!<br />Except, it's not really a road trip. At least, not in the typical YA book kind of way, but that doesn't make it bad.<br /><br />It's amazing the adventures Colin and Hassan manage to have while staying in one place. You'd think they need the open road to find the best adventures, but Gutshot, Tennessee certainly throws that idea right in the toilet. I loved watching both Colin and Hassan make their own emotional journey's right alongside the actual real-life adventures.<br /><br />The Nutshell: This is a pretty terrible review, I know, but the thing you should take away from it is that An Abundance of Katherines is a book worth reading. There's heartbreak, healing, kissing, hog hunting (where the hog does the hunting), graphing, fighting, and even a little soul searching (come on, I had to get a little cheesy).<br /><br />Hit

B003O86FMW|5.0|Being an aspiring author myself there are certain things that I look for in a story.  The type of story that I enjoy is one which captures my attention from the very first paragraph.  Catching fire not only captured me but it carried me along on a journey that was both riveting and entertaining!  The main characters were believable and I found myself holding my breath until they were safe from the dangers surrounding them on every side.  It truly helped to wet the appetite for adventure that book one created in me.  Being able to purchase Catching Fire from amazon was a fairly new experience for me because I had recently received my Kindle for Mother's Day, and have purchased several books from amazon to date.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I've been a Jane Austen fan for quite some time. I fell in love with the books first, and then dove into the world of the movie adaptations.<br />I must admit, I was a fan of the BBC version, going into this one. I was of course skeptical due to the compressed time and even having Keira Knightley in it.<br />I was quite pleased with this film. I went in understanding that it would only be two hours so of course things would be cut out, issues that could take up a significant amount of time were over in two minutes, and that no movie could ever live up to the book that proceeded it. The actors were the thing that made this movie work, they turned their short-lived characters into people we could grow to love and care about, or mistrust and dislike in a matter of minutes. In fact, I enjoyed a select few of them more than those in the BBC's version.<br />If you're a Jane Austen fan, or just a fan of the movies, this is a great movie if you want to get your Austen-fix as I call it, but don't have the time to watch the other versions that can stretch out for quite a few hours.

While, I do like the form factor (thin and 2 AA) they suck batteries down in a few hours and they are dim with an irregular light pattern.<br /><br />I decided to get this cheap kit to convert it @ 7.97 free shipping to Hawaii (unbeleavable)<br />Now I have a light that is 2X as bright and 5X longer battery life. 25 hrs<br />This is not as bright as the Mini mag LED or my other Cree tactical flash lights but it is a near perfect blend between brightness and battery life.<br />It fits in the loop on my little tool carrier which I carry a Leatherman, Readers, Pen etc..<br />I also have sewn a small loop on the side my caps that enable me to use it as a head lamp perfectly.<br /><br />The light has a good center spot with ample flood. I wrapped several winds of Teflon tape around the threads on the head end so it stay at the perfect focus.<br /><br />I can now swap out some high quality rechargeable AAs every week end and have a decent light with me 24/7.<br /><br />So it is a lot like my ol' lady, she might not be the brightest but, she don't eat much.<br /><br />One mod that I will make is epoxy a ring to the end cap switch so the rubber button will be recessed.

B002ZG97RE|3.0|So much jumpy action, juggling camera work, dark almost invisible scenes. Man, this is hard to watch. You feel like you've had 10 cups of coffee after awhile. This is fully based in reality. Instead of the Ny Times Judith Miller as the Bush administration's press schill, they changed that to someone from the WSJ. I found that funny. There were no WMD in Iraq, but one American soldier is determined to find out why he went to war anyway. That's the gist here, as Matt Damon plays the heroic soldier looking for a plot to fabricate tales of WMD as a justification for a war to remove Saddam Hussein. This plays very anti-war, so I guess the right-wingers didn't like it. I didn't care for it much because the film techniques are so tiresome. What a confusing mess of chaos.

B008B8DWDU|5.0|But those parts were wonderful in their own way.<br /><br />The book is nicely written, but the real stars of the book are the characters. All the characters have disarming vulnerabilities and a wisdom you don't expect in a book written for kids, or even in a book written by someone so young.<br /><br />It's especially noteworthy that the female characters are always independent, driven, wise and strong. That isn't always the case in traditional tellings of these tales.<br /><br />There are still a few typos in the Kindle version, but nothing too distracting.<br /><br />Honestly, I'd recommend this to almost anyone, ages 8+. It's a fun, easy read and I'd be a lot happier about kids reading these fairytales than pretty much everything else out there.

B0084AZXKK|3.0|I read this book back in my seventh grade literature class and thought I would give it a revisit. Honestly, it was very underwhelming. The action was bland and the tension between good vs. evil withered away near the end. Also, it was very difficult to fully understand the book without looking up each nautical term and pirate jargon found in every line about halfway through the book. Treasure Island was a nice little blast from the past, however, I think I am going to stick with contemporary fiction from now on, or at least something a bit more exciting.

Geographically, I am still having trouble placing all the different provinces and so forth but hopefully this will be resolved with more reading. Glokta is definitely one of the most intriguing characters I have ever read about, EVER. Couldn't care less about Ferro though, she is just annoying. Abercrombie does a great job kicking off this dark, gritty, fantasy trilogy and I cannot wait to see where he goes with it. On to the next one!
0871404133|3.0|Dr. Wilson gives an outstanding synthesis of social organisms and shows us just how unique and fascinating we humans are as a species.  Nonetheless, the close of the book is very weak.  He makes sweeping statements such as science and religion will never by synthesized.  In fact history has shown that they always are and will continue to be.  One must wonder if he has ever read Joseph Campbell, Albert Einstein, and a slew of other great scientists, philosophers, mythologists, and so forth.  Further, while he is very critical of religion, he does not offer the same critique of science, which is itself a mythology- the myth of materialism.  Indeed, we see this run though out the book in which both religion and the humanities are filtered through a functionalist lens- as if that is all that the universe is concerned with.  Further, Science and technology are having a far more destructive impact than any religion ever has, personally and collectively.  From these false premises, he goes on to plea for a reasoned approach to the future. Depth psychology and its synthesis with mythology and social psychology has shown that our lack of reason and our irrationality is largely beyond our control, but must continually be worked with to transform them.  Since science presently offers us no means for such deep subjectivity, it is neglecting the core of our being.  Related to this, Dr. Wilson makes the claim that science offers us answers to the ultimate questions, but this is a deep misunderstanding of science.  There is not a single ultimate explanation that science offers- in fact, it can be said that what makes science so fascinating is the way it continually runs up against the big questions precisely at the point where it realizes- in each and every field of science- that it is at the point that the questions it seeks answers to are no longer those that can be answered by the scientific method.  In this light, ancient mythologies are not so backward after all, because theyare addressing precisely those unanswerable questions that science either refuses to answer, or deludes itself into believing it is answering by suddenly getting amnesia about what constitutes a question answerable by the scientific method.  Instead of his pessimistic view on science and spirituality, what we need more than ever now is to evolve and synthesize our religions with science, and move to a deep subjectivity that enables us to embrace our irrational and reasoned aspects- and through such growing self awareness, put science in its proper place rather than on a pedestal, and so realized the truth's of our individual and collective selves, rather than a highly restricted version of truth that can only be established through the scientific method.  We need to embrace respect for the deep psychic forces that shape our world, but instead we get more of a faith in science approach that is just as guilty of dogma as its favorite enemy- religion- and as we have seen historically, and worry for the future- in its present form, even more destructive.  What he fails to address about the religions is how despite their differences, they enable people of uniquely different cultures  to arrive a universals- part of the philosophy of the Universalist churches that he fails to include.  And further, to assign significance, value, and especially priority- something that science has no means to do- as given by the scientific method.  And thus, it is precisely at these points where science and spirituality can be synthesized effectively.  But first science must come down off of its pedestal and realize its own arrogance- that psyche comes first- before science, before religion, so that all must be viewed first and primarily through her lens before moving forward.  Perhaps if science first humbled itself in this way, then organized religions might follow.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Let's be honest, everyone buys this book because it promises some erotic scenes that most of us will never dare to try in real life. The forbidden fruit tastes awful, however.<br /><br />The book is so badly written you'd wonder how it ever scores positive reviews. The guy always \\"cocks his head to one side\\" (English isn't my mother tongue, but even I can come up with a number of synonims), the girl always thinks \\"ow my; holy xxxx, holy xxxx, holy xxxx, ect.\\". The characters are very thought up and obviously come out of the author's fantasy for a rich and handsome and twisted millionaire with complicated childhood, who will occasionally answer his work phone and please her the other 23,5 hours a day in very kinky ways.<br /><br />If this is what makes a best-seller these days, I'm off to read good old classics.

0143121006|3.0|Based on a true story from 1937, Paul French relates the details of the investigation into the murder of Pamela Werner, a mystery that remains unsolved to this day. This type of third person narration with no dialogue occasionally makes for dry reading. The salvation to this book is the mystery of the murder and the incredible twists and turns it takes along the way. I found the setting and the timeframe to be fascinating.<br /><br />The timeframe is important because there were so many political issues going on in China; Chiang Kai-Shek, leader of the Nationalists and Mao Tse-Tung,leader of the communists were battling it out for control. Throw in the fact of the Japanese occupation of Manchuria and impending takeover of Peking, needless to say, tensions were running high. China was on the cusp of massive changes and the brutal murder of one young woman outside the British Legation only added to the fears. The author did a terrific job with sense of place, putting the reader in the scene, while giving a good historical background of what was going on at the time.  That's one part of the book I really enjoyed.<br /><br />The two investigators, British investigator Dennis and Chinese detective Han,  were both hampered by their superiors and limited in what, where and who they could investigate. It was almost doomed to fail. It's as if even the top echelons did not want this case solved.  Almost everyone the two detectives talked to either lied, were bribed, relocated or were just covering up to save their own skins. It didn't help that a lot of the people involved were from the dregs of society and were unreliable or that they were from a privileged set and others protected them.<br /><br />Pamela's father tried for years with all his might and resources to lead them in the right direction but he was rebuffed at every turn. No one was willing to re-open the case. Even until after the war, he was still trying to get justice for his beloved daughter.  Such a sad turn of events.<br /><br />The end of the book lists the author's extensive sources and how he came to write the book in the first place. The mystery fascinated him and he couldn't let it go without doing his own investigation. It goes without saying, Mr. French did a tremendous amount of research into this case.f events.<br /><br />The end of the book lists the author's extensive sources and how he came to write the book in the first place.

B002XTJ9LC|3.0|The Ambient remix of Wait For Me is just that - very ambient.  Most beats, vocals and musical dynamics have been smoothed away in favor of long, slow chord progressions.  While extremely relaxing, I found myself often wanting to return to the actual Wait For Me album, a laid back masterpiece itself, and in my opinion one of Moby's best.  I'm a fan of other \\"ambient\\" albums (Eluvium, Sigur Ros, etc), and while this one is not bad, I simply prefer the original album and its mix to this one.  That being said, this album is still worth a listen for any Moby fan or anyone wanting a warm mix of songs to work or unwind to.
1439152799|5.0|Loved it! All of it: the gothic atmosphere, the castle setting, the WWII time frame as well as the early 90's time frame, the mystery of the mud man and the unexplained disappearance of Juniper's fianc&eacute;, Thomas Cavill. The Distant Hours sucked me in and never let me go.<br /><br />The characters were so real to me, from the deliciously creepy Blythe sisters to Edie and her mom, Meredith. I could just about picture every move they made. The sense of place was very well done also. I love the way Morton revealed things slowly while filling in the backstory, keeping up my interest non-stop. The ending with it's twists and revelations had me riveted to the page. I just couldn't put it down. 5*<br /><br />Kate Morton is also the author of The House of Riverton and The Secret Garden, both of which I really enjoyed.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I've never felt compelled to write a review before. I've purchased plenty of the self published works now, this is by far the best I've purchased (self published books - best thing to happen to a book junkie in a long time). I've paid much more for far less, many times, from authors I read regularly. Well done. Thanks for the pleasant surprise.

034580404X|4.0|I was never much into romance novels but decided to read this trilogy due to the rave reviews. I could not put them down and found myself staying up entirely too late just to see what happened next. If you are in to erotic stories this one will not disappoint!
0316098329|1.0|We chose to read this book in our bookclub.  There are 8 members and 7 disliked this book.  So 1 out out every 8 people might like this book.  It is hard to read becuase a 5 year old is telling the story and cannot speak in complete sentences.  ALso, it is a disturbing story that doesnt make me want to read more.  Dont read unless you want a depressing, sad, hard book to read.
0765316994|5.0|At the beginning I thought, what happen to Scalzi, he writes better than this. Then I realized I was reading a screenplay that had been converted into a novel. That explains where all those 'he said' 'she said' were coming from. I don't know if he was trying to capture the spirit of the Twilight Zone--but boy, he's got it: normal crew members take up residence in the Twilight Zone.
B0031QVW2U|4.0|This little strap is what it is, an extra length of nylon for an already excessive camera strap. But it makes that excessive camera strap much more useful and about 2x as \\"tactical\\" from a style perspective, which is awesome.<br /><br />If you bought a Black Rapid camera strap you're probably considering this for two reasons: to make your strap more useful, and to look like a bad-ass when you're wearing a camera. YMMV, but I think it does both.<br /><br />I like my rs-5 way more now, even if it's little more unwieldy to put on quickly.<br /><br />So I love it, but minus 1 star for being a nylon strap with plastic buckles that costs as much as I paid for Rage Against The Machine's \\"Evil Empire\\" when I bought it from the Musicland at the mall while skipping 5th period Japanese II; the nerve of them! That album changed my teenage life, but this strap just straps things together. I guess it's worth it though.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|This is the first full CD of Rufus Wainwright I have bought. I don't know if his other music sounds like this. It has an odd sound to me, but I love it. I will investigate further his other recordings because I like the sound of his voice.
B00846REIS|2.0|So to start, of course I found this book doing a similar to Fifty search.  I was excited because I had read this book was supposed to be better written than Fifty Shades of Grey.  I agree in that the language used is better.  HOWEVER, there is not enough character development in this book. I loved the development of Christian and Ana's characters and relationship.  Gideon and Eva do not have that development.  It starts really quickly and never really develops.  I do feel that the story is rushed.  I probably will not read the 2nd and 3rd books when they are available.  A plus to this book is the character Cary.  I really would like to know more about him than Gideon and Eva.
030758836X|1.0|[[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]I am astounded at the positive press this novel got from reviewers.  It stretches the plausibility factor as thin as it can be drawn.  It is overlong, ploddingly paced and amazingly repetitive.  It is predictable in the extreme and gives the reader two totally dislikeable people.  These are not charming villains--Richard II, Hannibal Lecter, for example--but two people it is almost hell to spend so many pages with--think \\"No Exit\\" horrible people.  The wife is a monster of the first order and the husband is the most implausible fool in the history of literature.  To believe this nonsense we have to think that the police who have been burned by just such tabloid story fictions as this one never smell a rat.  And we have to assume that a husband will throw all caution to the wind and sleep beside a murderous spouse whom he loathes.  In reality there is only one adjective to describe such a man--dead.  And this potboiler by a formerly talented writer is just that DOA.

B005LAIH9K|4.0|As a huge fan of the American Pie series, I desperately wanted another movie featuring the main cast because I thought American Wedding just wasn't good enough. It made jokes that weren't funny and a large chunk of screen time was devoted to Stifler (not a terrible thing, but the scenes were garbage) with just lame material. And of course a lot of the principle cast was absent.<br /><br />I saw a couple of the Pie spinoffs, but it was clear that many of us wouldn't view those movies as canon to the REAL series. When American Reunion was announced I thought it would be the prefect opportunity to wrap the series in a way the \\"Wedding\\" should have.<br /><br />After buying the Blu-Ray and watching this one, I loved every single second of it! It felt like watching Pie 1 and 2 again and the characters felt real again, not like in \\"Wedding\\" where it felt like they were there for the paycheck.<br /><br />Seeing all the main members of the cast back is a real treat for die-hard fans of the 1st movie and seeing cameos from the Sherminator, Nadia, the MILF guys and so on really added to a fun ride. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is I wish they would've given more screen time to Jessica (Natasha Lyonne). Vicky and Jess were real good friends so it would've made sense to have those two actually interact in the film. They kinda do in a deleted scene, but honestly it's a minor quibble.<br /><br />The guys actually develop in this film and Stifler is as likable in this film as he's ever been and it's nice to see him finally acknowledged as part of the gang and the story for Jim's Dad is fresh and hilarious too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, plot points from the previous films are recognized and mentioned and weaved into this film perfectly and I think it pays a great tribute to the series to end with this one.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Seems simple...and it is, mostly...but can get tricky at times. It's definitely addictive so you'll find yourself giving it more time than &quot;oh, just for a few minutes to kill time.&quot; It will suck up far more time than that!
0425263908|3.0|This book has been compared to \\"Fifty Shades Of Grey\\". If you are looking for that, you will not find it here. I do not see the comparison at all. This is a love story but with two people who have been through a bad experience as children. There is no witty emails back and forth which I enjoyed in Fifty Shades. There is just sex and more sex but nothing like Fifty. The book is a good story and I will read the sequel to it when it comes out. But don't expect the \\"Fifty\\" experience here.

B000002UQJ|4.0|This CD is a good record of Paul, may be compared in quality to \\"Flowers Of Dirt\\" album which is the predecessor. There are pop songs well done and enjoyable and can be listened to over and over again without causing motion sickness easily. I believe the tracks, not necessarily in that order, are the best: \\"Off The Ground\\", \\"Hope Of Deliverance\\", \\"I Owe It All To You\\", \\"Winedark Open Sea\\" and \\"C'mon People\\". There is no bad track. It is true both for fans of Paul McCartney and for those who enjoy a good pop-rock. Very good!
B005LAIHKY|5.0|First off, let me say that I respect the DS fanatics out there who were upset that this film is a comedy.  I do think fans of the TV series might consider that other who watched this show might have found some of it to be funny.  Also it was, i admit, wierd that they had the story take place in 1972 with the main character comming from 200 years in the past and not knowing what to make of this \\"strange new age\\", an age the people in attendance, most of them, were not born for.  Lighten up people.  This film was funny, the sets were amazing, the story was OK for the material, a gothic romance about a spurned witch, a vampire and the people caught in the middle.  No it was not really true to the TV show, the theme song was notably missing but we did get to see the water crashing on the rocks, and perhaps 1972 was not the perfect time for it.  I don't care.  Johnny Depps lines and the musical number pairing Chloe Grace Morits with Alice Cooper (my childhood hero) made the film more then worth seeing.  This movie is currently playing in the \\"cheap\\" theaters, where I have just talked two friends into seeing it (i have seen in 3 times now and find something new every time) it's really worth seeing on the big screen and I can't wait for the Blu Ray.  Sadly I will have to add this to a too long list of films that I loved and no one (or very few) others cared for.  I can't help it if I am right everyone else is wrong.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Definitely not the best of the series but enjoyed it. I still prefer books 1 & 3.  I just wish I could read the maps for this series in the Kindle versions, the printing is just way too small and I don't think there is any way to increase their size.
0142000655|5.0|Though I am no fan of the classics, the plot and dialogue were easy to follow. My only real criticism of the book was that it forces its readers to read far into the book to reach the more intense sequences and interesting points of the storyline. Therefore, readers are to be cautioned to have the necessary time to read this book before tossing it away to a dusty bookshelf.
B0089GQB28|3.0|But the last 10 minutes were an abomination. Embarrassing end to an otherwise brilliant film. It's almost as if an assistant reminded the director it was time to end it.

1603427244|4.0|(Full disclosure: I received a free review copy of this book from Storey Publishing.)<br /><br />There are a lot of great things going for Cast On, Bind Off: 54 Step-by-Step Methods; Find the perfect start and finish for every knitting project by Leslie Ann Bestor.  This book is all about edges - it includes 33 techniques for casting on and 21 methods for binding off.<br /><br />The concept is that this book can serve as a one-stop resource for finding the perfect cast on and/or bind off for your project.  The design of the book - small enough to be portable and including a spiral binding so you can lay it flat while reading and knitting - actually helps to advance that concept.  The front and back inside cover include handy lists of different types of cast ons and bind offs so you can quickly find a technique to match your project.  To further assist you, the cast on and bind off methods are listed in sections.  For cast ons, the sections are Basic, Stretchy, Decorative, Circular, Double-Sided, Multicolor, Provisional, Tubular, and Mobius, and for bind offs, the sections are Basic, Stretchy, Decorative, and Sewn.  There is also a detailed index.<br /><br />Each cast on or bind off method includes a list of common alternate names, a brief introduction, a picture of the front, back, and top/bottom of the method, a list of characteristics (e.g., \\"Firm edge that does not stretch\\") and a list of project types that the method is good for.  Each method is then described in step-by-step photographs with brief accompanying text.  Some of the methods include extra tips in a side box called Getting It Right.<br /><br />If you have a vague awareness of different cast on and bind off methods, I think this is the perfect guide to jog your memory and also to remind (or inform) you which projects you might want to match to a particular technique.  I'm not as convinced that the average knitter could learn to master these methods from the pictures and text alone.  For example, while the pictures do show step-by-step action, there are no illustrative graphics (such as arrows) which might indicate how the needles, fingers, and/or yarn got from one position to the next.  Similarly, the text is rather brief because it is assumed that the pictures are \\"doing the talking.\\"<br /><br />As a one-stop resource guide, the book doesn't quite hit the mark.  However, it is a great little book that can definitely serve as a reminder about a technique you may not be very familiar with.  It would be much better to have this book and supplement it with a YouTube video about a particular method than to try and do a Google search for random cast on or bind off methods that might be suited to a particular project type.  In fact, the resources section in the back includes some great links to videos demonstrating some of the techniques in the book.<br /><br />Overall, I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars for an intermediate knitter.  If you like to start and end projects on the go (especially when you may not have internet access), this book is especially great because of the portable, lay flat design.  I liked it so much that I kept my review copy (instead of hosting a blog giveaway, as I usually do) so I can share it with my knitting students.the pictures do show step-by-step action, there are no illustrative graphics (such as arrows) which might indicate how the needles, fingers, and/or yarn got from one position to the next.

I could never read another page and it would already have been the best thing I have ever read, and I have read hundreds (maybe into the thousands) of books over my lifetime. The plot, the characters, the writing is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />When I was little, I used to really enjoy all the wonders and majestic feelings a good book would give me. I really would feel like I was part of that world. Now that I am older, I don't feel that for books anymore, until NOW.<br /><br />Wool is mesmerizing, makes you think, makes you feel like you are actually there. The author's descriptive writing flows so smoothly, it is simply the best I've ever read. If you are even remotely thinking of buying this book, STOP THINKING and just buy it now. It is the best $5.99 I have spent. Thank you Hugh Howey for making me feel like a kid again and building such a believable world!

B000F9RB9Y|1.0|I just bought my first blu ray player and also purchased Terminator 1-3<br />They really have no business calling this edition \\"blu ray\\" it looks about the same as my regular edition DVD I have had for years (the special edition with the embossed cover kind of like a hologram) The sound on the blu ray is pretty good, but it's another bare bones with only the same special features as the regular special edition.  I am sure that at some point they will release another and we can only hope the video is upgraded and they pack it full of special features.<br /><br />This disc is simply the regular Terminator DVD packaged as a blu ray and the people who released it should be ashamed of themselves and maybe a class action law suit too!<br /><br />On the other hand it was about 7 bucks so whatever.  Don't listen to the people who say the picture quality is improved, they probably work for the company that released it.  This movie deserves better and in my opinion \\"The Terminator\\" has not been released on blu ray yet.

This album is bigger than it's connection to a genre, this is a declaration. R&B music can be popular without being pop music.<br /><br />Frank Ocean does an incredible job of mystifying the listener with his word play, you never know what he is going to say or how he is going to say it. If you love music, this is a must have. Melodies, rhythm, soul and dance. Frank Ocean does it all so well.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|For a fly trapped on an air-conditioned bus, the bus might easily be all the world it will ever know before dying. I think about things like this a lot, every time I look up at the stars actually. So, apparently, does Hugh Howey, whose \\"Wool Ominbus\\" takes this sort of thought experiment and flushes it out in a 500-page dramatization that is equal parts Cormac McCarthy, Richard Matheson, and Ray Bradbury. It is also 100% original.<br /><br />This might not be the first book you have read about people living in a dome (here, it is an underground silo), but Howey continually takes the plot in unexpected directions, and he breathes a life into this scenario that many authors just can't seem to pull off. Personally, I think it is all about the characterization: Howey's characters are flesh and blood; they hurt, they love, they fear, they bleed--and when they do, the reader cannot help but to feel their joy and pain.<br /><br />I also believe that all good novels are about discovery, especially self-discovery. That is the case here, at both an individual and a collective level. As the characters make their journey from ignorance to knowledge, Howey forces the reader to contemplate some interesting psychological questions. For example, why would a condemned man make his last act a service to the very community that condemned him? And we are repeatedly asked to consider the extent to which we prefer false appearances to reality, even at a communal level. As different as the world in the book is from ours, it is also eerily familiar. Yet, while there is plenty to fear, there is also plenty of room for hope.<br /><br />\\"The Wool Omnibus\\" should appeal to a very wide audience, from young adults to more mature readers of either gender. This is thoughtful speculative fiction at its nail-biting best. Highly recommended, especially at this ridiculous price.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|What a wonderful story about life. Every curmudgeon was once an adventurous and wide eyed child but as life takes you on its unpredictable path, you can lose sight of that and forget. Up is an adventure story of the best kind. A disillusioned old man realizes that true joy, the stuff of life, isn't about the destination but lies in meaningful companionship while on the journey. The movie has serious undertones but young Russell keeps things lively. His youthful enthusiasm initially annoys the old man who is set on reaching his life long destination spot at Paradise Falls. At the outset of their unplanned adventure together, the old man is grouchy, impatient, and sees the kid as a nuisance. Later, in the true spirit of adventure, the old man discovers that he and Russell have something in common, they need each other.

B005IQZB14|4.0|I've read quite a number of books relating to an author's experience of hiking a long trail (mostly PCT, AT), and found this story to be an interesting diversion from the standard (i.e., let me explain how I was hiking on day 20 it rained whilst I covered 16 uphill miles through forested blah blah). This book gets you inside the thoughts of the author and jumps from trail memories to pre-trail life and its impact on the journey of hiking alone.<br /><br />Appreciated the strength of a women hiking alone, facing all those fears and stereotypes that women are not capable of such an endeavor. The book is a very personal tale of life on a long hike...and just life revealed through the eyes of the author.

B007JGAR6U|4.0|Not very big, but that isn't all bad.  If I wanted big, I would've bought a Canon 5D, a backpack full of oversize/overweight L-series lenses and a 30 lb-rated tripod.  This is a good dedicated flash for a pretty sophisticated camera that needs its own dedicated flash and lenses for optimal performance.  If you went to the expense of buying an X-Pro 1 and the lens(es) that go with it, then don't choke up now and buy a cheap non-dedicated aftermarket flash.  Buy the real deal just like you already did.  Good product that sits on and works with a good camera.
B001NS063E|4.0|This second release by Dire Straits blends the delicate arangements from the first album with a much darker edge.

The layered synth that features prominently on their later albums is modestly introduced here. The standout track is unquestionably the heartbreak-epic \\"Tunnel of Love\\". Mark Knopfler is truly one of the great romantic hard rockers.

The 50 shades of grey refer to the many ways Grey finds to do sexual things. Credit the author with canny observations on their relationship. Can Anastasia bring him back to some kind of normal?  It takes three books to find out.[[ASIN:B007J4T2G8 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
0307887448|5.0|I find it silly that many refer to this book as too \\"nerdy.\\" Bottom line, it's like a great sic-fi, pop culture drama that advances us into a fictional future world. While the book does revolve around the video game culture of the 80's, 90's and 00's, it's ultimately a fascinating scavenger hunt.<br /><br />There is a reason Warner Brothers won an outrageous bidding war for the movie rights - it's entertaining. Don't let all the geek talk prohibit you from reading a fun story that is a great ride for the reader.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I first rented this season from the library because of seeing Torry Devitto on Vampire Diaries. Vampire Diaries is one of my favorite shows and was surprised to see two other actors from Vampire Diaries on this show also. I'm hooked on this show. The four little liars are great. Ian Harding is great as Lucy Hale's love interest in this show. Watch this show and I believe you will be hooked also. Season 2 is really great also.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Its a pretty cool game...... if you like ice age.....but if you don't its still cool.  I recommend it for people who like building and customizing your own village. Other than that its a pretty addictive game!
0385333846|4.0|I did not have high expectations going into this book, despite the fact that I usually enjoy World War II fiction. The amount of times that I had heard this novel favorably compared to Catch-22 , a novel which I did not like very much, left me thinking that I would not enjoy this book very much either. However the story and the characters and the unique structure and take on World War II in this novel was really intriguing. And while I would not say that it is the best World War II novel that I have ever read, I certainly think that it deserves the praise that it gets for being such a wonderfully told story with a message about the nature of war and humanity.
B001KEGRCA|5.0|Nice sharp images with a great sound track. Especially if you like the Dave Matthews Band. It's like you're really at the Grand Canyon.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is a wonderful book, it rises above the flotsam of fantasy - both mass market and self published. You can tell Anthony Ryan has a deep love for the genre, for literature,and for history. Finely crafted narrative, engaging characters, brutal action that keeps the pages turning. I honestly cannot say that I have been this excited about fantasy since A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />I would have gladly paid more than $2.99 for this work and wish I could buy it twice just to support him. If you have come this far, what are you waiting for? Buy this book!<br /><br />My only complaint is the cover - it looks a bit like a corny romance novel. A strange complaint but I think a book this great deserves a top notch cover.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Woody Allen film, but I'll be the first to admit he's been rather inconsistent in the last few years. That may be why Woody Allen's name is not featured predominately in the promotions and marketing of this film. The producers need not have worried, this is a great film. This time Woody's persona is aptly portrayed by Owen Wilson. The setting is Paris and magic is in the air, particularly at the bewitching hour when out hero time-travels to different golden ages of the city's past. The Humor is subtle but the story is mesmerizing. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a soothing break from the raunchy comedies and action films that dominate the summer season.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book reinforces the concept put forth by Arthur Agatston's \\"The South Beach Diet\\" book. It takes the theory that carbohydrates are responsible for ills such as weight gain and then expounds on it by vilifying wheat as the ultimate disease causing food. The book is very informative as to the evolution of wheat throughout mankind's history. It is written from a view point of and for those people which suffer from some sort of wheat ingestion induced disease. A good read.

B006T5GTK0|5.0|Yes, in a # of ways the Australian mini-series is better; it's in color & it's<br />longer & contains some very interesting plot twists this one doesn't;<br />the 2nd part of the mini-series takes place mostly in Australia, a little in<br />the UK, while only the last l5-20 minutes of this b/w film does.<br /><br />But it's very well done, maybe not quite as good all the way thru as the<br />mini-series.  But the conclusion, last 5 minutes or so, is even better.<br />Virginia McKenna does a great acting job, especially in the increasingly emotionally gripping scenes in the last few minutes.  I can't imagine how she<br />could have been better.<br /><br />So both are worth seeing.  I've transferred the mini-series to 2 dvd's,<br />don't want to hold my breath till it's available on dvd commercially.<br />But this b/w film version is a truly fine movie, gets better & better the further into it you get.  Be prepared for at least one difficult to watch<br />scene (my wife cldn't watch it).  & then a truly wonderful conclusion,<br />esp Virginia McKenna's superb & memorable acting.  She sure knows how to<br />do romance.<br /><br />- Pete Kossoris; kossoris@roadrunner.com
B006LSZECO|3.0|I finished this book, which was just OK. Light summer reading<br /><br />Good chatacterization, especially of the heroine's parents.<br /><br />Plot kind of unbelievable/far fetched.
B00633W614|5.0|I loved Only Time Will Tell and eagerly jumped into The Sins Of The Father. I think I actually enjoyed The Sins Of The Father even more than I enjoyed Only Time Will Tell. Only Time Will Tell kind of just introduced the characters and set up the story. The Sins Of The Father actually starts getting into the meat of things. Highly enjoyable and easy read. Hard to put down. I look forward to the next Clifton Chronicles. Jeffrey Archer has become one of my favorite authors. Lucky for me I have just discovered his books and have most of them ahead of me still to read and enjoy.
B0013ND30M|1.0|I ordered two copies of the DVD for Sleeping Beauty, one for each of my three year old granddaughters.  The DVDs do not play correctly they skip a big chunk of the video and the color is off!! I will not order another DVD from amazon when the DVDs came -- on the back of the DVDs it says made in Mexico.  These are not worth the money that I paid for them --- expected more from an Amazon product.
030758836X|2.0|I have read all this author's works. So I read her latest and was disappointed.  Wonderful premise, very original, but this dragged on and on and on to a very weak finish.  I am not going into details, but I was forever checking how many pages I had left as opposed to being sad knowing it was ending. I cannot imagine how a movie will be made of this, but maybe a movie will pull it more together. Very tedious. I am giving 2 stars because the prose was fantastic and the premise very unique.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|okay first off I read the books out of order but I did read them.  It brought 2 things to mind. one of them is my own sad attempts at writing love stories at 14...you know when hormones are ruling the universe and you write lots of improbable sex scenes from daydreams. Second of all, I was a internet troll back in the 90's on IM. that would be the A/S/L era...I lied about my age, I was a minor I was curious, I was left on the net unattended. I wasn't stupid I knew the guys were lying about their size I figured I could lie about my age and location.  I had better IM sex conversations when I was 15 then this book.<br />I work in walmart, the only people I see buying this book are really old 'mommies' obviously thinking its going to be a raunchy romp and 12 year olds. Yes that is right 12 year olds. The 12 year olds are really angry we're constantly sold out of book 2.<br />I did find the book hilarious. But I feel the author would have done better to do a little research on her subject matter. Its painfully obviously she's never been a Submissive and certainly never a Dom.  in short you can find a better romance BSDM that isn't 'porno light for pre teens and young teens' on Literotica.<br />I've read fanfiction that has better sex scenes. I can't imagine how its called 'mommy porn' the only people getting off on reading this stuff are the pre teens and young teens.<br />like some other reviewers, I had to check to see if the author was legal age...I still find it hard to believe. I applaud her efforts, but she should really get a better editor.

B000C036G8|1.0|After paying almost $50 for a japanese text version of this book for a baby shower gift, I was very excited to see the package arrive. When i opened it I was fuming!!! The seller shipped me the english version of the book! Which by the way had a price tag on it for $2.99! Wow! I attempted to contact the seller to resolve the issue but the only response was \\"ship the book back to me and i will issue  a refund once i receive it\\" um... NO! i was not going to pay $$$ out of my pocket for their mistake! After several emails to the seller with no response what so ever...It ended up I had to file a claim via Amazon to get a refund.

B007X4ECLY|1.0|1st off, I gave this thing the benefit of the doubt, being a (big) fan of many of Luc Besson's work (both as writer, director, writer/director, and so on)... But everyone seems to be missing a Huge Plot Hole (or are simply unwilling to acknowledge it & be honest)... the Maggie Grace character, would not want to be saved... period... as she would have been (in any semi-truthful/honest reality) been brutally & savagely raped, more times than I care to think about... and wouldn't even have been, physically or mentally capable, of aiding in her own escape, in any capacity... as she would've either been a near-comatose vegetable (or full-blown comatose); OR, she would've killed herself the first chance she got, to effect the only true escape she could ever get -- i.e., Death... because even IF \\"Snow\\" (Pierce) managed to get her to safety (comatose, or otherwise), the second she is able, she'd commit suicide, else she'd live the rest of her days with the horrendous memories of all those rapes, by all those nasty, desease-ridden inmates! ___ So, given that the film doesn't even take any of that very real, very honest, 'scenario', into account -- none of the rest of it, can be taken any more seriously, or objectively, because (any sane, honest person) can't stop thinking about the aformentioned points, during the entirety of the movie -- which, isn't that great anyway, even without that glaring, and offensively misguided, \\"plot hole\\", which is large enough to fit the entire \\"space prison\\" into.<br /><br />So, nice concept -- But utter and complete FAIL in story delivery, from start to finish.
0765316994|5.0|This book is an excellent parody of Star Trek written from the point of view of the hapless redshirts. The extras who would be lucky to get a last name a few lines of dialogue before being offed. Thus book has many laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />The reshirts start comparing notes and hey figure out that they are walking targets, then they devise a plan to save themselves. This book is a must read if you are a fan of Star Trek.
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|1st off, I'm NOT buying any set that includes that God-Awful \\"Crystal Skull\\", \\"Indiana-Raping\\", \\"movie\\"... and I use the term, \\"movie\\", loosely, because it has more in common with the garbage in my waste basket, than it does to Celluloid (or Digital) film, which was allegedly shot by a professional, and allegedly included good actors... but I digress...<br /><br />Offer them individually, or at the very least, w/o the 4th \\"movie\\" (especially since anyone who actually wanted this garbage, likely, already purchased it -- as it's the only \\"movie\\" of the 4, to have been released on Blu-Ray previously!).<br /><br />As for those who say, \\"It's a good deal/value\\"... Let's examine that shall we:<br />Currently, the price is $75 (+ S&H for non-Prime members) -- That's $18.75 per film.  When compared to other movies, just as old & just as popular as Indiana Jones TRILOGY, who have seen past, or recent, blu-ray releases... Well, $18.75 is pretty steep, as most of those comparable films cost under $15 (and many of them under $12). __ When you factor in the fact that most people, will really only buy this set for the TRILOGY & discard, sell, or permanently shelve the 4th, you're really paying $25 for each of the 3 you want (and $25 for Temple of Doom... come on, really!?)<br /><br />Plus, if that wasn't bad enough... according to the Product Details, you're not even getting anything to explain, or to excuse, the exorbitant $75 price tag. _ All the good bonus features were already included in the DVD (Trilogy) box set... And when their best selling point for these \\"new features\\", is, \\"X minute intro by Lucas, discussing the Good & Bad\\" (Temple of Doom)... and they have to intro the 3rd movie by saying \\"Not as good as the first; but better than the second\\"... LOL... Again, you have to ask... WHY would anyone in their right mind, pay $75 to get this Set? (and I've been sorely disappointed with past Lucas, DVD to Blu-Ray transfers... especially when some of those releases didn't even contain HALF of the bonus features that their earlier, DVD counterparts included!)<br /><br />Send a couple Loud, and Clear messages to No-Neck Lucas (who's looking more & more like Jabba, every year)... 1st: STOP making films... What LITTLE magic you had back in the day, has long since expired (see Indiana 4, Red Tails, Star Wars 1-3, etc.)... And 2nd: Shove this \\"Set\\" were the sun doesn't shine; because you know damn well that MOST people, Do Not Want The 4th (or even the 2nd)! _ (And again, many of the FEW who did like the 4th, already bought the dang thing - and you should shove it twice, for making them buy that god-awful crap, twice, just so they can get the other 3!)<br /><br />Sorry - I'm extremely urked with Lucas & needed to vent. King Douche & No-Talent-Hack, whose best successes, were all produced & directed by people with Actual Talent (who he just provided the story/plot for), i.e., Willow, Indiana 1 & 3, and 2 or 3 others at most. __ But I'm not about to spend my hard earned money, on a set that includes that A**-Raping of Indie, called \\"Crystal Skull\\"... No way. __ I guess we should at least be thankful he hasn't gone and added Gondarks or 'Sand People' or whatever.... LOL... YET.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is a very moving book, kept my attention all the way, was very sad when I reached the end, wish there were more on Juensey Island
0345803493|5.0|I won't go into the plot of this book. It has been gone over many times here. That said, I have not enjoyed a set of books this much since I read the Sleeping Beauty trilogy by Ann Rice a few years ago. I just found out half way through this book that it all started as Twilight fan fiction. I became totally addicted to this series while reading the 1st book and this 2nd book has only cemented my addiction. Again, it is not for the closed minded among us. Some will read this and just \\"not get it\\". We must all be respectful of their feelings. There are to many books out there to waste your time on something that is just not your cup of tea. These books may fall under that heading. For those out there that want to let go of their inhibitions and explore their dark side (and we all have one) you can't find a better set of books than the GREY trilogy.
0439023491|5.0|I liked this book 10 times better than its predecessor.<br /><br />Catching Fire made up for just about everything The Hunger Games lacked and it was difficult to find fault with anything. Suzanne Collins' second installment of her trademark series was chock full of endless suspense, gasp-inducing surprises, and brilliance of imagination.<br /><br />When I reflect on it, I only had two gripes about this book, but entirety of the book made up for the small negatives. For one, the book starts off kind of slow, but by the fourth or fifth chapter, the crap starts to really hit the fan in a major way. Districts are uprising, people are being brutally killed for their (small) acts of defiance. Soon, Katniss Everdeen and those she holds most dear find themselves blindsided by decisions from the Capitol that no one, not even the reader, sees coming. With lines being drawn and heroes (some less obvious than others) taking sides, Panem hurtles into full rebellion, and what results is one big rush of action, science fiction, and romance.<br /><br />The other thing I found irksome about this book, as many have already said, is that I did find Katniss' machinations regarding her love triangle to be a bit annoying. At the beginning of the book, she feels so strongly for one of her suitors but continues to flip-flop between the two throughout the book, right up to the very end. Once again, though, the rest of the book was so engrossing that my annoyance lasted for only a few fleeting moments.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you enjoy dystopian stories filled with surprises at every turn, this book (and, this series, thus far) is for you. I only gave The Hunger Games three stars...in a word, meh. But having read this second book makes reading the first that much more worth your time.

B007V508CC|1.0|An album... sorry - a \\"product\\" created in a boardroom not in a recording studio. Totally void of any emotional depth and completely creatively vacuous, to me this represents everything that is wrong with US music. Its only raison d'etre is to create fame and money for a \\"band\\" that is totally run its course and simply out of all ideas musically.<br /><br />The most reprehensible thing about this band and the product they have made is that it assumes people that buy modern pop music are stupid and spurn interesting, creative, emotionally astute, beautifully crafted pop songs.<br /><br />I get not everyone wants to listen to intense, sometimes dark, difficult complex songs, but there is a wealth of amazing, intelligent, beautifully crafted sheer pop songs out there. There is simply no excuse for a record like this and there is no defense for making a product as blatantly commercial, uninspired and dumbed down as this and having the gall to pass it off as music.

0345803485|1.0|How is this even a bestseller? I can't tell you what the book is about - I don't even think it's about anything. I'm pretty sure that it was written by a 15-year-old that has watched her mother in an abusive relationship, thinking that she understands what love is about. I'll be completely honest: I only got 25% into it, and I wanted to throw my phone. I resisted, as it is a $200 phone, but there is absolutely nothing about it that made me want to pick it back up. I can tell you that Christian has gray eyes ::nods:: and he is a 26/27 year old billionaire (must be nice). It was one of the only books that I thought to myself, \\"I could write it better\\" ... but I hated it so much that I don't want to rewrite it.<br />If I was the editor, I would have sent it back with a big red F on it and a note that said, \\"Try Again.\\"

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I tried to be the submissive Christian Grey wanted me to be. I wanted the pain to become pleasure. I wanted to submit without asking questions. I wanted to treat this book like pure escapism and suspend my disbelief at the 26 yo billionaire (could he have at least been something more fathomable like a 34 yo billionaire?) wanting to become involved with awkward 21 yo who just can't see how beautiful she is; but it would have to be the relentless referrals to inner goddess, cartwheeling subconscious and the vagina as \\"down there\\" that kept jerking me back into reality of how poorly written this book was.<br /><br />I was willing to give up plot and character development for fun light summer reading but in almost every paragraph there was something incredulous that just wouldn't allow me to submit to this fantasy. Why was her mother telling her to stay out all night and have sex with a \\"boyfriend\\" she just heard of and met? Why was her father/ step-father ok with a man he literally found out she had been seeing for 3 weeks buying her a brand new car? Did Audi and Mac pay for advertising space by the way? Why doesn't a 21 yo in college in 2011 have a cellphone, an email address? Is she supposed to be penniless because how the author describes her parents they seem middle class? Why doesn't she have a dress to her name (certainly she could have found 1 or 2 at H&M instead of borrowing her roommate's)? Why has she never shaved her legs or armpits (that's kind of a big cultural no-no in the US) and did she really need her roommate's help for that? And dear God why ad nauseam sex scenes with \\"quivering, quickening and hitching of breath\\"?  Shockingly bad and tedious at times.<br /><br />And then there were the things that completely turned me off from the book: Christian's demanding that Ana eat on command and not so much as roll her eyes was revolting. The tampon scene was beyond cringe inducing. Should I be glad he didn't have to throw off a used sanitary pad?<br /><br />Darn this intrusive brain of mine but I just couldn't submit to this drivel.Darn this intrusive brain of mine but I just couldn't submit to this drivel.

B004EAQNO4|1.0|I sincerely enjoy terrible horror movies. They are my form of high art. I cook a nice dinner and crack wise the whole time, and the result is usually funnier than most comedies. When I saw a preview for this film I tried to explain it to a friend: \\"M-Night. 5 people in an elevator, and one of them... is the devil.\\" Sounded like it was right up my alley. The beginning is just fine, by which I mean terrible, but the rising action and anticlimax are simply awful. It seems like M-Night predicted I would be watching this movie, so instead of tying together the pieces (of something smelling like the devil), the writer/producer/whatever decided to deny me what I so richly deserved-- and the result is pretentious loose ends without a hope for any kind of enjoyment. No wonder I fell asleep the first time, then forgot I ever watched this flick in the first place.
B0068FZ16O|5.0|This movie is so revealing about the horrors of the tricks our mind can play on us.  Russell Crowe is brilliant.  It also shows that medicine has a long<br />  way to go in addressing these problems.

B006RUJST6|4.0|This was a solid and easy to read book. It was neither repetetive nor unbelievable. Overall it was entertaining, and if asked by a stranger would I recommend it, I would say yes. The one thing that made my skin crawl was the way she referenced the Avett Brothers band throughout the book. I thought that was incredibly lame. Especially after going on YouTube and watching some of their music videos. Yeah, we get it, you like this stupid band. Do you really need to make them a focal point of your book. In my opinion the Avett Brothers references is what makes this book merely okay instead of something really special.
B005K17RU0|5.0|User friendly. Has everything I wanted and more! I would recommend it for anyone who travels or likes to keep up on the weather in other cities, like maybe were other family stays!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Im not trying to say anything new here, but I need to reaffirm what a piece of garbage this book was. It was an absolute chore to finish. The author's repetitive phrasing, the fact that every character murmurs like a jackass, and the labored use of \\"big\\" words plucked out of the thesaurus were all just too much. I'm angry I wasted money on this book and even angrier that the author is rich off this nonsense.<br /><br />Interestingly, I've noticed something funny in my personal observations of people who have read this book. The few folks I know in real life who read and loved this book were all very, if not morbidly, obese females who were poorly educated and without a significant other. Maybe this author is actually a clever genius who purposely marketed this book to this swelling demographic.
0345803485|5.0|I did not intend to read this book, however no matter how much I refused to acknowledge it, it was everywhere! I would turn on a talk show it was there, magazine covers, book blogs, even work. I am ashamed to say thatI judged this book before I read it as just what it was being called \\"mommy Porn\\". In the end I will admit that although it was very descriptive and sexual there was much more substance to this story than I thought. I found my self finding understanding  my own self through the thoughts and ideas of my own that I felt shame in.<br /><br />Did this book have a profound change on my life good or bad.. yes!, I find that I will be more open to the things I can't relate to and less judgmental of not only myself but of others in there choices and lifestyles.<br /><br />There were times the writing was a bit repetitive or young as I have heard it called but I learned some valuable lessons while enjoying the ride.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing!! Fell in love and couldn't wait to read the next one. It is an exciting story that I found myself completely absorbed in!!! Everyone should read this, it is an adventure you can't put down. I loved the movie too, love Jennifer Lawrence!!
0385006896|5.0|I bought this book for 3.99, from a bargain bin in a bookstore within a mall--both of which are long gone. I was 16 and we had two TV stations that barely could be picked up by the rabbit ears. As such, books were my life--my room was wall to wall books picked up from used book stores, or the bargain.<br />I must say, that when I bought this, I did not start reading the novels, feeling they were too long. Instead, I tucked into the stories, relishing tales such as The Musgrave Ritual, Shoscombe Old Place, and the Creeping Man. Doyle's use of quotes within quotes within quotes always fascinated me as well, especially in the Musgrave Ritual (though it could be quite annoying at times!)<br /><br />My copy, like that of others, is pretty worn, ragged, and marked in spots (at one point I went through all and wrote down the original publication and date.) It wasn't until years later that I read the novels, re-read the stories, then re-read the novels again! Often I will watch one of the movies with Jeremy Brett, then read the story/novel again.<br /><br />These are timeless and wonderful. There are some good lessons in deduction as well, and Holmes' manner of deduction was classic. I remember, as a 17 year old kid, asking a woman if her husband liked beer... when she sheepishly replied and asked \\"why?\\" I didn't respond. But the scratches on the lock of the garage door, coupled with a worn first step, and a fridge in the garage, with a folded-up carton of Bud Lite gave things away. What I really wanted to ask, was, \\"is your husband a drunk?\\", to which the response would have also been yes, but I sure wasn't Holmes!<br />Highly recommended. Along with, this, for those of us who are detail freaks: [[ASIN:0517481022 The Annotated Sherlock Holmes: The Four Novels and Fifty-Six Short Stories Complete]]
0393339815|4.0|This book had me laughing all the way through. Such a testament to the writing that this many years later it is still one of the most entertaining books out their. Very funny, such a British farce. The british speaking style takes a minute to get used to but after that you are along for the very funny ride.
1558908323|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie it's a cool mix between sci-fi and horror over all I am very pleased with my purchase and the movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I gasped out loud at the end of each of the five stories.  I've been talking it up to everyone I know.  Simply an amazing (collection of) book(s).  I don't normally read sci-fi, so maybe people who are immersed in the genre would not find this as fascinating and original as I did, but judging by the other comments here, most of them agree with me.  It's destined to be a classic, and not just genre-fiction classic, but honest-to-god, kids should read this in school kind of classic.  Read it now so you won't be the last person you know to have done so.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Works great on my Droid. But can't finish a puzzle on my Kindle Fire. Get half way through s puzzle and it jumps to another puzzle. Disappointing!
B003H9MSPG|3.0|While having some positives, like an ambidextrous \\"Bolt-action\\", the Longstrike doesn't really live up to its name. Having several Nerf guns, I found that it was much more worthwhile to do some \\"modding\\" with the grip/bipod from the Stampede, and the scope from one of my older Nerf rifles. It may not get much better for warring, but it looks a lot cooler with these rail attachments.
B007STXHTM|2.0|I received the dive housing directly from GoPro (couldn't wait for Amazon's 1-3 months of estimated shipping times due to a family vacation).<br /><br />Pro's<br />- it works - doesn't let the camera get wet although you'll want the floaty backpack or something like that to keep it off the bottom of the ocean if you drop it.<br />- underwater, it is great.  Colors are clear, very realistic.<br /><br />Con's<br />- it shipped with a lot of dust inside and it is impossible to clean.  No guidance from GoPro despite many attempts.<br />- there is no service from GoPro.  If anyone can actually get an email back from them or for them to answer the phone, please let me know how.<br />- When you come from below the water to above, the water doesn't clear from the front element.  So you'll get water droplets / distorted pics when you try to take pics from above the water.  And it isn't easy to get the water droplets off of the front element.<br /><br />So the lack of support to go along with the cons leave me with a thumbs down.  If I get a call back from GoPro, I'll update this review.<br /><br />________________<br /><br />Update:  I received a replacement housing after going around with GoPro for a few months.  The second housing was clean and clear.  No dust to be found.<br /><br />And I can now come up from underwater and the front element actually clears.  I never meant that there'd be no water on it at any time, just that the droplets wouldn't fall off or couldn't be wiped off unless you had a dry towel (don't know where I'd find that while snorkeling).  The new one works, so maybe there was a problem in production where some defects were left on the front housing.<br /><br />Now that there's a GPIII, you don't need this (since it comes with a flat front lens - finally) but if you have a GPII, it's a great addition when it works.

1932735410|4.0|Bought this recently and read once, not yet attempted the exam. So review might change latter, but so far below is my observation.<br /><br />Pros: Good quality of chapter end questions, focus more on exam, few additional concepts that are not covered by PMBOK & Head First that are required for exam.<br /><br />Cons: Presentation of material is not intersting when compared to Head First.  Also doesn't give clear picture of ITTO when compared to PMBOK, Head First etc, but instead just a plain explanation.  Disconnect from PMBOK terminology and also lot of negative tone which is unnecessarily distracts and wastes lot of time.
B006S053K8|3.0|If you were in high school in 1987 there will be scenes you forget it's a movie and swear you're just back in 1987.  Everyone else can probably skip this movie.  Bored hot girls at a minimum wage job are looking to momentarily amuse themselves with certain guys, give the finger to others, or both.  It captures the \\"in and out of love\\" roller coaster that was so common in girls of that era.  They just happen to find our nerdy hero the least repulsive among a variety of repulsive dudes.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Download was quick and easy! All of the books Ive ever wanted are found on Kindle.Amazon made the experience simple. This is an excellent product
0061726834|4.0|I bought this book on a whim. I know, I know, don't judge a book by its cover but i thought it was pretty so i bought it teehee :) The beginning of the book was very slow moving. The author writes beautifully without a doubt, but I really felt that she made the main character spend too much time describing things and over thinking. You can easily skip a few pages without missing the meat of the story. There were definitely times when I got extremely irritated with Lena (the main character) for being so naive. And I honestly did not think she was that good of a friend to her \\"bestfriend\\" Hana. She almost hated Hana for being rebellious when in the end she commits the ultimate rebellion. And she never apologizes for the way she treated her either O_o but they came to an understanding in the end (i guess).<br />Also it surprised me how persistant Alex was even though Lena was down right mean to him. But I guess that's a personal pet peeve of mine when kids like each other but are conflicted with their feelings so they act like they hate the person they really like. whatever.<br />All in all I think this was an enjoyable read though. You grow to like Lena throughout the story and understand some of her hateful feelings because of all the things going on in her life. The book doesn't really pick up until the end but I personally can't wait to read the second story.<br />I've noticed how some reviewers complain about the \\"background story\\" of the dystopian society and whatnot but I feel the book is perfectly fine the way it is. Not all dystopian novels have to relate to our current government and society. Stop over analyzing and and take it for what it is, people! That's the world THEY live in. If the author wanted to relate it, she would have. And this is a trilogy. She could cover more background in the other two novels, who knows?<br />If you like love stories, this book is for you.<br />If you like suspense in what's coming next (for the trilogy), this book is for you.<br />If you do not like slow paced books, move along and find another book.<br />If you want all your background info about the society being read about all at once, move along and find another story.
0316044695|4.0|I recently retired from the Marines, and have been reading a lot of military memoirs.  This one has quite the story behind it.  Marcus Luttrell is an amazing man, and was an impossible situation.  He was a SEAL dropped in to do a mission to find a killer.  The problem was that there were innocent people watching, and it was either kill the innocent, or let the killer kill more of them, his brothers in arms included.  It the perfect illustration of the impossibility of war, that killing or not killing both result in innocent people dying.  The story starts off with how he became a SEAL, which is good if you have never read anything about SEALs, but doesn't add much to the genre if you have read books like this before.  It is the actual mission for which he is famous that is engaging.  I'm guessing it was so attractive to publishers that they let the author (or ghost writer) get away with the writing.  It's not bad, but it also isn't Jarhead.  The book is definitely worth reading, but probably would have been better if it had started in the middle and dealt more with the consequences after the mission.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy is just absolutely amazing! I had a hard time putting the books down and read all three in exactly one week. I wish there were more!
080214473X|5.0|This is a rarity in military writing lately, an essentially engaging military story combined with really good writing.  I say that as someone who is retired military, and who has been reading nothing but this type of book lately.  I read Jarhead, and loved the writing, but found myself constantly thinking that the writer really didn't have much of a story to tell other than being a screw up.  I went through several books by special forces authors, and decorated heroes, and was glad I learned their stories, but also wishing they had spent more time in writing class.  In Black Hawk Down, you can't ask for a more critical military situation - surrounded, outnumbered, a rescues mission gone bad, with all the politics and impossibility of war swirling around, and solders who lay down their lives for their brothers in arms.  Their actions truly deserved the Medal of Honor, and unlike so many other books that start with the best stories, this one actually included good writing.  The book isn't perfect, but it is a classic.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was anxious to read this as it was so publicized . The writing leaves quite a bit to be desired. As a matter of fact it is so poor that it is distracting. The sex scenes are hot...red hot! Does one outweigh the other?? Dunno, undecided about the second book.

B000IZA9NK|4.0|WARNING- Spoiler (not plot, just character setting)<br />Seeing Gwyneth as the wickedly secretive mischievous trouble-maker and Jolie as the one who always turns up to come to the rescue is a fun and different twist for these two actors. Jude Law, as always, is predictably unpredictable.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm always rooting for writers with non-traditional starts and I read that this book started out as Twilight fan fiction and is the author's first.  This shows in both good and bad ways.  I had a very mixed reaction to the book and would have to say I'm of two minds about it.  First the parts I didn't like:<br /><br />-I agree with others that Christian Grey sure doesn't seem like he does much other than obsess over the narrator; not plausible as this high powered businessman and the author's descriptions of his beauty and his various attributes seem pretty juvenile and goofy (yup, he's a billionaire, philanthropist, pianist, pilot, etc.).  Yes, it's meant to be a romantic fantasy but still.  It's often the average things about people that make them so lovable<br />-I also noticed how repetetive the writing was with countless uses of the phrases \\"oh, my\\" and other less than creative ways of expressing the narrator's reactions<br />-OK, I personally find the ways the Grey characer controls the narrator to be classic domestic violence behaviors and to me, definately not a turn on<br />-The sex scenes and bondage-y type encounters are pretty corny; there were times I laughed out loud<br />-It's pretty evident that it's Twilight inspired; everyone steals from Stephenie Meyer and then for some reason, she gets dismissed a ton too (in the case of this book, it's almost the same scenarios with Jake and Mike type characters waiting in the wings for the Bella character; the Bella character being saved from injury early in the encounters by the Edward character; the list goes on)<br /><br />The parts I enjoyed:<br />-I found it really entertaining; time passed quickly when I was reading and I remained engrossed<br />-I've never understood S&M but it was handled well enough that I actually found myself intellectually interested in it like a puzzle; I sorta maybe got why some people might find it fulfilling and nothing else I've ever read or any depiction of it I've seen intrigued me at all (granted, I haven't seen or read much on the topic)<br />-Along with the previous, the narrator was a real enough character that I found that I cared about her reactions to things and I appreciated her process as she thought about what she was being groomed into (and yes, I do think it's grooming when someone is super seductive to you and then will only engage when the relationship caters to his needs)<br />-The author tries to set up a backstory for Grey involving childhood abuse; it wasn't the best or most developed but I think a backstory always helps a bit; however, this is a missed opportunity because the author certainly could have explored his vulnerability more (starting w/ the fact that the narrator could and probably would leave him at any point for how shut down he was)<br />-Like Twilight, I definately get the feeling the author wrote this story for her own amusement and fantasy; this shows a bit and I ;think this might be what gives it it's moments of credibility and interest; like I said, I'm always rooting for self starting writers and often, they can be really talented (Cassandra Clare is a good example, IMO)<br />-The emails between the characters are a nice riff on the epistolary form that was so popular in British lit, which is often cited by the narrator throughout the story; when the narrator addresses her emails to Sir Grey, I think a bit of the letters in Austen or perhaps more in keeping with this story, Samuel Richardson's Clarissa<br /><br />All in all, I wouldn't warn anyone against this because it is entertaining (though obviously not appropriate for children).  But don't expect great literature.  Although I doubt anyone reading this does and also doubt that was the author's original intent.

0446572993|4.0|The United States has many enemies and sometimes they think they can hide behind the political curtain when planning ways to harm the United States and their citizens. Ribbie is an American assassin who is used to eliminate targets he's been given.<br /><br />Somehow, the last target didn't fit in with his usual assigned kills. The woman lives near his office and when he enters her apartment, he finds her asleep, holding her child. Robbie is talking to his handler through an earphone and refuses the hit. However, the woman is killed by Robbie's handler who was monitoring Robbie's actions from an apartment across the street.<br /><br />Thinking he's been set-up, he has to make an escape from his own people. Unsure of who to trust, he gets on a bus and comes into contact with a fourteen-year-old girl. Robbie doesn't pay too much attention but his instinct makes him notice a man following the girl and then making a move to kill her. Robbie intervenes and he and the girl, Julie Getty, get off the bus. Moments later, the bus is blown up and only Robbie and Julie survive.<br /><br />In an action packed story, Robbie learns that Julie was trying to escape an intolerable foster care situation and that her parents had recently been murdered.<br /><br />The story of Robbie's betrayal and Julie's parents' murder, come together with excellent drama. While Robbie usually works by himself, he finds that it isn't safe to leave Julie on her own so he acts outside of his normal mode of operation.<br /><br />David Baldacci has written a finely crafted and provoking book about the intelligence operaion in the United States. It will leave the reader breathless. Both Robbie and Julie are excelltly drawn and fully developed characters with Julie being in the mode of the wonderful Lisbeth Sandler of Steig Larsson's novels.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

0812993292|4.0|THE UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE OF HAROLD FRY is a short book about a sixty-five year old man's six hundred mile journey from the extreme South to the extreme North of England.  He makes this trip to visit a dying friend he had not heard from for twenty years until she sent him a goodbye letter from a hospice where she is suffering with cancer.  Harold could have driven or taken another form of transportation to see his old friend Queenie but he is convinced that by walking the distance he will keep her alive.  He soon attracts publicity and other walkers who join him. The reader also learns that Harold has been emotionally separated from his wife of many years for some time even though the two of them remain living together.  Apparently this rift was caused by some disappointment with their once promising son who they have not seen in twenty years.  Hints are also left that  Queenie  performed some kind of service at cost to herself to save Harold at around that same time as the problems with his wife begin.  All about that mystery is revealed by the book's ending.<br /><br />Harold meets many interesting and often unique people in his journey and recalls  memories of his unhappy childhood and his once happy marriage.  Some of these characters and incidents are well drawn and memorable while others never seem to come totally alive.  The book has some important things to say and is as they often say \\"life-affirming\\".  However it still doesn't quite come to the level of a five star \\"must read\\".

034580404X|5.0|Purchased thru Amazon and I've read 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy the first time 3 months ago.  I am currently reading it again.  Iam glad I purchased the set.  Its a good thing to get the whole kit-n-kabootle at once.  I sincerely am telling you, it was the best read in a long time.  This lead me to purchase the Kindle.  I will most likely download the book there too!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon.
0345803485|4.0|I believe anyone who's either a Twilight fan or an erotic romance lover will most likely dig this book. Personally I read it for the first reason and for all of those who think of Twilight fans as either horny teenagers or bored, unsatisfied housewives, well... I'm neither. I'm also an avid reader in 3 languages, although never in this genre.<br />So knowing beforehand that 50 shades started as Fan fiction I didn't really have high expectations. Maybe that's why I did not concentrate on its literary insufficiency. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that even if there are many resemblances with the main characters' personalities, the story is something completely different to Twilight.<br />This is my first erotic romance ever, so learning about all the BDSM \\"kinky fu**ery\\" was also something new and kind of exciting and I believe that's what makes you relate to Anastasia and also what makes you become completely intrigued by Christian.<br />It is true that at one point I got sick and tired of reading \\"Holy sh*t\\", \\"Inner goddess\\" and \\"Oh my\\" so many freaking times. But when I decided to overlook those details and started thinking of the \\"inner goddess\\" as a secondary character, the story really got to me, as well as the development of the characters.<br />I decided to write this review because I believe the book created so much noise that many people plunge right into it expecting something that it's not. It is very repetitive and poorly written. This is not an English literature classic. It is an erotic romance Fan fiction and in the end it is not super hot sex or an elaborate language that will keep your interest. It is the story, and the deep evolution of the characters.<br />So have that in mind if you choose to read it. It is what it is, and EL James told her story based on existing characters but giving them their individuality. She managed to make them endearing in their own way, completely separate from Edward and Bella. They become Ana and Christian in a completely new and wonderful love story.<br />After reading this trilogy I got definitely curious about the erotic romance genre, thinking that there should be something better written out there. So I started my quest with the highest rated books in Amazon. After reading a few of them, I concluded that there are in fact more literary, more naughty and less repetitive erotic romances. But I found that most of the plots are utterly predictable, an excuse to justify the sex, the characters have no development, their actions are unjustified, too much unnecessary drama, and are ultimately very boring.<br />I will continue my search for something \\"more\\", but I have to say that up until now Fifty Shades is IN IT'S KIND the best STORY I've read.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|Yea yea, I'm a woman, got sucked into this trilogy craze. Prob won't bother with last book. Whew, it's pathetically redundant-seriously it's the same old same old in every situation for this couple. It's weird, but character development is so poor you can't even picture what these two look like. For a quick beach read it might be worth borrowing (do NOT waste a penny!) but don't expect Harry Potter or even Twilightish writing ( and Twilight was fairly poorly written too but puts this series to shame! Also, does anyone else see EXACT simarities to Bella and Edward almost? It's like two 15 year olds had a writing sleepover and they came up with these four ridiculous characters-Bella/Edward and Ana/Christian). Anyway, I'd give this a D+

B0069UP2PI|3.0|Although this film might appear to be a slightly more sophisticated take on the deadly virus meme than, say, \\"Outbreak\\"--and featuring an A-list ensemble cast--it is actually something a bit more peculiar than that: it's a film in which the protagonist never actually appears. That protagonist is, of course, the virus itself.<br /><br />Although every character's story revolves around the deadly outbreak--from the unfortunate Patient Zero (Gwyneth Paltrow) to the compassionate WHO doctor (Marion Cotillard) to the earnest CDC investigator (a disturbingly stiff Kate Winslet) to the muckraking blogger (Jude Law) who sees a conspiracy at work --the film tells the story of the virus: its insinuation into the world population, the havoc it wrecks on humanity, the race to find a vaccine, and the ultimate resolution. Steven Soderbergh creates an appropriate sense of chaotic detachment, mirroring what in all likelihood would actually happen in the event of such an outbreak, and he quite realistically depicts the almost bureaucratic way in which such a pandemic would be \\"managed,\\" leaving us with a sense that a global viral outbreak would prove to be more than \\"just\\" a health crisis. What is most chilling about this film is its eerie verisimilitude and its uncanny portrayal of business-as-usual amidst the calamity of a global catastrophe.

B005FITIDC|5.0|This movie is probably the best I've seen all year, and it's definitely the best Gerard Butler movie I have ever seen.  This movie was adapted from a book about a real life situation going on in Africa and a man from America dedicating his life to helping the orphaned children there.<br /><br />Gerard plays Sam Childers, a heroin addicted ex con biker with an attitude, who after killing a man decides to change his ways and go to church.  He then turns it all around and opens his own business and starts his family.  He volunteers for a mission to Sudan and after staying there and seeing all the violence taking place there.  He decides to go back and try to open an orphanage there.  But as you watch the movie you will see all the hardships and torture this man goes through to help these kids.<br /><br />This movie is action packed and inspiring, it will make you cry as well.  It's simply amazing I don't understand why this movie hasn't gotten more recognition, I haven't heard anyone talking about it.  What makes this movie even more amazing is that this is actually taking place to this day, and they couldn't have found a better guy to play Sam than Gerard in my opinion.<br /><br />So I highly recommend this movie to anyone who isn't easily grossed out by blood and guts and can handle watching child deaths.  It will take your breath away.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app! I had no problem putting in my location. And its pretty accurate! I like that it shows the radar screen and that you can change the colors of the thingy on the bottem of the screen. Get this app!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun and I love it I play it all the time I like how you can unlock it and you don't have to bey it.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Prior to recent updates, I would have given it 4.5 stars. Now, the app runs w/o starting it, zapping battery &amp; memory space. Have several task killers specifically to keep shutting it down.<br /><br />Samsung Epic
B007PTJOV0|5.0|sometimes on my kindle fire it shows this black line on the side so I turn my kindle off and it still didn't work!!!!!!!!!!!  so then I deleted the game and reinstalled it and now it works&iexcl;!!&iexcl;!!&iexcl;  yayayayaya
B003SNJYSK|3.0|This is the fourth Harry Hole novel that I read and by far the least interesting. The plot device of jumping between WWII and the turn of the Millennium doesn't work and I found it annoying. The parts set in Norway were well written, as always, but for me the historical part was very distracting. Worst of all, for me, was a plot twist that I cannot reveal which I feel was not playing fair by the reader. I will read more Harry Hole novels but this one was nowhere near as good as others (Snowman, Leopard, Redeemer) in Nesbo's otherwise consistently excellent series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app, it has helped my whole family to get into the word and I can remember more of it because I can hear it as I read it. I also love the feature that reminds you and keeps track of what you have read, also gives you many different ways to learn God's word. Good job on this one. :0)
0425263908|4.0|I loved Bared to You I was having withdrawals after reading fifty shades trilogy, I recommend this book highly it was a great story line and I can't wait until October to read the next book.
B007DIQC90|5.0|What a very eclectic and unique sound OMAM produces. I really enjoy the smooth vocals and very much look forward to seeing this band perform live sometime soon! I strongly suggest this album for anybody and it would make a great gift!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this ap.  I use it everyday!!  the daily devotionals are wonderful and I love being able to share them.
B0089AF2DS|5.0|THIS IS BARONESSES BEST ALBUM RELEASE TO DATE.  MUSICALLY THEY HAVE ALL BEEN GOOD, BUT THE GUY SINGING DOESN'T SOUND LIKE HE HAS A DRUMSTICK SHOVED UP HIS BUTT ON THIS ONE.
0345529057|4.0|Placed the order Sunday evening, received email it was shipped Monday, it was on my porch Tuesday when I came home from work. All with standard cheap shipping! The box set contains the first four books of the series. The case for all 4 novels is thin cardstock, flapped & folded, no glued seems. The novels' paper and cover quality is lower grade. With care, these will withstand at least 5 re-readings. Overall, decent deal for the price. If you want quality books though, spend the money & buy the hardbacks. I wanted the story at a reasonable price and am happy with what I received and am exceptionally pleased with the speed of shipping!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Looked like the game may be fun. However on the HTC vivid the screen don't scroll when ya try with the arrows. Therefore impossible to complete the puzzle . If it is fixed will try again and re rate the app higher.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Would have fun with this if the game board actually fit on my HTC screen. I can't find a way to scroll over.
0345803485|4.0|I had seen the cover of Fifty Shades.., of course, but it was my Mum who told me what the books were about! She hadn't read them but apparently I live in a cave. I myself read all genres so with piqued curiosity I gave these a go. I think it helped immensely to have an open mind with zero expectations going in. That said I was actually surprised there was character depth with Mr. Grey revealing the Whys behind his ways. I also found it very refreshing to have the male being \\"fifty shades\\" instead of the woman for once. It made me more empathetic and interested to read on, to find out his reasoning. This is fiction, folks, romantic fiction at that. It's a fantasy feel good that dives a little into a damaged psyche (whom we've all known at one time or another) and the hardships of an explosive budding relationship. Yes it gets daunting and repetitive for me at times, but overall this trilogy is an interesting read. Think 9 1/2 Weeks meets Thomas Crown Affair meets Pretty Woman and you've got it. Remember, this may have some parallels to Twilight but it is NOT YA nor for the prudish or faint of heart. As for S&M, it only skims the surface in order to bring Mr. Grey's afflictions to light. So if you want something a little different to heat things up like an erotic soap opera, then Fifty Shades.. is your read this Summer!
0439813786|5.0|I finally got my hands on this book after years of being curious about it this past fall because the movie was coming out and I fell head over heels in love with it. I inhaled it over the course of a night and just poured over ever single page because the illustrations are just so intricately and beautifully drawn! There are so many gorgeous little details and you can't help but just run your hands over the pages because everything looks so real! It is absolutely stunning.<br /><br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a story told in mostly pictures with a few short paragraphs here and there. There are lots of inferring going on while reading this story and it was such a different, but incredibly enjoyable reading experience. The story itself is heartwarming and full of adventure.<br /><br />My favorite illustrations were of the bookstore (of course). For those of you who don't know me very well, I am a tad bit obsessed with beautiful bookshelves. (Check out my \\"Bookshelf Monday\\" feature here and my beautiful bookshelves board on Pinterest.) I can't imagine how much time Selznick took to illustrate all the pages of this book because every page is chock-filled with details, right down to each spine of the books. I wanted to LIVE in this book.<br /><br />In my opinion, being able to accurately draw the human body (especially the face) is one of the hardest things to do, but Selznick does it so effortlessly and it's a true ode to his talent as an artist. Even the details in the eyes are so expressive that you feel like you are looking into the character's soul.<br /><br />Selznick is an amazing artist and writer. The Invention of Hugo Cabret is so deserving of the Caldecott Award. If you haven't had a chance to read this book, go get it NOW because you are seriously missing out!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|If you are a collector, you must have it. Excellent movie and extras in a well finished case. I recommend it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|great for past time play while sitting in the airport or on the train; bus trip or long car drive
0307744434|5.0|A book that hooks you right away and is impossible to put down. Addictive storyline and characters you actually care about. Loved this book and highly recommend it.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I love this cd! Perfect for jaming out in your car, with the windows down and sunglasses on. I love Phil Collins anyways this is a great collection and the quaility is fantastic its a must cd
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Too early to review this all properly. Too busy to spend enough time reading it, but what I have read so far is fascinating. I have watched the first 2 seasons of Game Of Thrones and yet reading the book I am still eager to know what happens even though I have already watched it on the small screen, so I think this is a testament to Martin's writing ability. I love the way each chapter is dedicated to an individual character, and at the same time still manages to promote the story line. My favourite characters are definitely Arya, Tyrion and Daenerys. The detail is immaculate. Having seen these characters visually it is amazing how closely all the actors are to replicating the characters in the book. So a lot of respect has been accorded to the author. Hopefully in a long while when I have completed the book I can give a more detailed review. But I will dare to say that this is the biggest thing in Fantasy Writing since The Lord Of The Rings.
0345803485|2.0|I'm so happy I read this book -- only because it led me to this page of hilarious and spot-on reviews. My inner goddess is doing a cartwheel!!<br /><br />At least the book moved quickly. And now, it's time to move on to something that's actually been edited before its release.<br /><br />My inner goddess agrees.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This was the first game I loaded onto my first Kindle.  It is also the first app I put on my second Kindle.  Yes,  the ads are there but I don 't mind dealing with them because the game is free.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is such a cool game ........im addicted to it ............i do winning deal all the time  ..............id recomend it to anyone who like cool games like this
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I used to love this app; I have recommended it to friends and colleagues many times. However, the most recent update wiped out ALL of my history within the app. Having it read my Gmail and Facebook won't help much because SwiftKey was remembering common phrases/sentences I type within other apps. TouchType, what were you thinking? I am so frustrated with the app now. I also regret having recommended it to others. :(
B008JGSM6G|4.0|So far, way too easy.  Although its an interesting twist that's you have to fill in every block. 3 stars because I like these kinds of puzzle games
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I got this amazing series collection just in time! Now I can watch the original version of the last episode with the controversial George W. head on a stick. HBO is pitiful for discontinuing this to the point where they stopped selling it a couple of days after the news about George W's head on a stick was released in the mainstream. I mean, what did they do with the DVDs they took off of the market? Throw them away? As if the world needs more trash in its oceans.
0439023521|5.0|Great Book. Seeing the movie first helped me latch on to the book faster than if I had began without that background.  Get the trilogy.  You're going to want to continue with the story after finishing this first book.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|We really enjoyed the action in this movie, appeared to be more realistic than most other action type movies.  It is a little rough in some spots like when the bad guy used the drill on the lady, but otherwise it was good fun.
B007P6VLRS|3.0|This album sounds okay and I'll give it a little more time to grow on me, but I can't help but wonder what's the point every time I start it spinning. The honesty and adventure of the youthful albums is over, replaced by sorry, platitudinous lyrics and less-than-compelling music. It seems like a retread of old times at best, or exploration of avenues not worth exploring. Comparisons to post-Disintegration Cure are apt. I find Billy's 1998 work with Hole much more interesting than this; Machina was the last Pumpkins album as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Fiona Apple trounces Billy in the battle of long-awaited new albums.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excuse my writing but it comes from the heart.<br />Very good fiction saga. Starts with shocking surprises, very well written, you feel you are in the story. Looking forward to read the Wool 6 and other books from Mr. Howey Hugh.
B0089GQB28|4.0|You will not know what the title refers to until well into the movie, BTW.  Anyway, the cast does a great job, especially Paquin as the gifted and troubled teen who erupts in class and at her mother after witnessing a deadly accident in which she played a role. It takes a while for everything to unfold, so you need to be patient.<br /><br />There are some scenes that might not have needed to be there: the girl suddenly deciding she needs to lose her virginity; her extended outbursts in class; a debate between another student and a teacher about a line from Shakespeare, etc.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|I have read many of David Baldacci's books and thoroughly enjoyed this read. Some of his books are not as good  but this book is up there with his first published books.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run is an ok game but at some point to me it starts to get so boring add more stuff............(make it fascinating so you will be FAMOUS.!!!!!!!!!!
081095415X|5.0|We saw a Nick Brandt photography exhibit, and had to have one of his books.  His photography is beautiful and moving.  The book does not disappoint.  It is very nicely printed.  Nothing beats seeing Brandt's images in gallery size - they are huge prints, some 5'x5' - but I can't afford those.  The book is a nice reminder of his beautiful work.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This was the fourth book in a series.  I would read anything Diana writes.  Am buying the fifth book now.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Back to the one and only field monitor cans. Working as a FOH engineer, I need a monitoring tool that brings details through a hell of noise. Also, there is a need to understand balances in the mix - frequency- and level-wise. These cans play the mid frequencies precisely enough to detect and locate problems. - The only weakness is the low frequency range where it gets a bit un-precise and \\"muddy\\". Plus, there is some dip in the highmid-range (around 3-4 kHz) which is not too bad - this helps details cutting through in noisy environments. - Compact through fold-ability, I very much like to take them along with me everywhere I go.
B00335EQ3Q|4.0|Just got the Special Edition DVD, and I have to say I was disappointed. It only has two new features, a 22 minute documentary outlining the journey from a drama student project in the early 80's to the Cannes Film Festival, which is mostly Baz Luhrman narrating. Plus there's a deleted scene. ONE deleted scene. (What the heck does \\"dweezy\\" mean? Google was no help). Why not put a video of the stage play on the DVD?<br /><br />The commentary track is the same as the one on the 2002 DVD release. I would have loved a new commentary track from the cast (Luhrmann can talk your ear off which is great in a commentary, but he often talks over his two colleagues which gets annoying at times), and more deleted scenes would have been awesome. Or at least outtakes. I also noticed they corrected one of the gaffes:  the scene where Scott & Fran dance on the roof for the first time showed a crew member's head peeking over the roofline. This edition corrected that. Sloppily.<br /><br />If you're an uber SB fan like me, yeah, you should probably pick this up if you have the original version on DVD. This is one of my top five movies of all time, right up there next to Raiders of the Lost Ark, Aliens, and Blade Runner. But the 2002 DVD is probably a lot cheaper, and has almost all of the features of this new edition.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok its fun to play it does get boring sometimes I like free points I'm only doing this for the points
B0036JU6CY|4.0|I didn't give it a 5 star because it was a little to bloody/gasping for me but I LOVE karate movies. The nite fight scenes added suspense which I love also. :). Just a liiiiittle too graphic when a head got chopped off. Eeek!!
0345803485|2.0|Between the constant references to Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious,\\" I am starting to wonder if anyone else thinks this chic is schizophrenic? The way that the author writes the main character's internal thoughts makes me think she is 14, not 21 and a recent college grad. Somehow I managed to get through to the beginning of book 3 and cannot read anymore. There is clearly no character development with Ana as she has not matured one bit nor learned that her husband is seriously bipolar. Christian Grey can go from charismatic and playful to serious and brooding with a blink of the eye. As damaged as the author makes him out to be, it's quite miraculous that he learns to love in a matter of weeks.<br /><br />If you take out all the undeniably unrealistic sex, the persistent lip biting, the constant \\"tucks my hair behind my ear,\\" the obvious and underdeveloped story line, what you would end up with is barely 100 pages to spend a few hours on. Sure, Fifty is a mindless read but be forewarned that it is going to get real old real fast.
0345803485|1.0|I am simply horrified to see this book getting so much attention, and E.L. James growing richer by the second. The writing is tragically awful, the erotic scenes are boring, the characters are dull as dishwater. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
1416955070|5.0|These books are like a YA (but very different) version of the Harry Potter series. Some more romance and Clare doesn't skip the more violent/ gruesome scenes either. The books loosely follow the HP series, but the books have their own twists that make them unique. I would not say she was copying the HP's at at all, but maybe she got some inspiration from them.<br /><br />The verdict? The mortal instruments are the best books you'll ever read (better than HP)
B008645YEE|5.0|The soundtrack is just perfect, it goes to the soft and dark melodic themes of batman begins and to the chaotic and full of action of the dark knight, this soundtrack is just perfect.

B0026S93C0|4.0|This was a favorite of all of my girlfriends and I, and I was completely upset at my husband every time he would do the running man while singing \\" She's a maniac, maniac on the floor\\".  So like any self respecting child of the 80's , I made him watch it.  He finally, I hope, gets that there are some movies like this one, that mocking will only strengthen our love for that steel town girl.  Was as great as I remember!
0061808121|5.0|I just finished listening to this yesterday in my car.  Sissy Spacek is a wonderful reader.  To have her read ANYTHING to me in my car is a priceless treasure, but to listen to her rendition of To Kill a Mockingbird was truly an anti-doldrumine!  She (and Harper Lee) had me in tears more than once.  This reading of this venerable classic, an examination of racial prejudice and human interactions, is highly recommended!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a good app to have!!!!! I think everyone should get it....Its good to have...I love it its great to have..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was reluctant to write this review as there were 1337 reviews before it and it seemed a shame to change that number. As thease books are in fact leet. I haven't found myself holding my breath while reading in a long time, I found myself having to remind myself to breath almost immediately. Very great story going to check out the rest of this authors books
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Any fan of Downton Abbey, Cranford/Return To Cranford or Doc Martin will find Lark Rise to Candleford delightful.  The characters are crisp, appealing and varied. The ensemble works well together and the story lines are thoughtful and easily followed. There is day-to-day, humor and sadness--all in the day in the life of a village such as these. Anyone who can't get enough of Downton Abbey or Little House On The Prairie will be delighted with these communities and their inhabitants and their lives.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Hounded is an original mixture of humor and Irish folklore.  I love all mythology and folklore, but the Irish tales have always touched a special place in my heart.  Hounded is no exception.  Atticus is attempting to live a basically normal life.  Hiding from an ancient Irish god for the last 21 centuries, whom believes he has a right to possess a sword that Atticus has, is getting a little tiresome.  Atticus has made a decision to end this now and return to his normal life.  I mean...as normal as life can be when you have dog you can talk to and you are 2100 years old.  Atticus is loyal, funny, and pretty darn perky for someone that old.  I loved him.  He is just a go-with-the-flow kinda guy.  Ancient Irish god trying to kill him - Aye - goddesses manipulating him for their own agenda - Aye - still having a great time and cracking jokes - Aye -reviewer now thinking with an Irish accent - Aye.<br /><br />Atticus is accompanied by an array of paranormal creatures.  Witches, Werewolves, and Vampires..nothing is left out.  All of the paranormal's had a different twist and I felt that Mr. Hearne did an interesting thing here.  He made them care about money!  I mean think about it.  How many books have you read where the characters are motivated by money in any way, shape, or form.  It was a nice touch.  Mr. Hearne also used many references that I found seriously amusing (It was everything from Pantera to Kansas and Star Trek to South Park).  Hounded is a great book and a wonderful beginning to a series.  I loved all the characters and cannot wait to read more!<br /><br />I wanted to add that I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Hearne at a local signing last week.  He is just down to earth, funny, and as immature as I am.  So if you ever get a chance to go to a signing or visit him at an event - Do It!!<br /><br />I give Hounded 4 out of 5 Bullets!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|keep up the sales. those darn acorns are too hard to come by. can't keep buying them. scrat game needs to be more generous.
B00846F1YW|4.0|unless it is my kindle, the software sometimes does not work with the pinch and zoom.  I still enjoyed the game once I figured out how to get past some of the mini games. I will get mysteryville 3.
B007X4ECLY|3.0|Ever see \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\" the John Carpenter flick staring Kurt Russel? This movie basically takes Russel's wise-cracking character, Jack Burton - jokes, attitude, and all, and puts him on this space prison. Let's ignore all the idiotic plot holes (like simple forensics clearing all charges - being vague to avoid spoilers) or launching an attack from a distance to avoid defenses. Of hundreds of people having no problems without food or bathrooms.... Or perhaps 20 cops and hundreds of weapons. The list is seemingly endless.<br /><br />Special effects are decent, acting is totally B-movie, the script is awful, the premise is idiotic and the ships look like a 12 year old did the design work.  All that said, it's fun to watch a couple of times, but not worth buying unless it's on the dollar clearance rack.
0307949486|4.0|This would have been a 5 star review if the first part of the book wasn't so slow.  I found the subject matter disturbing but compelling, and the main characters riveting.  I would recommend this book for readers who enjoy suspense and don't mind some graphic violence thrown in.  It's nice to see a couple of strong female characters who don't need a man to save them from peril.
0143116738|5.0|This book is very well written.  We are using it to read at our school for preschool and lower elementary.  It very educational and not to long of a read.  It makes alot of good points.
1400052181|5.0|This book works on so many levels: as a medical history, a cultural history, the hard life of a black woman in the early to mid 20th century, and the inequities in American health care access.  Sounds so terribly dry, but this book is anything but dry.  The author managed to engross me in this tale of medical history and how it intersects with one family's story.  Like Henrietta Lacks, I had no idea that anyone who has ever had surgery may have those excised parts of themselves in a lab right now as part of an experiment.  Ms Skloot has taken a difficult subject and made it readable.
B005CYLSW8|1.0|Too quick, well scrubbed and relentless, not lingering anywhere to give us a glimpse of the noble.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought only one CD at the bargain price.<br /><br />I'm turning more and more to re-issues for the spiritual element --- so out of fashion these days.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I had already seen the movie before and the family enjoyed it so I decided to buy it. Received the movie very quickly with no problems.
034580404X|2.0|What is all the yak about these books?  Do not quite get the genre--romance????? The main characters have sex everywhere you can imagine in rapid succession. Each encounter is described with the same adjectives and emotion. Easy read and predictable. Would not recommend.
0439023513|5.0|The Hunger Games series are the books you can't put down and you don't want to end.  The 3rd book came in no time and was in great condition.  You would pay $12-$15 in the stores, but I would rather order it with free shipping along with other stuff in my wish list!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I don't use it as much as I should but it works very well when I do wish it had a calendar
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put these books down. OH WOW!! I have never read a book like this before and want more!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you build lots of things and its really awesome. like helping the animals and collecting money and feeding and the level up
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|As a retired 24 year U.S. Navy veteran, I greatly enjoyed \\"Act of Valor\\". The action was non-stop and very riveting. The fact that the \\"actors\\" were actual SEALS made the movie immeasurably more realistic and hard hitting. I highly recommend this movie for action fans.
0345803485|1.0|I can't believe I fell for all the hype about this book.. Just dragged myself thru chapter 5 and I just can't go on.. Decided to google \\"am I the only one who thinks fifty shades of grey is stupid\\".. Thank god there are others who agree with me..so lame.
B000EGF0NW|4.0|Lucky opens to Alice Sebold being grabbed from behind, drug into a tunnel, and forced to submit to a man's sexual advances. She is brutally beaten and raped. The story that follows is about avoiding her pain and healing, and how her life was forever changed by the attack. Some reviewers have declared this book a failure because she spends most of the book falling into one addiction or avoidance technique after another, never really allowing herself to recover. It took years of self-abuse and blame before Sebold found herself on the right track.<br /><br />I'm not going to say this book was an easy read even though I read the whole thing within 24 hours. There were places I literally thought I was going to throw up, and many places I felt like crying. Its very emotionally moving.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game because I love puzzle games if you are thinking about getting this game get you will love it. never juge a book by its cover thank you
1589795474|4.0|This is a good book filled with some good information.  It is somewhat of a boring read but the information makes up for it.  I have read many books on finance and this book is filled with information not covered in other books.
031620157X|5.0|This is the hilarious tale of twins Alex and Conner as they leave their world and find a foreign land of wonder and magic. An enjoyable adventure that combines modern day with the realm of fairy tales. Chris Colfer delivers a fun magical-mystical story, combining modern day with fairy-tale characters that the twins grew up with. The authors include mysterious powers and excitement as the twins face challenges to get back home. A fantasy children will adore. Highly Recommended!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|NO SPOILERS<br /><br />With any great TV show that continues for a few seasons, one begins to wonder whether it will start to lose it's zap.  I can tell you that Breaking Bad still has all of it's zap, and remains, for me, one of the best TV shows of all time.  I don't make that comment lightly; I have seen a lot of good shows, only a few of which I would call terrific, and I don't often give five stars.<br /><br />The pattern for this season is familiar.  Having resolved the cliff hanger at the end of the last season, there is a bit of catching their breath, or is it cleaning up the wreckage, or even more correctly building a grim \\"bottom\\" upon which to build the new story of the fourth season.  Things are REALLY bad, and really broken.  Broken Bad.  For me, it was at this point, in the ultra-grim second episode, that it was clear what the only possible solution could be.  I think this was deliberate, that they set the agenda, and indeed the outcome, of this season, early on.<br /><br />But it seemed quite impossible to get there.  How could they get there?  How WOULD they get there?  DO they indeed get there?  I won't answer these questions, because therein lies the joy, and the jolt, of watching this show.<br /><br />I can tell you that after the grim second episode, it's like getting into a train that begins to accelerate on shaky tracks, and going faster and faster.  Minute by minute, it seems like it is going to jump the tracks.  At times, it seems like it already has jumped those tracks.<br /><br />Eventually, the metaphorical train rushes, unstoppable, to the inevitable end of the season, and what a season climax it is.  What happens seems impossible, and I think it is, but they had lot of fun doing the impossible.<br /><br />If you're interested in the fun they had doing it, they have a documentary on just the season finale for your enjoyment after you finish the episodes, on the last disc of the DVD set.  Because this is one memorable season finale, with imagery you won't soon forget, and it's worth learning more about it.magery you won't soon forget, and it's worth learning more about it.

Written in Wodehouse's style Bertie finds his Aunt worshiping Cthulhu or something, excellent, beyond expectations. As for the actual comic books parts they weren't very good, but the stories written in different styles were so good.

1468161660|5.0|Within the first chapter of this novel it's obvious that Ms. Hoover has a skill for the written word.<br /><br />The story unfolds easily, the characters and their situations are believable and relatable. Layken, or Lake, is just a girl trying to recover from a life that isn't going how she'd planned. She feels helpless and as if she's losing everything important to her and in a sense...she is.<br /><br />Will, a charming yet very real guy that lives across the street, seems to effortlessly shake her from her sorrow just long enough for her to realize that she's still living...that there is hope of moving past the tragedies in her life. But when Will becomes untouchable, distancing himself from her and simultaneously putting loss center stage again, she's certain that she'll never find happiness in her new home.<br /><br />I am in love with Lake and Will's relationship. It's this tragic, kind of sexy, and totally touching connection between two young adults who have suffered far more than anyone should in a lifetime. It's easy to understand both sides and to understand the struggle that keeps them apart. Sometimes in books the conflict that keeps lovers apart is a flimsy and weak argument that ends up feeling drawn out and even more often, the characters draw out their happily ever after simply to reach a page count. This love story however doesn't feel drawn out and boring, nor does it seem forced. The factors all add up. Imagine that.<br /><br />Because I am self-published myself I need to take a little detour and point out that it is authors like Colleen Hoover that show us as readers and even those skeptics of self-publishing that a great novel doesn't need bells and whistles. It simply needs a talented author with the ability to tell a story worth remembering. I was, I'll admit, drawn in for the most part by the fact that Hoover self-published. Between the awesome reviews and the feeling of being a kindred spirit of sorts I knew that I HAD to read this book and it's sequel. It saddens me however to think of the readers who will jump on this bandwagon far too late to fully appreciate its worth. You know...when it's a best seller and about to become a major motion picture.<br /><br />So without talking this story up, because it certainly sells itself, I suggest that you, yes you skeptical reader of self-published works, and you also, reader who is open to any great piece of literature, to read this book NOW. Do not find excuses to read it \\"eventually\\" or keep it in the back of your mind to come back to later. This author and her novels are why we read in the first place.it's sequel.

0345803485|1.0|My husband wanted me to read this book for obvious reasons. I finished it in one day by skipping all the parts where she blushes and says \\"Oh, jeez\\". I read most of it right before bed and upon falling asleep, I had the most wonderful dream ever!! I dreamt I had 6 cats (yes, SIX!) although my husband only thought I had 3 because I had secretly installed a doggie door to our attic and just made sure at least 3 of the cats were upstairs at any given time. There were a couple of close calls but overall I totally got away with being a secret cat lady!! I was really sad when my alarm went off.<br /><br />Oh, what does this have to do with 50 Shades?? Apparently even my \\"subconscious inner-goddess\\" prefers to dream about cats over Christian Gray. I don't think I need to add anything else.

0345525558|2.0|I would have given this a one star if it weren't for the fact that I stuck with it to the end.  I was drawn in at first, since something about the mood at the beginning reminded me of White Oleander, a great first novel also about foster care.  Then, the suspense in The Language of Flowers kept me going, but the story became unrealistic by the middle, and I started feeling annoyed by the lack of  insight to the characters.  So much more could have been said, considering the reasonable length of the book.  By the last third, I found the story tedious, and the fairy tale ending was quite unbelievable, so I couldn't wait to read the one star reviews by other people!

0439023513|5.0|Spoilers Within--Consider yourself warned.<br /><br />Having recently finished reading Mockingjay, I spent the last few days grappling with it, trying to figure out my reactions and to make sense of it. And there is one word I keep coming back to: devastating. And that, I suspect, is what Suzanne Collins wants us to see, the devastation.<br /><br />While the first two books in the series are appreciated and praised almost unanimously, I've noticed a lot of mixed reaction to the third, and this makes sense since Mockingjay is a very different book than either The Hunger Games or Catching Fire was. The first two have threads of romance, often tender and innocent, threads of action that are riveting but fantastical and contained, even threads of satire and humor. But in Mockingjay those are all but gone, replaced with Katniss slowly disintegrating before our eyes. Don't get me wrong; there are currents of some serious stuff underlying each book: anxiety, depression, PTSD, the struggle to feel or accept love. But by Mockingjay, those weighty currents are all we have. It becomes impossible to believe that the characters we've followed and loved can possibly survive intact.<br /><br />One example that stands out to me is Peeta being hijacked. As I watched him, through Katniss's eyes, broken and destroyed, turned against her--the one person in his life that made him happy, I felt devastated. This character, who is the heart of the book, brave, selfless, compassionate, loving, is so easily undone, turned into some beastly, callous, brutal thing. As a reader, I felt myself beside Katniss, grieving for the boy with the bread, not because he is dead, but because some fundamental part of his essence, of what made him wonderful is lost forever. At the beginning of chapter 16, after being shot, Katniss recalls the word Peeta said to her as she drifted into sleep after hurting her heel in Catching Fire; she asks him to stay with her and he says \\"Always.\\" But of course, by the timeKatniss remembers this, by the time we as readers learn it, we also understand the terrible irony of it--that the Peeta who promised to always be with her is already gone, replaced with someone capable of cruelties that the old Peeta could never have conceived. When the same scene is echoed later during the assault on the Capital, it gives some hope that Peeta can pull through, that his love for Katniss can keep him from spiraling backwards into a violent, wrecking madness. But that is not a selfless love, not the love of the boy who asked Katniss to take everything from him, and I could feel the full devastating force of losing his innocence, his kindness, his unconditional love.<br /><br />Which brings me to Katniss. While Peeta is broken in the middle of the book and then slowly, painfully rebuilt throughout the rest of it, Katniss just falls to pieces more and more as the book proceeds. Until, in the end, she is ruined. Katniss is goal driven, always has been. Some people see her in Mockingjay and can't recognize the drugged up girl who hides in closets, but her will, her spirit remains: the will that kept her family alive in district 13, that kept her and Peeta alive in The Hunger Games, that tried to save Peeta's life at any cost in Catching Fire. By the end of Mockingjay she clings to one thing: killing President Snow. But once that is done (and I would say that in killing Coin, she was completing that mission, but that's a whole other matter,) once her final mission is complete, the survivor in her is overthrown. How she has been manipulated, how she has manipulated and used others, how she feels responsible for so many deaths, the brutality she has seen so casually committed by people she trusted, all of these things cause her to give up on herself, to give up on humanity, to hate herself because of her humanity and the viciousness it entails. Even she, this iron hero, stops fighting for her life, for her dignity, and instead seeks refuge not in Peeta, butin death. I was reminded of what Finnick said at the end of Catching Fire, how he wished that Annie were dead, and everybody were dead including himself because that would be best. Like Finnick, Katniss is a devastated shell of a human being that can only imagine relief in death, and yet even that peace is kept from her by Peeta's hand. Was stopping her from taking the nightlock a selfish act or was it selfless, a sign of his recovery? As Katniss says, they protect each other. That's what they do. But in Mockingjay they have to protect each other from not just external threats but the internal demons ravaging their minds, the ghosts that would carry them to madness and self destruction.<br /><br />And what is perhaps most devastating about Katniss in the end is her continual struggle with love. What is most difficult for me to accept as a reader is her diminished capacity to even know love, to allow herself to feel the better parts of humanity. She spends so much of her time guarding against letting herself need other people, from the girl at the end of The Hunger Games who says she can't \\"afford\\" love because of how vulnerable it would make her, because it can be so mindlessly taken away, to the woman who faces the same fear with her children. Katniss ends up never being able to love entirely, not in the way that I, as a reader, wished she could, the way that would show the possibility for salvation, for forgiveness in the aftermath of such total devastation. Yes she returns to life once Peeta comes back to District 12, but it feels like a shadow life. She says she finds his arms, his lips, the hunger she felt kissing him on the beach. These are all familiar parts of their romance. But Katniss and Peeta are not the same people, not capable of the same feelings they were earlier in the story. I know a lot of readers wanted more from Suzanne Collins in showing how they \\"grow together again,\\" but I don't think that could have been possible. What these two charactersare capable of feeling is so diminished by war that anything else Collins could have written truthfully would have just earned her the same criticism. When Peeta whispers \\"You love me. Real or not real?\\" Katniss tells him \\"real,\\" but I get only the shadow sense that she feels it. I doubt that she even can. I want her to. I want to believe that she can at last allow herself something as pure and intact and beautiful as real love. But maybe that isn't possible. And that is devastating.<br /><br />I'm reminded, in the end, of The Lord of the Rings, of Frodo and Sam coming home after their journey. So many readers of those books turn to Sam because he remains so simple and stoic, still able to find love and joy in family and friends. Frodo is broken, so broken he must leave because he has no life left in him, no capacity to enjoy the world he helped save. Tolkien was a veteran of WWI and he knew what Frodo faced, although there was no official label for it then, no PTSD handbook. Still, Tolkien managed to give his readers Sam, and so many of us cling to that character at the end, wanting to believe that some hint of humanity's grace, of simple joy, goodness, happiness or love can survive beyond the destruction of our darker impulses: our greed, our cruelty and violence, our oppression and dehumanization of our fellows.  But in Collins work, there is no Sam, the closest person to him, Peeta, still clutches the back of chairs, struggling with flashbacks, waiting for the madness to pass. In Collins work that pure character that was filled with unconditional love and selflessness is corrupted, is broken, is lost.<br /><br />If you've managed to read this far, I thank you, and promise that I am wrapping up my thoughts. I guess I don't blame readers for wanting a brighter ending to Mockingjay, I wanted one too--we want Sam, want to believe in the power of the better angels of our nature to persevere even in the face of absolute devastation. But Collins gives us something farmore complex and difficult--is there good in people? Yes! Of Course. Katniss reminds herself of this with her final game, recalling memories of Rue, Cinna, Finnick, Prim, Peeta, the good things she has seen in humanity. But ultimately the aftermath of war leaves scars, leaves such devastation that the innocent, pure love of the boy with the bread can no longer exist. It isn't possible anymore. Even the best amongst us is diminished, tarnished. Collins point may not be what we want to find. It certainly is not what I would like to believe, but that seems inconsequential. What matters is how her point resonates, how that hollow feeling signals something real, how that depression that I (and others I know) felt seep into our chests at the end of the book reveals something we know to be true, even if we fight to deny it. I don't think less of Collins's book because it dares to show me something that I wish weren't true. I think more of it for challenging me, for not giving me the smooth resolution, the rose-tinted epilogue.<br /><br />The beauty and terror of this story lies in how we as readers become witnesses to atrocities, atrocities we cannot turn away from because we have invested ourselves in these characters. And in seeing the undoing of these lives we sense a cruel reality: that no amount of time or peace can fully erase the damages of war. Perhaps there is comfort in the fact that Katniss and Peeta are just characters in a novel, but we all know they stand for voiceless millions, victims of genocide, torture, slavery, war, mankind's dark heart. And that is what is so devastating.
0345803493|5.0|This book along with the first one are great. Besides all the sexual content the actual story is so cute and romantic. Its a tear jerker especially the last few chapters.

030758836X|3.0|So many reviews have covered the plot and I won't repeat that. I just want to add that the book is insightful, intelligent, interesting and really wonderful, until about three quarters of the way in. Then it becomes so strange and difficult to believe that I found myself losing interest. The ending was abrupt and honestly unbelievable. There is just no way two people could have behaved that way. And maybe that was the point, that Amy was gearing up again by the last page. Anyway, the ending left me wondering what happened. In the acknowledgements she does say she could not figure out how to end it, and unfortunately, it shows.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|The Shield is an awesome cop show and definitely my favorite.  I was a little hesitant about buying the set because of the reviews I read about the discs getting scratched because of the way the discs are packaged in the set.  But, once receiving the set, I thought it was great.  You only need to be careful about taking out and putting back in the discs and they won't scratch.  I definitely recommend any Shield fan who wants to buy all the seasons, to get this set.  I thought it was awesome.

B000FQJAIW|3.0|George Lucas is a giant tool, but we all know that by now.  I got these because the Special Edition versions of the movies are anachronistic, horrible filmmaking, and I figured, \\"how bad can the picture really be?\\"  Well, it's pretty darn bad.  It looks like a really good VHS transfer, for goodness' sake.  However, there is no other option (besides VHS), so I guess I'm glad I have them now so I can show my kids the movies without having to worry about lame CGI Jabbas and Greedo shooting first.  At least I bought used ones, to save a little money and avoid giving that huge-necked sonovabich any more royalties.
0393324818|5.0|Mr. Lewis wrote an excellent book.  He made the intricate details of a sport that I follow only casually easy to understand.  Mr. Lewis' writing style also made the book very easy to read because he explained things simply and clearly, applying excellent context to more complicated words.  As I was reading the book, I found myself wanting to determine how I could apply the \\"Moneyball\\" concept elsewhere.  I want to see the movie more than before I began reading the book.  Even if you don't follow baseball, much less the Oakland Athletics, I think you'll find this book enjoyable.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|The instant the first show ended, I was hooked. The one and only problem with this show is that you become addicted to it! Too bad season 2 will be completely different (with Jessica Lange being the main character) but I think it'll be interesting to see how they carry on. Rumor is, a few seasons from now, they'll go back to the ending of season one (Jessica Lange and the highly coveted kid) and continue with that story. But until then, season 2, set in a mental hospital (hope it's not cheesy) should be a change from your everyday mental hospital story. But don't get too used to Jessica Lange's character in season 1! She'll be completely different come the October season premiere.<br />  Overall: Great, brilliantly different show that hooks you from episode 1. Changes every season should keep it interesting.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|this game is great and very adicting. I also had that problem with my buildings taking 500 hours until you could collect but I deleted an re downloaded the game an not had any problems but a little laggy sometimes. the main thing that bothers me is the energy. I'm at level 58 and I only get 50 energy. and 50 energy is not enough to collect everything I have. ive spent ALOT of time playing this game but they should allow more energy everytime u go up a level. for some reason its stuck at only 50 energy an to be honest its Sufis to have to wait 3 min for 1 energy. exspecially wen I'm into it but have to wait. if gameloft wants pplelike me who has spent money an a lot of time with this game to keep playing that's a big thing they should work on cause I'm not going to keep paying for only an extra few min its pointless but overall a good gamesters
B005LAIGRS|4.0|I am a fan of Denzel. So, of course, I saw this movie. I did like it, but it's not one of my favorites. In this movies, Denzel's character is kind of bad, and I think he played his part very well, and Ryan Reynolds did a tremendous job, too. Reynolds almost made me cry when he was hurt in the end. I was almost in tears.<br /><br />I will say the reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because I felt like there wasn't enough bite to it. I wasn't sitting off the edge of my seat waiting to see what was next. I wasn't breathless waiting to see if someone was going to get killed. At times, there was some cliches in there, but it wasn't overly in my face. I mean, I knew there was a mole when the safe house was instantly found, and it just came too early and too quick in the movie.<br /><br />There are plenty of running, fighting, and chase scenes, not all in that order. It wasn't too complicated to follow. But like always, Denzel made the movie. But I will admit Reynolds played his part with a lot of heart. I was on his side all the way. They all did a great job.

B007KAJG3K|4.0|The first Sherlock Holmes movie was good, but the second is even better.  Everything was ramped up in Game of Shadows.  Today's movie makers have a style that makes a movie exciting.  As a fan of the Holmes stories, I was bored with the many versions on TV and screen.  Usually Sherlock is done in a dry manner.  That is not the case in this movie.<br /><br />In the first movie fans had to gear up to Sherlock's new style.  In the second installment fans are ready for more and get it.  More action, more movie magic, and more  delightful humor.  This movie has brought Sherlock Holmes back for a new generation to enjoy.  Highly recommended!

B007Y30OQ6|4.0|For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \\"fanboy\\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.<br /><br />Physical Characteristics The iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.<br /><br />New and \\"Improved\\" Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.<br /><br />The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \\"new\\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.<br /><br />The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />Smart Covers aren't really \\"smart\\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.<br /><br />Multitasking Support One of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support.

Scott and Zelda, Cole Porter and so on - and only Hemingway and Adrien Brody's movie-stealing Salvador Dali gets to show some dimension in this other-dimensional, ersatz Twilight Zone, hardly funny or hardly romantic jaunt that - even though beautifully photographed - has a DVD cover more evocative and enthralling than the entire movie. Anyway - with such a cast of luminary characters this movie should have and could have been much, much more.  But it isn't.  It seems like the legal pad outline was filmed instead of a fully developed, excitingly insightful, truly comedic and truly romantic script. A pity.  A miss.
B0038JN6VA|5.0|After seeing and hearing a friend's X-Mini, I purchased 5: one for myself and 4 for family members. Each has been very satisfied with the size, compactness, ease of use, and the quality of the sound. One member was able to put it and his Iphone in a zip lock bag and take it to the beach to listen to music with no loss of quality or volume. Have been using the X-Mini regularly for 3 weeks and am very satisfied with the results.
0345803485|1.0|Couple of things really struck me.<br /><br />1. This will be required reading for homicide detectives investigating murder of your women lured into 'games' with sick perverted sexual deviants.<br /><br />2. Thinist disguise of a romance ever written for the chance to illustrate BDSM.<br /><br />3. Save yourself the trouble buy Book 3 read the last 3 chapters.<br /><br />4. What could have been a rich story about an abused child and redemption is reduced to a tabloid story that probably will be made into a movie, like Twilight.<br /><br />5. Don't waste your money
0142418471|3.0|I liked this, but it was a little predictable and just blah. I didn't like it nearly as much as John Green's other books -- I felt it was missing the quirkiness and mystery. The only other book I've read by David Levithan was Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist, another collaboration, and that is one of my favorite teen books, so I expected to like this more.
0345803485|1.0|Jeez, Holy Cow and Triple Crap. I cannot believe anyone could read this book and classify it as literature. I have a Masters in English Literature, but I am no literary snob and will get down and dirty with the best of them. Seeing this book flying off the shelves leaves me in utter despair; hearing people praising it as if it was the best thing since Jane Austen is leaving me sobbing in the fetal position in the library.<br />Before I even knew that E.L. James was a compatriot of mine, I was wondering why Ana, a girl who has never left the USA is speaking with a British accent. Who the hell talks about their \\"backside\\" and \\"ringing someone on the phone\\" and goes \\"on holiday\\" in the US? I also severely object that Ana is so into Tess of the D'ubervilles. E.L. James has ruined Thomas Hardy for me - I can no longer read Far From the Madding Crowd without imagining Sergeant Troy flogging Bathsheba, but that's besides the point.<br />Ana, a 21 year old college student, who lives with a very sexually clued up roomate, has never really been kissed (oh aside from the time that she made out with someone when she was a teenager) and she has never masturbated. She also doesn't have an email address. Really? What sort of weird puritanical upbringing has she had. She meets really good looking with intense gray eyes, really intense gray eyes, Christian Grey, who is obviously loaded and instantly falls in love with him. She feels all tingly \\"down there\\" and she has the sudden necessity to change her panties every time she thinks of him.<br />Christian Grey has obviously been abused as a child, because why else would he have this uncontrollable urge to hurt women??? Stereotype anyone??? Grey, who has dominated 15 women with experience, inexplicably falls for this klutzy girl who literally falls at his feet the first time she meets him, and suddenly he is bowled over and all his desires to beat, flog and whip go flying out the window. What on earth is it about this girl?? Really, do tell, I want to know, because I sure as hell can't see it!<br />As for Ana,she doesn't want Christian to hurt her, but she doesn't want him not to because that's what he wants to do, so for the whole first book we get \\"Oh Christian, hit me,\\" and then \\"don't hurt me,\\" yes, no, up, down, in, out - the girl can't tell her arse from her elbow (which may actually be what Christian sees in her).<br />Barely has she left Christian's edifice (office building for the uninitiated) when he knows where she works, where she lives, her bank account details and has created an entire manila folder with her history. He travels a distance (I'm not sure how far it is because unlike Ms James I haven't just stuck a pin in a map and decided to set a story there) to her place of work and revels in the fact that she's helping him choose bondage equipment.<br />Christian Grey is the most objectionable, annoying, stalkery prick, but somehow his behaviour is justified because he is good looking and rich, oh and he has a thing about feeding the poor (his obsession with feeding Ana would have her double the size in no time - but fear not, he could always flog it out of her). This sends a terrible message to women, if the guy is good looking and buys you nice stuff then he can treat you as mean as he likes.<br />The characters are undeveloped and badly thought out. Christian Grey, a controlling bastard, if there ever was one, suddenly and inexplicably adopts a sort of catchphrase \\"laters baby\\"!! Really!! If anyone used that on me there would be no laters for him ever. And if Ana is supposed to be a literature major then why does the book seem like the Secret Diary of Adrian Mole aged 13 3/4 only in the girl version. If possible, she is even a worse character than Christian. And if Christian wouldn't have spanked her I would have together with that insufferable inner goddess of hers.<br />As to the sex ... don't even get me started. I am not against erotica, I have read erotica (Anais Nin for example) and Fifty Shades is not it. The sex scenes are boring, repetitive and even awkward at times. I can't believe that there are women creaming themselves over this and claiming that it has helped their sex lives. What kinds of sex lives were they having before if this tripe brings it up a notch? And by the way calling it Mommy Porn doesn't take away from the fact that it's porn. And if you're gonna read porn, at least let it be good porn!! Once upon a time reading porn was something that you did in the dark under your covers, but now with the advent of the internet there is so much out there that you can read it whilst pretending you're doing some work - so don't waste your time with this bunch of garbage.<br />I want to comment on the plot, but it is practically non-existent. The few tiny strands of story that are introduced are not thought out at all and instead of using them as opportunities to develop the characters, James just glosses over them with another orgasm. Oooh and that's another thing that gets up my craw - every time Ana is legitimately fuming at Christian he distracts her with his eyes, a smile, or his pants that hang off his hips in a special way and she forgets all about it. Yay for the feminist movement!!<br />I think that this may be the only time ever that I would agree to a massive public book burning!! Run, run, far far away from this book.
B002R88G5E|5.0|I recently purchased this to read for my book club. I loved the book - couldn't put it down. Some editting issues with the kindle version but this didn't detract from the enjoyment of the book. I felt that Hosseini brought the characters and the places to life. At times it seemed like a true record of the lives of these women.
0345803485|2.0|Fifty Shades of Grey must be one of the most poorly written and anachronistic romantic (erotic?) novels of all time. A young virginial college student meets a handsome, slightly older, very experienced, and insanely rich business man. She is so clumsy that of course he must fall in love with her, and demand that she be immediately and absolutely monogamous to him. I suspect it's a bestseller because of (1) betrayal of female desire (\\"I am so wet\\") and (2) some mild S&M games. If you are looking for some kinky sex, you have to be very patient as plain vanilla sex is all that happens in the first two thirds of the book.<br /><br />Honestly, if you want literary kinkiness, go for \\"Story of O\\", Anne Rice's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", \\"The Sexual Life of Catherine M.\\" or maybe Elfriede Jelinek's \\"The Piano Teacher\\".<br /><br />If you want badly written kinkiness (albeit not quite as bad as the Fifty Shades), go for \\"100 Strokes of the brush before bed\\".<br /><br />If you want weird, try Charlotte Roche's \\"Wetlands\\".<br /><br />Only read this book if you must, it is not a pleasure.
B0050OMJIW|4.0|A great read, well written. I loved the humour, character development and metaphors. No problem with the kindle edition, seemed to be well editted. Recommend this one
B003WQT2YY|5.0|I love the music of Mozart, but Scalieri's description of the music gave me new shades of understanding about what I am hearing.  And the costuming and acting are so worth the watching.  Sometimes we forget that child prodigies have troubles in life.  And this movie shows the difficult maturing process of Mozart.  I very much like this movie.
B006Z20976|5.0|A must buy Blu-Ray and DVD!!! I can't wait to watch this movie!! It looks so good! Thanks for selling this at a low price!
B004M5HKIY|3.0|*** Kindle edition has been updated since this review was written ***<br /><br />I can tell the Kindle edition of this book has been updated since I wrote my review, because it is no longer available for my Kindle (Kindle Touch). Since it's only available for the \\"newer\\" and \\"fancier\\" Kindles, I would assume it has been converted to the new format that allows you to zoom in on pictures. That would negate the part of my review that mentions large images being broken into pieces.<br /><br />Additionally, since this edition has been updated, it is possible that the publisher updated the Table Of Contents to include links, or the book to include real page numbers.<br /><br />I would like to say that I would give the print version of this book 5 stars. The stories are excellent classics, and some of my daughter's favorites. The artwork is fun, and in full color. If they have fixed the image formatting problem with the Kindle edition, but did not add navigation or page numbers to the book, then I would now give it a 4. If they have fixed both problems, then I would give it a 5.<br /><br />With all of that said, my original review is probably useless now, however, I will leave it intact below:<br /><br />**********************************************<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I have a hardbound copy of this book, and was excited to purchase it for Kindle because it would be much more compact and lightweight, as well as always having it with me between Kindle and iPhone. The stories in this book are excellent, and I would highly recommend buying a print version, but I was so disappointed with the Kindle edition that I returned it for a refund.<br /><br />The problem with the Kindle edition is that there is no easy way to navigate to each story. This could easily be solved if the table of contents was built into clickable links that would take you to the right location, or even if the book used page numbers so you could reference the TOC and use the Go To feature to go to the corresponding page. Instead, without either of these features, you are left to guess at what Location number each story starts at, and then keep trying until you finally get there or get nearby.<br />My initial plan of attack was to spend half an hour tracking down the Location for the start of each story and bookmark the start of each one. Instead, I realized that having to do this was not worth the $17 I paid for the book, and I sent a complain to Amazon and was issued a refund.<br /><br />I was also a little disappointed with the formatting of this edition. As is done with a lot of other children's books on Kindle, larger images are put into the book as the full image, and then broken into halves so you can see more detail. This makes sense for continuous pictures that run across two pages, but so many of the images in this book are composed of several parts and could have been broken down into separate image files for better display on Kindle. A great example of this is in [[ASIN:0618494960 Curious George and the Firefighters]].<br /><br />Don't let this review deter you from the content of the printed editions - these are great stories and this is a great collection (I would rate those at 5 stars). But if you're thinking of buying the Kindle edition, I'd suggest buying each story separately rather than in this collection - that is, unless the publisher revises the formatting a bit.e to go to the corresponding page.

034580404X|2.0|I am amazed of the number of folks that say this is the best books ever!  Its very kinky, a love story, yes it is but a sick one.....redundant....if I had time I would go back and count the time she used the word \\"smirk\\".  The 2nd and 3rd were better, I don't understand all the hype over a sickness.  On a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 6.......very poorly written! I don't want to miss a good read though so I read it!  Try it ....you may like more that I did.
B001O2SIN4|5.0|I liked what I saw but wished there was more content for what the video cost. Some more information regarding just how much info was about the elephants would have been nice.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote. The files are shared among all my devices (laptop,  desktop,  phone,  ipad, kindle fire) so that all my notes are always available. I use it for lists,  creative writing, work,  saving web pages and lots more.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is just comical genius. Amazing 5 stars.  Dont believe the haters. The cast was brilliant and everything about the movie was great.  Laughed from beginning to end.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I think what sets this series apart from all the other supernatural star crossed lovers out there, is that the narrator is the male of the couple. And frankly, if Lena was the one telling this story, I'd probably find it detestable because of the incredible gallons of angst she's wading through. That said, I do find myself enjoying these characters which is why I gave it four stars instead of three. In a nutshell Lena essentially cuts Ethan off, and a new boy in town is hanging on her arm. Lena seems to be veering towards the dark side, which Ethan believes is only because of new bad boy John's influence. To help her he and Link, along with Marian's new young British assistant, Liv head underground and try and stop a diabolical plan that the evil Sarafine has hatched. The book comes to a quick conclusion, and sets up the next installment, with enough of a cliff hanger, that fans will want to make sure the next chapter is waiting.
B0086DBE62|5.0|It was a bit underdeveloped and juvenile but the kids loved it! Can't say much else about it. Definitely a one watch type of movie.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|just don't buy the free verzen. its not. wepen game. ,<br />  if you can do temple run you can do this.as I seid awesome
034580404X|5.0|This was a great read.  It was recommended by my daughter who read it first.  It will be interesting to see if this author will write more like it.
B002N14GPE|5.0|I wished I had watched this movie when it was on Netflix. I caught the end of it on television and ceided to rent it. It is suspenseful, funny, and a bit scary at times. I like the movie and I wish Netflix would bring it back on streaming. The girl that played Esther is good and the storyline kept me on the edge of my feet.
0307719219|4.0|If you are interested in economics, history, or politics, you will find this book interesting and enlightening.  It weaves together the political history and economic history of nations rather than viewing politics and economics as separate disciplines.  The authors provide detailed examples from six continents resulting in a truly global perspective.  While the book does not provide a clear-cut, simple answer to poverty, it is a book that will spark discussions about solutions.  The book is so thorough, providing detail of many historical events, that it does get long and repetitive in places.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I bought this book based on all the hype I had been reading.  This was to be the summers must read.  Everything I read made this book sound so intriguing.  It took me 207 pages to get in to it but finally it got good.  And then it came to the end and it turned out to be my major disappointment read of the summer.  This was way over-hyped and the \\"mind-blowing turn of events\\" were predictable.  I wouldn't pay full price for this. If you find it in a bargain bin, buy it.  If not, don't waste your money.  It's not all that....
B00064X3FE|5.0|It's a very good recording/remastering of the best (to my opinion) Elton John's album.<br />This music returns me to the 70-s.<br />I listened SACD layer, but this disk also could be played on any CD player.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|greatest calculator this has allowed me to carry less and less thing with me in my bags, just my kindle and I am happy
B008GXHOFW|5.0|who the heck thing 7 effing dollars is expensive for a game. considering the xbox 360 version cost 60 i dont understand whoever calls this great deal expensive
B001HN6922|4.0|Came quickly, and in great shape. And works great. Very happy with this purchase, made my son very happy that we got his old one replaced quickly.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like it. but it is slow to load up.  The auto shuffle is great. It is fun and with the update, even more puzzels.
1907016414|5.0|i just finished reading \\"girl trade\\". the first book i have read (and i read<br />a lotttttttt of erotica) that really shook me, and left me<br />thinking about many things. for the first time in my experience i read in a<br />book what i always believe about my life.<br />your paragraph on page 109 - \\"our brain is a circuit board.....is chokingly<br />identical to my beliefs.<br />you are a refreshing and welcome voice to me. i will be purchasing other<br />books by you. good luck!!!<br />Suraya
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I've bought and tried a lot of different bluetooth car speakerphone kits and most had issues with the mic reception, speaker volume, battery life, or any combination of those.  The blue ant products have always impressed me in all those areas.  I bought the supertooth buddy for my wife and father-in-law and both are very happy with it.  It is very easy to use and you only have to charge it once every couple of weeks under normal use.  Great product!
B0063GORYU|5.0|its spider solitare no more no less although there are ads they are small and obviously needed to keep the game free
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|Somehow I missed this show when it first began airing and have discovered the beauty of live streaming episodes free w/ Amazon Prime membership.  This show hooked me from the very first episode!  WOW is all I can say!!!
B006H5120E|5.0|I've seen this movie a hundred times and yet after year and it still makes me cry. It's just a great movie
B001KQZ7I8|4.0|It is a great book, very useful, it talks about our deep desires it gives a model of life to live by. I wished it includes more practical details on how to apply Logotherapy. In general it is a great and recommended book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it's a really fun game. it's really adicting. but it really gets hard. but the good thing is that u can skip a level and go to the next level if u can't get it. the goal of the game is to cover every square. look at the picture of the app...that is like level 1. the game works perfect on my kindle fire. HAVE FUN WITH THIS GAME!!! GET THE APP!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is why traditional publishers still exist. They catch things like poor grammar, unclear antecedents, and subject confusion. It makes me sad for the state of the world that this got good reviews from anyone. I'd give it zero stars if I could.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is a book about a woman too naive to exist and her abusive boyfriend, who dominates her life not in a hee-hee sexy way, but in a truly horrifying \\"Wow, that's a Special Victims Unit Episode\\" way. The fact that this book has gotten any popularity at all speaks to how effed up our culture is about relationships between men and women. The way the author blithely wrote about a flat out abusive relationship bothers me because we don't need another role model to tell us how to shut up and be abused.<br /><br />No, Fifty Shades of Grey is not a good book. It is a horrible book which got a lot of attention because it took Twilight and combined it with BDSM so full of flaws that you know it was based off of toys seen in an Adam & Eve catalog. The author clearly never spent any time around people who do actually participate in that kind of play, because she had no notion of the psychology behind it. There's no power exchange, no trust, no release of the day to day pressures by giving over control. Even Kushiel's Dart understood that better.<br /><br />This is a watered down cheap version of what kink is supposedly like, complete with uncontrolled, unsafe, and abusive circumstances. Don't read it, unless you're looking for a lot of laughs.
030014332X|5.0|Just finished reading \\"A Little History Of The World\\" by E.H. Gombrich. The most readable history book ever. Reads like a journey. It didn't feel like I was reading a history book. It felt like a really interesting novel and the characters were the countries. The author was lucky as he came from a German Jewish family and through his job got out of Germany just in time. This Art Historian wrote the book in London in 1936 for children (older children). Then he edited the book in 1985. I'm pretty sure it wasn't translated until 2005. I couldn't put it down. The author made great attempts to not be biased, include everyone and give you just enough info to know whats going on with out boring you to death with too many dates and details. Its like a really well written summary. This needs to be a school text book. His message at the end is really wonderful about making the most of the time we have here, that \\"it's all worth it\\".
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I was looking for the song \\"I just haven't met you yet\\", it is on this cd. It's bouncy tune is very catchy and I can't resist dancing along. But another song got my attention just as much is \\"Baby you've got what it takes\\" !!! Love the boost it gives!
B0073PPKNM|4.0|I love Melody's voice but sadly in this album I have to agree with Rodamu who wrote \\"On most tracks she merges into the music and her subdued, whispery words fade into the background. A great talent made a great mistake with this album.\\"  I however, do not think that Melody was the one who made the mistake.  Whoever produced, engineered this album did Melody a great injustice.  On a lot of the songs I had to turn the volume up much higher than I would care to just to hear her voice.  The instrumental part drowns her out.  Sometimes, I do not care for some clip that is part of an ending to a song.  It doesn't seem to fit. As Tube Sound \\"Calm Down\\" wrote \\"the overall sound is somewhat muted and not that relaxing to listen to. I feel always on edge.\\"  I felt edgy listening to this too. I think it is because I listen to it on headsets and usually shuffle the songs after the first few times I hear it and I have to keep changing the volume and remembering to forward to the next song when track #11 comes on so I don't listen to the silence. I feel this album should be reproduced removing all the mistakes.<br /><br />Melody's voice and her writing are still 5 stars.  She has the most amazing and beautiful voice that you never tire of listening to and I love her lyrics.  Let us also not forget the collabroration of Heitor Pereira, the very gifted producer, composer and guitarist.  His work is amazing.  Check out his solo guitar CD \\"Untold Stories\\" if you are able to locate a copy of it.<br /><br />I have to also congratulate her on trying new things, that too is a sign of a gifted talent...to not be afraid to experiment with new sounds.  Many singers do stick to a certain sound and never deviate from it.  I am glad she did as this is a beautiful album if you look past the few glitches.<br /><br />Finally, as others have said, I too loved her first two albums and will always look forward to new albums to come.  Hopefully, I can see her perform someday.
B006LSZECO|4.0|GREAT fast easy read. Many OMG moments that you don't see coming!  She did a great job making you like then dislike the characters witth out missing a beat.
B0072PUC7W|2.0|Sadly, most of the ASOT yearly releases have trended downward since 2007, and I believe this CD hits a new low. I'm just appalled at the lack of consideration concerning the track-selection. To make matters worse, transitions (which really aid in the story telling/energy of the mix) are non-existent. The tracks in both of these CDs are uneventful and shameful to be more precise. One commenter mentioned \\"rinse and repeat\\" and I couldn't help feel that all of these tracks have the same kind of beat, sound, effect, feeling, emotion -- call it what you want -- to it. It's dull and seriously lifeless.<br /><br />Both CDs are pretty dark, especially CD2 (near suicidal). It's very slow moving and monotonic, which leaves ALOT to be desired. Transitions are quick and in some cases unexpected. What I've really disliked recently about Armin is his taking of pseudo-classical style opera/symphony and mixing it with progressive beats. A great example is CD2's James Dymond - Overthrow (Protoculture Remix) -- it's just horrible, and CD2 is chocked full of them.<br /><br />With the trance genre (which is really prog trance now), there isn't too much to hold on to anymore -- sounds/synths are whitewashed and mono-chromatic. With Tiesto going towards the more American-styled Club sound and Armin Van Buuren going in the opposite different direction, the fun styles we heard between 2004-2009 are gone...This CD just expounds on that trend.<br /><br />Now, if you really want to listen to a good Armin CD, check out his 2012 Yearmix -- one of the best I've heard in the last few years.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|kept the family entertained. reminded us of our first Mario brothers games we used to play. really enjoyed it!! the game runs smooth on my kindle fire and I have not had any problems so far.
