B005U30I22|2|It wasn't at all what it appeared to be on the web site. When I recieved it I notced It had a offset in the middle visor
B00BZYIF1Q|1|the dodge emblem broke off the second time I open them to take screws out.  Very cheap plastic.  Don't buy.
B0034ZYE5U|5|Exceeded my expectations, Very powerful! Easy to use and easy to install. I mounted the winch to my trailer, all the electronics are located in the  tool box above the winch. The winch control is also mounted to the side od the tool box.
B00LGZMEOS|5|In for over a month and working great. 5 stars for the price and quick delivery. It did take a long trickle charge when I got it. Very pleased.
B007KCXS0A|5|Perfect. Exactly as I ordered and expected.
B0026M9D80|5|What a smooth ride compared to the poem shocks!
B00WH2KIOC|4|For the price I cant argue, they where easy to install and work with. My only complaint is they didn't come with some type of adhesive strip for the top of the flare to help secure it to the vehicle. The only thing holding it on is its shape and a few screws in the fender well.
B000CHL58M|5|fit great
B00IKSRTBM|5|A big improvement over traditional bulbs!! Brighter and more easily seen!!
B00KTHUMHK|3|When i got it my old remote stopped working so I didn't have a working remote to program it.  I took it to the dealer to have it programmed and they couldn't get it to work either.  Not sure why.
B000PCBCE6|5|love it
B000E4VG00|5|Fast delivery and good quality I installed it without any issue
B00OB8EJGS|5|I wish I would of purchased the magnetic ones but these worked just as well.  Have to make sure your lines are straight when cutting.  not good for wrapping around the corners.
B005DOQYNU|3|Very impressed with this kit for my 2006 4Runner.<br />The kit contains every bulb for the interior except the itty-bitty tiny bulb that is in the glove box.<br /><br />Installation was easy and straight forward--just like everyone else states--keep in mind that LEDs do care about polarity.  There's a 50/50 chance that you'll install it the wrong way (100% chance in my case :) the first time and it won't work...just flip it around.<br /><br />These are definitely brighter than the factory bulbs and make things much easier when you're looking for something at night.<br /><br />I've had mine installed for a little over a year now and haven't had any problems....every LED is still working.<br /><br />And these do &#34;dim and turn off&#34; when you close your car doors--just like the factory bulbs did.<br /><br />*****UPDATE 2/23/2016*****<br />I've had these bulbs installed for about 2 years now.  For the most part, they've been working well, but I have had to replace three bulbsdue to the LEDs starting to flicker--two interior bulbs and one used as a license plate bulb.  I know lights don't last forever, but LEDs should last longer than this.  I deducted one star because of this.<br /><br />*****UPDATE 6/24/2016*****<br />I guess the lifespan of these bulbs is about 2 years.  I've had to replace a few more because of flickering or the color of the light changed to a yellowish color as opposed to the nice, bright white when they were new. I've now used all the &#34;extra&#34; bulbs that came in the package--any other failures will require purchase of more.  I've lowered my rating down to 3/5. They're super cheap at just a little over 10 bucks, but the price is clearly reflecting the quality you're getting as well.
B00LEBLI82|5|Great Product
B00JRHLXDK|5|Everything works great. Fast turn around. Would use again
B005P9WXMY|5|It just adds a bit more class to an already classy automobile. Metal gear solid. I'm loving this.
B005NLQAHS|5|keeps connected to the car all the time. No problems at all
B003UXZ6RG|5|Value for money is good
B003TXVZE0|5|This piece of gear is personally one of my most important items when playing in the field. It helps me to be environmentally conscious of the impact of my presence in the outdoors, forests, mountains and other places where are home not to me but to wildlife. I carry this trasharoo spare tire trash bag to leave no trace and out of respect to, what I consider my backyards.<br />it works just fine and stays secure (if one mounts it properly in the spare tire), on the spare tire and besides keeping my trash secure it serves as an additional storage device. I Like to store my wetsuits, fins and other wet gear in there and the drain holes help sped up the draining and drying process on my way home.<br />If you love the outdoors and respect it then do yourself a favor and get this!<br />Shipping was fast and I am super happy with my purchase.<br /><br />Thank you shipper!
B000CE9NU2|5|Exhaust looks awesome, very nice quality. Its not a direct bolt on piece, also flange to bolt to headers is not included with this kit. That is one item that should be listed as an add on.
B00E9L574K|4|cool
B00JX2U2OK|5|You have to work with them a little, but once you get them to fit right, they look sweet.
B00A27GBQ8|5|This worked perfectly in 2006 Jetta 2.5. The installation was not very difficult, there is a good video on youtube about how to install, saved  bundle as opposed to taking it to the stealer dealer for installation.
B0048G8RN4|2|did not fit dash very well, I returned it
B004SSEF56|5|very happy w keychain...arrived on time
B006P8SJVS|1|biggest P.O.S. i ever bought,the gas sending unit was wired backwards,when the tank was full it read empty,when empty it read full.the pump output was way below min.spec would barely start and ran like shit.lost my ass on this job,take the tank back out and on a motorhome its not an easy job at all.got lucky and found a used pump to make it run and work correctly,of course amazon said all returns must be unopened box.how the hell you going to know if it works if you dont open the box? i guess Q.C. in china with a gun held to your head...... well you know.threw the damn thing in the trash,never again.
B00V30J86I|3|wasn't wide enough so makes it hard to get items in and out.
B001VKT9IW|5|f
B0002TP2C0|3|Only one issue, the method they used to attach the escutcheon to the front of the charger. Makes the charger look cheap. Otherwise I like it.
B004UMB7WY|5|This stuff works.....We have a 2002 volvo and the rims were coated with brake dust, I scrubbed, washed,cleaned and still looked like crap. I bought iron x to try and in less than 5 minutes per rim they looked new again.Yea the stuff smells real bad,  Yea its expensive, but if you want your crappy looking rims to look new again spend the money, its worth it.
B00VL9LIM8|5|Very bright lights
B00DTO6G9S|5|very good lights for the price
B0031272GY|5|Great quality and a beautiful product.
B00EKTIDBU|5|Love it. Fit 2007 Camry perfectly. Easy to install, looks like it came with chrome door handles at affordable price!
B00AHQAXMM|5|great :)
B004VS384M|3|Lighting good
B00LO88BAS|5|easy to install, fit well and look great
B008G4Y076|5|very beautiful
B000UV961S|3|&#34;Meh&#34; is my response. First thing is is that it was too wide to begin with. Does not fit the windshield perfectly. It is stiff and supports itself at first, but after a couple of months it looses its rigidity and sags. Looks like crap after more wrinkles develope. I can imagine it would be the same across the board, but I can tell that multiply times of opening my visors, that it is wearing them out.<br /><br />Would go with a Subaru heatshield now in hindsight.
B00IITY08S|3|Ok for the price, I guess.  These are pretty narrow and sleek.  Installed on 1997 F150 4x4 supercab.  They could certainly use another support in the middle somewhere.  I go about 150lbs and they work fine for me.  If I were heavier, I would be concerned about durability.
B00HYHWSO8|5|Love these floormat liners.  It makes cleaning up the inside of my Ford Explorer much easier, and protects the carpet from the spills that tend to take place whenever my kids are riding along with me.  Good quality, although the rear floormats don't mold exactly to the floorboards like the front mats do.  I'm still very pleased overall.
B004JB1MGM|5|Great value for the money! Product came new and was what described. I took parts to mechanic to replace and saved 500 dollars with parts and labor from what I was originally quoted.
B004PQQTRI|4|Helps a lot to keep the sun out not completely but it helps to keep it cool and allows a breeze way also.
B0096S980U|5|Exactly replaced my old broken out case and its working fine now.
B000AA4RWM|5|Takes the guesswork out of wondering if your trailer is level.
B00N7KNI1S|5|Great looking license plate holder at a good price (less than $15).  Needed a new lph for the back of my Jeep Wrangler 4-door since the original dealer lph cracked after several years.  Fits fine.  Happy with this product.
B0040M30O2|5|As advertised, this seems an excellent theft deterrent.  While nothing can foil a really determined thief, this should discourage anyone looking for a quick and easy heist of your vehicle tag.  I would also recommend the screw covers which would further stymie a thief, sending them on to a less time consuming target such as a plate held on by those ridiculously simple to remove stock screws.  This is a well thought out assortment of stainless hardware that should fit most vehicles.  There are several kits available for different general applications so do your homework.  Just be sure to put the specially designed hex key in a safe place.
B001EEC45A|5|Fit beautifully and got a great price here!  Elements are known for having easy clean car interiors. The down side is that the upholstery becomes brittle and cracks quickly. These covers fit so well you won't believe its a cover!
B00032KC3K|5|These covers not only enhance the appearance of your license plate, hiding those often rusty stock screws, but serve somewhat as a theft deterrent especially when added to the stainless steel anti-theft hardware kit.  Anything that makes stealing something more difficult will likely send a thief in search of easier prey.
B001JEK4KW|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B0037Z5F3M|4|actually had to send it back because truck owner already bought an OEM and installed it before this came in. He was a little upset that he spent so much on the OEM as this was an identical match for a fraction of the cost.
B000K00DSO|5|Perfect deal I appreciated!
B00FTDJ9FA|5|Very bright!
B00ZVI491W|3|They are ok, but the hex screws are easily stripped when trying to tighten them enough for a 1.75&#34; bar.  They aren't totally tight like they should be as I can still move the lights around. I would find something better next time.
B00654OMF4|5|Fantastic Product. Full strength is great for degreasing engine bays!
B00IKKS4W8|5|My husband stated that they are very well made and strong jacks.  Wished the trailer would have come with some as good as these.
B001GF3QM2|5|Fits perfectly on my 2007 Ford Escape
B004WAW5OS|5|Great fit for the make and model I chose. Keeps my black leather interior cooler and leather wrapped steering wheel protected. The velcro strap is very convenient.
B00DTDYPWO|5|looks like a real plate
B00QXKKCS6|5|Very happy with the product
B00E1SLRG8|3|Rotars great except we got front brakes. :( we bought rear ones and saved these for when the fronts need changing
B008E7QGXG|4|great price -works
B0024ECCJW|5|Easy to install and works great!
B0002F6804|3|Came with no door or instructions of any kind. Plus poorly packaged.
B0028JBEBK|5|Fits perfectly in my 350rx and really helps to keep my car cooler.  Love it!
B01008A3XA|5|Works perfect
B000F2JEFA|5|Looks great and fits perfect 😎
B007O5FEIM|5|Though not mentioned in description of these tools, they are stamped Made in USA. I was pleasantly surprised because it's difficult to find tools produced in America. They're nice tools.
B00JUCBVP2|5|Love it! Shipped fast.
B001CQWM8E|5|Love it just what I wanted.
B00FQW7V4U|5|I Love it!
B009DJNSYY|5|Exact replacement
B00BDEOGA2|5|I use these on my RV drinking water hoses and a female connector to replace the old cover on my RV city water fill.  I keep my hoses in the storage area but these little end caps help keep the small creepy bugs out of them when not in use.
B0006GK5NA|4|Works as expected
B00Y1Q3TXY|5|Great Jacket for the price. I wear it all the time now when I take my bike out. It feels great and it is not uncomfortable for long rides. It has great visibility and that is critical to be seen in all weather. Would recommend for everyone riding.
B00MBPRWRG|2|Very thin metal, missing 1 recess on backside, should be 2 gauges heavier to last more than a couple years in use and match OEM.<br />Better than glassing up, but very lightweight to use, this thin metal is harder to weld than the oem gauge during repairs.
B0009N4F8Q|1|cheap crap
B000W0RPPQ|5|Works Great!
B00YB5GAEA|5|Great sale.
B00LNK9PLQ|1|Plate looked fine but covers tags completely on bottom.  Return policy and restocking fees are unreasonable.  Not your typical Amazon customer service partner.  If they work for you they do look good but if you have to return them for any reason you might as well throw them away.
B000GOHUW6|5|shipped fast, saved me a fortune on repair AC myself
B00JSSZBDQ|5|Great adjuster...would buy it over and over
B00KKA5QZO|5|waited a long time to find this and get a great deal on it
B0049P7NZW|5|great for fresh water on the boat
B00K16FPO4|5|We used about half of a bottle and the trim on our Jeep Wrangler 2011 has been restored from a light gray to black.  It is not perfect but definitely much better.  I will get this product again.
B009V18FX8|5|great
B00VPHYZMQ|5|thank you
B00M8IMLPY|5|I am fully satisfied with this product.
B00IKSL5BW|5|they are great! fits nice
B00074Q2A6|5|works awesome for our camper
B00OZWFKTK|3|in all fairness I have not installed this yet! That being said it is very cool and the right size, not large and gaudy like some I've looked at. My only concern is the fit, it doesn't actually have the adapter choices like some other shifters I've looked at, the &#34;universal fit&#34; is a silicone/plastic plug that you can force over the stem. Nice weight to it and it has a nice feel.
B00YXBC5CI|5|Fixed my problem and easy to install
B009SEJI66|4|Perfect Paint Match!!!!!!!!!!!
B000143LHY|4|I keep this in my car at all times. It works great at getting rid of ANY smell you need. I recommend this to anyone with a car.
B0030VBF00|1|just bad quality
B007ZUOZXQ|5|It did what it was supposed to do. Satisfactory Product
B000Q0YPYG|5|Fit my Kia.
B000E7SY0C|5|A quality product that is as advertised.
B00THYJ1MS|5|These are the best after market lights I've came across they are almost 100% as good as the real deal. Also the chrome is nice. I even put HIDs in them and it worked out great because they have the reflector cup over the low beams. Had a reflector cup fall inside and they overnights a new head light and let me keep the old one for extra parts. Very pleased. Worth the buy.
B0049QIXY6|5|Finally got rid of that pesky check engine light. Turns out it wasn't the gas cap.
B00JIEX722|5|They got here on time and are an excellent product. The light source and quality of item is exactly how it was described. I'll make damn sure,the next time I need license bulbs,I buy this product again
B009YKFJGM|5|Customer support is great! The parts are not OEM but they fit just fine and do the job. Beats the $200+ from the dealer.
B00RNITD32|5|Very nice.
B000O0GEO2|5|Genuine Ford part. No leaks. Can't ask for more.
B004DC7RTI|5|Great car mats
B008E9110W|5|So far so good. No dash lights on!
B005KYV9HE|5|perfect
B00HTOB0NG|5|They work great
B00WA3YLDM|5|GOOD PRODUCTS
B000TK8N1O|5|Pretty awesome
B001927PS8|5|great replacement part!!!!!!!!! easy to install. Saved some cash!!!!!!!
B000CO7I04|5|Part was as expected.
B00230KID4|5|Best degreaser cleaner for engine work I have found. Extremely expensive to stuff you can buy at  the box store but that stuff also doesn't work like this. If I have a nasty job I need to clean this is the stuff.
B000BZ51GC|5|These are great bearings. Fit perfect. The price was good too.
B005OS5YG8|1|Horrible fit. I thought this would be a perfect solution for me, and the cutout looked like it would go around my 4WD shifter but it was a horrible fit. It wouldn't lie flat on teh floor, it wouldn't conform to the center hum, and the hole for the shift boot was much higher than the contour of the floor and looked horrible. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B001CA4G84|5|These are the made in USA Moog suspension parts. Far exceed the quality of the OEM. They let you grease them and this is the 2nd car I put the Moog ball joints on. They will last forever as long as they are greased regularly. My OEM ball joints were totally wasted at 90,000 miles and more than likely should have been replaced 20,000 miles ago.
B00IS9427W|5|Awesome off road bumper. Installed really easy. All the mounting bolts line up perfectly. I hooked up the two middle lights to my existing driving light harness and ran a separate light harness bought on line to a rocker switch. Awesome lights really zombie bright I wouldn't use them in on coming traffic. Also the wiring hole drilled into the bottom of the brush guard is awesome for hiding the wires making it look clean. The item was packaged well. Thank goodness because the box took a beating. Arrived on time. Thanks really loving it !
B0059HJZO6|4|good lube
B00JSJMV38|3|Quality seems low for the price. Nice look and feel.
B00CXYVKKA|2|While the order arrived in a timely fashion, when I went to apply the decal, the letter &#34;y&#34; was missing in the word family.  I had to immediately remove the entire decal from my car. Sadly, removing the decal is a bit more difficult than applying it, although I did get it entirely removed from my car window.  I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 star because it did arrive quickly and applying it was easy to do.
B004JO7J1Q|5|Just what we hoped for!
B000C91HX8|5|Thanks
B000LG45TK|1|Not sure why you STILL have this listed as a Sport Trac exhaust, it DOES NOT FIT SPORT TRACS! I ordered it expecting a dual pipe exhaust for my 07 sport trac, but this is built for F150s, which have a totally different frame, and does not fit the explorer sport trac. As far as i can tell, only the Gibson single pipe cat back fits the sport trac, and that is what i had to get to replace this.
B008Y3NZ0W|5|Got perfect, operated perfect on my 454 block.
B003E3OH86|5|I have has a set of the covers on ,my 2008 ford edge for over 2 years now.  they have held up great  no problems going thru car washing.  still look great.  i would highly recommend to my friend and have.  i don't think you can go wrong with these covers.
B00F2ZH9UW|5|Whatever I use it in starts first pull.  Thats a big deal when using 2 cycle engines.  I'd  say its the real stuff for the application.
B000E26H5G|4|as described
B0088BX0IM|4|I like the looks but have not used it yet.
B002MW001S|5|My little Honda becomes a semi-truck with this thing. Love it. Can pull much more than it's rated for.
B009PF8G8E|5|These fit our 2006 Nissan Murano perfectly, perfect amount of lift
B00094JANK|1|I loved them at first, but after time they move around  and creates a problem when you have a manual transmission.
B00U1E0OQK|5|I am not sure why I waited this long to get it. it is a breeze now to hook up and go. No more breaking your back trying to line up mowers or box blade.
B000IYSJHY|4|As advertised.
B002MCVPOO|5|Worked perfect for my 01 6.6.
B00ANZHG4U|5|Excellent, will order more. Soft and absorbent, survive the washing machine just fine.  Using these instead of paper towels for many things now.
B007KPJIRE|5|Great Item, fast shipping
B00861F9CY|5|Great muffler system,  Bolted on ok. Needed to buy an extra wide clamp. Overall very happy. Got an extra 2 miles to the gallon!!!!
B001DKT0DO|5|Easy to use and well attached on the mirror. Recommended!
B00RZ4Z3GK|4|Good switches.
B0023VOVRW|4|Fit great.
B0073Q48TI|5|Good product hence the rating however it doesn't fit into my 7/8&#34; bars maybe bad measuring on my half, I drilled my bars to fit, and have had no problems since good blind spot protection and aligning them can be a a little time consuming but patience pays off
B00DP3O8ZM|5|Love this exhaust !
B008B5U5U6|4|does the job
B007UHPSAS|4|I like these reflectors, but they are the wrong size for my car.  I bought the size recommended for my make and model, but I have to finesse them to get them to stay up.  Just didn't want to go to the hassle of exchanging them.
B00P7ZV0VG|5|Awesome product!!!!  Looks like a photo. Very easy to apply. I purchase 4 more (2 for a gift) and two for my flats boat.
B00C4B1F7U|4|My wife found the package badly damaged when she got home.  it had been delivered by UPS.  Both ends of the hitch had broken through the box.  The actual hitch was fine and appeared in good condition.  it was relatively easily to install  As a newbie it took me 45 minutes-1 hour.  The hitch itself seems strong and well made (i'm about to move cross country and will be using it in conjunction with a hitch mounted cargo carrier).  The packaging and delivery sucked, but thankfully didn't effect the hitch itself.
B0067UDP9A|2|Distance from base to engine mounting bolt is off by over 1/2&#34; and the 3 bolt holes on the base are slightly off as well.  It probably won't fit any other 88-91 Honda Prelude since they all use the same motor mount, the [[ASIN:B000CRCUY0 Anchor 8008 Rear Mount]].  I noticed if I changed my car's description from the Si 4WS to 2.0 Si, Amazon indicates that the Anchor 8008 mount will fit.  This doesn't make sense, as the 2.0L and 2.1L blocks had the same dimensions externally.  A brief web search shows that the model 8008 mount fits both engine sizes, as well as Preludes through 1996 according to O'Rilley's and Ebay.  Reference attached pictures.  In the first picture the new mount is behind, faced up to the old one.  Using Amazon's excellent l return policy, I have exchanged this one for the 8008 model, and will try to update after installation to confirm the fitment.  Edit Sept 16, 2015:   The Honda part # for both the 2.0L manual transmission and the 2.1L manual is 50810-SF1-000 (discontinued, of course).  I received the Anchor 8008 and it fit...after some modifications.  Hope to post a review there as well.
B001AGFI78|5|Go to Walker's ecatalog on their website to find the exact one you need. Put the part number in amazon and bang. Great quality.
B00C1XT22Q|5|Works great
B001KS0M5O|4|Replacing my rear wiper was easier than I thought, and ordering this wiper saved me money over what I thought would have to be a factory part.
B001Y91MFI|4|So far so good
B00XQ1SBE2|5|fits perfectly and it is very sturdy unlike the usual sunshades.
B000EDOSKG|5|I love this because it allows me to install this on faucets without the ribs.
B011NNGPR4|2|Extremely thin material feel cheap.
B00TD1NCYI|5|Perfect.
B00VU5VKSA|5|good sound fast shipp
B00JGJH8QU|5|Use this everytime I hook up my RV! Great Product!
B000C67XK2|5|Cheapest filter kit around.perfect fit. Shipped on time too.
B001NYP6VU|5|ok excellent seller
B00P704AFO|5|Great looking and nicely made.  Fits perfectly.  I will wait till after winter to see how it holds up with the ice and snow.
B000BQSIWK|5|No problems so far.
B010RJ3E3I|5|Fits nicwly
B00JSCK650|1|Problem with light is moisture collects inside as it is not sealed very well at all and once that happens light begins not to function.  Wish I would of known this and bought a different one that can take rain.  Otherwise great light if used indoors or someplace where it never rains.
B00K8XDJ98|5|Easy install and look great
B009S9RURU|5|Thanks I love it and fast shipping
B0000AY4MK|5|Great price and convenient to use.  Looks well on my 2004 black Silverado.
B00QFSAPP6|5|This thing is great with plenty of cord
B0024E62CU|5|Works well with the Quick Connect hose
B004131EDY|3|Not oem or could be rust my truck is 14yo but had to take them to the belt sander.
B00CQW8XAY|4|Good, you have to do some adjustment to make it fit, but for the price, its great.
B00NWF5YF6|5|Very nice way to replace the controls of a worn down door opener
B00XZ9N50U|5|Toyota wanted to charge me $122 just for the remote and another $55 to program it. Got it here on Amazon for $20 and programed it myself in less then 5 mins. If I ever need another one I'm getting it from Amazon. Very happy with it. And highly recommend this.
B00HRSW4YS|5|Its nice to have a 6 point bolt head replace the original 12 point in this application.
B000F0G0UO|5|Great
B0055BXZKQ|5|Used this on my 2015 Corvette Zo6 to wrap the air intake elbow. Seems to be cutting down the air intake temps fairly well for such a cheap mod
B00P80MRP8|5|This product fits perfect in the 2014-2015 Ford Escape with the extra large sloping from window. Glad I purchased it.
B00DUS3EKC|5|Was delivered very fast. No damage and was in original packaging. Install was very easy and I've been running it for a few days now. I will update my review after I have some miles on the radiator. Royal parts is great!! great communication also!! 2 months later....I installed the rad myself and it was fairly easy for a guy who can turn a wrench. So far so good! it has been running great with no puddles left under my rig. So far I've driven 3000 miles. I will update my review later. So far I'm very happy!
B000SOFLHK|5|works good
B002UC4YMQ|5|When the power converter in our camper shot craps because of a pitiful power supply at Fort Niangua during a canoe trip, I purchased the Parallax as a replacement.  If fit perfectly into the space of our old power converter.  It was easy to install (if you are familiar with wiring) and works great!
B000N5U5VG|3|Big and heavy but it's inexpensive.
B006QGD996|5|Easy to use
B0006H9346|5|Fit perfectly, fixed leaking problem.
B00QMWQK2M|4|Great value and looks good.
B001P20XZE|5|Great accessory for my 2006 Hummer H3
B0021YZELI|1|I'm an avid Amazon customer.  and never take time to complete a product review, however after my experience this past weekend, feel compelled to do so!  It was time for my dreaded semi-annual detail on my 22ft Blazer Bay so this past week I went on Amazon to purchase my &#34;go to&#34; marine cleaner wax and polymer polish. I noticed DRIVEN MARINE POLISH, read the reviews and decided to try something new since A friend of mine uses this product on his car and loves it. What a mistake! This was a weekend project with a lot of hard work and elbow grease that I always dread but do because it's a must if you want to keep your boat in good condition after weekly use fishing the salt water, brackish water and fresh water on Mobile Bay in South Alabama!<br /><br />My process that has always produced the best results is a thorough boat wash, thorough use of biodegradable Hull Cleaner, two applications of boat cleaner wax with PTEF using an electric buffer and two coats of Marine Polish with PTEF both also applied using an electric buffer (PTEF IS A GIVE AWAY ON WHICH PRODUCT). This process gives me 6 months of a beautiful shinny hull finish where everything washes off with minimal effort using any boat soap and NO STAINS OR WATERLINES ACCUMULATE ON THE HULL!<br /><br />This past Friday and Saturday I completed the above process and the boat looked as expected - awesome! Deep shine and I was impressed!<br />Sunday I decided to reap the benefits of all my labor and took my son out for a day of fishing. We launched in brackish water in the Bay and then headed out to the salt water around Dauphin Island. We returned after dark and decided to wash the boat in the morning. Folks I just spent an hour scrubbing the boat with boat soap and it's shinny! Unfortunately, the hull has brown splotchy stains everywhere below the waterline and I have to use cleaner wax and a buffer to get it out! Wasted a weekend because I used DRIVEN instead of my &#34;go to&#34; which has always proven reliable! If you need a sealer in your application don't use this product! Best of the Best is false advertising! Shine it does but after one use it stains from ordinary use! Might be a great product for fresh water but brackish and salt water it doesn't compete with the PTEF brand. Another lesson learned the hard way! Never buy a product with a cool name in a cool bottle that advertises to be the best of the best! Buy what you know works!liable! If you need a sealer in your application don't use this product!

B001O7PNNM|5|Great product
B0091YXN46|5|Perfect fit everytime. Just turn bulb around if it doesn't work to first time.
B00INA090U|5|I am short and this is a life savor.  The screen is a little distorted but I can live with that as long as it bocks that sun.
B00W6J04Z4|1|Didn't fit truck properly
B000H7CJAK|2|Did not come with the acid to fill.. so had to go to local autostore. Should have been clearly stated in description so clients would be informed.
B004GCAOOA|5|I bought this for my 1997 GMC Suburban - to cut some holes into it, so I can install some fog lights. I did not feel good about cutting up a perfectly good fitting factory spoiler. Now, because I knew this was not OEM, I was expecting to struggle quite a bit to install it, but I was very shocked on how well all the bolt holes (10 in all) aligned up! The only three things I recommend, is first: (and as stated in another review), is to do this when it is above 70 degrees so that it is easier to work with, second: start from the middle and work your way out one faster at a time in each direction, and third: because I had problems removing the factory bolts / clips, I reinstalled the new spoiler with all stainless steel hardware. This is in case I ever have to remove it again, I shouldn’t have any problems. Hope this review was helpful for you!<br /> Craig
B008R0LIHO|5|No problems!
B00I1PT70A|2|Helmet is pretty heavy, so it is hard to handle when you need to move your head
B000CO86EG|3|I really don't like how the red paint was already staining the inside of the box it was shipped in.<br />As soon as I took it out, little red chips of paint fell onto the counter and floor and slightly stained my hands.<br /><br />I don't plan to return it as it needs to fullfill it's purpose but i wanted to warn consumers not to place this product directly on the carpet of your cars.
B003JICQNY|5|The 20k Reese is a strong very good hitch
B00IKQZSA8|5|Good
B008Y807MQ|2|To cheaply made
B003CVX89E|1|Didn't see the small writing that I had to spend another $75.00 dollars to purchase a special battery for it.
B0040D0IXM|5|good
B00O0E4FTY|5|Fits perfect in my car.
B010PDAB96|4|Fixture is quite bright, has nice appearance and low profile is also better than comps.  4 stars instead of 5 because I had to bend soldered contacts on PC board to get fixture to mount flush & did not include mounting screws or wire nuts.
B00VVSC8TQ|3|It attracts lost of dust and lint, which drives me crazy. However, it does keep the key from falling off, which is why I purchased.
B00P9OF04I|5|This stuff worked great!  Just as described no complaints.  We could get 2 or 3 uses out of it too!
B002R0ODE0|5|Great light, red not orange, perfect
B0012BHVP8|5|This voltmeter is the perfect size to fit in my tool box, and has worked well whenever I use it to see how well our trailer house batteries are charged.
B000A0CAQM|3|Typical low cost Air Filter for a family min-van that sees a lot of highway miles. Would go with a more rugged brand if I were to use a vehicle which saw more off highway use.
B00HCROOR4|5|Worked as advertised. It was very easy to install.I have no issues with it.
B0014I1BRI|2|This drastically made my mpg worse. The sound is quite nice. And the actual performance is good.
B00L3E0LQU|3|It's not really big enough for a full load of groceries, it maybe fits 3 medium filled bags.
B009AGY7IQ|5|Good quality at that price range.
B0002Z9N88|4|Have a buddy help you. looks and sounds good.
B001NYYREC|5|excellent
B00332GNXK|5|The rail caps are perfect. Arrived on time and look great on my new truck. Would highly recommend these....
B00069CN2I|5|These are excellent mirrors that are easy to install. They have not vibration  and I am very satisfied with them. I would recommend them and they come at a great price. I use them  to tow my travel trailer.
B00W31VMYC|4|Too tall will get shorter one next
B00X012TUU|5|Fits great
B00IA2DOKS|5|Exactly as described! Speedy delivery too!
B00H7PQ50U|5|This stuff is amazing!!! It cleaned all the mold out of my shower and my curtains stay dry and clean. My car looks amazing!! The people with bad reviews either don't know how to listen or read because they used it wrong...you don't have to let it dry or use buffing machines! If you find this at a costco get it!
B000IE0F12|5|Glad to know I have it if I need it
B0087NB1IW|5|Awesome product, phone calls are clear...the receiving end can't even hear background noises.  Also love the Bluetooth capabilities, streaming music helps with the long rides!
B0035MVGA8|4|I have one proplem with it , it tends to scan to one side once or twice when i use hazard light , otherwise it looks nice even the reverse light does not really match the truck yellowish reverse light and i wander if is gonna continue functioning after 2 years from now
B000NZSR5W|5|I love these tail lights! I had the same style for my 2004 Chevy Monte Carlo and just loved them. Once I get my JKU, I just had to have them! No problem with condensation inside and are extremely bright!
B00IGDP6ZC|5|Used as a replacement. Fits great!
B00CJ9JE6Q|5|Worked great. Thanks. Would buy again.
B00VW0J846|5|Great antenna!!!  Fit my 2014 GMC perfectly. Looks awesome.
B000TK5TLG|5|This is a great air horn!  It's always dangerous riding a motorcycle, because of the many idiots that think driving the car is secondary to phone usage.  The air horn will get their attention quick!  It's very loud!  Happy to add it to the motorcycle that had a wimpy stock horn!
B00DMA7PCQ|5|good rubber
B008CGXHQ8|3|not worth the money, save your dollars for the strip club
B002LYQALQ|5|Sweet!
B000G76OOI|3|Good Quality
B00BT0KJVK|1|All of these RV led lights are supposed to be manufactured to fit a 12v automobile socket.  The four long-neck led lights I received would not fit in the sockets.  So I am now the proud owner of four long-neck reading lights that are of no use to me.
B00X35BYFY|2|Cool looking lightbar. .this bar is spot style no real flood....update10/17 . Took it off my suv.. it looks bright. It just dozent put any light on road or anywhere. I would not recommend this.
B00L3YKSXG|5|I love it
B00KTIZPF8|1|Could not get it to program
B00GJ1DCMM|5|Part fit perfectly and performs well
B00Z8YTFQS|5|It will work
B00NOG0PNO|5|It's a very good light bar you can't go wrong with it.
B0002M9QRE|1|Not at all bright enough to make much difference driving on city streets and angle adjustment is horrible.
B009PMKRCU|5|Thank great product
B00JAMW5SY|5|Love my new sticker came in on time and in good condition. It was easy to put on.
B00JXZR6CI|5|Very good
B00B2PWBZ4|5|I can believe how much dirt I track into the car from my shoes. I can take these out, wash and dry them and insert back into the car.
B00Y5EQ5DI|5|Nice product, fast shipping.
B003YLKLD8|5|Fan used to work only on high , now it works on all levels like the day I bought the car.
B006GLA8TA|5|Look great!
B001L92UMU|5|it fits just right.  Nice and firm and is easy to put up
B00BMRZN66|5|It is the cats meow. Works really great.
B00NHUN41C|5|Just what I was expecting.
B007638TOS|5|What we wanted.
B00063X7KG|5|I've used Mequiar's clay bars for years and would never wax my vehicles without this important first step. However, I never flatten the bar into a &#34;pancake&#34; as instructed. I always use it as a full &#34;bar&#34; and for good reason. Allow me to explain:<br /><br />When the bar surface becomes soiled, I take a common Potato Peeler and take a few seconds to shave off the soiled layer, exposing a new pristine surface. Using this method, I've had clay bars last for years and there is never a question about the bar being too soiled to use any longer.<br /><br />I never understood the logic in folding or kneading microscopic contaminates back into the bar ? How do you know when the bar is too contaminated to safely use any longer??
B00XWDYT4U|1|I bought this keyfob and got totally different item that will not work with my Tacoma delivered. Sad!!
B00HVVVEYM|2|Perfect fit into cargo carrier.  Very good for dry weather.  Used it on a 6-week cross-country trip.  Problem was even thought properly closed with zipper and Velcro tabs, it leaked in the rain.  All packed materials on bottom of bag were soaked.  Not a good experience.
B00BKW444A|5|Worked well loading a truck on my trailer. It's a little fast but overall a great buy.
B000CB21WC|5|OEM fit in my 1995 Honda Accord 2.7
B0049CM1LG|5|Bought this a few months ago, easily installed and is still working great.
B005CO9FDW|5|item perfectly described and shipped as promised
B000TYQ9G6|5|great product, wonderful service for purchase
B005OK6UZK|5|Works great so far!
B007PKC6KK|5|Very Pleased
B00DJDYS58|5|work's great & great product
B00C4B1F7U|5|High quality, prompted shipping and very easy to install. Love my new hitch.
B000GOG3FG|5|Great! Works like a charm. Getting it in can be a little fiddly though. If you are having trouble, remove the glove box. There is two 1/2 in bolts on the bottom and the clips on the inside pop right out. Just make sure to leave the glove box closed while removing it. Also, bundle a new air filter because the one that's in there is probably very dirty! This worked for my 2001 civic ex.
B00N2ZFTOW|5|Better than the original.
B000WK4CS4|5|Great product! Easy prep, strong battery.
B007MUY8U4|5|the same lift part number matched  100%  same mfg  and everthing  works  as stated  on amazon  reminder  when ordering  lifts  they come in pairs  so fi you change  your old  lifts  change both so the lift window  goes up straight  then it wont bind up because the lifts are matched  as a pair<br /> works great  no problems  my old<br />suspa  my lifts where over 12years old  and I replaced with same  Suspa  lifts<br /> if you plan on changing your lifts  on the cylinder there is a part number  on it to tell you what type  and pressure  and make and model number<br />not hard to change  took me aboult 5min to change them
B004G4H6M6|4|Fit like they were supposed to.
B00FH43E9S|5|This thing fits so damn snug, it is amazing. Not too tight so as too be uncomfortable, but allows no unnecessary movement either. Chin strap padding is extremely comfortable. I even have room to fit an Over-The-Ear earbud in comfortably. Never had problems with feeling too hot or fogging up on me as the vents work great. No excess wind noise.
B00R8NFDPY|1|Does not fit right and the damn brackets keep popping off. Wasted $$ and now I have to go spend more $$$ at the dealer for the proper ones.
B008IT8TAI|5|Arrived in very good time. The packaging was great and it arrived with no defects. I was able to put it on with the help of my 65 year old Dad... We had a good time working on it. It took about an hour maybe a little less. I had no trouble getting the old one off. This bolted on and fit perfect for my 2007 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. I like the sound, it could be a little louder, but it will do.
B00F5DSZ9U|4|Injectors look well crafted and I was able to easily install them in my 2003 Mazda Tribute.
B00CIYZHSQ|5|good quality, keeps the oil where it should be
B006M6ZDNU|4|Purchased to replace the battery in my Chamberlin garage door opener. Fit just like the original and seems to be working fine. Time will tell.
B009B6IQHS|5|Excellent product. It's of nice quality. It sits high enough that it is only a few inches away from my right hand when on the steering wheel. It obviously makes your throws a bit longer so I recommend having a short shifter already installed. It comes with adapters, but it fit perfectly on my car without them. I would recommend this product
B004YID69G|5|Great add on piece.
B009NROGLU|5|these work as good as the one that came with my fish finder
B003UT5VKW|4|Good product but not a100% off on stains but if does look a lot better. I do recommend this. Also great on the price and size.
B0073JDIFK|5|love it
B009TA3D9W|3|These seem to fit well, but extend behind the pedals higher than the factory mats. So I have to press the clutch pedal extra hard to start the car. These also (unnecessarily) cover the dead pedal. Otherwise I'd say these do the job just fine.
B006EH9WUC|1|Not good
B00DBEQ48Y|5|Great product at a great price. And shipped ontime. Rear only
B007SAIFWA|5|Awesome quality at awesome price. WIN - WIN!!!
B004GCO0X6|5|On Time and no dents Thank You.
B0009U65G4|4|Meguiars makes a number of good quick detailer products but this one is the best.  It's a little pricey so I only use it for the final step in my car wash/waxing process.  I use Meguiars Ultimate Quick detailer for quick cleanup of dirt and other droppings as it is a bit cheaper.
B002QS3F9C|5|Reads temperature accurately
B001CEG90I|5|Rev4 2013 best
B000S2MKSU|5|Bueno
B001F15Z5I|5|good
B00M0EJKOG|2|Beautiful, went on nicely. One month later the floral design started to flake away. 3 months old and it has fallen apart. Don't bother to buy this one.
B003848C4G|5|Insane improvement over stock! The customer service is also fantastic!
B00TI1D5JK|4|Good product at a great price!
B00N43I2TG|5|Great product + amazing quality
B009LHJ0OK|5|Very happy with purchase
B005BNYVWY|2|I bought this product for my wooden steps on my porch....... They did not adhere at all and ended up tacking them down
B000NTLS2M|5|Product shipped very quickly. It was a great fit. Pulled it out of the box and snapped it on the tailgate without effort. 45 seconds to install. I'll admit it was pricey for a basic plastic injection molded part but no other suppliers had a credible reference to my application so I bit the bullet and now have a great fitted tailgate cap.
B0042Z0E6E|5|Loved these. Worked out perfectly to put over dirt for a large party. Cleaned up and folded up nicely for storage. Price was excellent for size. The material was perfect for my use, but I would classify them more as a mat than a rug.
B00MI3JU2G|5|I like this hat it goes with my silver 2012 mustang.  It is good quality.
B004A5LCMQ|1|Not heavy duty. Very loose fit on my 2 5/16&#34; hitch.  Looks a lot better than it really is.
B00W8LR0KM|3|Figment isn't perfect but really close
B00XE07Q14|4|basically this is no-name Chinese TPMS system.<br />The installation requires to open all tires (I bought the internal sensor model).<br />The sensors will start transmitting once they sense airflow or pressure change.<br />the monitor is nice as it can sit wireless on the dashboard . it has also auto-power-off.<br />So far I am charging it with solar light (never had to charge it manually).<br />The reading is accurate (compared to an analog tire pressure gauge).<br />So far so good but I only own it for a week.<br />So time will tell if this system lasts, especially how the display survive under hot summer (it includes a Lion battery) and those tend to crash under heavy temperatures.
B000EQR5YE|4|Works so far. Easy installation.
B006E4KG5U|5|Great replacement for boat lighting where power is a premium
B002JB8046|5|Good
B00PGIUC4K|2|Broken power control system.<br />As well as very slow when running.
B00LVTZLU8|3|They work, but are kinda low quality.  One of them came with a scratch which showed up as a silver stripe (black sharpie took care of this).
B00HW1TLYQ|5|Great stuff
B006QMIKIK|5|Easy install. OEM quality fits in perfectly.
B00BMH5Y9C|5|works perfectly
B00KPZECVI|4|Lines up with button very well, this cover will allow me to carry this on a key ring as the plastic loop on the key was broken.
B000ALJ4MY|1|They cut the size of the resin in half. Buyer beware. Dont think is enough.
B000BWAKX4|5|The installation was delayed and was not able to rated.  I have completed the installation and the product is A-1 quality for my corvette<br />Rafael
B00KTJ6D26|5|Bought for my dads car
B00ZBV55CG|5|Looked exactly like it did in the photo. That's awesome.
B004EQ8882|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. Added that extra pop to the truck. Easy install and very affordable.
B00CO853J4|5|Beautiful fit and quality. Excellent price and shipping
B00KV7WSVQ|1|Didnt fit my truck
B003RWQUTI|5|WORKS LIKE MAGIC
B00SSKLXS2|5|works great.....!!!!!!
B00NHJOC6O|5|Wiring was simple, and since mine has the side airbags I had the heaters installed in the seats. Love the look of the controls. It adds about 12w per step for a total of 60W when on the highest setting per seat.
B00995LDN0|1|Its fake.. you'll get a shipment from china
B000X25MJE|5|Wanted something waterproof to cover the cargo area in my 2015 Prius v and give me a little extra peace of mind that spilled milk wasn't going to leak through to the high voltage battery. Great fit. and provides a nice contrast if you have the &#34;ash&#34; color interior.
B00V7NEPYG|5|Great lights and best value.
B0017UBHQS|5|Just as good as OEM.
B001DQA89S|5|I have used this product for 4 years since I moved to Lake Tahoe. My home is at 6,500 feet elevation. This product does an excellent job of helping to melt the ice and snow on the windshield.<br />I have a washer fluid sensor and it works fine with this product. This product is good in the winter but I also have a home in Yuma, AZ and it works fine there at 115 degrees.<br />James Spencer
B000CPCRMW|3|G2 paint system looks much better and last longer but a bit pricier- but worth it
B000COCX0E|1|this didn't work for me. the bolt went at and angle and i couldn't recover. it resulted in an even worse oil leak than i had before. it was really hard to do in a garage with jack stands. this could work for you if you have access to a lift and make absolutely sure that it's going in straight.
B000CPI5XW|5|I'm actually impressed with the Red Line shockproof gear oil. Shifting gears is far less &#34;clunky&#34; sounding and much smoother on my 2012 xl883.
B004BTOR6E|1|Didn't specify early or late engine version.  Didn't fit. Stuck with it now.
B00852684M|1|Total piece of S$%T. These are hilariously poor and do not work out of the box.
B0046I3I8I|2|Cheap material - won't last long
B0110CO95S|5|First the product: WYSIWYG pretty much. I personally divided the stickers into roughy three categories:<br /><br />A) Brand logos comprised about half, maybe a bit more. I'm not really one to advertize brands, but my girlfriend can use the for collahe, and while most are well known (starbucks, coke) some are more esoteric, and could pass as just interesting art.<br /><br />B) comprised about a quarter of the total and ranged from stickers of a young goku to ageneric looking cartoon lion. I won't be putting these anywhere prominent, and might just give them to some younger relatives.<br /><br />Finally, C) the stickers I am happy with. These again comprise about a quarter of the total shipmrnt (that's down to individual taste) but even so, compared to purchasing similar sized stickers individually I saved a lot of money. My personal favorites ranged from a Shephard Fairey obey sticker to batman to a kind of trippy multi-coloured flower. There is variety.<br /><br />Note that four of the 100 stickers were somewhat adult in nature, these being a rainbow pot-leaf, and three not fully clothed women. I think there was a hint of nipple in one of them. The horror. So if you're giving these to your kids, flip through them quickly if you are over protective.<br /><br />Also, I too got the Obama as the joker political sticker that another reviewer mentioned. I'll just put it in the uni's young republicans' mailbox next time I get over to that part of campus and if one of them wants it then it's a win-win. I think it's a dumb sticker, but a large part of the fun of this is that it's a grab bag. You don't know *exactly* what you're getting, and the fun is opening the bag and seeing what comes tumbling out.<br /><br />I bought this pack because I am having a sort of mini mid life crisis and after years of not decorating/defacing essentially anything I own, I have the sudden urge to customize everything. Some of these are going on my car, others on binders or my laptop. I am completely satisfied with this purchase. For this price, there's really no reason not to gamble that you'll like even ten of them, given the exorbitant prices of individual stickers.
B001DH4C3U|5|Just what we wanted
B00CS335VS|4|These bolts were the right size for my 1995 Ford Ranger and installed easily. The only complaint I have is that they are an allen head vs. the torx head that the factory installed/OEM parts were. Luckily I had a socket already and didn't have to buy one, but I didn't realize this when I purchased them. It has rained several days now and parking on a hill submerges the bolts in water, sometimes for days at a time. They haven't rusted yet so their plating is of reasonable quality.
B00KXP8UN6|1|This is a horrible product. The primer, paint, and clearcoat do not flow out of the marker tip after a single use. Once used, the tip becomes soaked with primer/paint and will dry out, making the entire tip stiff and unusable. I will never buy products from this company again.
B00OGNM04Q|5|Exact replacement for the original
B001898WRA|4|The doors came in in good shape and they were not difficult to install. You do have to adjust them so that they close easily and to prevent them from pulling away from the body of the Jeep when going over 30 MPH. I still haven't been able to get one of the doors from pulling away but in all fairness I still haven't put the doors in a vice and bend them to give them more tension.<br /><br />Having said that, these doors are not water tight and a perfect fix, but that's is to be expected. They are noisy and leak pretty bad when it was parked and it rained over night. But what they are good for is being able to carry them in your Jeep on those days you take your doors off but want to have a back up plan in case it rains. It's better to have some protection when raining then none at all. I was going to see if I could leave these on all summer, but it leaked so bad while parked that I put the stock doors back on. I would recommend these doors if you want a back up plan to no doors at all.

B00EKW1NEG|5|Thanks you so much! It is perfect.
B007V2CN1O|5|Bought one of these for my Ford F150, it works great!  I like the fact that it is hard and stays in place.
B001BNHY1S|5|Great floor mats. Great team!
B002IV8A42|5|The plate can be moved up in a machine shop with an hydraulic press. My seat now goes from 7-11 inches, which is perfect. I lock the swivel in the open position, which makes it easy to turn around and look at the skiers. I had to make a hole in the floor with a jig saw, easy to do. The post extends down the haul
B001G6MO7Y|5|Perfect fit and price !!!<br />Japanese craftsmanship !!!
B011QXQ7EM|5|We LOVE IT<br /><br />Thank You

B00WAOR9H6|5|Was. Exactly what I wanted.
B000C3BBKS|5|Right price and fast shipping. Install was simple but varys of course depending on vehicle. I wanted to use an fittings but cheaped out. Everything in box was all I needed.
B000BZL9PO|2|did not fit my 1994 Volvo 240
B0067UERWE|5|Exact match as orginial, fast shipping, I would recommend.
B007DYCL1C|1|Only was shipped one of the two I paid for.
B005G5S3F8|5|Best boot ever.
B00XM21EXK|5|Shipped quickly. Item as described. I finally was able to put the last touch to the 26s. Looks good. Definitely recommend.
B000BQSIWK|5|Use it to charge my deep cycle battery I use on my trolling motor and it works great.  Charges quickly and then maintained between uses.  It is light, small and durable so it stays nicely tucked away in the corner of my garage where my fishing gear is kept.<br />The indicator lights and screen lets you know when your battery is ready to go and they can also let you know if you've connected the wires backwards.  Sorry I cannot give you an exact time line on how long it takes to charge my deep cycle, however I plugged it in around 10pm and at 5am it was fully charged and ready for the water.
B001EOYIRW|5|Excellent! Easy install and quick delivery. The only thing that would make it better in my opinion would be to include a flange for attaching electrical plug in.
B00BLS3HFA|1|BAD PRODUCT LASTED LESS THAN 100 MILES AND THEN ENGINE WENT TO FULL THROTTLE CREATING A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION...
B004A30UHG|4|All it was supposed to be
B0068EV0M4|5|great price early delevery just what i needed to get back up and running
B000XBGTAQ|5|Just what I needed. Quick delivery, competitive price.
B00XBRWE6W|4|Very good idea for locking down the hood. but they tend to bend when installing lower bracket. other than that. they work
B000NCOKZQ|2|Does not work on my Samsung Android phone.  Plug the plug into the speaker jack and when I push the camera button, it just makes the zoom move out then that is it.  Nothing else.  Checked with a few other friends, it worked OK with their I phones but not on mine even though it says on the Amazon page that it works on Android.  Also, the head on mine wobbles.  Not at all happy with this.  Tried to e-mail the store but have not heard back.  Maybe I am missing something.
B00C503ZUU|5|GREAT
B002FR5QZU|5|I just love this plate for the front of my Honda Accord.  It's so beautiful.  The colors are very brilliant. I also bought a frame for it with the screws to attach it to my car. I live in South Florida and the theme goes great with where I live. Gorgeous!!
B0018PW15I|5|Fixed my oil pan leak.
B0002Q7ZU0|5|Simple plug in install. Hardest job was fishing the wires through the grommets in the body but using stripped single strands of Romex wire I was able to get them through. Plugs fit perfectly. I was glad not to have to cut any wires to complete the installation.
B00BKWTGHK|5|This is great lights up the cargo box perfectly! I showed this to a friend and he ordered one for his truck next day! I am sure it can be used for many other applications as well. has a timer so it will shut itself off in a few minutes (conserve batteries) the amount of light is more than enough.
B007FTV9Q8|3|It gets really Hot to the touch.
B002SSKFGG|5|Fit perfect, worked as expected
B003IS3HV0|3|I didn't see a huge difference between this conditioner and Lexol.  So my vote is it's just okay.
B004RCRS9I|5|Works great, makes washing the roof of my truck a cinch.
B000C9MBX8|5|OE Seal.  Worked great.
B001DV1EUU|1|Still did not receive plate as shown on website
B000EDSSEI|1|Looks nice, good construction...but it won't seal.  I decided to get this so that I could see/monitor the flow when I dump.  Unfortunately, it doesn't fit onto the RV valve/outlet tight enough to seal.  Instead, it drips continuously as you dump your tank (yuck!).  I thought it might be a bad rubber gasket so I bought a new set.  Nope, still won't seal.  You can feel that it is not tight when you put it on your valve/outlet.  The gasket needs to be just a tad thicker.  My old black 45 degree elbow fits fine and seals; you can feel that it is &#34;snug&#34; when you put it on the RV; but this one isn't.  Oh well, maybe I'll try the Valterra brand. Edit 7/1/2016:  I purchased the Valterra brand; it fits much better and doesn't leak the way this Camco unit does.
B00BGRDMOM|5|Great product, well made and fast shipping.
B0024ECAE4|3|My main gripe with these locks is that you cannot remove the key when its unlocked, without modifying the front of the lock to add another notch so the key comes out in the 90 degree position.  Other than this inconvenience, the lock functions smoothly and seems like its made of good materials.
B008CH4NPQ|5|BRIGHT !!<br />and easy to install in my 2006 Scion xb
B000C9DHHM|5|Great peace
B00HCX06A2|5|I bought this for my husband who just bought a Vespa.  He loves it!
B00VXRT636|4|Seems to work fine and didn't rip apart on the first use.
B00BYNJ7OW|5|Worth every penny . Big improvement over oe
B008CH146C|5|i get a lot of compliments on it and am proud to have it displayed on our vehicle
B008X02JIU|4|Exact part and easy to install
B00E0I54FO|5|Worked just as described, thank you
B00873J0YY|5|Good quality & easy to install.
B00HTX3BNE|5|It was easy to install makes my car sound a lot more beefier. It as the description says only thing is that it needs a divider like some of the others have so your car brings in cool air instead of the engine heat cuz that's the whole point of a ram air cold air intake but all & all I am very happy with the price and the product.
B00U3AQN1W|5|Easy to use and understand. Not just give the codes but also the meaning. No more $125 each time the engine light goes ON.
B002MCOP0A|4|Was doubtful at first look, but a bit later I could plainly see the added value of the Chrome overlay!!  Hopefully the 3m tape will hol up well throught he winter months..Will wait and see!!
B007Q1DKD0|5|Perfect fit. Fast shipping! Thank you
B000UIY5TO|4|had to modify the gasket and drill a couple holes to line up but it works great.
B0089P91YO|5|It really looks good and sturdy except I expected it to be a little bit bigger. It's about the size of a nickel. Despite that, I think it's a good buy!
B003U1NQOS|5|I always get laughs from this :P
B00GRHS8Y0|5|Awesome product.
B00NNZKE6O|5|Worked as expected.  May have been able to use something from the local parts store, but decided to use the Subaru product instead.  Car shifts better than new!
B00KTHUTRI|5|They keys working perfect like original. I took it to the local locksmith in my area for cut and programming!
B005CLPPVG|1|This picture clearly shows the DRIVERS Toyota Echo exterior door mechanism.<br /><br />If you can't even get the picture/description right, how good will you be at getting the actual part right?
B00BITIZWW|5|Worked great, missing screw cover.
B00MJVE0UY|5|Haven't rode with it yet but it fits great. All the features are excellent and work as described. Delivery was prompt. Helmet is gorgeous, the picture doesn't do it a whole lot of justice
B004NFW5EC|5|Excellent long lasting product!
B00G23Y37U|1|They are tiny
B00UF6OFEQ|5|Beautiful solid keychain; a little heavy and kind of big, especially if plan to add keys to it. I use it more as a journal charm.
B00JGG0W0C|5|Just as described,Quality product.Well pleased.Sipping was very prompt.
B005N6Y5AW|3|Really like my hoodie but wish the decal was on back not front.  Keeps me warm, great quality.
B00PGM0V7E|4|Nice and bright! Time will tell, but they seem fine. Inclusion of the resistor would be a good thing.
B008DX7KGS|5|Perfect
B000IET39C|5|Best price among suppliers.<br /><br />Noisy, acceptable amount of powder seen but brakes is functioning well.
B006PPM6CO|4|Looks good and the LED lights should add to my braking visibility to the cars behind me. My only issue, and this has nothing to do with the Bully step, but is when it is plugged into my SUV the blind spot monitoring goes off because it assumes I am towing a car. In hindsight, I would have probably just ordered the regular one without the LED lights and saved $5-6, but again, that is human error on my part, not a problem with the item. I will add that of all of hitch steps on the market, the Bully is by far the most attractive in my opinion.
B004G08K9I|4|works great
B008OIS8JU|5|Easy to install & work well.
B005BU5DCO|5|Gas did not come out of the tank so I would say it works exactly as advertised.  Bought it for 2009 Toyota Highlander that was throwing a P0456 error code for the emission system.  It did not fix that problem but it fits perfectly and my wife even installed it so...wait, don't tell her I said that.
B00407V5B2|5|i would recommend using 3 coats of this product with ample time in between applications. Then, follow that up with 2 coats of the Dupli-Color clear coat for the result in my photos.
B0089XOHYU|5|This just works. It's on all our bags. We'll be ordering more.
B00O4Z5XOA|1|the one sent for my f150 was too small by a foot on width.  why bother with the cut outs for wheelwells ?
B000EDUUJ4|5|great product
B0017T3P28|5|This tool is totally awesome.  I was able to pull 40 landscape T-posts in about 45 minutes.
B004WJPN2A|5|Just the right amount needed for all 4 sides
B00C908EQ6|2|Way to sticky for a curved fog light. So many bubbles and wrinkles even with a heat gun. And even if you get it applied good, it only looks truly JDM Yellow/gold with two layers of the tint
B004APM12G|3|Works quite well - good adaptability to 32nds and mm.
B001G8AIMU|1|This is not really a charger, just a tiny 12 volt power supply with a very unstable voltage delivery.  While it will actually work to charge a battery there is going to be risk of overcharging, and they won't charge anything of decent capacity in a good time frame.  I would purchase these if you need a basic 12 volt power supply, but I would not rely on them for consistent battery charging.
B00CQ8SNL2|4|My kit sank another inch after the first year.
B00H9S71LW|5|Scan tool works perfectly with dash on my phone. Uses low frequency Bluetooth so I can connect to my cars radio too.
B007QBKODO|5|Smooth and strong. With same company's brake pads it works on my Ford Transit very well! I see after half of the year it looks much better than original Ford's ones.
B00AOC9YJW|5|Seller was great. Lights are very bright, and exceeded my expectations!
B00GUKB0XK|5|Perfect factory badge replacement!
B001RBQF4G|1|Absolute crap
B00BTMV4YE|2|very difficult to intall
B00598LYWQ|4|Good product.
B00YLNW86G|4|I do wish I know were this product was manufactured at.  Nothing to tell me on it (that I could see).  Reported as NEW, which I do hope is the case.  Price is great.  Apparently went in easily (mechanic put in) and now have air.  Had put in rebuilt one in previously and only got 7 months before A/C compressor started to leak.  Have 87 4 Runner, so had to retrofit in the past-----------just so you know retrofit does not put out the air conditioning as the old Freon types do.  Not the fault of this product, just the way it is (anyway as I have been told). Although will say this A/C seems to be doing better than my other one. Would have given it a 5, but only have had it in use for about 3 week, and do not know how it will last.
B00BTGSID0|1|Don't buy them. They are not silk lined like they claim they were. So they have the potential to scratch the paint. Spen the few extra dollars and buy the nicer ones by chemical guys
B000WJD7PO|2|The lights do not have directions to at least tell you which wire is which.  I would prefer factory.
B000WJA5ZY|5|Great for yoke mount on a cessna
B00029WYEY|5|Seems to do its purpose. It cleaned my dirty K&N air filter. Not sure I would see any significant change in driving, engine would be happy!
B00K2MYPVG|2|The clock is small as advertised but the ticking will drive you mad, I am able to hear the ticks from across the room. For the price I don't have a right to complain but I know that I will be looking for a replacement very soon.
B00FJDL0J8|5|Tried first on a friend's box truck that had no attention for a few years and instantly renewed finish and brought out the trim color again. Hope it lasts.<br />Easy to apply and good leveling qualities.
B002SIR91A|5|Folds nicely and is surprisingly strong for the price.  It is nearly weightless as well.
B00939KCFC|5|Was easy to install. Meineke was going to charge me 1,100 with parts and labor. My husband replaced this part at home and he is not a mechanic. I would recommend this part to anyone.
B0043BMOMY|1|Not as bright as factory fog lights.  No instructions of any kind sent with product.  It would be very helpful to have wiring instructions for the Halo lights.  I did not install these for the above reasons.  Would like to return.
B00L9J5DSA|5|Easy to install and looks great.
B003AT4RHK|5|does exactly what it says
B00DR1544Q|5|I'm very pleased with my choice to buy this top.
B000LP8F60|5|Quick and easy installation.  I have multiple cars, and this lets me easily transfer my EzPass without any hassle.  I can simply hang this to the mirror of any of my cars.
B001FY0H94|5|Perfect match for my Panamera. Had a little difficulty getting a couple to stay on but with a small tweak they worked fine.
B009D2XASU|4|Perfect for my TW200.
B008V655LO|5|Love this mattress! Soft/firm and easy to unbox! Would order it again.
B004A35K76|5|Easy replacement of original. Installed and working properly. Hopefully i will get 10+ years out of this one that i got out of the original.
B00D19MXLQ|2|wrong item
B00659ED3U|5|Love me some U S Air Force
B003S1RQ2S|5|Does the trick. I don't know much about batteries, but I attached it & it works. Seems right to me.
B000C55Y4A|5|Great price & quick delivery. Part matched perfectly. Thank you
B00EZCL08K|5|fits perfectly. Works fine.installs easily.
B000C2APB0|5|Fit well, good tip included in the package to make sure the big gasket doesn't bunch up. No leaks so far!
B004C0U2SE|5|This is USA made and Excellent quality, 1/3 the price of Autozone. To those claiming China Import either Standard changed their manufacturer or you broke your part installing it and wanted a refund.
B0000BYASB|5|Professionally and well-built, I would recommend and will buy another
B007XE8C74|4|Easy to use and very handy to have for an older car on a road trip. You at least have some idea of what might be causing the darn check engine light to come on. Also useful for clearing the codes when you need to be able to use functions like Vehicle Skid Control which get automatically turned off no matter what the cause of the check engine light.
B0069TQL54|5|just as expected
B000CN9876|4|good product
B00D5O315E|5|This cover is of excellent quality and quite generous in size.  I have a 2014 Audi A4 S-Line series and it fits beautiful and comes with 4 straps to ensure the cover is not blown off during heavy wind.  It also comes with a lock and key which works along with wire cord I guess to keep it from being stolen without having to cut off/damage the cover.  I really love the design which has pockets to accommodate the rear view mirrors. I just put it on today so I can't tell you how much cooler, if any, it makes the car.
B004ZF4MW8|3|Why my Hid look like this.
B002XM3IP2|4|should work
B000F14X48|5|Perfect, looks n fits great!
B00FS82XNQ|4|Works fine.  The mounting hardware needs a little better engineering.  As an example, the pan head screw with the square shoulder that holds the bracket to the bumper is great, but the square shoulder sits just about 0.001&#34; above the thickness of the mounting bracket which means you can't tighten down the bracket without drilling a hole with a diameter larger than the diagonal dimension across that square shoulder.  Nice bright lights, and I will purchase something from Rigid for the front of my vehicle.
B003XWEO8Q|1|I got these grips on Saturday. They are very, very poor quality. The rubber cushions come off as soon as you turn the throttle, and the clutch grip also slides off the handle bar because it doesn't have the insert for the switch box on the handle bar!<br />Spend the money and get the real thing. I will!
B0010ADJIE|5|Excellent item!  Fast delivery and worked great!
B00WOY33EA|5|These things worked perfectly for me and saved me a lot of money in dealership repair!
B002626OLY|2|I have a green leather purse which I have been unable to get clean with any product. This product might be useful if you begin using it when the item is new, but it did not get ride of any marks or stains, watermarks etc.
B000CN9J8Y|5|good stuff
B00D3STVG0|2|It is not made properly. The seams on the side are loose ans stretched out.
B0092P19T0|5|looks really good
B00L9HTM20|5|What I expected for the price.
B0046U4YPM|5|Was a good fit.<br />Works like a charm.<br />Shipped quickly.
B000VKTUE6|5|Purchased these to replace the cabin air filters in my 2007 Honda Element. The Amazon fitment guide stated that these would not fit, but they were an exact fit to the ones I removed. They are working great! The slight mildew smell is now gone. It took about a minute to replace, including removing and replacing the glove box contents. Very happy with saving a few bucks by avoiding the dealership.
B00GRHRTEU|5|Just like a few others have said they wistle when i go over 35mph. But i bought these ao they wouldnt slap back under high speeds. Ive gone 75 with these and they stayed true. Make sure you really tighten to the point of not being able to go any further. Also i eliminated the wistle noise by caulking the outside border (non mirror side). I saw on a jeep thread that because there is a lip in the rubber around the mirror the wind would allow it to wastle. Since then its been gone.
B000CI6Y96|5|Fit perfect. Works great
B004D5SUIC|5|High quality
B009EVP6QO|4|Fits perfectly. Just do not load it with heavy stuff, it might losen with all the bouncing caused by driving because it doesn't have a solid base.
B00A80EVXO|5|Very nice. Once we put the students driver reflectors on our vehicle other driver seem to be more cognized and courteous to our student driver..
B000BUQODG|5|Great product thank you
B005RO7L1A|5|Exactly as advertise.
B0068EQ2PY|4|None.
B009FREAGO|5|This is a stylish looking litter bag for my new car !  It seems to hold a lot.  I place it over the gear shift on the floor instead of the headrest.  Great product !
B0094VGO0G|1|The part arrived on time and installed perfectly. It did however two days later no longer will kill the motor. It will start the motor just fine but is itermitant on shut down
B00X9IH986|4|Arrived much quicker than stated. Fit perfectly and color was as described.
B000BVRZ74|5|Saw a tip on treating shower glass with Rainex to keep soap scum at bey.  Five weeks later it's still working!  No need to wipe down the glass after showering, the water simply flows off.  What a timesaver!!!
B00DJ5KEF4|2|For some reason it would not charge my phone
B000B8N3MS|5|perfect just what i wanted
B000JFHNG0|5|great product
B00UO1PMGW|1|Broke before even installed
B0081ZVBDQ|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B006N9392I|5|Excellent.
B000S2SRXC|5|cheaper than anybody
B000RUCTSO|3|It is bright the light is white but it wont stand up in a fight. In all seriousness now it is a very bright light for 55W not my first choice for a truck tho thats lifted the beam pattern is best suited for cars jeeps and maybe stock height pickups. I changed the bulb to a 55W plasma yellow from PIAA and it makes good work of fog. Also sadly its all made of plastic and the light enclosure seeps it could pop off if hit with a rock or a large bug.
B00BU7DRLQ|5|Nice hard hat stickers will buy more
B005GL89X8|4|The cover is made from a form of plastic with a furry inside. It does not deal around the car much to the seal much to the dead lizards dismay because though he was not trapped he was cooked. It's awkward to put this on with one person but doable with the string tied off to a broom handle. The cover does not stay on with just the single cross vehicle strap. I ended up rigging a bumper to bumper strap as well and found that created a sturdy cover. This is a brilliant object for someone who has more than one car (and a preference to which they drive) since once the car is washed and covered it stays that way til you remove the cover. Shipped quickly. The bag for storage is nice.
B0018BKIUM|4|Good product
B0027EUPFC|3|They kill you on the price of this thing, but when you need it, you need it.  It is a like-for-like replacement.
B00YMDXVF2|4|Impossible to find oe. These aftermarket lights worked fine. Not a perfect fit . Wiring connector plugs into factory receptacle but not as good as original equipment.  Shipped to me in one week
B007LIBJPO|1|It smells horrible.
B006MX7ZB6|1|The sizes are not good at all. Some parts fits the others are very big
B00KY0DOAO|5|The package came quick and performed<br />As expected.
B00JYASND8|5|These lights are solidly built, easy to install, very bright and perfect for the front of our 1998 Jeep Wrangler. My son and I like them very much, and we would recommend them to others... these might actually be usable on teh street too, not just for off-road.<br /><br />Since the Jeep had an existing set of driving/fog lights already installed on the front, there was already a wiring harness in place for us to use. We have tested several replacements for the old lights, and this pair is now at the top of our favorite list. These have a tighter 30 degree spot beam, which lets us direct where they go (better than flood-style lights), and the bracket has 150 degree adjustment.<br /><br />Installation was not a difficult job:<br /><br />* Took off the existing lights and put these in their place<br />* Connected the light wiring to the harness leads already in place<br />* Tested the lights to make sure all connections and the switch operated as expected<br />* Used good quality electrical tape to seal up the wiring connections<br />* Zip-tied the lights wiring in place where needed to keep things from flapping around<br />* Hit the road<br />* Returned and adjusted direction and elevation<br />* Hit the road to test again<br /><br />All told, this took about 45 minutes.<br /><br />These light seem to be very high quality, and once mounted they are rock solid. Each light contains two rows of three 3W LEDs, for a total of 18W (2140 lumens +/-) of 30 degree spotlight power. Each unit weighs in at bout 1 pound 4 ounces per our postal scale, and are 3.25 inches wide, 3.2 inches deep (front to back), and about 3 inches tall excluding the base post height.<br /><br />One important question is -- are these water tight? Sure are; they are IP68 rated which means that the lights are dust tight and water proof to 3 to 10 feet underwater for a continuous period of time... not that we really want to submerse the Jeep -- but if we do, these lights will keep on going.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quality set of light of this size, construction, brightness and style, for use as I have described above, then my son and I would highly recommend giving this Nilight set a try based on our experience with it. Another fun father & son project.<br /><br />Very recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience.you are looking for a quality set of light of this size, construction, brightness and style, for use as I have described above, then my son and I would highly recommend giving this Nilight set a try based on our experience with it.

B005DUUT9Y|5|good product for the money
B00BMULWN6|5|Very economical replacement. Works great
B000CQRJK6|5|Quiet braking, firm braking; just what 300 HP begs for.
B000C9MWOG|5|Perfect, just passed Ohio e-check, told me they me they had to keep old cap for the state and gave me new one, after a couple of miles check eng. lite came on steady for 1st. time since I bought car one month earlier &#34;White 2007 Saturn Vue w/ metal not plastic flapper make sure you check your specific vehicle,  From day one after disconnecting battery cable never had check engine come on again, before AutoZone told me code was an area of cap.  At 1st. cap touches my plastic &#34;white&#34; body but after a few times it moves freely:)
B00F9LQ3RO|5|Super
B00HS0GFU4|1|I bougth a set like 3 months ago and now they are gone. Wouldnt buy them again. The ride was cool till they last. Go for other brand or pay a lil more for more quality
B008Y7JCK0|5|the transmitter arrived on time and it took no time to get programmed.  It works great and am very happy with it. Thanks MOPAR!
B00KV8MIUG|4|Very good
B0002STS4Y|5|As described. Worked fine for my application.
B0002STSQM|1|Inaccurate - don't use it.
B00A2EQWOC|5|Very nice
B0068N79YI|3|Cheap fix , im sure the plastic will break in a few years again
B00X27XPPK|5|I like the bluish tint
B00199P5X8|5|Work nice. Felt great after I put them on
B00KTHUQM6|4|Works out great
B00N52TZZG|5|love it
B00B5M02GO|5|Works great with my car. Haven't had a problem yet with the product.
B008KZDDGA|1|This does not work on a 08 335i.  White board.
B004YEIV0Y|5|very high quality
B003KKD9UA|3|Please be certain you understand this is for ONE valve guide.  Interesting that the picture shows 8.
B000CF8VUE|5|Excellent product for the low price
B00T5G53ZM|3|Its ok but doesn't work with my 2000 Sarurn of which is my main vehicle.  However it does work with my F100 Ford Pick up.  Takes a while to hook up to the blue tooth on my phone though
B002PL5818|5|Work great, no squeals!
B00AJW7RKU|5|ok
B00LAJTEFW|5|I have an F250 and one of its rubber valve stems just blew out while it was in a parking lot in temperatures near 100°. Thank God it didn't happen while out on the hwy. I found these metal stems on AMZN, bought them and installed them recently. The price was great and now I'm at peace in knowing that when driving with a heavy load, these stems will not be blowing out. Thanks! ~wtsa2.com
B0027D5HOM|5|new filter
B000CO8RAY|5|As advertised.
B009UQEDNA|4|It fit up pretty nicely on my 2001 4.0L XJ.  Decent sound, not too loud but a little more of a rumble than stock.  Since I have a 3&#34; lift, home made fuel tank skid plate, and extended shackles on the back, I had to come up with my own rear hanger but that was expected.  The hardware was not fully threaded and so it did not clamp up. I had to go get some 3/8&#34; x 1&#34; long fully threaded stainless bolts and some flat washers to make up the difference with the huge hole.  The bolts were the reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5... galvanized grade 5 bolts that didn't fit.
B001THV9D0|5|Wax works great. Brake dust practically falls off now, virtually no scrubbing required to get the wheels looking fresh!
B001N729FS|5|junk
B00YZ56RJE|5|We received our RJ Lock August 15th. The fit and finish is impressive. We tow a bass boat and when it's on the trailer and unattended<br />the added security will be good to have.
B00BDVMJGS|5|The housing fit perfectly and snapped into place covering my cap and wires ends, held down the plastic housing covering the rest of the wires, and looks good. Priced almost as low as a junkyard or eBay replacement.
B003WF64GO|4|VERY NICE PLATE, LOOKS GREAT ON THE CAR.  ONLY 4 STARS AS THE VENDOR BC NOVELTIES SENT IT IN A REGULAR ENVELOPE AND SENT BY U.S. MAIL.  THE PLATE WAS ALL BENT UP AND BC NOVELTIES SAID I HAD TO SEND IT BACK TO THEM AT MY COST.  THE PLATE WAS ONLY $6.99.
B00CPYC9BC|5|Worked out very well for me.  I can now hook the gas grill to my RV and don't have to carry the little propane cans around.
B004U7N7YA|5|It works fine the grommet was a SOB to get into the fuel tank. A little work and no leaks
B003978QIE|5|Bought as gift...was told it works well.
B00X04JRMU|5|I use this on our Motorhome. It makes clean up a breeze and in half the time it would take me with the hose a bucket plus it leaves a nice shinny gloss.
B00DMS648E|1|This product said it would fit and work in my 2011 F-250, but it did not.
B00GJD1UVK|3|Nice foaming glass cleaner although it emits a rather unpleasant odor. Nonetheless, as is the case with most &#34;GUNK&#34; products, it's good for removing patchy crud and heavy build-up providing you let it penetrate for a couple of minutes before wiping. Initial results are favorable although a detectable haze seemed to form within a week or two after application thus revealing residual streaking. A couple of applications may be required, even on only moderately dirty glass.
B00MPXYCP4|5|Excellent item just as described fits perfect high quality made in USA
B00F0QAPBI|5|Fits and looks awesome on my 2013 Kia Optima.  Very happy with looks and product.
B00EEGUVQ4|5|Great
B009IK9P18|1|I used it for two week. The right side mirror disappearing during I drove back home. I have trouble to take it out now.
B001FIDNGO|4|Worked great
B001IZKDZS|4|This does seem a bit large for the intended purpose but seems to work well.  I like the side straps and the ability to tailor them to your needs (stretchy straps with flexible metal hooks).  This seems well made if a little flimsy as others have commented.  I can see how it can rip easily but I just took my time to put it on and had no issues.  I'll update after it has spent a few weeks in a NW soggy winter.
B002G3PHSE|5|perfect fit, easy to install, price much cheaper than autoparts store or dealer.
B001DRHN54|5|Fit my 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee perfectly. Good to get the old one off as part of a basic tune up.
B009OBVRY4|5|After buying a new black car, I came to understand what everyone meant when they warned that black paint shows everything. It seems that every time I look at the car, I see new swirl marks and scuffs.<br /><br />After year of considering  purchasing  this tool ,  and manually waxing the car, I decided to give it a try. I thought the tool was simply going to spin, similar to the headlight restore kit by 3m. I couldn't have underestimated how good this tool really was. The applicator pad is on an orbital head, and it applies the wax evenly and consistently, which gets the most out of the buffing/polishing/waxing process.<br /><br />Not only will this tool save you time, it will give you much better results then doing it manually.<br /><br />I would recommend buying their clay bar kit, and the wax applicator kit that is intended for this tool. Be sure to have plenty of micro-fiber towels (find ones that don't rough rough border stitching, I found some at Walmart for under $15).<br /><br />First wash, then use the clay bar (which removes any remaining dirt and leaves the car extremely smooth), then polish, then wax.<br /><br />Take before and after pictures, because you will not be able to explain to others how well this process works... it'll be the best $100 you spent on your car.
B000EQPBH2|5|Fit the AC Delco 219-351 valve (also purchased on Amazon) perfectly.
B0079XC0Y0|2|The massage is actually vibration not massage. Some times I want only the heater but can't turn the annoying vibrations off.
B012JHUQ50|5|Perfect fit!!!
B00KRAR4HA|5|Put it on my motorcycle to keep the iPhone/gps charged
B00KOU2UYU|5|Fantastic! Looks great ad very cheap ! got my order within two days!
B00D3YEGO6|4|Presentation is everything. Packaging was really nice and it also came very quick.<br />I received it but will put it on later today. It's not plastic and doesn't like it will fall apart.
B00T62RK1U|5|i will put in my truck is just what i spected thanks
B006FJEYN4|4|perfect fit
B000BZEHW6|5|Youtube and plug and play.
B0013JBRT0|5|I've used these on 4 different vehicles and it is by far my favorite accessory; even my Dad has started using them on his truck. They last typically a year or so, I've had 1 bulb in for over 2 years and it's still going strong. Just for that, I would recommend buying 2 packs at a time to be prepared.
B00130HLCG|5|Genuine Ford part. Works as it should.
B005SVXQS4|1|Does not work as advertised
B005OL7K4E|2|Specifically purchased this one for my red and black vehicle, colors quickly faded (in 3 months)
B0001XPC7C|3|too small for our coins...otherwise, it is good
B007HRUX1A|5|Works perfectly for our Motorhome
B0002KL3QS|5|Worked like a charm on an aluminum head.
B000HDH47W|5|It is as good as the Honda one at much less $$.
B00G620ZVU|4|These lights look good and are super bright, just what I wanted for my 1992 Jeep Cherokee Laredo. I had no issues wiring these up with the wiring harness I also got from Amazon. Haven't really had the chance to test these while driving yet, but they light up my driveway and yard really well in the dark, I have no qualms (yet) with performance on rural roads, which is why I got them.<br /><br />One concern, though, as you'll find in most of the 1-star reviews here on Amazon. Many people are complaining that water got into the light housing. Living in the Pacific Northwest, this is unacceptable as it rains 7 months a year here, so these have to keep the water out.<br /><br />I don't know how well you can see it in the really close-up picture on my review, but the screws on the front face of these lights were a little too long, and actually push the plastic lens back from the face of the housing. This left four significant gaps where water could get in.<br /><br />To be on the safe side, I put a thick border of silicone all the way around the front face where the metal housing meets the plastic light cover, and also filled in the hole where the wires come out the bottom. I believe that this will keep the water out, but I'm not 100% sure. I'm going to keep a close eye on things as I drive in the rain and will update my review later when I have more information.<br /><br />Overall, if sealing with silicone keeps water out, I think I'll be very happy with these lights for many years.
B0009H51WQ|5|Good
B00LE61UBC|4|TREY GOO
B0054S5OOU|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B000BQUEWC|4|it has enough cubby holes so items don't fall out.
B00HNF1F4K|5|Great. Timely arrival. Product intact.
B0091Q3NCG|5|I have used this a couple of times to diagnose my 2011 Nissan Maxima and let me tell you, this little gadget sure did come in handy! It was easy to use, easy to read, and easy to follow the instructions. I am definitely happy I purchased this because auto shops sometimes charge to the pull an error code so to alleviate that nonsense, I just purchased one of my own at a fairly decent price too! Get one, it is very convenient to have on hand, trust me!
B0029XM950|2|thin and flimsy
B007KPUATE|1|Terrible.  Set screw was stripped out of the package.  Recieved a replacement with the same problem.  Had to rethread and fix myself.  Junk.
B00PLCS2QG|5|These are actually better than OEM, colors are great, and the shape is perfect. I even replaced the OEM ones that were still attached with these.
B000BNXQIY|5|They are of good quality and look spectacular on the Jeep.  Also, a most useful addition since I'm too short to enter the vehicle without the Running (Step) Boards.
B000XQO11U|5|Unit performed as expected. Good quality. Fast Shipping.
B004D83JTO|2|The foam inside the glasses irritate my skin. I wish it could be removed but its glued on.
B006IWTJK6|4|Good product
B00B4XBQPU|5|Well made and large enough to cover the edges of the plate fully.
B00MI3V7YA|4|BEWARE - does not include anything to attach the waning to your car/roof rack. I have a frontrunner rack on my FJ80 and made some brackets out of metal. NO guidelines included either. Apart from that, ARB is the bomb.
B00192MU2Y|5|Well made and easy to install.  I bought another to update my Motorhome power cord end
B003VCBDG4|1|I should have paid a little closer attention the location of the drain plug.  This thing sticks out so far, that I actually put my stock plug back in.  If you never take your truck off road, then you will be fine.  I was just worried about ripping this plug off driving around my property.
B009S7I96I|5|Nice skylight
B004K8LUIO|5|Just what I expected. Work well.  UPDATE 9/1/15:   Each piece has a small metal clip at each end that fits over the door edge.  After only a few weeks I just noticed two are already gone.  Don't know how well the adhesive is going to hold up.
B003VATF2U|5|these are very nice, much better than the ones I could have purchased in the store.  Purchased them for our Motorhome.
B000XECJES|5|Love these cloths. They work great on my collector cars.
B00DN6MM86|5|Matched perfectly to my 2015 RAV4
B005BWIAOA|5|great no issues with it
B00LMRFJGK|5|This sticker is MUCH larger than expected, but still nice and very funny!
B00KEA2BPI|5|Love it.  Wish I ordered more.
B0015DQ81G|2|Probe is too large to get a good tread depth reading.
B008025186|4|Probably best used if you have a decenwellt wax base on the car to use for touch ups or maintenance between heavy detailing. Product worked well, it went on easy, dried to a lite haze and wiped off very easily.
B00JZQXJ3K|5|So I bought a new JK this week and the only thing it was missing was a receiver hitch. The dealership wanted $457 to install one and it would be at least a week until it was on there. I decided to buy one off Amazon instead and couldn't be more pleased with the product and purchase. Ordered on Friday, delivered Sunday morning, on the Jeep by lunch time EZPZ.<br /><br />First off I want to thank some of the other reviewers for their installation tips. It really gave me a heads up on what to expect and eliminated almost all of the potential frustration of the install. I'm going to give a quick wrap up to help any who come after me.<br /><br />Installed on a 2015 JK two door sport with very basic hand tools by a guy who hires out 95% of the tools related stuff that needs doing around the house and cars. I used needle nose pliers, crescent wrench, broken ratchet with 3/4&#34; regular socket, regular phillips screwdriver and long common screwdriver (as a pry bar). Oh, and don't forget a flashlight if your eyes are getting old.<br /><br />1. Make sure the vehicle and particularly the muffler are cooled down. You will be very close to the muffler during the entire hitch installation. You do not need to loosen the muffler to install so don't worry with that unless you happen to have a lift at your disposal and a rolling tool case nearby and charge mechanics labor by the hour. The instructions say to remove the tow hook but I really don't know why? I left mine on because I'm sure I will use it sooner or later.<br /><br />2. Lie on your back underneath the mounting point and line up one of the end holes with the hitch in one hand (don't worry about lining up the other holes yet). With your other hand angle a mounting bolt with washer head side towards the bottom of the jeep and slide over the top of the muffler a bit. The bolt will start into the hole at an angle but once started you will be past the muffler and can push all the way through the frame and other side of the hitch. Repeat on the other end hole. Now the middle holes are lined up so repeat with those two.<br /><br />3. Break out your pry bar and pry the bumper cover away from the frame so you have some room to work on the nut side. It is tight and can be frustrating if you don't know what to expect. You can get an extra inch or more of room which is enough with somewhat steady hands. Grab a washer on one end with needle nose pliers and place over the end of the bolt. Now grab a bolt with regular pliers and place over the end of the bolt and finger tighten the head just to get it started. Repeat with the other bolts.<br /><br />4. Tighten to proper torque. Your receiver is now installed.<br /><br />5. Regular phillips screwdriver to remove 4 screws on drivers side tail light. Pull apart harness from vehicle to light. Plug in trailer harness to each end (you can't mess this up they only go one way). There's an opening inside the light well/corner of the jeep to push the trailer harness end through so push it through.<br /><br />6. Get back under the Jeep, thread the harness over the frame and push the end into the mounting bracket on the hitch. Find the holes on the inside of the frame to press the mounting clips to and do that (gee. it's like it was made for it). Put the tail light back on the Jeep if you haven't already and your lights are now good to go.<br /><br />7. Go play with your toys.
B0057GU30Y|5|perfect match for my Denali. great for scrapes or small chips
B007Y5LVYS|5|Worked well.  Fixed the vibration I had in the front end.  Thought the vibration was the motor mounts which I replaced twice.  Once I put these in the problem went away.
B00JRLRQEQ|5|arrived on time and as promised
B0002LWFNM|5|It actually fits & works properly
B000UK1054|5|other batteries didn't fit in the holder properly
B005JPJNO0|5|Best pads you can buy
B004ZG8D3Q|5|These replaced an older,worn out  pair. Love them!
B0087PZWE4|5|Part was exactly as described and works great.
B001DRHMMS|5|Great
B006GS3Q7E|5|Great
B00AC6WGN6|5|Love it
B000PC4BBC|1|JUNK went against my machine shops advice n he was right. Brand new motor sounded like a rod rap plus sounded like a empty power steering pump. Spend the xtra money buy a Pete Jackson
B00O9TOA6I|5|Blind spot no more
B00QVTP5YK|5|Purchased a used 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport and wanted a &#34;backup&#34; key. This key has the &#34;chip&#34; in it that you can program using 2 of the original key fobs. You HAVE TO have two key fobs to get this to program. I had the key cut at an Ace hardware where I work and then tested to make sure it would work in both unlocking the door and turning the ignition (it will make they key rotate in the ignition but until you get it programmed to the car, it will not actually start the car). It did both of those things so I went through the enclosed instructions to program it. It's a pretty simple process of inserting one of the original keys into the ignition and then inserting another original key (or one that the dealer has made for you) and then inserting this key, waiting a couple seconds and then WALA!!! It worked.
B00WDSVEE8|5|very good and convenient to me
B00L4G91V8|4|Just what I wanted and a very good price half what I would have payed at the ac store.
B00R52M1DA|4|Good heavy gauge wire for SUV jumps
B0089HZOA2|3|Not bad, plates are quality in construction except for the VW emblem and Turbo are a sticker which is pretty lame for the price.  Still, not bad.
B00WAZYRK2|4|No instructions included in the parts on how to install them or at least have a utube channel on how to complete the process.
B002OQM1ZA|4|Not noticeably better than any standard H7 headlight, but it fit perfectly fine and have lasted for months so far
B00LPXLRV2|5|]For 2004 Volvo 2.4i , I personally believe it adds a few horsepower and torque. sounds good!
B00E4CQH9S|5|A+++++++++++
B008PEVN4K|5|Looks awesome!
B00DX893UE|5|I'm on my second year with this battery.  I had expected that it would discharge over winter. I'm happy to say that I only started the engine once over winter, and the battery had plenty to startup the engine that was at near freezing temperature.<br /><br />If I was to give this any cons would be watch the top off voltage.  being a Li battery the voltage seem to run a little high cruising down the road. The GPS I had on the bile didn't like the voltage, so I switched to a different manufacture GPS. Problem solved.
B009YKQR2C|1|2 burned out, 1 is working good and another has 2 LED's burned out. Do not buy.
B000XY31LS|5|Great product. Straps are strong. Built in soft ties are awesome. The secured latch hooks are an excellent idea that all motorcycle / atv tie downs should have.
B00NO4JH9Y|5|Got what was promised and was thrilled.  Having extra product for service around for trips and local is a blessing.  Can't beat the price and the product seems terrific.  Used 1 oil and the air filter immediately.  Very happy.
B007Q8NWHW|5|This is a great helmet for trips around town and summer riding. The sizing is true and I like the style as well. The visor stays where you place it and deflects a good amount of wind when down. The chin strap doesn't have a quick release but is easy to adjust. I prefer wearing this helmet to my full face helmet because of the increased field of view but I would probably choose my full face helmet for highway trips because of the higher speeds. The helmet was comfortable out of the box and seems to be of good quality.
B001G7ZB46|5|Worked perfectly............ yay have my air conditioning again....
B00O0B7E3Q|5|sold my car, otherwise, it was perfect!
B004AHQ558|4|Works well on my Lincoln MKZ 2010.
B004GQO6RC|5|Very good.
B00KTHYAUU|4|UPDATED REVIEW The programming instructions provided did not work.  Searching, I found similar instructions and the two fobs I purchased linked up on the first try.  I will say one of the fobs I keep in my pocket has now cracked (less than a year) but the device still works and is a great deal for the price.  Not good so far but going to try again with some other instructions.  I purchased two remotes for a 2005 Scion XB.  The instructions provided claim they will wipe out the old remotes and add the new ones.  So far, the two new remotes unlock the car and set off the panic alarm but do not lock the vehicle.  Thankfully the old remote didn't get wiped out in the process (even though I did it three times.) Unfortunately even though I followed the instructions carefully and the code on the back of my old remote matches, these don't seem to be working.  I looked it up and there are two other programming methods so I'll try those and update this review if it works.
B000C541EO|5|Grate OEM fit plus still Made in the USA.
B00065JM8U|5|Good product.
B004R388JG|5|Perfect two bike carrier. However, just like other reviewers have mentioned, the carrier has a tendency to swing a bit. I think the aperture were the bolt goes through has been drilled a bit too large in the factory and thus gives the impression of being loose.
B002SA0S3E|5|Just what was needed, used in a boat fuel tank
B00AGWD7VG|5|I have tried just about everything in my tool box and this works. All the different shapes and sizes fit and at last I have a neat pliers drawer. I filled the first one immediately and bought a second. Great product...
B00GJ1D7JU|5|Thanks works great had no problem with shipment an no delays
B005JCPZVS|5|Nice and strong. However, they are harder to stretch than a bungee cord.
B007T6QSTU|5|it is working super
B007P2F786|5|Exactly as described and fits our Polaris Razor perfectly
B007ZY5GYO|5|Awesome boots. Could wear them all day if I needed to
B000E28EG6|5|good
B000GU3KHO|4|Except for a feral cat putting two tears in it, it has kept the rain off my ride. The black has already faded considerably. Florida is hard on everything. And why is cats feel they have to climb on everything?<br /><br />As to size. It's a real tight fit for my Moto Guzzi Norge and barely covers the luggage bags in the rear.
B00OHZ20X4|5|I'm extremely satisfied with this floor protection mat.  I'm what might be called a &#34;critical application&#34; user in that the architect that designed our house in the 1980's put the two garage bays overtop of bedrooms & baths located one level down.  Yes, that was a bad idea but there were legitimate reasons due to the steepness of the site.  To make matters worse, we live in an area with 40 inches of precipitation a year in the form of rain, sleet, and snow.  I've had other floor protection systems, but this one is the best by far.  It's parked on every day of the year by my wife's full-size SUV, and although I try to keep it fairly clean, my maintenance isn't perfect and it does sometimes have gritty stuff or even small gravel particles on it.  Because I can't really afford to have a system failure, I replace the mats about every 3 years.  I've never had a leak, the edges have stayed perfect, and it's normally non-slick unless a bit of ice forms on the surface.  Keep up the good quality.  You have a good product.
B0027QWNDM|3|I doesn't fit the old fat car manuals but was able to put all my car receipts in it.
B00MB867TM|5|My don't move pass half way now. The cooling fan solve the problem. Thanks a lot!
B0056BOGKS|5|Easy to install and has survive a couple of scrapes on the pavement.
B00W8JJNWM|5|It is wicked Cool! :-)
B00JGE2PUE|5|just what I was looking for!!
B00NUJ3K8W|5|Worked as described and expected.  I would certainly recommend to anyone I know.
B00480J4J6|5|DIY replacement with these bulbs is not difficult, and will save you a ton of money compared to what your dealer will charge.  This is the exact bulb that the dealer will use.
B002092DWC|5|This is the perfect tool for the job. I haven't had any problem with it.
B001GH5ORK|4|Super simple installation. Only complaint is that the screws appear to be painted and not powder coated. Be sure you use the right size of screwdriver to avoid stripping the head.
B00HSTRYMS|5|Great sticker printed and packaged well
B001OBITQ6|5|They seem to be as good as the ones from Isuzu, so I am happy.
B00ZGGORFM|5|Its works really good
B004JHBKLS|5|An inexpensive air filter.
B00EANHCNQ|5|So far so good
B00KHUQ9NK|1|awful quality
B002QEFQJI|5|Speedy delivery and the product works great!! Thank you!
B000ALG86E|2|Does not Fit vehicle that was listed on the box.  It's about 12&#34; too short length wise.  Review is for the #3.  Vehicle is Nissan GT-R.  This cover is only good for indoor use.  For the Price you cant beat it.
B00VB2OE9O|1|The cover was supposed to fix my 2015 kia optima well it was too short and the wind would remove it off the car. Very unsatisfied. .
B00U1U669I|5|Quality sticker!!!
B005BT288W|4|only if it had gaskets would have been nice other than that it worked
B005KOZ25Y|4|So far it works as needed.  It cleared my codes and I was able to go to local Auto store to get the correct part based on the code it read.  I have noticed the screen is a little hard to read at time due to the contrast not as bright as when I first purchased it but it is still readable.  That is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.
B00J1COI92|5|Love the fit on my 2015 kia optima. I do recommend for someone planning to make there car interior design better.
B00G3JI0UY|4|Loses a star because ONE of my nuts didn't fit well, so that side is loose. It is really bright and works well.
B000COTP9Q|4|works great
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product. It is making this hot summer a bit more convenient
B000JK6INE|5|Best wax period
B00062YAZ8|5|They did the trick my engine was building internal pressure and blowing oil past the seals
B000CSIP5W|5|Less than 1/2 price from that of my local equipment dealer. Wix is one of the best filters out there.
B000WJX5I8|5|This peddle made a perfect adjustment on my 2005 Roadking.  I removed my floor board and the first section of exhaust heat shield which gave me enough room to do the install with no problems.  I wish I would have done this many years ago. Oh, if you plan on reusing your original rubber peddle cover spray some wd40 in there and it works loose pretty easy.
B000BUTD9I|4|Light weight but tuff. Easy to fold and un-fold for use.
B000CIQ47S|5|Great plug, worth the cost.
B005IIR7EG|5|It fits perfectly on my 650KLR.
B00IJB51WY|5|I used it three times to start a big bulldozer, it works real well
B00JW1WYR0|5|Perfect replacement for the one on my 05 ford f150
B00CVVUQ50|1|Not Happy at all 1fell off within two day and couldn't find it! So needless to say they all had to come off! It was a waste of money! Very disappointed !
B00HQN2318|1|These are crap, it's cheap for a reason
B002BEI0JQ|5|I had an original California Jelly Blade for 5 years that recently broke on me. I couldn't find one of these on Amazon so I started to look for another one that would be similar. I found this one and it works great! I'm happy with it cause it's flexible and easy to handle.
B001AXGT7O|5|Excellent quality transom mount. Once put together & installed, this thing is heavy duty. Highly recommend over other brands at local stores which were no where near this solid & were more expensive.
B000C9GK12|5|original part great deal
B002XLHUQG|5|These things aren't particularly cheap, but they work very well, and can be installed and removed quite easily.  They look like they will last for many years if properly cared for.  Very useful addition to your travel trailer accessories.
B001HC48D0|5|Absolutely perfect. Not hard to install. I have a 2014 Ram 1500 express. And with taking my time was about a hour 30.
B000C9WKI4|5|Thanks
B00JA80PEO|4|so, my wife saw this on my amazon wishlist and bought it for me, there aren't enough stars to rate my wife.  as for the headset, I couldn't get my android phone to pair with it until after I restarted the phone, my ipad and wife's iphone saw it instantly.  knockd two stars for this.  fits inside my hjc helmet good, seems loud sitting in my living room, and bonus, I wasn't aware of the fm tuning functions and that is a big bonus I prefer a couple local radio stations for road closures etc. added a star back for this.  tomorrow I'll crank it out on my buell ulysses xb12xt, 1200 cc engine, moderately loud exhaust and we'll see what happens.
B000XQ9MGE|5|Great ! EZ to carry around.
B004FOWE5Q|1|Didn't fit my 87
B009RSU18C|5|America
B00YZXZOLI|5|I love it so much!
B00L4V9ECY|5|Invaluable picture on how to connect, thank you for caring/thinking.
B00QW3KIHO|5|Appears to be solid. Have only had it in for 3 days, but so far, so good. Install was about an hour job. If your handy, you can do it.
B00GKB761E|5|Not and easy job, but I have done several of these.  Check out YouTube for tutorials.
B0002KKIJQ|5|I bought this after doing some research and decided this would do a better job on my Polaris Ranger Crew tires with aluminum wheels.  I am glad I had this in my tires!  On a recent trip were were many miles from anyone or anywhere when I hear a loud hissing coming from my drivers rear tire.  I hopped out and saw that something that poked an almost 1/4&#34; hole in my tire.  It as obviously to large for the sealant to close it off on it's own but I grabbed a twig on the side of the road, broke it off to about a 1&#34; length and stuffed it into the hole.  The sealant immediately sealed around this and I was able to make it all the way back to my trailer and the tire still has full pressure in it as I type this review.
B00TEP5462|5|very good handles, just as described!!!!
B004R2ZT8U|4|I really like this bike rack for my use.  Because it loads on the wheels, the bikes always ride level.  It may not work well on small kids bikes.  It is very easy to assemble and dis-assemble.  I never leave it on the hitch when I reach my destination for fear that it could get stolen.  In less than 1 minute I can tear it down and store in the vehicle locked up.  It needs very little space to store.  The only down side is that the hold down straps don't last.  They will tear out the side of the oblong holes.  I don't know why the holes are oblong.  At over $5 a strap plus shipping, I am considering to use another manufactures straps, or just go with Velcro tiedowns.
B005N53C9I|1|Seat covers won't stay on
B0002RNSG4|5|Easy install, glad I did it this way instead of the other kind I saw where you take both headlights off. This one goes in the side panel at the back.
B00C305898|1|Unfortunately, these are not as described.  They do not fit a 2003 Harley Dyna or ANY Harley with 2 cable ends for the throttle.  They are also reverse mirror cut, so the control buttons will not fit the cut outs correctly.  There is only one hole for a single throttle cable lead and the clutch side switch housing also does not fit correctly.  I am attaching some pics.  If your throttle has 2 cable leads  (like the pic of my 2003 Dyna throttle) these will not work on your bike.  Ride safe...
B000COB8KK|5|Worked great!
B00DNJPYO2|5|I bought this to replace the one that came with my new scooter. After spending over $1000 on something, the last thing you want is for the elements to mess it up because of a cheap, paper thin cover. This cover definitely does the job. It's comfortingly thick, with a soft lining inside to protect my scooter from scratches. It's thick enough to keep the sun off, as well as the rain. We've had quite a few storms lately, and since I don't have a garage I want to keep it dry and protected. This is just what I needed and does exactly what it should. Would definitely buy again.
B008YFTB4E|5|Work really good and are really bright and also really easy to install
B004I0JTAK|5|Awesome
B00075XCCG|2|is to close to the muffler an it makes a lot of noise on the road i try to move the hitch to the side to leave more room on the muffler side but it didn't work
B004Z8H98Y|5|Loce these stickers. Put it on my  front door.
B002801LEE|2|these did not fit my OEM alloy wheels on my BMW 740il. sent them back.
B007N6PPQS|1|I should have believed rvdan's review - the positive charge causes a subtle, but noticeable and really annoying pull to the right - very disappointing engineering fail from a company whose products I generally respect.  I'm not willing to wait it out with the hope the pressure will equalize - if they'd just design it correctly from the beginning it wouldn't be necessary to wait for it to work.  Will be replacing with Rancho and returning the Bilstein.
B007ED9JFS|5|Fit well<br /><br />It is very good looking love it!
B00KLSZ632|5|These things are awesome. They work perfectly with no flaws
B00DUDNLOQ|5|Beautifully crafted, beautiful packaging: simply love it and it came early, added plus  :)
B001AXYSOU|5|Have it on my car bumper. Get lots  of laughs
B00HNYPB96|5|Does exactly what it is supposed to do.
B011DF61YY|3|Hard to adjust, not fast at all....got arb stem puller to replace...
B00C3N9ZF8|2|Looks nice but is typical cheap made China stuff. The lid barely screws on and off.
B00THJZGJA|5|perfect for my 68 le mans since I'm giving it the goat option
B00C3Z9QD2|1|Product doesn't work like it says and about half of what I ordered had a broken seal and was dried up.
B0010GK3SM|5|Very happy with easy install and performance.
B00P3SLJOK|5|The Smart Tote 2 XL is a great improvement over the original design. The old tote would never drain fully no matter how hard you tried, so it could never be flushed clean. The new drain design allows all of the waste to be emptied & the new large flush opening makes it easy to use a hose to clean out. Took this camping the day after receiving it and it was soooo much easier to drain and with the rigid hose & 90° elbow it's less likely to splash on you. Very pleased with the upgrades. 5 stars
B000COBLKW|5|very bright lights
B005TOLSBC|1|The case did not fit my remote. The battery for mine is in the back of the case. This  one was not
B00CFL9058|5|Bought this for my 4-year old son who kept complaining that the seat belt was rubbing on his neck. He loves it and blue is his favorite color. It's not bulky, just a cover. Exactly what I was looking for.
B000JZN0SU|2|Not great at all. Purchased this because other great review, it doesn't clean the glass well at all. Blades starts to deteriorate  after few months use.
B00O9APDNG|5|Looks really nice on the front of my Honda Civic!!
B00DSCZ0U2|5|I bought these trunk supports for my 2004 Mercedes SLK.  The packaging was really not much &#34;packaging&#34; at all.  But hey, we're not buying things for the packaging...right?  The installation was extremely easy, especially after watching the instructional video on YouTube.  I am so glad that I went with my instincts to change my trunk supports myself instead of paying the shop to do it.  SAVE ME LOTS OF $$$!  THANK YOU!!!
B0018YE9FE|1|Once again, put my make of car in and said these would fit my car, NOT!! Do not trust this site for car parts.
B00G620ZVU|4|Lights were great. Brackets not so much.
B00A92BJP4|1|IT IS NOT KABOTA ORANGE. VERY DISSAPOINTED.
B000GQA7L0|3|is not compatible with any other tops or the net top for the back. it is my least used top.
B001GPUYZY|5|Really nice, I&#34;m not sure how well it will hold up to desert driving so I'm going to find a clear cover for it.
B00HRBUITS|4|This seat is comfortable but it is not any lower than a stock seat . One of the rubber mount pads was torn loose . It was very noticible as I unpacked it and should have been replaced before it was shipped . I started to return the seat after finding it to be as tall or taller than the stock seat but a friend encouraged me to put some miles on it . As stated it is more comfortable than stock . I stated to the manufactor that I would keep it if they would send a replacement rubber pad which they have not done . Quite a bit of money not to be lowered as what prompted me to buy.<br />Larry<br />2013 FJR
B006M9VIRM|5|Easy to install and adjustable. The only downfall is you have to slide your hitch through the mount before installing.  Small price to pay to not have mudflaps permanently attached to your truck.
B00B3P0V78|1|it was cute and my mother loved it when i got it for her, but the sticker ripped as soon as she took it off of the paper. it's pretty cheap and has poor quality...
B00EKTIQO4|5|I love them it made the car look even sharper and very easy to install.
B004AJ18XU|4|worked as described
B00BITHKNM|2|Broke after 6 months ...WTH
B0130NLX8G|5|It's a good designed storage organizer,  I love it!  I love that it can hold water bottles and food in the center pocket and also small books. Tons of uses and keeps my car clean and organized!  Hope it can come with different colors!
B00KQSNVD4|1|key  switch  did not work .  will be returning it
B009RER9OA|5|Super easy to install and very bright.
B000COC7ZU|5|Definitely need this when changing valve springs.  Makes things so much easier.
B00OBXQO34|5|Cheap and fits 2016 Ford Explorer
B00K007R6U|5|I had high hopes from this product and it didn't disappoint! I've been spraying febreeze every time I smoke, but when I walk in my house I can still smell it. I placed 3 spread out around where I smoke and in an area approximately 500ft sq.  Now when I come into my house, after being gone for awhile I don't smell smoke at all. Awesome! Now I don't have to buy stock in febreeze! lol
B0009V1WS4|5|Great device, excellent value
B00F0VK7RU|5|Everything fit perfect, took less than an hour with only basic tools. Conti tech is really Continental which is original supplier. Amazon was about 20$ less than anyone I could find. Make a drawing of the belt routing before you remove it.
B00PG9I8IQ|3|Hard to get flat on curved lights and can not even see them during day or night.
B000EDQQD8|4|It works fine; I'd prefer to see the actual numbers rather than just color coded &#34;ranges&#34;, but it does what it needs to do, doesn't leak, and allows a quick visual verification of safe pressure into your RV.
B003HBWM96|3|Minor scratch on the passenger front vent shade and took two days for the same one to stick on... Very easy to install... Made my '15 Terrain look sweeet! But the minor scratch and the time it took for one of the vents to completely adhere after proper installation warranted a 3 star rating otherwise these really are a 5 star product. I just wish mine came completely undamaged. Hoping AVS reads this and does something to change my overall opinion if not, im going totry a different brand next time.
B00F8STLRM|5|So far so good, I wish they would make a sun shade with the crew of firefly on it.
B000Q0CWK0|5|Installed these on my 2002 Toyota Landcruiser with 150k miles.  I like these because they have a black 'grip coating' which helps them stay in place...much better than the ones I replaced. :)
B0011Z98Q0|3|Just a shade too small for my 1998 BMW 740il. should have ordered the next larger size.
B00BY2220O|5|Really love it. I can take it with me on trips to use in the shower.
B00GUPQVHA|3|Think you
B000B6CVZU|5|fits and looks like oem part.
B00029XEBG|3|The gauge side works(G) for the Vdo gauge I bought but the (WK) side for the idiot light comes on with anything above idle. Installed in a 2001 VW Golf,2.0 azg engine code,defective sender or what. Any feedback would be appreciated-nella409@yahoo.com
B00HSFB4CS|5|Good filter, does the job well
B00JSSZBDQ|5|Hands down the only way to go to be rid of the factory automatic adjuster. Hands down. 2009 Heritage Softail Classic
B000CINVA6|5|I use this for lubricating parts on my 3D printer and other engineering projects.  Being an airsol spray makes it super easy to get the grease where you need it allowing you to quickly and efficiently lube up whatever you need.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this for linear bearings and linear guides in addition to normal radial bearings.
B000CBTGHK|5|Perfect
B00NLMEIIY|4|Does what it's supposed to do.
B0083SL82A|4|Very nice for under $10. I bought a &#34;used&#34; pair that had some scratches near the bottom of the vertical arm. Once I got them mounted I figured out why, The ends of the levers on my '82 GPz750 interfered. Obviously, they were returned by someone with the same problem. I like them otherwise and just removed the ball tip of my clutch lever to clear (the brake lever was already missing it's tip when I got the bike). I think they'll do nicely, No more watching my shoulders as I cruise down the road.
B0042VTYSW|5|Haven't had to use it yet, thank the good Lord.<br /><br />Goes on a keychain really well, not too cumbersome to carry around in a pocket. I was worried that the black piece (which has the key-ring) would come loose from the main piece over time ... but nope. Still looks good and I trust it will work if I ever need it.
B0009OR91K|5|I originally purchased this when I thought I was going to replace a steering box on a friend's '91 Jeep, but ended up not having to use it.<br />I've used this to release upper and lower ball joints, and tie rod ends--basically everything except a pitman arm!<br /><br />We've all been there....banging away on a ball joint or tie rod end with a big, greasy hammer and causing all sorts of destruction.  And when the hammer doesn't work, you engineer contraptions with bottle jacks and an even bigger hammer and just cause even more destruction.  And when that doesn't work, you do the unthinkable--you reach for your pickle fork.  That's right, that evil forked piece of steel that is mushroomed on one end from you beating it mercilessly and deep gouges and marks on the forked end where it has ripped apart unthinkable steering components.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this.  I used to dread ball joints and tie rods until I got this.  A simple tool that pops those things apart with ease.  Hit it with a impact gun and things get even easier.  You will fall in love with this tool.  You'll put a gold chain on it and wear it around your neck.<br /><br />This is a well built tool from Lisle who makes good tools.  It is a bit wider than some other similar tools I've seen for sale, but it's dimensions haven't caused any problems for me.  Put a little grease on the threads and this tool will last you years.<br /><br />There are two types of mechanics in this world:  Those that own this tool, and those that WILL own this tool.
B00K56PPAY|5|So cute!!
B00F4E1PU6|5|Exactly what I was expecting and got it right on time
B00LU4L6RQ|5|So nice- I can find my car in the parking lot!  Good quality.  It does not come off antenna even on the highway.<br />I wouldn't leave it on through a car wash though.
B000GTUM9O|4|mounting hardware could be better but for the price it's not bad
B000GTYB64|5|Adds that extra sparkle  to the bike. Really looks good. Way to easy installation,  literally took me about 15 mins to do both sides.
B000EDOSNI|4|Easy to install.
B007ZJJG8G|5|Does what it should!
B00776LMHA|5|Installed 6 months ago my Parents 94 accord NON vtec and its been holding up great no leaks. defiantly would recommend it . ONLY WORKS FOR NON VTEC 1990-1997 Honda Accords
B001TIB0OW|5|awesome, thank you
B00LNORRNU|5|Awesome. Works just like I knew they would.
B00KSM98US|5|Retainers arrived on time, exactly as described, in excellent new condition  and packed very well.
B005ASZKEI|5|Excellent product
B00CSX49N6|5|Very nice tip. Added a bit of a rumble to my truck. Thanks!!
B00FXWLD88|5|Used these connectors to make a winch connection from the rear bumper of my truck to the winch on my trailer.
B005HV3NHE|5|Nice little sticker
B000C847HW|5|THE ONLY THERMOSTAT TO BUY FOR SATURN S-SERIES! installed one in each of my saturns and the  car now runs where it should and gas millage has gone up!
B000CITK8S|5|Extremely happy with this battery tender! Easy install, quality materials, simple plug and go feature and not to mention, an amazing price! Highly recommend to anyone looking to save the life of their battery.
B005DF53RW|5|Very satisfied
B002VVOF9I|5|Made in USA<br />Quiet, good quality product and at reasonable price
B010ELYX7A|5|Works as it should. Same quality as the oem valve cover.
B000EPMQMG|5|great item fo coat
B00HG48C80|1|No good  don't buy it is not a good idea
B000XBH4JG|5|Great  item
B008BHBEE0|4|I have a small, 60W 12V power supply I use to power some LEDs I use for task lighting on my desk and some 120mm PC fans I use to circulate air around a stack of external hard-drives. Since it has the available power-capacity, I also use it to power micro-controller-based LED light-show I keep running on my workbench but for this I needed 5V so I purchased the LM2596-based DC-DC convertors and set-up a few for use as &#34;point-of-use regulators&#34; on the breadboards I use to drive the light-shows.<br /><br />Very handy, inexpensive, and preferable to use instead of 78xx-series linear regulators which drop the excess voltage across themselves and dissipating the energy as waste heat.<br /><br />The potentiometer used to set the voltage was turned almost completely to the maximum voltage setting, i.e. the Vout = Vin. I turned it back and forth several times to determine the correct direction to reduce the Vout. It took a lot of turns before the Vout started to drop. In fact, it took enough turns that I was beginning to think that the device was defective (mimicking the experience of another commenter here) and the unit was stuck, forever, at Vout = Vin. However, I hadn't hit the minimum setting on the potentiometer so I kept turning it down until I saw the Vout start to drop. Success.
B009FREAGO|5|Handy as can be
B00MWL8TXA|5|very good item<br />fast ship!
B003VJVQGY|4|received on time and there were no issues
B00GBW09G6|5|Exact mopar replacement for a better price
B00OV8RG0Y|3|I loved Breaking Bad so I bought them but they stink something really bad.<br />The car wash one is wrong. It was A1 Car Wash
B00CFALFXY|5|arrived as planned used them and they are good.
B0049DJOTC|5|Perfect fit for my 1998 Ford F150 XLT. Installation was fairly easy. It does come with the two hoses and hose clamps needed for a complete replacement.
B0049U341E|5|Good price an an apparently well constructed replacement strut.  Installed without any hassle.
B0096BP6IK|4|It does what it says. It works fine for me.
B009W361ZY|5|Amazing bag!! Very heavy duty and so well made!!i bought it for my wife after bought her new G37!
B000BZ968Q|5|installed it on a 01 f350 4x4 coarse thread lug nuts when i installed new moog ball joints i got everything from amazon except outer axel seal so i had to pay double for that at a local pars store, my error.did it yesterday hope it lasts a long time abs line plugged right in no problem.
B00JBJU2JK|4|Looks and feels like a quality product but doesn't fit my Genuine Scooter Company Roughhouse 50/PGO PMX 50 Naked. The diameter is too narrow. Not too upset though since clone motors are hit or miss. I was able to make it work, but even still after numerous measurements the stock spring and this spring are the same stiffness with the stock spring being slightly stiffer and full compression.
B000RFUF12|2|The nozzle was missing from the pitcher
B00DOMY9GM|5|GO BY THE SIZE CHART. I love this vest. Definitely going to order a 2nd one, but this time I will get a medium. I'm 5'11\\" 230lbs big frame with a 48\\" chest. I wear XL s***s and I said \\"No way is a M going to fit\\" so I got the L. It's ok, but the M would've been much better. The leather is just right. Not to think not to thin not to soft not to stiff. But like the guy in the video said, if you get it to big (like I did even if by 1 size) it will be to long when you sit. This vest is the ONLY vest I ever saw or had that truly is a perfect fit over a thin T-shirt, thin jacket, or my winter ridding jacket. This is the vest you can wear all year over anything. The only reason I'm going to order another one is because I am a Patriot Guard Rider and in the Red Knights MC so I need one for each. Come to thinking of it, I might get a 3rd one just to have one with nothing on it.
B003PJOJ4Q|5|easy to install; I love that I can haul our mower around with my car now instead of needing the ruck every time.
B00OP9XC6Q|5|Good qualities and a great seller.
B00HFL3NV0|5|Fast shipping. Would've liked the cork gasket better but fits fine.
B001PBB9OO|5|great
B008TW83FU|5|Was exactly the one we needed.
B000CNN0K2|4|1996 F250 4x4 Crew cab, 7.5L V8, E4Od Trans, Short bed.<br />I had to shorten the pipe hangers by 3&#34; for my truck.  If i didn't have a welder and the tools it would have been more money to have a shop shorten them.  Other than that great install, very easy, and clean.  Nice sound throaty but quiet.  I like this product.
B00332GO9I|5|came 2 days early, fits great, looks great. Thank you
B000WJEORY|5|Prompt delivery and works great.
B007AHJLLK|5|The mats for my RX330 fit perfectly fine.  I purchased set of two front mats and one large mat for the back seat.  Took about 5 minutes to install, very easy.  Trickiest part was to slip the rear map underneath the bottom of the center console.  Very nice to help preserve the original floor mats.  Very easy to clean, especially with children.
B003OAXAF0|1|paper, no metal between.  much better out there for the money
B008H3YG7A|5|Works as expected. This was an upgrade to switch provided with the lights.
B000C822QU|4|Worked and fit car just fine.
B002HOLD4E|5|Fit perfectly... It's just a shame that this isn't already incorporated into new trucks!
B00VGR8TBI|2|The letters and the vinyl itself were very pretty and would have been gorgeous if it worked out. However, I think some of the letters were too thin, and that made it extremely difficult to peel it off the backing and then adhere it to the wall. I wound up tossing the whole thing because the letters bunched up and there was no coming back from it. I got the same vinyl from a local place and requested that the letters be thicker and it worked out much better. This product was good quality, but simply did not work out for me.
B00DHUA9VA|5|Works great and easy to install
B002789WV6|1|Wrong size, didn't work for our 2006 Toyota Highlander limited
B001F0IJPC|5|exactly what I needed
B00MFY61IO|1|I received this item and it was chipped and cracked when I received it.  I have tried to call but I work during the day and I cannot be on the phone on hold for long.  I just kept it since don't know whom to contact regarding this issue.  The package was ripped as if it were dragged along during shipment.
B00PU68J34|5|Worked perfect!
B000C7S0AI|5|It fit and performs perfectly  , was shipped and received in a short time  . I would purchase again  if needed  . The price was less than local retailers by a small margin .
B00NEL6HT0|2|Does it filter your air, yes.  Does do it well?  No.  Within a short while, about a month, of using this product (I purchased one for each of my vehicles), I noticed a musty smell.  Coming from a carbon cabin air filter, the difference is just plain unacceptable.  I have been a big fan of K&N in the past, but I will try to get rid of the 2 I bought.
B009IK9RXO|5|Added driving safety for a few dollars.  Excellent investment.
B008IAHBWY|5|Great product! The liquid they give you with it is pretty useless cause there's not much, I mixed my own liquid (water and dish soap). There's bunch of videos to watch online on how to do it and I SUGGEST YOU DO! cause you only get one try.<br />I had a local shop custom cut mine :) LOVE THE WAY IT LOOKS!
B001DCH2FK|5|My factory brake pads squeal was tearable as was the brake dust . After installing the akebono ceramic pads . No more noise . Breaking is as good but it's more linear than the factory pads . Awsome pads .
B000WJEKHI|5|I have a 2006 Yamaha ttr230 and was able to simply remove the stock turn on and off button and plug this ignition into the same connector.  No cutting wires or any mods required.  I then attached the ignition to the front plate retaining screw.  That was the hardest part of the switch due to the slightly longer length of the wiring on the ignition.  Great retrofit
B001NZZAGU|5|Worked Great! Could not have been any easier to put on.
B000C8411E|5|They key on my old lock cylinder on my 96 saturn SL kept falling out . Replaced it with this one and its been great ever since! has been installed for a bit over 4 months with no issues yet. just wish the key said Saturn on it. but over all for the price you cant beat it .

B0118V3UTM|5|I received this sunshade on Friday and put it in my car on Saturday.  It works great!!  My car was sooo much cooler.  It looks like the car is wearing sunglasses.  I love how it can fold down to a small package!  I recommend it to anyone, it's so comp[act it can slide under a seat but it works so good.  No more hot steering wheel when I get in.
B0087Y9ZWU|3|i just recived and instaled, look fine but stil don{t know how it works on time, i´ll updated later
B001P0ZA86|5|I'm using it with a 2004 Jeep Liberty pulling an R-Pod 179 travel trailer. The setup was very easy and it eliminates having to wire a brake controller into the tow vehicle. If you've got a 7-pin trailer conection on the tow vehicle you're set to go. Its also easy to move from one tow vehicle to another. It was the first one the R-Pod sales staff had seen and they were very impressed. It works just like its supposed to.
B000GTUM9O|1|I've ridden with this windshield for 3 weeks now and it continues to come loose either at the handlebar bracket screws or the windshield post screws. I am sure I have it installed correctly. This creates a safety hazard at any speed due to the fact that the windshield comes loose while I'm riding my motorcycles and can distract the driver. It comes loose at high speeds and low speeds but mostly shakes itself loose while on the freeway at speeds of 50+ MPH. This windshield is dangerous and poses the threat of causing an accident at any speed. The posts that attach the windshield to the bike are hollow metal tubes, and when a consumer tightens the threaded screws, it actually starts to collapse the hollow tube. If I tighten this any more, I fear that the threaded screws will puncture the hollow windshield post tubes. It is of poor quality and is hazardous to say the least. The seller has refused to take a return on this item because it's used. I would not have known about the poor quality of the product until I used it - it is not apparent that this will come loose on the motorcycle until it is installed on the motorcycle and actually used. Apparently, causing a hazardous condition on a motorcycle does not concern the manufacturer and because it's now been used for three weeks, they refuse to initiate a refund. I find this ludicrous. BUYER BEWARE. If you travel on the freeway, this may rattle loose on you too. It came to the point that I carried the Allen wrenches with me so I could tighten this on the road - I'd have to pull over no matter where I was and tighten it. NOT A GOOD PRODUCT. Do yourself a favor and purchase a fork mounted windshield if you value your safety.

B0087UIV8S|1|Sent wrong part for my application....
B00UG0GTJA|5|Very well built hitch. Fit my 15 Subaru Outback nicely and was a relatively easy install. I did find it easier to fish the attachment bolts down from inside the back end versus making bigger holes in the underside and pushing them up from underneath.
B008BC8EW0|5|Can't believe I didn't have these earlier, makes driving with long trailer much easier.

B00873J0YY|5|Better quality and materials than the Thule for a fraction of the price.
B002DOME1E|3|IN THE TOOL BOX
B004A2BBOI|5|Installation was easy and the product fit exactly as described. A cursory google or youtube search will bring up a myriad of videos with step by step removal and installtion instructions; all in all it took me about thirty minutes to change both out.
B00LOZABKO|5|Use these on my 2015 Corvette Zo6 with my race TSW wheels. Work Great
B00JNL64KM|5|Good quality, looks great!!!!
B008R0KNOI|5|This is a great product. Compact, quality construction. More than met my expectations.
B002L15W8G|5|pretty
B00ZJBDI6S|4|fast delivery, cheap gloves. but do-able
B0030553CC|5|I have used the gasoline version of Sta-bil for years with excellent success, I expect the same from the diesel formulation.
B000BRJEYA|5|Perfect fit for my 1st gen 350 SBC 87-95
B000JFJLP6|5|Good for emergency and well package.
B001EAQTRI|1|had no luck with the ground loop tried to use it on my computer but to no avail..
B00LNGEJEI|3|Kinda thin and the material is rough....not for comfort
B00EE1US7Q|5|Works just as stated. But here in Oahu I cannot find anywhere that can cut a key with a keypad attached so I may need to just buy a new one at the dealership. I would make sure you have a place that can copy the key for you first. But the electronics in this work just fine.
B005F9HSCO|5|Can't see nor feel the difference compared to an over priced dealer product.
B0031XHYWA|5|Perfect.
B0002LWEYC|4|Fits perfectly and is durable.  I don't find it very difficult to roll and unroll.  It folds easily when installing it around the rear view mirror.  My only issue with it is that the velcro strap should be longer.  As some have stated,  keeping it rolled when storing it cause the ends to memorize the rolled position.  I've found a good antidote to this is rolling it up from inside out.  However the velcro strap isn't long enough to reach around when rolling it this way. And it's glued on,  not sewn and started to come off when I tried to stretch it.
B000CF3WDU|5|good filter
B00M9NTYMG|3|I am giving this item a 3 star becasue the description lies. In the description its says: &#34;Also included are three different mounting brackets so you can either bolt this bracket to your axle, bolt it to your shock, or weld the included raw steel slug anywhere on your frame and clamp it to that.&#34;<br /><br />That is totally false!! It only came with ONE mounting bracket which was disappointing for me. I made the one bracket work but I was very unhappy about not receiving the other 2 brackets that I was expecting to come with it.<br /><br />Otherwise the quality of the material and the overall function is great!
B003VCELCW|5|Leaked at first, but after tightening it down a bit more it's fine. Makes oil changes a bit quicker and less messy, and will be very handy if I ever have engine trouble and need to send an oil sample to a lab for testing.
B00LFL8HPI|1|Dura International 29596000 Front Wheel Hub.  This does not fit my 2002 PT Cruiser. It is not a 39mm hub and brearing.
B007VYHGK0|5|Exact fit. And made from better rubber over the black OEM rubber type.
B00GTHLKCA|5|This did the job and was MUCH cheaper than buying the part from the dealer. My husband was able to swap the part easily on his own and it prevented an expensive trip to the mechanic.
B00KBXHEKA|5|great product!
B000JZY4D0|5|I had some trouble with this and shipping. UPS couldn't seem to get one to me without beating it up! Finally, after a bit I was able to get one that wasn't beat to bad. It fit fine and is performing well. As much of a headache as it was the savings would make me do it again.
B00P2D4BPA|1|Did not fit my 2006 Escape.  Amazon return processing was painless.
B00GJ1OEDS|5|Fast delivery, excellent price, fixed the problem
B00QWVGSKW|2|it worked fine for 2 months and start blink
B000C7YQ2Y|5|Works great - better than paying NAPA at their price.
B00BQS7XZ0|4|I bought this coolant expansion tank for my 05 Volvo S40 and I received it quick from Amazon and installed it myself.  Pretty easy to install and save myself some cash.  Looks and feels durable and well made.
B000GUWQBU|5|fits fine works well, price very competitive
B004RCQUII|5|just what I needed,thanks
B0000AYFTV|5|just as expected
B001F5I614|5|my husband loved the gift
B0031XFO2M|5|Perfect.
B000C02YP2|5|I'm impressed by the Centric rotors. One one vehicle I had these on it sat out in the lawn for a year and a half. I thought for sure I would have to replace the rotors due to rust. But to my surprise the brakes worked just as well as they did the day I put them on.<br /><br />Cheap parts store rotors if the vehicle sat for more than a few months I would have to replace the rotors. It looked like chunks of the steel on the rotor face would just flake off. So I'm guessing the cheap chain parts store rotors are just a low grade of steel. Centric must have higher standards.<br /><br />Since these are so economical I just replace them rather than spending the time and money to turn the rotors. Plus these rotors have the little screw hole to help drive the rotor off the hub if it's stuck. Usually the cheap parts store rotors don't have that. I put a thin coat of [[ASIN:B009VO2LCG Jet-Lube Pure Nickel Nuclear Extreme Anti-Seize and Thread Lubricant]] on the back so usually they don't get stuck.
B005HAYDR4|5|great product
B00UUID9DM|4|a little small for my 15&#34; macbook but it still looks epic! Avengers assemble!
B005CNNLRY|4|Mat fit perfectly for my 2015 Ford Focus but the driver side mat was definitely used/returned with scoff marks. Have to say a little disappointing knowing you paid full price for a NEW product.
B00KMBPA9I|5|just as expected
B00FWOKMI4|5|very good
B001UGJPXQ|5|really helps to stabilize the trailer, cuts down on the rocking motion.
B000C9MU52|5|less than 1/2 the price of the dealer.  lol what a joke.  WOrk just fine so far
B00I5WXAS4|5|Just finished installing on 98 passat gls 1.8 wagon. All parts fit perfect, appears to be of good quality , rubber boots appear to be better designed than original as well as bushings. All bolts and nuts included. Didn't bother trying to pull the hubs appart just  took them to local garage along with new bearings and had them done for 50$. There are no instructions be sure to watch the videos on you tube especially the ones from Bentley, getting the bushings torqued in correctly is critical. CV axles are cheep and easy to remove and install when everything is apart consider replacing  if they have some miles on them. My first drive to the alignment shop reminded me of how nice those little cars drive. I am going to buy another set for my 2000 passat glx.
B00O83NNMM|1|Does not fit 2005 Dodge Ram 2500.  Had to drill out pilot holes on the cab, and then the light did not even fit.
B004R35M8Q|5|it was easy to install, just me and no extra help. it was so precise and tight. it fits exactly in the equinox 2007. I used it to transport 2 bicycles from NYC to Miami, FL, traveling around 3000 miles and absolutely no problems.
B000BYEQGO|5|Fit and worked like a charm. Will by the other 3 in a few months and I'll have my tune-up complete. Thanks!
B00VGL7Z5A|5|It works just like is supposed to.
B00WYC7YOW|1|This is just a sticker, not the actual sign.
B0045WBVUM|5|Tried the 'hawk on a round trip to L.A.,CA.  Once you get the right air pressure (easy) your ride will improve a lot.  My bike's seat is usually fine but on a long (400 mile) day the 'hawk rules!  Sure, you still need to get off and stretch (100 to 130 miles for us) but the comfort factor is much better.  Cheers
B000P17NXQ|5|Works perfectly
B00IGCWBFG|5|My oringals wore out, they are exactly as described and installation was fast and easy.
B00BLPS29E|5|Easy to use and operate when it comes to securing a helmet on a bike. Fits my BMW R Nine T handlebar.<br />Cheaper than similar models found at motocycle dealers' stores.
B00T366C9A|5|Great product, fit just like it was suppose to and looks great
B001QK1X5O|5|Got what I ordered Good Price & shipping.
B00DX88YAY|5|Good product
B00AO6I0CK|5|Very Good!!
B002NAQLJ4|5|Worked out very well
B00K8BN8QO|4|First pair went on my son's 2006 F150.  Changed out relatively simple, no need to take off valve cover.  2nd set goes into a 2008 F150, this one is a pain and will have to have the valve cover removed to do it.
B001DYUKWK|5|Very good.
B005KDO8U0|5|They are all I could want, easy to put in.
B000CMKG6Y|4|Overall good product however recommend using automatic reset breaker and upgrade wiring to 10AWG which is the normal size used with manufactures recommend with brake controllers.
B000C9Q6NY|5|Excellent.
B00130L816|5|Great filter, high quality, and easy to install!
B00BUHN8HO|5|Great quality, first time using Cometic head gaskets. I will definitely use again with other engine builds.
B004MU8VRS|4|Kind of a pain to install in our 98 SOUTHWIND motorhome but it works great.
B0057W1W26|5|They were a gift and we were impressed by the quality.  Recipient will be traveling in style.
B00WFHVLCC|4|I was a little skeptical about this product at first. I have the 2011 Juke SL, the first year the model was released. As all Juke owners know, there are three driving modes; normal, sport, or eco. I've always been unhappy with the normal mode; it always seems to sputter a little as I shift into Drive. Even rolling into a green light, the sputtering persists. The torque and responsiveness is better in Sports mode but impractical for continuous daily driving.<br /><br />Installation was straightforward and fairly easy. Although I'd suggest studying the instructions several times to make sure the steps are followed faithfully. The battery was left disconnected overnight per the manual's recommendation. As I test it the next day, I noticed a clear improvement in the engine's performance. Driving in Normal mode was noticeably smoother, no more sputtering. Acceleration and responsiveness was greatly improved. Tested it going up a challenging steep hill and what used to sputter and painfully slow to respond, kicks in obediently & quickly. I know there's a lot of negative reviews here but for me, this simple upgrade has increased the fun in driving my Juke substantially. Can't say much for improved fuel efficiency yet but more than happy with the improved engine attitude. Happy motoring!
B000CGR4BU|5|fit was correct and appear to work fine. They stop this big ole heavy car
B00B1UYSEW|1|Not what I needed!
B004KEJVDO|5|Seems to work good when properly adjusted, used it for a couple of valve spring removal with heads on.
B00B966CQU|1|This product does nothing to dissipate water into gas. Don’t believe me, put a little water in a cup with gas. Pour in  some heet, water is still there.
B007KPU95E|5|Looks darn good on the bike!!!! Will be from you again.
B001QVA6TM|5|I did lots of researching on ball joints for my 96 tacoma, I just want good parts that last, my truck  is stock, and I don't want to pay oem price. I decided on the raybestos professional series. They are engraved 555 made in japan, and their spring less design is sturdy. The feel and look of this part appears high quality. I cannot speak of longevity yet. It was nice they came with a spring ring for the boot so no wiring is needed. This model for my truck did not have a grease zero or hole for one which was a bummer, but I just stuffed the body/boot full of lithium grease along with the grease it already had. It's designed to be that way so I'm okay with it. Intallation was great, I would defiantly buy these over moog, and recommend them.
B00DGU98VS|5|Just as described. OEM for a better price then and local shop.
B008B5X5GC|5|Worked great
B005MHPWP4|5|Wish it was a tiny bit bigger.
B000BZJVA4|4|Better than other brand I installed.
B00KQSLHF8|5|Worked prefectly
B00537FIRU|5|Well built however the unit ripped thru the box during delivery. It's shipped in a big box with no cushion. It's doesn't have noticeable scratches and it's to bulky to ship back as I'm sure the second wold pop holes in the box too.<br />Fitment was perfect.
B00D1CQVIY|3|comes with sucky connectors. but the wiring harness was good
B00FR1VFNS|5|Amazing
B000BWE4RC|2|The description said it was self priming, the package says gravity feed.  Pick one, it can't be both.
B005380D3S|5|thx
B00KMYYQ36|5|Wanted to waterproof fo my new gazebo top - this was great.  Will use it again next year when I take gazebo top out of the summer
B003AP7PYQ|5|Looks great and fits well.
B00D33FQ82|5|Fast delivery. Perfect fit
B007ZCD2F6|2|says 5000lb rolling weight, was trying to pull a 1995 ford probe, (about 2600lb) rolling up the trailer ramps, had a very hard time, had to do it manualy untill it got the front wheels on the trailer, and then the same for the back wheel. cable for the power hook up is short, if you have a long truck it will not reach under the hood. remote cable is short. on the plus side, it is light, the mount is good and strong, the cable is thick and long.
B002R0ASEE|5|Worked
B004ZF3PY4|2|A very bad experience for this product is supposed to say the power of electricity. As well as lighting, one yellow and the other blue. And slow when running
B00LPEOVT6|5|Once again FOX delivered high quality items without breaking the bank, this one is not the exception, I love the colors, cool gold looking lenses 100% UV protection, fits great and very comfortable, I'll buy it again any time, I highly recommend these goggles!
B00GTGU554|5|Great upgrade
B00192KZQ2|5|Awesome. works good. Does what is intended.
B00N18WNV2|5|Worked like a charm!!
B007TWCC5I|5|it's a terrific patch. I recomend it.
B0047RV8WG|1|Lighting is very weak but not worth any star in the evaluation
B0031I6FM0|1|Both rotors we're badly warped out of the box. Amazon was great and paid the return shipping on the rotors. never had a problem with ACDelco parts before. Very puzzling.
B00G4Q6U4O|4|Pump was an easy install but I have noticed that the fuel capacity sensor is sensitive; the time between the light coming on and the vehicle running out of gas is much shorter now.  It can probably be adjusted but I have not tried it yet.
B003D50KHC|5|Cured my leaking seal problem.
B000I4JPZE|5|Huge time saver if you ever needed one.
B0054YCW62|5|Exactly what I expected and more
B0000UUU6E|5|The BEST !!
B003YMRNV0|5|Work as they should, no issues. Great price.
B001NZQIFM|5|Plug & Play!! Can't get much easier !!!
B00FUT7IP6|5|Super!!!!!!!!'
B00TD157HI|3|they work pretty well, but the material is not too thick, so it doesn't hold much dirt or dust at a time.
B00O65H6S4|5|I have a 2014 chevy silverado Z71 with a V8.  I was told by GMC truck owner (basically the same truck) that he was getting 24mpg.  Being that I have tried as much as possible to peak out the mpg and only have gotten 21 over 7k miles, I called balony and said if he showed me on his dash history I would not only believe but buy one.  He showed me his past 400 miles as 24.2mpg and he has the tranny that is more for pulling than fuel efficiency as mine.  Well, I ordered one here on amazon and installed it in 15 minutes.  I could install one now in probably 7 minutes, so easy.<br /><br />After the first 100 miles I am now a true believer!!!  half city/ half country driving and I am at 22mpg with a peak at 33.2!  33.2 peak was a 25 mile average riding E then W on a back road (see picture). And I think I could get even higher :)<br /><br />The engine does seem slightly more vocal, but not as loud as others made it out to be.<br /><br />This is the only aftermarket part I have added so far.  Please let me know if there are other things I could do to improve mpg!<br /><br />21-33.2mpg with a full size Z71 crew cab is absolutely hard to believe!  So, I have included a picture for some proof!  I have also included some pictures I took while installing for your reference (I did this within the 15 minute installation too :)<br /><br />I will add more proof pictures ASAP!<br /><br />GET IT, it will not only pay for itself quickly, it will save you $ and time at the pump
B00D798FTO|4|I liked the quality of the frame but it covered half of my month and year stickers so had to return it.  Seller said they should be getting in more with a thinner bottom.
B0006MRQRM|5|Very satisfied.
B00HJVF25G|5|I have a 1990 Toyota 4Runner with over 300,000 miles on the Original engine as I have owned the vehicle since it had 65,000 miles in 1995.<br />I have used the product and certainly it worked for me and I have done the compression tests on my cylinders<br />myself before using the product, I have all the readings. I can tell you since using the product and driving up mountain freeways in Arizona<br />at 106 degrees outside I have noticed a performance improvement and I was able to gain about 10 MPH improvement on the steepest incline going from Phoenix to Flagstaff, I was able to exceed 50MPH and before engine restore I was lucky to achieve 40mph with all cars passing me.  I can attribute this to the Engine Restore product as I was about to have a valve job done. I am now delaying that procedure. It also stopped the real main engine seal leak and I can now park in my driveway again without embarrassing oil puddles.<br /><br />What I did do in addition to putting in the engine I also squirted 2 oz of the stuff with a syringe in each<br /><br />cyllinder. Certainly it smoked for about 10 min when I started the engine.<br /><br />This is the best product I have ever used, besides the Castrol oil I have always used.<br /><br />Tony
B001TNMWBM|5|I bought these to spray over PVC ID badges to make them last longer. Works very well, everything should be dusted very well before spraying because it will make the tiniest dust particle big and noticeable with the many layers you spray. So far no scratches or fading in use for two months in a harsh manufacturing environment.
B00DI3DV6G|5|Surprised hubby with this gift and he wondered where all his &#34;stuff&#34; was in his trunk. I kindly replied with love and said, &#34;It is now organized. I got a big &#34; thank you&#34;.
B000HI9E7U|5|Wonderful for valve adjustment jobs, i have an S54 in my Z4M/E46 M3, i did the valve adjustment with it, it has the 0.007-0.009 and 0.011 and 0.013 sizes for that engine. it was great
B001G7EA52|4|perfect replacement part although it doesn't last very long. this is a flaw with mercedes' design, but at least we are able to replace it
B00EL37R8U|5|Better than I expected. I replaced 25 overhead bulbs in my RV with these LEDs. It's amazing how beautiful they make the RV look. No &#34;yellow cast&#34; like the original bulbs put out. Pure white light witch adds a cool look to everything. The quality of the units seems very good. They are cooler to the touch and were plug and play. Highly recommended this product.
B002Z5VIS6|5|easy to put in
B00K6L86F4|5|Sink was the exact replacement we needed for our 1987 Jamboree. Easy to install and looks so much nicer than the old yellow sink that was in there. Good, inexpensive, fix up for our camper.
B00HFDC8EQ|1|Very bad ..
B007BKEJS6|3|There are many versions of mirrors for Avalanches. Badly need a schematic included with product.
B00TFQLI8I|3|you get what you pay for.. its cheap and very soft foam (elbow falls threw and easily moves the rest)<br />save up and invest in a legit oem jdm one
B000BPTVTK|1|Clogged my wiper lines and nozzles. Rain-X neither answers their phone nor returns voicemail messages.
B0024NM16M|5|No more dull headlights all shiny and new!
B004H2N46O|2|I really wanted to like these.  They seem reasonably well made and at a reasonably good price.  I purchased them in February 2014 and one completely died in July 2015.  These are for my Prius and replaced two different brand bulbs (not Philips).  When I replaced what was in my vehicle, one of them would turn on for about 10 minutes, then go out.  The other one was still working, but I replaced them as a pair so they would match.  One of them died completely last month and doesn't even attempt to light.  Fortunately, I kept the old bulb that was still working when I replaced these.  I am surprised at how much brighter that old bulb is than the remaining working Maxlux.  This is my first time with HIDs, and I thought they generally lasted longer, however in my old vehicle with conventional Halogen, I've usually got about 4 years of life out of them.  Will be going with genuine Philips as they aren't too much more expensive.
B0001EVXE2|5|just what i was looking for
B00HK4G3ZU|5|Whats not to like...its a Bigfoot Decal and the price was right
B00R34S63O|5|The absolute best window cleaner in the world.
B0012TRLWS|5|Very nice!!!
B00LND6FX4|5|First K&N filter I've ever purchased.  From now on I will be replacing all stock filters with these.  We saw a 1.5 mpg increase on a recent 1000 mile round trip versus last years mpg's on the same trip.  Doesn't sound like much.....but given that I don't have to replace the stock one's every 10,000 miles and these are a far superior product to cheap paper filters it's a no brainer.
B001OKD8VI|5|As described. It's a gasket.
B006QH54WU|5|Now THIS is a battery.  Had to replace mine and went with these because it can be difficult to get in the boat and check levels of water in flooded batteries that you have to open.  I noticed that these while a bit heavier, they do hold a charge much longer from what I have seen thus far.
B00DDQ1930|5|I love it make my car look good
B000CMJQJC|4|Amazon says these will fit my 1999 Chevy Suburban but they do not. They are designed for the 1999 and newer Chevy Trucks. GM didn't redesign the Suburban until the year 2000.  No problem. I returned these and got a set designed for my body style and really like them.<br /><br />Recap:<br /><br />This model number is for the GMT800.  Not the GMT400.
B004NKUXBE|5|Works great
B00S7S7C58|5|Bulbs were more than I expected greatly surprised
B004QPCLC0|5|it's just like the original fit very fine I am very happy thank you very much.
B004A6PLSG|5|fit perfectly and a great price compared to the local parts stores
B005XEFADU|5|Works great and definitely helps eliminate odors. Went on a 10 day trip and used a drop in packet for the first 5 days or so and could smell the tank after the first day. Used the Happy Camper for the final 5 days and had no odor at all even though the last 5 days were warmer than the first 5. Will continue to use this going forward.
B00FFUF3HA|4|Nice, quick delivery
B00XZ397Z8|4|Looks great. My husband put it on the back of his truck, not sure how long it will last but so far looks good.
B004UQQT0A|5|You might think your windows are clean but they're not 100% clean until you use this. Just running my hand over the windshield over a treated side and an untreated side was huge (this given my hands we're a little chapped). It as easy as spraying on Speed Shine, rubbing the bar around the lubricated area, wiping off and buffing. Also, don't be stingy when it comes to the Speed shine; the area being clayed (if that's a term) should be well lubricated. I would probably say use this once a month depending on what part of the country you live in and the kind of weather your car endures.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Very bright and exactly what was described. Just had to silicon to keep from fogging. But very nice light
B000BRFGGA|5|Love it works great nice an loud
B00PGRGSH6|5|Just installed these on my Lexus. Fantastic lights, very bright and with the amber color they look better than the white LED options. Well worth the money.
B001NAP2D6|5|works well
B000Z0HVHA|5|Works great
B00S41OSC8|5|This is the second one I bought. They meet my needs.
B007GEMKFQ|5|Great quality and it looks good.
B00DZPC5NM|5|Work well. Just like the ones that came with our 2014 Chrysler Town & Country.
