0792839749|2|Please don't let your child watch this!!!<br /><br />Started watching this with my 3 year today (yes, my mistake for not vetting a movie before watching with my 3 year old). All was merry and bright until the intermission. Post intermission, I feel like the car dropped off a cliff into the twilight zone: A creepy child catcher dressed in undertaker's clothing.A &#34;barren&#34;ness who hates children. A creepy scene with her in lingerie and the baron, her husband, trying to kill her. Lost children who storm the castle and tie up the adults, wielding pick axes and scythes. Seriously? I was disturbed and I'm 30. I fast forwarded most of that junk and I'm sure it went over my child's head, thankfully. Never again. I just hope she doesn't have nightmares.
B0051MKNV8|5|When my husband brought this movie home he had to talk me into watching it.  Once I watched it I was hooked.  I love the thought of the possibility of a drug that can make someone use every part of their brain.  I have recommended this movie to numerous people who all enjoyed it immensely.  Overall this is one of my favorite movies!!!!

B0091QS88K|1|I'd give it a zero but not an option. Getting sick of apps using in-game purchases to be able to progress through the game. Either charge up front or make it free... stop trying to milk further revenue ffs
B00555X8OA|5|FANTASTIC, GREAT BOOK AND VERY WELL WRITTEN ... THANK YOU AMAZON
B00992CF6W|5|I love this game. That goes without saying. But my kindle won't let me buy any more apps or. Download any thing else
B0040X46TE|5|His voice is beautiful and so full of emotion.  I loved each and every song, expecially \\"over the rainbow\\" and \\"what a wonderful world\\"
B00T73AO0W|5|this is a awesome movie. i didn't know that this movie was Mel Gibbsons first role. he did an outstanding job on playing Max. can't belive that this is the movie that started his career and i didn't know that he was from Australia. this is a great film. the special effects are ok but for the time the movie was made they were good, the story is good and the action and acting is good. this is one of those 1980's  movies that everyone loves and became a cult classic. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00EW9GQR6|1|I did like her other music but this one was not my thing. I guess I am too old for it because my daughter loves it!

B001HN694K|5|Just finished watching the movie. Creepy and yet beautiful. The movie is outstanding. I'd watch it twice with a joy. Great movie. Awesome cinematics, good and great actors. Just loved it. Of course I don't like too much of creepiness, so it took me a little while to start liking the movie. But it's absolutely great. After 30 minutes I liked it more and more with each moment until I realized that this is it. I love it!
B008JFURKG|4|Good movie with good action. It lost a bit of the flair that made the 1st one great and I think they tried a little too hard to go over the top in action. However, still a very enjoyable movie and plenty of good scenes.
B004YOEFG8|5|Watched it on a 106 inch DLP 3D projector, great graphics and spectacular documentary.  IMAX movies are the only thing I've found so far that is actually worth paying the extra price for BluRay and one of the only things I actually like in 3D.
B00EHMFC78|5|David Baldacci my new favorite author!!! this book is a pager turner, could not put it down. It captures your attention and intelligence all at the same time. Can't wait for the next adventure with Will Robie and Jessica Reel, two of the most fascinating characters, wonderfully written piece. Awesome!!! you must read this suspenseful, educational, wise wonderment masterpiece!
B00AB65SP0|3|It's still entertaining to watch, but far as funny as the first ones.<br />Seems like the ideas dried out.<br />Won't buy the next season.
B008133MDK|5|I wish this was like an HBO series with 10 episodes. So much awesomeness, great story. I will be sad if they don't make more.

B009JZSC9S|4|It is unfortunate how flagrant the animosity between Alicia and Kalinda has become. Without spoiling too much for everyone, it doesn't seem to get better in the next session. Julianna should really forgive Archie or vice-versa.
B009CPES4I|1|Slow and boring.
6300214559|4|The story of the real Lady Jane, tragic and fascinating, would make a wonderful screen play. Unfortunately, the writers of this film's script adapted a few facts and sandwiched stock, pat fiction in between.<br />Helena Bonham Carter, at once beautiful and earnest, does give the viewer a flavour of the intellectual, devout, and manipulated Jane, and the acting, scenery, and music are first rate and the reason for my high rating. There is a sense of Edward VI's concern for the sucession, how Jane was used as a pawn, and such historical truths as, for example, how the poor were reduced to destitution when there no longer was monastery land to farm.<br />Beyond that, the circumstances of Jane's life and brief reign are so distorted as to make the book verge on the farcical. Whatever factors there were in Jane's situation, no part of it was in any way a &quot;love story.&quot; The depiction of the madly romancing couple managing all sorts of reforms (for example, &quot;their shilling&quot;) within a matter of a week practically reduces Jane's story to camp. One could get the absurd impression that Jane's being manipulated, even beaten, into a marriage with Dudley was a piece of good fortune with a happy, if brief, outcome.<br />Of course, those who believe that history in no way matters are welcome to compose fictional love stories... but, when anyone had as intriguing a true story as did Jane, it is preferable for such love stories to not borrow her name.
B000002AT6|5|This is the best soundtrack I have ever heard. It may seem strange, but some of the tracks actually sound like Montana. My favorite track is &quot;The Ludlows&quot; becase the violin is breathtaking. I give this soundtrack ten fingers up!
B00B22IJXK|5|Super great app so worth the money. I recommend it for everyone looking for a realistic cheap Photoshop app :)
B00AREIAI8|4|A fun game for horse lovers. Only thing that bugs me are the ads. After level 9, they started popping up after every mini game
B003GK2216|4|Great review of a period in time in social structure/behaviour/hardships......we often beleive things were good in the olden days. No ways! Development of the themes and characters over time was good.....but tailed off at the end. A BIG book!
B00985E3UG|5|It's certainly is a wakeup call to see how the \\"system\\" seems to work against us all. It's disheartening that these firms don't seem to have a moral side to them.
B0091REZMW|3|if you like hidden object games this is one of the best. I enjoy it keeps me busy and wanting more. I definately recommend it to everybody like me.
B0050SYS5A|2|doesn't really work, really downgrades playable area, kinect can't focus on me or recognise me anymore.  don't use.
B000002KOQ|4|As my first introduction to Ms. Mitchell's work, I had no idea what to expect. I was riding the wave of celebration for the 20th anniversary of Woodstock, and happened to catch an interview with Graham Nash, where he mentioned her penning the ode for the event, that piqued my interest. Fourteen years old and eager to explore, I went in search of the eartheral creature described.<br /><br />The tape, long ago replaced by a CD, exceeded all expectations. The \\" Woodstock\\" anthem was so well written, especially for a \\" Kid who couldn't make it\\", as Mitchell was quoted as saying a few years later. However, in typical fashion, she captured the spirit behind the event. In retrospect, this ability to create vivid pictures with her words created the hallmark for the brilliance of her emerging greatness as a song writer.<br /><br />Ms. Mitchell's voice is above reproach; she easily had the most angelic, sincere delivery of all the genre combined. The songs contained here reflect the free spirited ethos of the late 60's, with some personal observations painting a lush portrait of Canyon life. The skill of distilling gender role questions, pastoral living, spiritual seeking, and the thrill of opening oneself, as well as another, to the possibility of love is amazing. Considering she was only twenty seven, at the oldest, when these songs were written, the talent assumes a new level.<br /><br />This is a great intro to Joni's work; then, if you choose to work back to the first two, you will see the improvements on already exquisit work.  If you proceed to the next succession of material, you can trace the gift truly taking form. For days that mellowing out seems the only option, this is a perfect soundtrack.
1781162646|5|Really great book, I couldn't put it down! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys mystery mixed with a coming of age story.
B00KNWYDU8|5|I loved it it's my favorite game
B007ZGO7EM|5|I love this app, great when I'm out and need a calculator. Like right now when I'm trying to figure out how much my college books are going to cost.
B008EKMB82|3|Loved the concept of the book but it takes a weird turn toward the end that felt like a cop out by the author.  I was disappointed in what I'll refer to as &#34;the dream sequence&#34;.
B0097HSS4M|5|Very user friendly. Works very well. You can take a photo add several different things to your photos like for example date, name of the person in the photos, add any color of text to your photos. Change the enhancement of the photos. There are several different things you can do with this app.Very satisfied.
B00IXOU8ZC|5|good
B004N622EY|4|Nice attempt at a strong female character. However it's disappointing that she's the only one and in the end<br />- SPOILER -<br />All she ever wanted was a man.
B00R7FRTWI|5|Just Brilliant.
B00IHZ91T6|4|Good,useful information.
B0098NSCSM|3|I watched the movie because it was well-received by other reviewers. I don't know if this is a Mars/Venus inability to comprehend the interaction between the main characters who were brutal to one another. I empathized with the circumstances and I recognize that in their coping they regressed developmentally. While each had redeeming qualities and they came to acceptance at the end, I did not resonate with the characters. Perhaps it was because denial was the main component of the movie and the landscape of dying and grief is so much richer than I perceived in this representation.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Amazing book that simply demonstrates true love in its most raw form; I can read it over and over again.
B005K17RU0|5|I am sure if i paid a little more i could get more than the basic information thiz app provides.  Nevertheless I am completely happy with what I get.  Thanks
B00129H7VS|5|&#34;From this day to the ending of the world, But we in it shall be remembered- We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother...&#34; --William Shakespeare, Henry V, Act 4, Scene 3<br /><br />Maybe the only downside to this mesmerizing story that traces a typical group of United States platoons, &#34;Easy Company&#34;, through their lives, trials, triumphs, tribulations, and deaths through war-torn Europe in the mid-1940's is that it never enjoyed a theatrical release. &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; has elevated the bar incredibly high for any future dramatic cinema that decides to tell a story about World War II (or any other war for that matter.) This is not John Wayne or Robert Mitchum pontificating platitudes atop podiums, or a couple of guys with radios watching explosions from behind a trench saying &#34;We need reinforcements&#34;, or even a German high commander being flabbergasted by what he sees through his binoculars. This a look at the war from a completely different angle, from the angle of a fellow soldier, a blood brother who may not live to see tomorrow.<br /><br />&#34;Apocalypse Now&#34;, &#34;Platoon&#34; and &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; were the catalysts that sparked a new era of war cinema quite removed from the heroic clich&eacute;-ridden and platitude-riddled drivel that graced many-a large screen for the first few decades during and after the war, such as &#34;The Longest Day&#34;, &#34;D-Day the Sixth of June&#34;, or &#34;The Sullivans&#34;. (There were of course some very notable exceptional films, such as &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front&#34;, &#34;Paths of Glory&#34;, even &#34;Casablanca&#34;.) &#34;Apocalypse&#34;, &#34;Platoon&#34; and &#34;Ryan&#34; forged new perspectives of war that were at the ground level where the essence of human drama truly resides. In many ways, &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; is the culmination of this new cinematic territory, although you might argue it owes a debt to the original &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front&#34; of the 1930's.<br /><br />&#34;Band of Brothers&#34; is not about a particularly heroic company, an exceptional company, or a famous company. &#34;Easy Company&#34; was probably just about as typical an American military unit as you will find--a para-trooping company consisting of many young men from a variety of backgrounds who were drafted into service in 1944. The story begins with the company going through the rigours of basic training at the hands of Captain Sobel played by David Schwimmer in what may be the best role of his career. Sobel is a hot-headed military trainer, good at re-creating possible wartime scenarios and pushing his men to their limits but awful at true leadership. When he pushes over the line by unjustly accusing a fellow officer, Major Winters (Damian Lewis), of not following orders, Winters calls his bluff, and Sobel's men begin to lose respect for him, which is of course fatal to anyone in command. But this is just a prelude to what will follow.<br /><br />The real story begins when &#34;Easy Company&#34;, now led by Major Winters, flies into the Western Front and fights directly with German ground soldiers in France. This is war at its grittiest and most unromantic. War as depicted in &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; is about constant fear, anguish, and disillusionment coupled with split-second decision-making and timing. A delayed decision or an ill-conceived tactic could mean the deaths of many of your company. The filmmakers conceived a look and point-of-view in which the viewer feels like one of the men, walking and running alongside them during battle. The ground-level fighting as depicted in &#34;Brothers&#34; may even surpass &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34;.<br /><br />The other endearing aspect of the film is the characters. These are not bigger-than-life generals or colonels. These were young average guys, most of them nameless and lost to history, who liked cigarettes, sex, and playing cards. They talked about movie actresses, posted pin-ups of Rita Hayworth on their walls, and gambled using cigarettes. And in the field, most of them just tried their best to survive.<br /><br />Being a hero was not necessarily on the forefronts of their minds. This is where the meat of real human drama comes to the fore which is I think the point of &#34;Brothers&#34;. One minute their chatting at a campfire when one of their friends is instantly killed by gunfire. A medic dashing around other encampments looking for supplies for the wounded and dying. A soldier who hides in a barn to escape the notice of German soldiers who have arrived. Or fighting hidden snipers in what had been previously a very sleepy town going back to the Middle Ages. They hadn't seen combat since the time of Henry V. These are the real stories.<br /><br />This is one of the best made-for-television series since &#34;Roots&#34; from the 1970's. These were just regular guys asked to accomplish a monumental task. And that is what is heroic.x, and playing cards.

B001UTW7QU|5|Fringe is a two-level series, with a day-to-day mystery to solve and an underlying complex mythology. The script does a great job connecting both, always feeding into the mythological elements by drawing from the day-to-day mysteries. Many series tend to rely too much in the day-to-day case solving and that can get tiring, but this one achieves a good balance by bringing in and feeding into the mythology. Characters are very well scripted and acted, kudos to Torv, Jackson, and Noble, but also to the supporting cast. The chemistry and dynamics between Jackson and Noble is just perfect, progressing through the series as they get to know each other. This is a type of series you can enjoy if you watch a single random episode, of course you'd enjoy it much more if you knew the background. Great show!
B00NEQRNVG|4|The book is great! It is a little slow in some places but, there are more real life situations in this one. Can't wait for the next one!! Love this series!!
B00433TO52|2|I like Shakespeare plays. The kindle version of this book was hard to read. When reading a Play, its hard to determine which character is speaking. Plus it doesn't tell you what line you are reading.
B000002MM8|5|This was the first Dead Can Dance CD I ever heard, and it is just lovely. I have probably listened to it a thousand times. It has a unique dark, almost tribal sound. Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard both have incredible  voices.
B00BHHIWQO|1|This game took over my kindle. I couldn't exit. My only choice was to delete it. Not even worth it for free.
B0028K3192|5|Maxwell's back and I couldn't be happier.  This one makes it definitely worth the wait.  Can't wait until his next release.
B00008S2VG|5|Speaking as a huge Madonna fan, I have followed her for my whole life as she's grown as an artist and this is her best work to date. She's very honest and has revealed her feelings more than she's ever before like in the songs &quot;Love Profusion&quot; and &quot;Mother and Father.&quot; The songs are an acoustic/techno mix that works well with her voice and nice to listen to when you want to mellow out. This is an album that's definitely worth purchasing.
B002M9WW30|5|This is a great item to have. This film series is a great story of an ordinairy guy who suddenly finds himself on a path to drasticlly improve his life. Along the way he pushes through several physical and emotional barriers between his goals and his friends/family. The ride, while bumpy at times, is very satisfying and rewarding for the watcher. The really good thing is that each movie has Rocky tackle a different obsticle for different reasons.<br /><br />Moving away from the movies, the set itself is pretty impressive. The movies do have slight quality issues but, it's very easy to brush it aside and forget the problem, except for the first film. In the first movie there are scenes where one character appears blurry and has shadow all around him/her but all other characters look bright and clear. While I haven't seen every extra, the ones I have seen add a lot for the movies and it is great hearing Stallone explain what he did with the character he acted/created/changed.<br /><br />Not every movie is 5 stars but, the set makes up for the majority of bad marks I would give some of the movies. Very recommend.
B00884GR0W|5|It is true that this game isn't. minecraft but it is an awsomely amazing game I love how there are real looking people and animals!If you LOVE minecraft as much as I do then you should get this app!(And I do NOT work for the app creators&gt;:(  )
B0067R0APK|4|Very informative, and updated!!!<br />I just wish that the radar was more detailed. Otherwise it is a reasonable app. Worth the download.
B00000ICN5|5|What can you say about SRV !!!  He's one of the greatest guitarris !!! Like Hendrix !!!  SRV is the best around !!!  Wanna learn from a real player !!!  Listen to Mr. SRV !!!
B004R13U6Y|5|I bought this app from the android market for 5 dollars several months ago.  I consider it one of my must have applications.  I read alot of books for work and pleasure,  having an app that remembers where I was is a must. Features like adding my own notes, and having it read aloud are great too. The developer is very active often putting out new releases for things I didn't even notice were wrong or missing.  I consider this a good thing.
B002I8PVQA|5|Such a great movie to watch!
B000001GPX|5|This is simply the greatest performance of Beethoven's 7th Symphony, 2nd movement, ever committed to tape.  Arguably, the 2nd movement of the 7th is the most powerful Beethoven ever wrote.  Of the 5 recordings I own and the numerous others I've heard, none is in the same league as Kleiber's interpretation.  That single track is worth the price of the whole disc and more.  Just think of the 5th symphony and the other 3 movements of the 7th as bonus material -- very, very good bonus material.
B004G6009K|5|Tangled was a film I entered with a little trepidation. After seeing this one, I had regained my dwindling faith in Disney. It's lighthearted, funny, musical, and not stupid (or at least doesn't treat the audience like they're stupid). Everything a Disney film should be (except hand drawn)!
B00IU5ACXW|5|Although there was a small, slightly deep scratch on the front of the case when it arrived, the rest of the case was almost spotless, and the CDs played 100% perfectly! Very satisfied with the service!
B008RA3X5E|5|So good. Simple, attractive and has all the qualities of a fine alarm clock. I recommend this one to anyone shopping around.
B00MASEPTC|3|Meh. Not sure what to think about it.
B001706I5I|5|Great Family Movie
B004PZ4HC8|3|This is another book that has a film version coming out this year, which was the main reason I want to read it. This book is kind of different in terms of it's format. It's set up like a pseudo-documentary; a journalist interviewing different people about their zombie apocalypse experiences and what insight their individual expertise and views can lend the catastrophe.<br /><br />Many of them work high-up jobs as politicians, influential scientists and physicians, etc., while others are just laymen and everyday joes. While we just listen to interesting (sometimes horrific) stories of people's experiences and it feels like we're just watching 20/20, he actually gives us a very well-rounded idea of the events and timeline of the zombie outbreak on a world-wide scale.<br /><br />All that said, I have to admit I didn't end up being a huge  fan of the format. It started out really interesting, but it just didn't work for me overall. Don't get me wrong, I get why people loved this and it was a best-seller, but I found myself getting bored. First of all, the book begins by basically saying that the zombie apocalypse is over and the world, though in ruins, did survive and is starting to rebuild. Though it's a common thing to do, I'm never a fan of telling the ending first. Yeah, in fiction it gives you an end point to work toward, but I'd always rather be surprised. In this particular novel it was even worse because this wasn't formatted like a regular story. All the short stories put together never had a common thread or character, so there was no character to root for and no climax to work toward; nothing you wanted to see play out based on the information given at the beginning.<br /><br />Because of that, like I said, I got bored and had a hard time finishing it. I think the movie looks fun--hopefully I won't be disappointed there as well--and I'm glad I read it to get an idea of what it was, even if I did just skim large chunks of it. If the format sounds like something you'd like, then you probably will. For me, I doubt I'll pick this up again.
B00BQ1DBUS|5|I love it but then I love Rod Stewart.  If you are a fan I am sure you will love it too.
B00BRR66SA|5|When you make a 10 song LP of 7 minute grooves (give or take), you understand, something special just happened..... the groove came back to RnB. It's not about what your saying, it's about how you present it. Justin and Timbaland worked this presentation to the bone. They give you the standard pop appeal, and then they proceed to dress and layer it all up, and then strip it all away again. RnB has lost it's way, and this album found the proper path
B0054JZC6E|5|good game very fun and also very very very very very very very very very very very very very addicting
B000OZ0NXA|4|I saw this book in stores front and center when it first came out, but never considered it because the childlike handprints on the front cover made me assume it was some kind if horrifying account of murdered children. Luckily my kindle didn't show the cover so I was in deep before I realized it.<br />Meeting Jack Reacher is a wild ride, the story grabs you from the beginning and immediately forces you to figure this guy out, which is refreshing. The book is full of interesting conflicts. It's an exciting read. I would have given it 5 stars for the entertainment value but I didn't like the gross details he wrote into the violent scenes.  I'm happy to have found a new book series that is so well written.
B0020BUWX2|3|Every part up to the point of her choice was great but how the final choice was played out was kind of anticlimactic. I didn't realize that was the end of the book. Once I realized the choice I was just like, &#34;Oh...ok.&#34;
1475143389|3|I wish Michael Matthew's writing style was more concise.  There is really great information in this book, but if you intend to use this book (as I do) as a reference where you want to quickly look up a fact, it is very difficult to find.  The author tends to beat around the bush for most of the book.
B004ZNARH4|4|I'm a Pink Floyd fanatic, or maybe I'm not ... I've never been thrilled with \\"The Final Cut\\" or, for that matter, \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\" The former is really a Roger Waters solo album masquerading as a PF album not long before he left the band. The latter is David Gilmour's baby, and while it's got some interesting music, lacks Waters' lyrical inventiveness.<br /><br />Then there's the Syd Barrett-led Floyd from 1968 or so, which only produced one album, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\" Barrett was a brilliant songwriter, or was most of the time; \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is brilliant, as are some other tracks here. But \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" bores the daylights out of me, and some of the other psychedelic overtones here result in this being an album that has not aged especially gracefully.<br /><br />After Barrett's drug use/madness drove him from the group, the band struggled through a few somewhat uninspired albums, including \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" and the \\"More\\" film soundtrack. \\"Meddle\\" and \\"Obscured by Clouds,\\" the two albums released just before \\"Dark Side,\\" hinted at some really good things to come.<br /><br />Then came the Floyd albums that defined the band for me: \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall.\\" Each of them quite different from the rest, each of them with its own considerable merits. \\"Animals\\" was about as noisy as the Floyd ever got, and \\"Sheep\\" and \\"Dogs\\" especially were great fun for their musical bite and lyrical nastiness. \\"The Wall\\" is probably the creepiest album of the four, and the one I identify with least ... but then again, I've never been a rock star who's coming apart at the mental seams. That leaves \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and over the decades I've vacillated between the two when trying to decide which is Pink Floyd's best album.<br /><br />So ... as I said, I'm a Floyd fanatic, or maybe I'm not. I will say this: I don't appreciate being sold a box set as expensive as the Dark Side \\"Immersion\\" box that has so many packaging problems. I was absolutely HORRIFIED when I saw the contents of my first copy. The two discs in cardboard sleeves were fine, but the four that were supposed to be on spindles had ALL come loose during shipping. Two were badly scraped and scratched, and the other two showed slight damage.<br /><br />I am glad I ordered from amazon. I let them know via the Web site about the problems; they shipped out a new copy almost immediately. Out of caution, though, I held onto the first one until the second arrived, and it's a good thing I did: Again, the discs had slipped off their spindles, or in this case three of them had. Fortunately, using the two sets, I was able to piece together four good discs, not counting the ones in sleeves, and shipped the worst of the lot back.<br /><br />This just shouldn't happen with a set this expensive, but at least the retailer made good on it. I've also read some pretty scathing criticisms of the 2011 vinyl version of DSOTM, so maybe it is true that quality control on this whole project wasn't what it should have been.<br /><br />As for the contents: I was very, very skeptical that anything here could surpass the 2003 SACD mixed for 5.1 by James Guthrie. Indeed, the disc labeled DVD-Audio didn't come close, in my opinion, or rather, just didn't sound to me like there was any noticeable improvement. I'm a surround geek; my system plays SACDs, DVD-Audio discs and blu-rays, including blu-ray audio. I've listened to a lot of surround mixes over the years despite the general failure of such formats in the marketplace.<br /><br />Without expecting much, I listened to the blu-ray audio disc included in the Immersion Box. I must say it has its own merits. As one of the band members points out in the 2003 documentary (I think it was Rick Wright), there are tubular bells on \\"Brain Damage.\\" I have good ears but I'd never heard them, even on the SACD version. I played back the DVD-A version of \\"Brain Damage\\" included here; still didn't ring any bells. But the blu-ray did. They're very faint, but I can hear them. And overall, the blu-ray mix is very, very good. Basic difference for me: I think the lows and mid-range are slightly superior on the SACD, with the highs being clearer on the blu-ray mix.<br /><br />That still wouldn't be enough for me to award this box four stars despite its shoddy packaging. But the inclusion of the quad mixes and Alan Parsons' alternate mix are definitely interesting to hear.<br /><br />You've got to be pretty crazy for the Floyd to buy this, but for those interested in the history and development of this album, there's enough here. Now, back to that packaging issue: Thank God, the powers that be corrected the problems with the Immersion version of \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"faint, but I can hear them.

B00H9KKKAY|5|If you didn't like this movie or were offended by it, this isn't for you. It's raunchy, it's funny. It's a man's movie, and I wouldn't expect less of Martin Scorcese. I'd recommend it to anyone with a pretty open mind and a good sense of humor. This isn't something you watch with your grandma. But overall, it's a great movie. Great acting, funny, and very entertaining.

B000OCXFCO|5|I am amazed they put out a really tight, musical album. <br />Not sure about Dave Mustaine's political statements though, they are quite foggy and just some 'infotaining', angry outbursts from a politically not very educated Mustaine to me. They are not necessarily nationalistic. He just seems indignant at conflicts happening today. <br />I'll overlook that, because this band will never be a political reference to me. I just want energetic, tight, melodic and gripping rock music. <br />I'm just so happy they still seem very dedicated to what they do best: play tight metal.  <br />This is awesome in comparison to the other very popular metal band which has just turned into bored fatigue; they are just some tired millionaires now.  <br />Thanks Dave !!  <br />We owe you a lot, you keep metal for a big audience alive. <br />Big cheers for not kneeling down to trends like the horrible 'nu-metal' or 'rap metal' and stuff like that. <br />You give us hope ! <br />Megadeth humiliates all other big metal bands in my eyes. <br />Real, great, precise, gripping metal !

0553296981|5|Rereading Anne Frank's diary, I was struck again by how alternately charming and haunting the book is. Charming in the way Anne describes her family relationships, friends, her feelings of love and the mundane details (and aggravations) of life in the secret annex. Haunting for its context and for the passages in which Anne writes about the  restrictions and horrors being meted out to Jews by the occupying Nazis. I guess I admire it for the reason most readers do. Anne's voice is so genuine. It's a delight to follow her innermost thoughts as she matures and wises up about people and life around her. It's also disturbing as she expresses concern about the danger closing in on them.<br /><br />Enhancing my second reading of \\"The Diary of a Young Girl\\" was Francine Prose's<br />[[ASIN:0061430803 Anne Frank: The Book, The Life, The Afterlife]]. It's an extended commentary on Anne, her diary, and the plays and movie based on her story. Prose sees Anne as more than just a girl who, under extraordinary circumstances, wrote a diary. She takes Anne seriously as a writer, a conscious literary artist who was editing and rewriting her work in the weeks before her arrest by the Nazis. Prose analyzes and provides more context to many scenes in the diary. Reading it alongside Anne's diary made the diary even more memorable.

B00KDHSNV8|4|One of the greatest love song writers of all time, Richard Marx comes up with a winner here. &#34;Whatever We Started&#34; had me hooked from the start. Like I heard him say in an interview recently, this is really a sensual CD, which is the theme throughout this masterpiece. I almost had to lock the door and turn out the lights, so no one would know I was listening to it. But, the songwriting is fantastic. I often wondered what his wife thought about all these graphic songs that appeared to be about other women. Being a songwriter myself, I know that would you write about is not actually about some particular person or place, so I hope she took it that way. Richard Marx is not one of those really outgoing artists, he just lets his awesome songwriting speak loudly in creativity.

In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such perfection that the map of a single province occupied the precincts of a city, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, these . . . maps no longer satisfied, so the guild of cartographers inked a map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire itself (one-to-one) . . . The following generations, who were less fond of cartography than their forebears had been, viewed the vast map as useless . . . and abandoned it to the inclemencies of sun and winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are tattered ruins of that Map, inhabited by beasts and beggars; across the breadth of the realm there is no other relic of the disciplines of Geography.\\"<br /><br />One-to-one. What a vision! Revoking Plato and Plotinus, to see things as they really are, not as they exist in the realm of pure forms and being!<br /><br />This box-set consists of Herbie's recordings from the mid-70s and early 80s. EMI had already remastered these recordings and skilfully so; the improvement here is minimal (if at all). More importantly, it's \\"one-to-one\\".

0465011047|5|Neither Laura Ling nor Euna Lee spent time in a North Korean labour camp, yet a boy and his family spent nearly ten years in such confinement from 1977 to 1987. The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag by Kang Chol-Hwan and Pierre Rigoulot tells the story of nine-year-old Kang and his family who were forced to uproot their lives with no advance notice and make the trip to the remote Yodok concentration camp.<br /><br />Kang's family's only crime was sharing the same household with his grandfather, whose crimes against the state remain a mystery. The grandfather was abducted at work and never saw his family again. We learn from Aquariums that he was sent to a more brutal concentration camp, where he later died. Meanwhile, everyone who shared the same household as the \\"counterrevolutionary\\" grandfather had to pay the price of cohabiting with a rebel to the state. The entire extended family, including uncles and children, regardless of age, were sent to Yodok. Aquariums contains one family photo at the front of the book, and when I read the caption I honestly thought that there must have been a printing error, since the caption read: \\"Author (right), age 19, one year after his release from the Yodok labor camp...\\". I did not believe, nor could I imagine, that North Korea would send a child to a labour camp. I thought that the age must have been wrong; surely Kang was 29 in the photo and not 19. As I read Aquariums I soon realized that the caption was accurate and Kang, as well as his then seven-year-old sister, both suffered for a decade in a concentration camp.<br /><br />The suffering endured by the family, and the children especially, will break your heart. There were times when I was afraid to turn the page for fear of what barbaric brutality the children would suffer, or witness, next. Not since American Psycho have I been so fearful of turning a page: and this is a true story. The family lived in a small cabin and barely survived on starvation rations of corn. And only corn. Thus deficiency diseases prevailed, like pellagra, and the family supplemented their diet by catching rats, salamanders, worms and insects, which in turn cured their pellagra.<br /><br />Yodok life was nonstop work and Party indoctrination. Children under fifteen went to morning school, where they learned quickly that the teachers didn't care for them. The students could quite easily preoccupy themselves silently with something else during class, or even doze off, and the teachers couldn't be bothered. Since Kang's school life before Yodok involved listening to and memorizing speeches by the Great Leader Kim Il Sung, he did not find such Party indoctrination at Yodok out of the ordinary. The savagery inflicted upon the students in the labour camp after class, however, had the opposite effect of what the Party indoctrination hoped to accomplish:<br /><br />\\"A couple of years was all it took for the camp to utterly change a child. Instead of turning us into stalwart admirers of our Great Leader's regime, as it was intended to do, the camp taught us how to rebel, jeer, and mock anything vaguely whiffing of authority. Within a year or two of arriving, a prisoner lost every scintilla of respect he might have had for the Party. Our disdain spread like gangrene, beginning with the guards, then slowly, inexorably, making its way up to the great leaders.\\"<br /><br />One was constantly watched at the camp, and not only by armed guards, but also by fellow prisoners, who were compelled to \\"snitch\\" on their neighbours. Those who were selected to be snitches could not refuse, and although they were supposed to be invisible and blend in with the inmates, it did not take a long time for camp residents to figure out who among them was telling the authorities. Everyone had to watch what he said and learned that the best thing to do was to say nothing, no matter how innocuous a remark might seem. When Kang sees a woman crying over a recently deceased relative, he writes:<br /><br />\\"...I came across a group of people from my village standing around a woman who was loudly weeping and venting her sorrows about something. As I joined the crowd, I gathered she was lamenting the death of a relative, whose body was apparently still in the family hut. \\"Ah, why did you die so quickly?\\" she kept saying. \\"Why did you depart this cursed world?\\" The unhappy woman must not have noticed that a well-known snitch was in the crowd, as well as the leader of one of the work brigades. Her son, who was also there, saw the danger and tried desperately to catch her eye. It took him a while, but he finally did it, at which point the mother did a complete turnabout. \\"Oh,\\" she continued without the slightest transition, \\"why did you leave this world, which had become so happy under the wise governance of our Great Leader?\\" No one dared to laugh, but after that, neither could anyone cry.\\"<br /><br />Children were made to attend public executions and participate in the stoning of deceased hanged corpses. Public executions also included death by firing squad and Kang's accounts of these experiences will turn your stomach.<br /><br />In spite of the daily horror of concentration camp life, Kang managed a rare smile in his ten years of incarceration. I will quote a paragraph that, while disgusting in content, produced a literal rolling-on-the-ground laughing episode:<br /><br />\\"I remember another informant at Yodok whose specialty was snitching on kids. Once, we decided to exact our revenge by setting a trap for him at a spot he crossed several times a day. There, we dug a hole resembling the fugitive trap we had once discovered up in the mountains. In place of sharpened stakes, we filled the ditch with excrement from the latrines. The trick seemed easy and risk free. As luck had it, the infamous Wild Boar came along first and wound up burying his foot ankle-deep in feces. We saw the whole thing from our little hiding place, and now had every reason to try to keep our location secret; but our teacher was so outraged and was having such a hard time extricating himself from the mess that we just couldn't restrain ourselves. We started laughing so hard we cried. Within a minute he had us collared and was giving us the thrashing of a lifetime. When he was done, he ordered us to scoop out all the excrement by hand and carry it over to the neighbouring garden plots, where it would serve as fertilizer for the guards' summer vegetables. The abominable chore took days, during which time several of us saw our hands break out in strange-looking pimples and blisters.\\"<br /><br />Kang and his family are released from Yodok after ten years, and the final third of the book deals with his life as a civilian and as a former political prisoner in North Korea. He and a friend listened to contraband South Korean radio and local snitches inform the authorities, which leads Kang and his friend to make the decision to escape to China. The crime of listening to Southern radio is a sentence to a labour camp, and since Kang and his friend were already both former camp detainees, if they are reapprehended they would face a more brutal concentration camp, from where no one is ever released, or death by execution.<br /><br />It is suspenseful to read about Kang's escape into China, and of his travels throughout China on the underground railroad. Since travel within North Korea is severely restricted even to its own citizens, Kang could not access the northern border region without causing suspicion. Kang fortunately came from a wealthy family and he used his money to bribe North Korean guards, train conductors and ordinary people. According to Kang, the entire North Korean regime is run by greased palms, and by this form of corruption, it is more \\"capitalist\\" than the Southern regime the Kim dynasty despises.<br /><br />Aquariums is a translation from the original French and translator Yair Reiner made the story sound so alive and full of adolescent phraseology that I would never have guessed that its original language was not English. I recommend The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag, which is so far the only first-hand account of life in a North Korean labour camp.was so outraged and was having such a hard time extricating himself from the mess that we just couldn't restrain ourselves.

B002BSHXJA|3|Having had the time now to compare both the 'stereo' and mono releases of the Beatles catalog, I can safely say, I wished they were better.    My first real complaint is with the media as a whole, be it video or audio. The buzz word 'remaster' usually makes a person 'sweat with anticipation', and gets them to think that 'the ultimate version of (fill in the blank) has finally arrived. But there's several things to consider too.    Usually what I've found with the word 'remaster' of any product I've purchased is simply this - and this alone,' it just means 'they did something to it.' (Whoever 'they' may be.) So now we come to the Beatles catalog.     Are they 'remastered?' Yes, the stereo versions have been 'tinkered with,' no question about that. Are the mono versions 'remastered?' That's questionable.     The main thing about both of these sets is this. They are new transfers. And yes, they are better then the '87 releases - noticeably.    But other than the 'stereo' versions being better transfers, and of course they did some EQ work on them, as well as added some limiting to make them louder, I can't call either one of these box sets 'the ultimate.'     The new stereo versions are indeed better transfers then the previous releases as well as the mono versions. This is the unifying likeness of box sets.     There are many good observations by costumers on here already. The 'Cheapskates Guide' is very well thought out and put together. I have seen many other reviews here as well that anyone considering purchasing one of these sets should read. One memorable review I read that the listener noticed 'a lot of 'artifacts' as he put it. He is absolutely correct.     As I read some of the interviews with the audio engineers, one of their comments was 'we did very little to the tracks, if anything.' And the truth is I would believe his comment after careful listening. In one of the interviews I read one of the engineers commented about using some minor 'editing' to cleanup a 'hard low end plosive' (pop), but again they mentioned they did not do that much to the new transfers.     Personally, I'm very surprised at what the audio guys did NOT do. And yep, there's a lot of 'dirt' that could be 'righteously cleaned' to improve the tracks. BUT ... there in itself is a hot button (so to speak) with people. And that in itself whenever you 'remotely hint' at anything resembling the 'dreaded monster of 'noise reduction' people usually panic. So someone made the decision to use very little - if any at all on these new releases. (If I recall correctly, only about 5 minutes total for the entire catalog, and even that was no more than minor spots that I'm more than sure it was bad enough 'something had to be done.')    I personally don't think they did much of anything to the mono set. And right out of the gate for me there are tons of things I can hear that tell me this. Yep, like one reviewer said, 'lots of 'artifacts.' there is plenty of pops left, and lots of 'crackle' too. Most noticeably to me the 'graininess of the vocals' at times. So you 'die hard purests' that are 'afraid they did something' to 'your Beatles' mono set - fear not. And if they did, I can assuredly tell you since I own them - I sure wish they had done a lot more.     A good reviewer mentioned that the mono set is 'bottom heavy.' He is correct too. They are. Sometimes it's great for that particular track though. Other times it's just too much and makes the track 'muddy sounding.' Sure, it does add that 'bottom end punch', and man that can make a big difference to the right track. But with a track that is predominately 'acoustic', too much is just too much. (Rubber Soul comes to mind) But then you're faced with some 'gawd awful fake stereo' on the 'stereo version' of that CD. If you don't stand in the middle of the stereo field, it's tolerable, but if you do, it just nothing but annoying with that 'hard pan left / hard pan right' non-sense. (Personal preference noted here- of course).    As a whole though, I can say I do prefer the mono set over the stereo. But I say this with 'some' reservation too. The stereo mix of Penny Lane (which has always been a favorite of mine), is more pleasant to listen to then the mono version. So at best, I can't tell anyone 'one set' is better then the other, as in 'stereo vs. mono.' To me it's a 'mixed' bag, but again, I lean toward the mono set.     I can't give these set a 'glowing 'recommendation.' If you want a better then you got (as in the '87 releases), you will get that sonically.     But if you want something as absolutely wonderful as the REAL REMASTERS of 'Yellow Submarine' and/or the 'Love' CD - you won't find them in these sets. George & Giles Martin (and Geoff Emerick too I think), did an amazing job with the Yellow Submarine CD that was released about the same time as when the movie was re-released. (Which by the way does constitute for a 'real remaster' of a movie too.) The 'Love' CD, won a Grammy Award, so I'm not the only one to applaud the work done on that one.    So, my complaint only with the EMI, APPLE ... OR ANY OTHER COMPANY that claims 'remaster' - be honest enough to tell people - yeah we did something to it ... but they are still dirty looking ... dirty sounding ... and never got any PRISTINE RESTORATION WORK done on them. Oh sure, we EQ'd them. Oh sure, we made them louder, oh sure we made the picture darker, oh sure we fiddled with the sound ....     But to call it a 'remaster' ... if it was a bad track to begin with .. or a bad print that needs RESTORATION done to it ... just doesn't cut it at all with me anymore.     Which bring me to a close on this. Except for one final point. I have no idea why Apple said 'it took four years' to get these box sets out. The artwork? The legal hassles? I don't know. But to me when a audio engineer tells me 'they did very little to the tracks' and I can tell they didn't, why promote them as such, as if to imply the entire audio team spent that kind of time making these possible. (?) If Apple says that, then you gave the audio guys some very very long tea breaks, (Since Abbey Road studios in England.)     At any rate, I do lean toward the mono's on several things, but even those tracks could have been much better.     I have no doubt - friends and neighbors - we have not seen the last of the phrase 'newly remastered' ... and I sure hope Giles Martian gets on board here, even if he can't get his dad out of retirement.     Help us 'Obi Wan Martin' - you're our only hope! (And please bring Geoff Skywalker with you !) What we REALLY WANT is to see Apple REMIX ANYTHING THEY CAN .. with whatever is left ... from the master tapes. AND to do that 'righteously' ... ALL the master tapes need FULL RESTORATION work done on them. (Did I YELL THAT LOUD ENOUGH! ... (hehe!)    Am I glad I got the mono set, sure. But again, I wished they'd been better.    Take care all, and enjoy what we got for now.

B001EAWME2|5|The movie Halloween(1978) by John Carpenter is usually regarded as the grandaddy of all the slasher films. The reality is that Halloween borrowed a lot from this Canadian classic. Everyone look at the opening scenes of Black Christmas and compare them to Halloween. The camera is placed on the killer, we get the killer's pov. In Black Christmas we see the killer \\"Billy\\" climbing up the wall and finding his way into the sorority house. Much the same way that we see the killer's pov in the opening of Halloween. In fact the beginning AND ending of both films are almost EXACTLY the same. I've talked about the beginning, now the ending. In both movies the endings have open-ended endings where the killer is still around, still intact after the entire movie is over, alive to kill another day and in another movie.     Halloween went on to become a franchise but Black Christmas was for the most part forgotten. It has gotten more credit recently and there was even an unnecessary remake in 2006. But the original from 1974 remains one of the best horror movies ever made. This movie is great due to its plot, direction and cast. The cast includes a young Olivia Hussey and a young Margot Kidder as sorority sisters. The cast includes the rest of the sisters as well as some of their boyfriends and their hilarious sorority mom. The sorority mom, Mrs Mac(played by Marian Waldman), is a wonderful character. She is a foul-mouthed alcoholic mom who runs a pretty loose ship. But the sisters seem to love her anyway! The sorority girls have a lot in common with Mrs Mac especially Margot Kidder's character, Barb, Barb is also an obscene drunk. She goes to a police station and fools a dimwitted cop into writing a sexually explicit word into his report. Barb also gives alcohol to a little kid that the sisters have agreed to host for a Christmas party! Olivia Hussey's character is the straight-laced Jess, who has problems of her own. Jess is pregnant, her boyfriend is a wannabe concert pianist who seems a little un-hinged. For a while it looks like he is our killer \\"Billy\\".     Black Christmas does a great job of developing its killer Billy. Billy is deeply disturbed and he shows it by constantly calling the sorority house and making bizarre obscene calls. Billy is much more frightening than the slashers who came later like Michael Myers and Jason from Friday the 13th. Billy is very believable. There is nothing really supernatural about him. What's really scary about Billy is that he seems as smart as he is crazy! He brazenly kills women right in front of the cops' collective noses, yet they are helpless to stop him.       Black Christmas is the Grandaddy of All Slasher Films. It is a much scarier movie than all the slasher films that came after it too. It is a very creepy and atmospheric movie  that is good for multiple viewings. In fact you want to get a copy of this film in the format of your choice just as soon as you can. It deserves a place in the library of any film buff as a very important part of film history.

6305736650|5|This is one of the greatest movies of the \\"good war\\" and all times. I have seen it a lot of times. The DVD came in an excellent condition and in time. Thanks! I know what I am talking about because in my 73 years old I have been journalist and writer. I am Juan Alborna-Salado but some friends call me \\"the Cuban American Hemingway\\".  Juan
B00FEMJF6O|3|For the most part it is ok. But some times the amount of stuff your need for earning stuff it a little to much. That and needing so many crowns for other stuff is way to steep .
B00HGE90Z4|5|Excellent, can't wait to see Season 2, whenever that will be.
B0066W1AZK|4|I liked this app well enough, but I replaced it with a paid version so I could avoid the ads.
B004SIIBGU|5|Excellent application. Well organized, easy to use.
1250012570|3|It took nine chapters for me to want to keep reading. Normally I give up by the first if I'm not hooked but all the rave reviews kept me pushing through it. I loved Park's character. I felt nothing much for Eleanor and she was the one I should have really felt for. The relationship was well done and I felt how much they loved each other, but I disliked that she ignored him for an entire year that was jammed into about three pages of prose, and her reason for doing so was nonexistent. The ending was terrible. Why would she wait a year to send a post card that said what it did and why would he read it?
B00C4Y4434|5|Always love Lagoona,
B00APUQT7I|1|The first one was entertaining. The second was passable entertainment.  The third one was just too many.  The fourth one was a foregone conclusion.  My daughter liked it, for some reason, and her taste in movies is not usually questionable but in this case, I'm not sure what she was thinking. Maybe she was sleepy and wasn't really watching.  If she was, she probably would have hated it like I did.
B007J4T2G8|4|Somewhat disappointing.  Did not live up to all the hoopla.
B007X4ECLY|4|A pretty good movie to watch with marginal acting in some cases...But I recommend this flick anyway....
B000069HK2|5|Ok. To start off: Every song on this CD is rockin', but not for everyone. It's a shame they're not number one on the album chart, because there is NO other band that I like EVERY song of theirs. <br />Maybe Memories: 95% This is an awesome song, very hard rock that most people will love.<br />The Taste OF Ink: 84% Great soft song at first, but gets old soon and once it does you'll likely never listen to it.<br />Bulimic: 96% Possibly the best song on the CD because of understandable screaming and awesome, touching lyrics.<br />Say Days Ago: 94% Hard! I really like this song, lots of screaming, yet you know exactly what Bert is saying.<br />Poetic Tragedy: 90% Hard song, full of screaming, and has a limited appeal. I really like it though because of great vocals.<br />Buried Myself Alive: 87% Hard and soft at the same time. Heavy guitar and soft vocals make a surprisingly good combination. Constant radio play knocked it down about 5 percent though, sadly.<br />A Box Full Of Sharp Objects: 85% Pretty much all screaming with some great lyrics, sadly you can't hear most of them, so I found myself at lyrics.com reading and saying: \\"Wow, this would be an even better song if you could hear it.\\" Great though, good tune.<br />Blue and Yellow: 96% I'm a sucker for soft songs like this, but you might like the harder stuff on the album, so it isn't for everyone. I love it, and its one of the best tracks on this CD in my opinion. \\"Rather waste some time with you..\\"<br />Greener With The Scenery: 93% Great slow song with lyrics you can seriously relate to, unless you're a 12 year old cheerleader that is into N*Sync.        <br />Noise And Kisses: 97% I really love this hard/soft song it has such... real lyrics. And it's just so awesome in the tune, the lyrics, everything.        <br />On My Own: 89% Good song. Not a cheerful song, but a pretty good one. Depressing and slow, but thats not necessarily a bad thing, and in this case, it's a good thing.       <br />Pieces Mended: 90%I'm not too crazy about this song but I must say it has some of the best lyrics in ANY song but the tune doesn't bring it together like it could.<br />Choke Me: 92% Hidden Track that you hear about maybe 9 minutes into Pieces Mended. Awesomely hard song that you can't understand half the time, but something you can really can bang heads to.    <br />In conclusion, the worst song on this CD gets 84% and that is awesome, because it's still an adaquetely good song (The Taste Of Ink.) And since that's the worst, the good is REALLY good. And it's all good on this CD. I would honestly pay 50 bucks for it, and since Amazon is offering it at a MUCH lower price GET IT!
B00R2LTNL2|1|Once again I could not watch it after purchasing. When you performed system test, the first step would show download speeds of around 6 meg, when it went to loading it took forever then it would come back with the statement it was my fault and I needed to check my internet connection.<br /><br />Turned off router for a bit, turned back on, no change.<br /><br />The same exact trouble occurred with Blacklist Seasons 1 & 2, none of the tricks worked. (actually got a few of the season episodes off Black List Season 1 BUT several times on each episode it would quit then reload and eventually play, but show would be interrupted. NOT  enjoyable, far to frustrating.<br /><br />The Hobbit wouldn't even start, just said my internet connection was to slow, by the way it runs consistently at 6meg.<br /><br />After so much frustration and not able to find problems with download speed and did not find any.<br /><br />I went to VUDU and downloaded all three with HDX and had zip problems NONE at all.<br /><br />I think your servers are swamped and we are paying for the fact with frustration and MONEY<br /><br />AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE CREDIT MY ACCOUNT FOR ALL 3 VIDEO'S DEFINED.
B000G8NY4U|5|I have, for a long time now, been a hearted fan of Yanni's work and I was fortunately enough to assist to his openning presentation of this concert US tour and still  today my companion on the occasion and I treasure that concert as one of our most memorable experiences. It has been a mile stone in our lives ever since. When the presentation ended, we left the arena in a complete silence, hand in hand, as if we were still holding in that grasp all the unexplainable emotions experienced while the music and the lights were rushing within us through our eyes and ears. That is why when this DVD came out we gave one each as a present and a token of remembrance. I simply recommend this production to any music lover.
B0000640VN|5|This is my favorite romantic movie of all times. Actually it is from this movie I found out who Hugh Jackman is. Never heard of him before. (I know, shame on me). I know it is a modern movie in a modern setting but there is something about it that makes me miss the olden times and the way how men used to be, so respectful, gentle and considerate. After watching this move, modern guys just don't appeal in the same way. Eeeh, I fell in love with Leopold. It's very light hearted movie that I can watch over and over and over.
B00L7PJE4A|4|Works great.
B00IU0M85C|5|the main actress is fabulous- so talented playing multiple roles. it is a must watch. Loved it! It is a very interesting story line.
B00KGRFV92|1|I would have liked something with realistic battle and living, but without the sex scene pandering. Not something you can watch with the kids.
B00133KFGW|5|This is not just a \\"chic\\" flick.  After my 27 year old son recommended it, I watched it with my husband and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is a beautiful story to be enjoyed many times.
B00MNYTWMI|5|I like that I can play often and not have to buy a thing.  The art is awesome too.
B001IWV030|5|One of my old time sit back and relax with Peter Falk! Love Peter Falk in most of his movies and more so as Detective Columbo.<br />I would highly recommend it!
B004XVN1T4|3|Good read but I much prefer his German tales. Jackdaws is one of my all time favorite fictional stories of WWII. Triple was good just not great...
B00FKF0F3C|2|I love Ken Follett, so I read the three books. One and two were brilliant. Three (this one) attempted to cover the basics of the last half of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Way too much on the John Kennedy years, and on the Maria affair. No mention of 9/11 at all, meaning no mention of the criminal activity of the Bush/Chaney alliance in lying us into a war. Any idiot off the street (myself included) could have predicted the outcome of removing Saddam Hussein from power (namely that worse religious tyrants would take over and destroy Iraq and millions of innocents). This should have been addressed at least to some extent.<br /><br />There was a feeble attempt to bring together the children of the original main characters, but it went nowhere. That could have been an intriguing ending, but it really felt like Follett was pushed to finish the book and get it on the market. He didn't have time to weave the characters together.<br /><br />I really thought the Hans Hoffmann appearance with Rebecca toward the end of the book was nothing more than absolute useless stupidity, kind of like the Maria affair with John Kennedy, only worse. To what end?<br /><br />And what happened to Erik von Ulrich?<br /><br />Overall, the book lacked the depth and realness of the first two. Will I read his next books. Absolutely! Like I said, I love KF :)
0618680004|5|Dwarkins main criticism of religion seems to be an aesthetic one. He tells the stories of a number of people who brought up as Catholics were tormented by the irrationality of the notion of hell either for themselves or others. He sees religion as a form of child abuse which seeks to close the mine of children and to stop them being thinkers. Linked to this is that religion is trying to make a come back to public life. In the east some followers of Islam have been trying to set up theocratic states. In Afghanistan under the Taliban the death penalty was instituted for homosexuals and art works of great antiquity were destroyed for religious reasons. In America the most religious of the western democracies a powerful religious block has been trying to re-stigmatize homosexuality, ban abortion and peddle the anti rational doctrine of creationism.  <br /> <br />Most of the works either arguing for atheism or against religious belief come from philosophers. One prominent atheist is for instance Michael Martin who has written what are rather technical works suggesting that religious thought is irrational. Dwarkins is a scientist by trade and his book is more approachable than those of the philosophical tradition. Like most of these works it will probably read not by the target audience but by those who are skeptics or unbelievers. When they read the book it will give them comfort and bolster their self confidence but one does not imagine it converting many of the believers.  <br /> <br />The book covers a number of issues but broadly these are: <br /> <br />1. Is a belief in God rational? <br />2. Why do people believe in God? <br />3. Is morality possible without God? <br />4. What is wrong with believing in God? <br /> <br />In the middle ages Christian philosophers came up with a number of proofs of God's existence based on deductive reasoning. These \\" proofs\\" were pretty much sidelined when philosophy was over time shown to be a valueless enterprise. The developmentof inductive reasoning produced advances in human knowledge which actually were useful. Medicine nowdays can help people. The medicine developed by Galen based on deductive reasoning was either ineffectual or helped kill people. The ancient and medieval theories of the universe of the nature of combustion and matter were all simply wrong. In the same way the old proofs of God are in the words of Karl Popper empty essentialism. Dwarkins actually tried to argue that the old proofs are wrong according to their own logic. This is not bad but one wonders why bother. He then tries to argue that the notion of God is illogical because it is basically an attempt to explain things for which there is a better explanation. If we look at things we have an explanation for the existence of plants and animals. It is evolution and evolution is backed up by evidence. The suggestion that a powerful being did it all is more likely to be a man made myth than a logical presumption. Later in the book Dwarkins also argues more strongly that the basis of religion is a dualist notion of identity. That is that what we are is not a body but a soul which operates a body. The soul lives and the body dies. However it is simply more logical to think that our identity is brought about by our body and there is no soul. If this is the case there is no afterlife and no God. <br /> <br />Being an evolutionist Dwarkins is worried about the belief in God. Evolutionists are of the view that societies are in competition and that useless things should count against you. He thus goes on a bit about why people believe in religion. He comes up with the answer that one of the skills of humans is the ability for us to learn skills so that we can deal with situations using learned knowledge. Our parents thus teach us things like don't touch hot stoves, don't jump into lion's cages and the like. We tent do accept these sorts of things and they become internalized. Dwarkins suggests that whilst we internalize thesethings we can also pick up useless bits of knowledge like sacrifice some goats every spring or it won't rain.  <br /> <br />Dwarkins is on stronger ground when he argues about religion and morality. Modern religion is not that old. Christianity is about 2,000 years old Buddism a bit older , Islam rather younger with Hinduism being the oldest. Prior to the development of these religions belief systems about gods were not tied up with morals. Yet it is clear that morality existed thus is pre-dates religious systems. Dwarkins goes on to argue that the actual morality that is practiced in societies is at variance with scriptural teachings and gives some good examples.  <br />In talking about what is wrong with believing in God he talks about the effect on children and runs his child abuse argument while at the same time talking about what may would see as the excesses of religion. The people who kill abortion doctors, the Taliban and Catholic teaching orders who were cruel to the children they taught.  <br /> <br />Overall the book starts a bit slow but it is more readable than the usual books produced by the philosophy school.  <br />
B00278U1W0|4|This is a one of a kind video that belongs in the collection of anyone who loves Rock n' Roll.
B003Y5D776|5|Was a little non-trivial to set up my guitar/headphone setup but once I got it, works like a charm. Ended up not using it though, I just got an amp.
B002MQYOFW|5|I finished this book within two days, I just couldn't put it down! Left me excited to get into the next books. Probably will re-read. 5 stars is not enough!
B007SGLZP8|5|I always love a Grisham novel.  This one keeps you guessing from beginning to end.  Great story, Great characters, good story.
0062515675|4|With due respect to Eckhart Tolle and the inimitable Oprah, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari is every bit as awakened and a lot more fun to read than A New Earth which is getting such \\"press.\\" In The Monk Who Sold, the teller of the story, the main character and the reader embark on the same journey at the same time and so the story has an immediacy akin to a spiritual event. Not at all pedantic and yet thought-provoking, the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari teaches non-demominational wisdom that's accessible and timely.
B007N6EUHI|1|HUGE FILE, Very expensive app & not all inclusive.
B004BSFC46|5|I bought these for my 4 month old son for Christmas and he LOVES them! They keep him entertained for hours at a time and doesn't irritate his delicate skin! I love the fact that he can hear them rattle, but it's soft enough to where it doesn't annoy me or my husband! Very satisfied with my purchase!
B0092D1V5Y|1|totally useless. I can't believe I even downloaded this useless thing. I guess I was bored or something. Who knows!
1577311523|5|I find it intriguing how this book has garnered many responses at opposite extremes -- either people loved it, or they hated it. I have to admit that when I first picked it off the bookshelf, I put it right back. To look at things from the perspective that my mind could be my own worst enemy was, to say the least, quite intimidating. <br />But being the counselor I am, I recognized a response in myself that I see all the time in therapy: the \\"don't go there\\" shutdown clients sometimes go into when you get too close to the root of a problem. <br />Eckhart Tolle \\"goes there\\". He reveals the mind for what it truly is. No, it's not something we need to get rid of, and in fact it helps us immensely in the appropriate situations. But the problem is, it often takes over. It drowns out the Real You with its incessant chatter. It runs amok and is capable of causing all sorts of misery. Only if you can see through this, and recognize the mind for what it truly is, can you break through and find enlightenment. <br />It's not easy to accept. No one said the truth was easy. But if you are ready for it, Eckhart Tolle and The Power of Now definitely deliver the truth. Face it if you dare, and watch your life change for the better. I highly recommend this fascinating book.
B00HV2KPNW|5|A beautiful Disney film with a complex and rewarding story. Frozen's plot is much darker than one would expect from a Disney film, with many tragic moments and unexpected twists, but the ending is rewarding. With lessons on love, trust, and the importance of family, Frozen satisfies the need for wholesome childhood entertainment, but has plenty to offer for the adults in the room, and keeps everyone entertained with a stunning and catchy soundtrack.<br /><br />In my opinion, one of the best Disney films in recent memory. Definitely worth a watch.
B0077ATSU4|1|This movie was horrible. Stick to the book! The movie was filled with worthless scenes of an annoying little boy trying to connect with his dead father. The book was a billion times better and I hate reading! What does that tell you?
B00688628M|4|This series allowed you to experience to a large degree what E company did during WWII. My son would not want to wait til another night for the next episode. We liked it allot.
0316010669|5|This is probably the best book (rather I listened to the unabridged audio version) on RC I have come across.<br /><br />I am regularly talking to clients about rapid cognition or rather gut feelings because they are so important and so many people reject their own and live to regret it. Malcolm Gladwell takes a laymans approach to a technical subject and hits bulls eye after bulls eye.<br /><br />If you want to know why you sometimes make brilliant snap decisions and how valuable that ability can be, read this book.
B00ARI9CDQ|5|I love this product.  I like to keep up to date on all kinds of news and this product gives it to me.  Thanks so much.
B008OW1S3O|5|...on the fantastic KEXP channel on You Tube. A live performance of this great record that may just blow your socks off or at least just appreciate proper talent.
B009O2XY12|5|I love this game. It is great. I think this will be great for long car rides and tripped. I totally recommend this for your young ones. Unlike other free games this one has every thing unlocked.
B006LSZECO|4|I loved this novel for it's creative intensity. It took a couple of chapters to get into the writer's style, but once I did, I was hooked. Yes, I know people are giving it mix reviews because of the ending. *No Spoilers Here* Also, readers think all the characters are unlikable. I agree, they are. But it's the story that is likable in my opinion.<br /><br />As a screenwriter, I love to read books before I see the movie versions to see how they are adapted. And I personally can't wait to see how they do this one! The rhythm of each chapter perfectly timed out as we bounce from Nick to Amy's point of view was simply incredible.<br /><br />I didn't like the novel length 415 pages, really? There was some mind-numbing details that should have been edited out. And the character's dialogues were at time unbelievable. I'm sorry, people just don't talk like that in real life. But I'm giving it 4 stars because, it was so well planned out. The timing in each scene was exquisite.
B001ACH4DS|4|I really am enjoying the David Cook CD.  I rooted for him on American Idol and was so excited when he won.  I am definitely not disappointed with his CD.  It's a great mix of songs and his voice is amazing.  I love the songs, especially \\"Permanent\\".  It's a beautiful tribute to his brother.  Overall... it's an excellent CD and I look forward to his next one.
B009A9EPLM|5|I ordered this CD based on the movie trailers I'd seen.  It arrived promptly - two days before I saw the movie. It was a good price and I've enjoyed it several times  I'd recommend this to anyone who is a John Williams fan and to any history buff.  In fact, I've already recommended the CD and Amazon to several people.
0385528787|4|I'd read the rest of the trilogy years ago, so this was somewhat ponderous at times. Worth the effort- not as good as ORYC and CRAKE
B000BTC5LW|5|Growing up in the 60's and 70's one only wondered when man would be able to achieve quality sound reproduction as in the recording studio. Finally, man has broken through in the field of sound technology! To the young people of today, watch this. This is what its all about! CREATIVITY!!!not the excrement for the ears which the corporations are dishing out to you! This dvd is incredible!  Words cannot express the feeling that the brain receives when it gets musical nourishment! All Pink Floyd fans unite. This is a must have, to enjoy over and over again!<br />What a pity there are no groups with the caliber of Pink Floyd to take the advantage of this unique sound technology we have today!
B008LD09LS|4|Please update  to 2.4  to slow on iPhone 3gs  having  issues with the iPhone working properly  please update soon  but still works great so  four stars
B00H58VGIA|4|I wish there was at 4+ or 4.5 star. I'm not an avid reader, yet after being invited to join a book club I decided to read this novel. I did a bit of research (with Oprah's notes or without them) and I chose the version which included her comments IF I chose to read them. This was a good decision for me. The book was easy to read, had good cadence, and wonderfully descriptive. I was deep into the story when on June 17, 2015, the nine people of the AME Church were murdered. It was surreal to be watching the news and hear &#34;Denmark Vessey&#34; referenced! OMG! He's a character in the book I'm reading!  So sad. I will never forget this book because that awful day.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because  . . .  because . . . although it was a wonderful story and well written; it just didn't WOW me!  I suppose I believe a rating of  5 gold stars should knock my socks off! This book was interesting, quick, easy and comfortable. It didn't knock my socks off.  I do hope you'll read it, if for no other reason that to learn about Charleston, SC.
B008EZVNO0|3|This CD is the perfect definition of something to put on and kick back to after you've had an especially rough day at work, and you want nothing more than to unwind with a gin-and-tonic, either at home or in a bar down the street from your workplace before heading home.  Nothing wrong with that, if that's all you want fom a Van CD.  Van's voice is still an instrument of wonder, but it's become quite obvious --- the days of musically challenging, thought-provoking work like the 'Astral Weeks', 'Moondance', 'St. Dominic's Preview' and 'Into the Music' albums are well behind Van.  This is lounge jazz-pop bordering on muzak.  What saves it (as usual) is Van's voice.  But there's nothing to really grasp on to here.  Whereas Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Neil Young still release albums that are thought-provoking work, Van has settled into being a sort-of white, B.B. King-like elder statesman.  That's OK if you you view music as wallpaper background for your day.  If you want something beyond that, however, this will inevitably disappoint.  It's not a bad album.  But by Van standards, it could have been much more.
B000002AGE|5|You buy it originally on vinyl, then get a tape to take in the car.  When it comes out on CD, you buy the CD. Okay, then I found a copy in a used record store and grabbed it to keep in the car.  That's what happened with me and \\"Heavy Weather.\\"     \\"Birdland\\" drew me into the CD, but there's so much more than this one song to listen to.  Weather Report's not just jazz, but a fusion of rock and African music.      \\"Heavy Weather\\" is the first jazz I ever bought and still some of the best.
B00HPYMVD8|4|Nice to see some new bad guys feature. Ie North Koreans. It felt like there were some irrelevant sub plots, but this did not detract from a really fun read. Although the book got to be a bit predictable towards the end it was certainly entertaining and cannot wait for the next one in the series.
B008133MDK|5|I really enjoy the show. Once you start Im sure u will get caught up and see one after the other
B003H4I4JU|4|Very different from &#34;Ender's Game&#34;, even though it shares some of its main characters and takes place on the same fictional universe, &#34;Ender's Game&#34; is basically an exemplary young adult, fairly action packed sci-fi story with &#34;a sprinkling&#34; of philosophy and real world history, whereas &#34;Speaker for the dead&#34; still has a good plot and its share of sci-fi, but it has a slower pace and is CENTERED on values, morals issues, prejudice, and philosophy.<br /><br />In my opinion, the way the author depicts some aspects of the future 3,000 years hence require an important concession on the reader’s part to achieve suspension of disbelief, for example: the way mankind is organized is simply to straightforward, instead of countries you get planets, but still Portuguese, Scandinavian, etc. planets… some rules forcing civility towards &#34;outsiders&#34; but no integration or cosmopolitanism.<br /><br />I've enjoyed both books very much, but being as different as they are, I think some people that relished one could very well not like the other.
B00000JY1X|5|I saw the Magnetic Fields at Bumbershoot here in Seattle back over Labor Day weekend, not really knowing what I was going to see.  I had heard a couple of songs off of older albums that were entertaining, but a little too synth-y for my taste.<br />The show consisted almost entirely of songs from &quot;69 Love Songs&quot; (at least as far as I can tell) and I was completely taken in by the range of sounds, the great singing, and the humorous and introspective (if somewhat morbid) lyrics.  There are plenty of bits that stick happily in your head for weeks.  I highly recommend these albums -- there is not a weak one in the box.<br />I wish I could think of other groups to compare them with, but I can't really.  They share a slight bit of humor (and some low male singing) with Morphine, but the musical style is completely different.  I guess you'll just have to click on the various samples above to hear for yourself...
B001KQZ7I8|5|Enjoyed.  Well written. A psycohology foundation book.
B00FB13Y74|3|I liked this for the first few times I played it but I soon realized that the amount I could play was very limited without spending more money.
B00AC8ZIXO|4|I have not had time to finish watching the whole story but it is set up well so far and I look forward to finishing it soon.
B00EGMQIJ0|2|Disappointed with the writing in The Circle. Eggers is better than this. It's a valid, contemporary premise and the underlying point of the story should resonate for any \\"thinking\\" person on Facebook, Twitter, etc. regularly. But at times the storytelling seems more like an absurd comedy than Orwellian profundity. Worth reading but keep quality expectations minimal.
B00CHSPB8Y|5|this app is amazing very good graphics not able to put it down it is a very fun app makes the movie Evan more desirable very good app.
B001NLKT60|4|A really good read.  Should have seen movie or read book, &#34;Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34;, before reading this book.  Seeing the movie really helped visualize the primary characters.
B00CSR2J9I|5|Great addictive and totally fun game. Play it all the time love it great for free time and when you are board and sick of other games.
B00992CF6W|5|Man so gooooooooooodddddddddd!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|3|My grandson likes this.  Was visiting him and he took my kindle and found this game and really enjoyed it.
B00JND1LQW|5|I got this as a faotd...super fun...not so hard that you give up...no annoying ads...give it a try...you will seriously love it
B007KZY1YY|5|I wastold the book was good so i bought it and it is very good I want to read the others book from E J James
B002SSBD6W|3|Its very insightful and made me eat meat only once a week. And I no longer eat sausages or ham. Just pure beef for one day a week.<br /><br />Except for all of the hateful and one sided opinions and lack of scientific explanations about \\"humans don't need to eat meat\\" argument, it shows chicken and pig farms with all of their cruelty.
B00L9B7IKE|4|This novel captivated me from the beginning. Maybe it was how normally flawed the main character was? How realistically she was portrayed? How easy it was to believe she was real? This novel wasn't deep or life changing, but it was very readable and entertaining. For me, I'd describe it not as the main course, or even the vegetable or potatoes. No, it is more like the popcorn in the movie theater, that has just enough butter and salt to make you take long drags on your soda and lick your fingers from time to time.
B001VLXNLU|5|I had really mixed feelings about reading this book given all the bad review but I gave it a try. I cannot agree more about the dialogue it really does feel like a forty year old trying way too hard. part of me is wondering what kind of editor would let that slide. no one talks like that not any generation for that matter and it really annoyed me but I tried to just accept it and focus on the plot and that's when i began to enjoy the novel. I think for the price it's all right I don't think is the greatest book but i don't have any buyer's remorse either. I think if you just want a light amusing read this is for you the key here is don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed it's not terrible and again considering the price its decent. the plot is intriguing enough that I finished the book despite the teen dialogue. just buy one book at a time and take it from there.
B00AIUUXHC|4|Great game. However, more bloody shark attacks would be cool!
B00821OX98|5|This show is awesome, makes you think about what you would do if this ever happened in reality. the only downfall was the ending of this season. but it left you hanging so well that it made you start the second season!<br /><br />I would recommend at least trying to watch it, takes 2 or so episodes to get into but after that your hooked.
B004ZMWUCU|5|The author is gifted at creating interesting, believable characters, not to mention, weaving a riveting story line. While doing this she exposes the evils of a once accepted sadistic orphanage, (now a thing of the past ) and the damage it did to the children who had to live there. In spite of how it sounds, it has a hopeful message and touches of humor. By all means, READ IT!!
1451697384|5|Great Book with lots of interesting information.
B008EEZ64Y|5|I loved it! I have read and loved many books by this author and this one is no different. Very descriptive and easy to read, I read in one day because I just could not put it down!
B008Y7EYSK|4|Enjoyed it.
B00BAXFECK|5|A brilliant story that takes you deep into a teen's suffering.  The Goldfinch is a truly great piece of literature, far beyond most popular fiction of today.
B00HB62MC0|5|would recommend for sure....one of my favorites I couldn't put it down I will re-read definitely.... such an amazing story
B00IQDFBN4|5|This is like better than Skype because u can chat,text and play games and change ur feature while u r facetiming this app is amazing I love!
B00I2TV3NO|5|Excellent
B000E1ZBGS|2|I read somewhere recently that the directors/producers of this version made some intentional decisions to do unnecessary things like lowering the financial status of the Bennets to near-poverty, changing some of the dialog to sound more modern and reflective of (their own shallow experience with) teenaged girls, and changing the timeframe entirely because the director \\"didn't like\\" the fashions of the time in which Austen set her original novel. They apparently wanted this version to appeal more to a younger audience. Thus, along with the issues mentioned above, you will also find faster cuts and dialog, scenes in which the characters do things that would be completely unacceptable for the time (Lizzie with her hair completely down, or Darcy walking across fields with his shirt flapping open), and some very strange behavior from the family (Jane allowing a man in her room while she is in her nightdress). Not to mention the blatant attempt to infer sexual innuendo where there simply isn't any. (Seriously? That shot of the pig's...um...boy parts? Lizzie making a very vulgar check of Wickham's rear? ...Was the director influenced by a 13 year old boy?)<br />Knightly's portrayal bugged me more than a little. I couldn't figure out what she was giggling at half the time, and the other half, the character was doing things blatantly out of character for Austen's heroine. I did, however, appreciate the fact that Mrs. Bennet is slightly more lovable in this version. The 1995 portrayal grates on the \\"nerves\\" and is way over done, but I thought this actress did a much more appropriate job of it.<br />It is worth a look every once in a while, but if you want to see an adaptation that actually attempts to remain true to the story and the customs of the day (and not our narcissistic modern teenaged audience) then I, too, would recommend the Ehle/Firth BBC production.
B000092ZYX|4|Was a diehard Radiohead fan and found myself being bitterly disappointed in both Kid A and Amnesiac - after a few listens it didn't open up the way OK Computer has.  In fact, both ended up being deleted from my hard drive fairly quickly and the CD's still gather dust.<br />Hail to the Thief is somewhere in between.  The melange of sounds, mixing, rhythms seems far less contrived than KA/Amnesiac, and while I don't think it has nearly the staying power of OK Computer this album has outstanding tracks that do stand the test of repeated listening.  As a group, they don't have the operatic hang-together feel of a great album, but far more worth my money than other recent purchases.
1451627289|5|I cannot say enough about this book....it's absolutely enthralling.  I've been a King fan since I first picked up 'Salem's Lot' back in 1976.  Granted, there have been ups and downs with his books, but this one is certainly a keeper.  I was hoping he wouldn't throw in some ghoulish ending which makes no sense (as he did with Duma Key), and I am happy to report that the ending couldn't be better.  He did a great job with this and I urge anyone to read it.  Don't let the large amount of pages scare you....if you're like me, you will find yourself up to all hours of the morning reading chapter after chapter.
B003ZSJ212|5|This review is for the Star Wars Saga on Blu Ray.  Most of the negative reviews here are from fans who feel cheated and are trying to get back at George Lucas (my hat is off to you).  However you have not purchased this product and therefore have no business reviewing the BD's.  The original trilogy look very good and sound awesome on blu ray.  This is the best picture and sound you will experience these movies!  While I am not a fan of the prequels I have to say that ROTS is almost Avatar standard on blu ray.  The first two films of the prequel I won't waist my time on commenting as I won't watch them again.  Overall the changes made to the original trilogy is not awful ( I actually enjoy most of the updated cgi ) as it makes these films more current.  I do agree ROTJ is a mixed bag and the added bar scene with Jabba the Hut is ridiculous! I find it sad that people won't watch the update Star Wars episodes 4 through 6 simply because the director / creator made some changes to the original movies!  Sit and pout but don't count on the original theatrical releases to be on blu ray anytime soon.  That will only happen if GL is broke and I don't see that happening anytime soon!
0553386883|5|Exceeded all expectations and I love all the Outlander books! &#34;Hello, the house&#34; were such welcome words! Now I need to know how they got there (I don't want to give it away).
B005ZOBNOI|5|I can't wait to watch the movie! This book was extremely moving...I couldn't put it down! :) love love love!
B007J4T2G8|5|The start of this trilogy hooks you in immediately.  The writing is intense and very well written.  I just finished the second book and am about to purchase the third and final book.  I am quite sad to be almost finished as I haven't read a book or series in quite a while that has me this hooked.  A definite must read!
B007HC3LHS|5|This was an entertaining book. Somewhat suspenseful yet was not too nerve shattering. I enjoyed the book from beginning to end.
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is really cool In a way it shows how to take care of a house<br />I showed my mom this game she thought it was cool. A lot of my friends have this game there reviews say this game is awesome
B00000IMYA|5|WOW!!!
B000XUBFE2|5|Loved this book.  I had a hard time with the writing style in the first chapter, but once I grew accustomed to it; the story flowed well.  The use of color in the imagery brought the story to life so much more.  My 10 year old son and I read it together.  We both enjoyed it, and it opened up some topics for discussion regarding history.
B0051UP5NQ|5|I've used it several times and it works well.
0345803485|3|I must confess, I bought this book because of all the hype about it. \\"Mommy porn\\", etc... Although I'm not a Mom, I thought this might be something hot and sexy to read. Wrong! The sex scenes were all the same, and got to the point where I wanted to skip reading them all together. I can't believe that people get turned on by this? Unreal! I've read other reviews on here where people have said they were tired of hearing about her \\"inner goddess\\", and \\"subconscious\\", which she mentioned all the time throughout the book. I found it unique and different to write a book this way. It didn't really bother me. What did bother me is Ana saying \\"Oh\\" all the time. It was almost laughable. She literally says it on every page. Either way, I think the book was an easy read, and was entertaining none the less. Ana & Christian seem to have a lot of attraction and passion for one another, so that spoke more to me than all the vanilla sex throughout the book. My suggestion to people considering reading the book is: Buy the 1st one like I did, see if you like it, and if you do, buy the other two. I myself will not be purchasing the other two books, but I will say it's not as bad as some people have said. But nor is it worthy of 5 stars either (in my humble opinion). Happy reading! :)
0684833395|5|I was made to read this book as a class assignment way back when and for once I was grateful!Very humorous and deep with an odd kind of spiraling writing style. The &quot;anti-war or not&quot; discussion is always hot on this satire classic and it's my bet the author would be proud of it.To me the war itself was the central Catch-22;the war that no one wishes to fight MUST be fought.Men who do not wish to kill MUST or be killed by other men with no wish to kill them...etc.I don't think it's anti-war necessarily;just against the pure acceptance of the idea without regret.The Armed Forces,war movies,Tom Clancy books,etc. never seem to acknowledge that in every heroic soldier there is probably a little Yossarian wondering how this all happened and why he must be a part of it(I thought Yosarrian found the other characters insane because he was the only one who questioned why they was there).I think it is the genius(and bravery)of writers like Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut to HIGHLIGHT this and keep wars (and war movies...) from becoming like Lieutenant Scieisskopf's parades: all looks and no truth.One of my favorites.Now tell me why I'm wrong!
B00NLKA0D8|5|If only more than Google adopted U2F.  I love this over the time based one time code generators.
B00GSJ9X4Q|5|If these things stay reliable, I can only give it a thumbs up.  I'll be waiting for the 256Gb SSD plus 2 Tb!  :)
B00BAXFECK|2|surprised that it is a Pulitzer Prize winner
B0000019PA|5|One of my personal favorite records in the genre, and of all records in general. I will never stop loving this album.
B001F6ZIXW|5|This is a great series and I'm glad I discovered it on Amazon. Now I have a new show to watch.
B00104W8T6|4|The soundtrack is a great example of utilizing artists from the past with the music of the present to deliver an outstanding package, which works well with the moods of the movie.<br /><br />In what could be a playlist from a college radio station, there is oldies and classic rock (Buddy Holly, The Kinks and Mott the Hoople's timeless anthem, All the Young Dudes), with a solid helping of the indie scene through Sonic Youth, Cat Power, Belle & Sebastian and Kimya Dawson, as a solo artist and her bands - Antsy Pants and Moldy Peaches. The real gem - which encapsulates the film - is Michael Cera and Ellen Page on Anyone Else but You.<br /><br />By pulling music from a variety of sources, the soundtrack is a real as dialing in the college DJ on the car radio before driving out of the high school parking lot immediately after school.
0393320928|5|A lot of books written by scientific people claim to be &quot;down-to-earth&quot; and for the &quot;layman&quot; but end up creeping into the obscure. Not so here. Feynman starts with his feet planted firmly on the ground and never strays. <br />The first few stories range from the serious to the light-hearted. From the pain of losing his wife to being invited to speak at a funeral for a man whom he can't remember. These accounts give you a good look at the ability of Feynman to convey a story and make it interesting. The majority of the book however is given to the time he spent on the committee that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Using no nonsense, straight-forward writing he takes you through the process of how he and the others, despite a lot of bureaucratic red tape, managed to find out what went wrong on that fateful day. What could very well be a dry and uninspiring subject becomes quite informative and engaging through his telling.<br />This is my first book by Feynman, but having absorbed the whole thing in one sitting it surely won't be my last.
0525421033|5|17 year-old Mia has a great life. Her parents are understanding former punks, she's a talented cellist and her boyfriend completely gets her. Then, one seemingly-innocent snow day changes Mia's life. With her day off from school, Mia, her brother and her parents go on a drive.    The next thing Mia knows, she's watching the paramedics pull her beaten body out of the car.    The accident has taken the lives of her family and Mia feels as if she won't be able to handle the pain. In her strange state where she can go anywhere but not be seen, Mia learns that it is her choice if she wants to fight to leave or die.    Throughout the novel, we see Mia as she contemplates her choice, a difficult one to make. Family and friends come in and out of her hospital and everything they say and do affects Mia's choice.    Finally, the day after her accident, Mia finally decides what she wants. That is, until one final person speaks who completely alters Mia's decision. The question is, is it best for her to stay or is it really her time to let go?    While topics like this have been explored before, I've never read a single book like If I Stay. It was heartrending and the method that Gayle Forman used was truly innovative. I love how the book went from present to past; it fully developed the characters and defined the relationships between them    The entire story is captivating, even though it simply revolves around one decision. I love how everything that mattered to Mia's decision was explored in the novel. Past experiences, the way the future would be...just everything.    The most important part, I think, is the way love is explored. The people who love Mia and the people who Mia loves are the ones that are the focus of Mia's decision. With her parents and brother gone, can everyone else's love be enough?    Everything about everyday life becomes important in If I Stay. Things that you might never have considered important may be the points that make or break a death-or-life decision.    *spoiler*    I think one of the most moving moments(for me, besides the ending) was the part where Mia's grandpa tells Mia that he understand if she chooses to die. It makes Mia's loss all the more evident. Her parents are gone, her brother is gone. Really, is there enough left for Mia to hold on to? If it were me...would it be enough for me to stay back for?    *Spoiler End*    If I Stay is a beautiful and sincere story of an ordinary girl who must make the hardest decision that she will ever have to face.    If I haven't made it obvious enough, I completely adored If I Stay. Make sure you pick this one up right away! .I've also read Gayle Forman's other book Sisters in Sanity and while it's not quite up to the par of If I Stay, if you need some extra reading, check that one out too :)
B0063IH60K|1|Hate Android OS after the phones I had with the Android OS all sucked. I mean serious, total suck fest for a phone OS.
B00CKOYVG8|1|Resent having to purchase additional gadgets for higher scoring. The birds are always fun but I find the games repetitious from one to the other. Angry Birds (original) is still a favorite game for me and I guess its founders have to find ways to make money from it.
B00I8H6X58|5|A sad, true story. Matthew McConaughey played an Oscar worthy role, he also lost plenty of weight (scary). My take on this, go to Mexico for your pharmaceutical needs. LOL!
B00ALYY6ZA|5|Easy to read with excellent presentation of concepts to support good health, weight loss, and a positive life style through self care in food consumption.
B00881VLCE|2|I like magic jigsaw, but, right after downloading, my kindle stop working. So I really shouldn't rate it at all.
044022425X|5|Great writing by Diana Gabaldon. Love the characters!  I have read the whole series.  Now I've ordered the Starz series on DVD and they follow the books perfectly.
B0035LGXXO|5|It's so much better now than I remember as a kid  on the dark greenish screen TV I had with the worn out tape from the video store.Also my 13 year old son loved and had no idea how old it is
0316055433|5|a wonderful book, and I loved it.
B006LSZECO|4|Enjoyed the story.  Nice easy read.  Nothing spectacular but again a nice easy read with a surprising but heart warming  ending..
B00A757EFW|2|This game is only a sample, which they don't tell you when getting it,<br />can only play for a few minutes, then wants you to buy an extended<br />version? Miss leading!!
B00AREIAI8|5|great game love it you can do so much find that you need energy to do things and time to do chores but other then that its great
B00U7VDC7A|4|Just started but interesting so far
B004SOR4H6|5|Works fine I love it's great because I can manage every thing on Twitter that I need to it works great for me I don't know why I am 're repeating myself.
B008WCP2PG|2|I was disappointed in the tale.  I guess I'm of the age that the drug culture is not my bag.  I know it exists, just a fratricide exists.
B000WGWQG8|1|Unlike other reviewers, I never read the McCullough book, am neither incensed nor titillated by nudity, nor, although I love this wonderful country, am I extraordinarily interested in John Adams or many of the other founding fathers as individuals. I watched it for entertainment (it WAS a TV show), and as entertainment it was just bad.    I felt like I was watching a big-budget, nine-hour soap opera Thanksgiving special. There wasn't a single subtle or even objective minute in the hours and hours this thing dragged on, just one heavy-handed, melodramatic, grossly overacted and manipulative set piece after another. I hated it. If it got a lot better near the end (which is practically impossible), I missed that, and I'm not even sorry.    I love history, but I'd rather let facts speak for themselves and be allowed to have my OWN reactions to them than be force-fed somebody else's highly-charged emotional responses to everything, as this thing did.    Hollywood produces nothing but junk any more, whether it goes to TV or the octoplex. Nothing but mindless, formula-driven, pre-digested garbage for the mindless violence-and-laughtrack-dulled masses who would have a stroke if they suddenly had to figure something out for themselves. Thank God, there are still some imaginative, challenging, and creative independent filmmakers out there, even here in America, and the rest of the world is full of them.
0439023483|5|he got it ok liked it do not know anything else<br />I would never read that garbage<br />Do not have time for all this
B009JZSC9S|5|This series has it all.....action, authenticity and love and sex.
B00I29VGMC|5|I don't write many reviews but I loved this book. I read it in one setting. I couldn't put it down.
B00ECU2SGS|5|Good flow in story, very believable. Definitely got you hooked into story, shows how curious young boys can be and how it can lead them down a unusual path
B005S9EKCW|5|Excellent representation of the power of grace and redemption in the life of one many, may consider to be the &#34;least of these.&#34;  We'll done; uplifting, challenging, heartbreaking, and thrilling!
B0007PAMEM|5|This collection of Tina's best live performances is a must have for any Tina Turner fan.  While I am still waiting for a collection of her videos from the Virgin Records Days(1993-1999), this dvd provides a great deal of entertainment value.  Even though the concert clips are stretched over a period of 20 some years, they flow seamlessly from one to the next without you getting the feeling that anything is dated.  It shows that she still has as much power live today as she did when she debuted with Private Dancer.
B007URVZJ6|3|Building Your Book for Kindle provides a good starting point.  It was necessary to regularly query the Kindle Community and the Internet for specifics.
B000FZEUGA|5|A dark and moody album, grabs me and doesn't let me go. The vinyl is pretty sharp, would have loved a gate-fold cover too, but I'll take the amazing music over ridiculous covers any day.
B00ECTZKJ6|5|Sonic masterpiece!
B004GHNIRK|5|love it!
0525478817|5|I'm only a recent fan of John Green's video blog on youtube with his brother, Hank.  Having watched those videos for about a year now, I decided to take a chance on him and his new, young adult romance novel.  And I am very glad that I did.  This is NOT some winsome, fantastical young chick novel about true love that will never die because the lovers are immortal vampires (who wants to read about that?).  The characters are real, their love is real, and their story feels real.  The best part about this novel is that each character feels authentic.  There is no dumbing down of any of the characters at all.  They question the existence of God and heaven, the value of contemporary art and literature, and what the best kind of life should look like.  There is also honest, teenage discussions about sex and video games that anyone in the in demographic  age of 16-30 will recognize from their own high school years.  And the fact that each of the characters has cancer only intensifies the significance of each of their musings on life, death, and love.  I did feel that the climatic twist was a little too cliché, but Mr. Green certainly makes up for it in the last 70+ pages.  All in all, this is novel that young adults in the previously mentioned demographic range (and even older) will love.
B00006FDCD|5|love the movie. great to watch. its great to watch with the family. Amazon never disappoints their customers. thank you for always having what I am looking for.
B00OPMI04M|5|So happy this album is finally out! I haven't paid full price for an album in ages. (Usually just ARRRR!! or buy singles.).. I just love her sound. I don't think there's a single song on this album I don't like, and since I haven't grown tired of the original 5 (or 6..) preview tracks that were already released prior to the album coming out.. I doubt I ever will. LOVE IT!
B00CWY76CC|5|Great fun!  Only  issue  issue i have with the game is that it is sometimes difficult to get the touchscreen to react the way you would like it to.
B00IIUATDM|4|Full of sex, drugs and money addiction, definately not for the kids.<br /><br />A  look inside the trading on wall street in the 80's, full of sex drugs and money addictions,  some people can never have enough, Very entertaining definately not for the kids
0062124293|2|Wanted to like it, liked it at first, during a cute story of her as a young teen, angsty and etc., but then it seemed that the author never grew up: her voice remained as cutesy and, to me, contriving to be hip-or-die as that self conscious young person's might. A no.
B0000AI45P|4|Came across this band when discussion punk online. Somebody recommended this album, and I saw them listed on Australian Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 essential albums, from a few years back. Two positive recommendations in other words, and since I've lately been exploring punk, I thought I'd check it out. Have to say that I really struggle to see how this band/album get viewed as punk. Being cynical, I'd have to say that the bar is set very low for being labelled \\"punk\\"...I'm guessing that playing at the music venue \\"CBGB's\\" would suffice, sadly. Anyway, if you are buying this album expecting to hear some pioneering punk, I think you will be annoyed. Being kind, the vocals are mildly/vaguely punk in style. Don't really listen to any progressive forms of rock, but I think this album may qualify. Or maybe you could it, ironically, \\"post-punk\\" music. Why ironically? Because it was released in the year that punk exploded around the world, with The Sex Pistols and, earlier, The Damned, The Saints, Radio Birdman and The Ramones, of course.  Television seems post-punk before punk had even really started!       What to expect: mildly punk vocals, simple complexity of sound, alternative type pop/rock, wordy lyrics, squiggly melodies and simple riffs. Lyrics are poetic and literate for the most part. Songs can be epic pop/rock constructions, and you get a dual lead guitar formation. The cd has a crisp sound and the music is mostly mid-tempo. If this is really punk, it is of a bohemian sort. Vocals are strangled at times, but I do have to say that I found the drumming on the album interesting, as were the guitar work, which got varied. Initially, on first listen, I was looking to score this album 65/100, but on second listen I liked it better, so am giving it 70/100.          Best song:        Torn curtain - the lushest song on the cd and slightly gothic too. Runs 7 minutes long. Occasionally the guitar sounds like a distressed kitten, and the piano features as well.           Next best songs:        Guiding light - a mellow track with melodic lead guitar notes. Bassy, piano features. Pleasant track.     Little Johnny Jewel - the guitar sounds strangled in this track...highly tunes, perhaps, though I don't play any instruments. 7:09 running time. Quite jazzy at times. Has some of those poetic style lyrics I mentioned before.  Has a nice guitar solo.           The rest:        See no evil - has an AC/DC style mini-riff and Kylie Minogue's song \\"Clever girl\\" (I think that is the name of the song) is also brought to mind.  The other riff in the song brings to mind the kind of stuff Thin Lizzy does.  For some, this dual guitar thing could be catchy. One of the guitars sounds 'throaty' and the other guitar has a circular thing going.  In this opening track, the vocals sound a bit punk, and there is a not bad guitar solo in this song. Sound quality very good.    Venus - there's a harpsichord kind of sound on this song and I'm not sure if it's not created by a guitar, somehow. The lead guitar has notes that ring out. A wordy song with a nice mini-melody to it.     Friction - a bassy track which brings to mind Australian band The Ferrets' song \\"Don't fall in love\\" as far as the guitar bit in the intro and throughout goes. Drum solo outro, and vocally Television do to the word \\"diction\\" what The Sex Pistols do with the word \\"problem\\" or \\"vacant\\" in two of their songs from their debut album. I.e. make the word strange and sort of obscene!    Marquee moon - one of those songs with a squiggly lead guitar lick, which bookends the song. Runs at 10:47. The intro notes reminded me of Joan Armatrading's classic song \\"Me myself I\\". There is a simple rhythm guitar, and bass is noticeable. The middle part of the song is mostly an instrumental, with a 3 minute guitar solo in it. One part of the song is similar is Led Zeppelin's classic \\"Kashmir\\".      Elevation - bassy, nice note picking on the guitar (which has a nice tone to it) .  The guitar'stone and melody, at times, puts in mind \\"The break up song\\" by The Greg Kihn Band. Think my notes are saying that this song also has a guitar sound like a yowing cat, but tweaked or something (old notes, been a while since I listened to the album).     Prove it - nice bass guitar intro, 1960's style guitar lick...seems familiar, but I just can't place it. I like the drumming and the tone of the drums in this song.    See no evil - has a Thin Lizzy rhythm to it. Don't listen to Thin Lizzy, but they may have been another band with a dual lead guitar set up.        The cd I have has got a few bonus tracks on it. There are variations on three of the tracks on the original album, \\"Friction\\", \\"Marquee moon\\" and \\"See no evil\\", as well as an untitled instrumental. \\"Little Johnny Jewel\\" is the last bonus track on this cd. The bonus track version of \\"Marquee moon\\" also has a good guitar solo to it, but it runs around half a minute longer than the original version.  As for \\"Untitled instrumental\\", well, it has a driving bass guitar and solid drumming. It gives a nod to 1960's surf rock and has a vaguely Shadows style lead guitar.  The rhythm guitar has that surf sound to it and it sometimes gives a wink to that famous guitar effect of a breaking wave sound.  Not sure which song first introduced that...\\"Wipe out\\"?         Recommendations:        Radio Birdman - Radios appear.  Australian pioneers of punk. This album came out around the same time as Marquee Moon. If Television really were punk, they might sound like Radio Birdman. Some of their tracks are nice and pleasant too...a bit jazzy.  Patti Smith - Horses. Sex Pistol Johnny Rotten called this album \\"Horseshytte\\". Not very punk. Like Television, Smith is arty and literate. Probably called punk because she performed at CBGBs too...as did Blondie.   The Stooges - Fun house.   The second half of that album is quite jazzy, noisy.  The Velvet Underground - either their 1st album (with Nico), or their self-titled 3rd. They also do 'pleasant' well.
B00000K2SC|5|Since I'm not what can be called a fan of sci-fi or Keanu Reeves, I wasn't sure this movie would be for me.  Was I ever wrong!  'The Matrix' is the  complete package: stunning, mind-bending special effects, perfect casting,  brilliant directing, and a story that stands on its own.<br />The visual  effects are truly a marvel to view, and deservedly won an Oscar in this  category.  Fortunately, there's 26 'bonus' minutes of footage at the end of  the film explaining how much of it was done.  <br />Keanu Reeves is perfectly  cast as Neo in this film- he excels at looking confused and has  (thankfully) minimal dialogue.  He does have a great physique which makes  for a fantastic 'action-hero'.  Laurence Fishburne turns in a fine  performance as the cryptic Morpheus; his voice alone keeps one's attention  in a way reminiscent of James Earl Jones'.  The real 'star' of the film,  though, is Carrie-Ann Moss, who lights up the screen as Trinity. Beautiful,  smart and independent, she gives this film a soul and prevents it from  crossing into a stereotypical sci-fi 'annihilate the bad guys' film filled  with techno-babble.<br />This is a film which *must* be seen more than once in  order to fully appreciate all the hints and clues given early on in the  film.  Not only is a second viewing necessary, but it's enjoyable- again,  the special effects are magnificent and have to be seen to be believed.   It's definitely a film you shouldn't miss!
B006IGZWB2|5|This movie is good on every level. The acting, the story line, the filming. I was enthralled by it and would recommend it to anyone
B0018OFN1S|5|This was a great movie.  I loved the action and the suspense.  It held all of our interest and kept us interested!
B008MEM24S|5|This is an amazing app it is totalty worth the $0.99!!!!!<br />Everyone should get it right away. GET IT NOW!!!!!
B001Q4Z5UY|5|I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters. I am still surprised at how good it actually was. I really didn't want to see it because it looked and sounded so stupid. But my girlfriend drug me to the movies to see it. In my opinion, this movie has all the makings of a good action movie. It has a plot, not much of a plot, but it is there, and its not like everything happens at the beginning and the rest of the movie is just pointless violence, the story actually unfolds between scenes of violence. A small twist here and there. Hot girls, good special effects. And the best part, no sex scene. I hate sex scenes in action movies, especially long drawn out ones, its a waste of time and is only put there because they wanted to make the movie longer so they inserted a scene that has no plot value whatsoever, but why have plot when you can have boobs? I'm sorry but i'm not going to pay $9 a person to watch someone else get laid.
B00008S2VG|1|Probably Madonna's worst album ever, Madonna fails to achieve her concept, which some people tell me she was aiming for.  Okay, so let me preface this by saying that I am a certified Madonna nut...over a thousand Madonna items collected from the beginning, and I've seen Maddy in concert over 20 times.  I was even at the Confessions concert in London that's now out on DVD.  I love Madonna.  For me; however, it's always been the music.  I don't think Madonna has had a good album since ROL, but this is her worst...I mean, it's bad.  So, Madonna wants to make a concept album about the condition of the world (more celebrities preaching to us about the world...blah...blah).      Let's take the title track.  As a song alone, it is horrid.  Why is Madonna rapping in this song?  It falls flat and because it's lost in the nauseating grip of Madonna's rapping, I for one am not really sure what Madonna's message is. Okay, sure, we have the lyrics, but it's a lousy single.  And there is no passion in the song.  Madonna made a fantastic video to the song, and then pulled it for a dumbed down version where she sings in front of world flags so as not to offend.  What?!  The original version reminded me of the Like a Prayer days and it almost conveyed the message of the song, but she pulled it.  Whatever.    Let's move on to other songs...I'm So Stupid is SO stupid as a song, that I'm not even going to give it credence as a song.  Nothing Fails is a good song that stands out on the album.  It belongs on another CD.  Hollywood is another horrible...horrible track.  The problem with this album, as with COADF and Music is that she starts to mix her voice with computers and vocoders that you don't know who is Madonna and who is the imposter.  Why is it appealing to make your voice sound like a computer?  No Madonna fan has ever answered that question for me.  Sorry, I prefer real musical tracks like Like A Prayer over Paradise where her voice sounds like a computer terminal.  This albumsounds like Britney's Blackout in a lot of places...lol...and that's bad.  I thought the world was over when Madonna sang with Britney.  That song, Me Against the Music was the worst piece of trash I'd ever heard, but this album sounds like a Britney album.      Love Profusion is another worthless track...filler really.  I'm not even sure why a video was made for this song.  Nobody Knows Me is as nauseating as I'm So Stupid.  The other tracks aren't as bad, but cohesively, the album doesn't flow well.  It is Madonna's worst album.  Don't waste your time on this one.  You know, there was a time years ago, when I didn't think there could be a bad Madonna album, but I was wrong, and this is it.  Pick up Like a Prayer or Ray of Light instead and stay away from her newer ones.
0345495004|5|Frank Lloyd Wright touched our lives with his work.  This book touched my soul.
B0081SRJSY|1|*UPDATE* I did the Test Drive a few times.  The game Carcassone has no hidden game play components nor do you need to bargain with other players like you would need to do with a game like Settlers of Catan to build the fun.  This makes Carcassone the perfect board game translated for play on a tablet.  The most confusing part of the game is figuring out and adding the points, and in the app, it's done automatically for you!<br /><br />Beautiful graphics and interface aside, this android app does not have the solitaire mode or the ability to play online with friends like the ipad/iphone version has.  With the local game play, I can play with a few friends by sharing the tablet.  With internet game play, I can play a game with family and friends who are across the bridge or overseas.  By myself, I can do a solitaire challenge or play against the computer.  I love this game.  But I'll stick to my ipad version and won't buy this android app for my phone until at least these two features are added.
B007ZH6WJY|4|I liked this book, it had excellent information, I thought it repeated some information. This would be a good read for anyone looking for answers about &#34;poverty&#34;.
B00LCT48GA|5|A must have!  I can't say enough good things about the composition of this release!  Slash's guitar playing is second to none!  The Autorip bonus is much appreciated!  I downloaded the album to my iPhone, because I wore the CD out already!
B00DURGZHW|2|Seemed slow and unfocused.
B00N35P5MW|3|The game is good, review requests are annoying tho

B0076DCT2G|5|I love DeMille's sense of humor.  I particularly like his character, John Corey.  His books are interesting, informative, and entertaining.  They're not classics by any means but are a good, fun read.
B00OLMZIZK|1|Not what i thought it would be.
B00BAXFECK|5|If you are a DT fan you will not be disappointed.  I was able to purchase this for my kindle at a wonderful price.  I wish there were more writers like this.

B000VNMMQG|5|This is an excellent, must-see film!  This film has inspired me to learn and read more about William Wilberforce as well as the other characters around him such as William Pitt who became Britain's youngest prime minister ever at the age of only 24, the quest to end the African slave trade, and British history in the late 18th and early 19th centuries!  The storyline is also inspirational in remembering that anyone can affect significant and positive changes with persistance!  And instead of all the negative, violent and hateful movies out there, this one will make you smile.
B00G0A7KG6|4|It was weird
B00GEEB730|5|great read
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Was great!
B00GT35G9C|5|This is absolutely  one of the best series I have ever watched.  Like a good book, I couldn't put it down!  I just went from one episode to the next.  Loved it so much.
B00AIQP9DE|5|Okay, I'm his mom and I am using his kindle. My Son would never play games like these, but I do all the time. This one was pretty good! Certainly took up a few hours and had some cool creepy scenes! Worth it.  Nik' s Mom
B00003CXC6|5|In the first chapter of Burton F. Porter's excellent new book, Philosophy through Fiction and Film, he discusses the problem of obtaining reliable knowledge and he uses Akira Kurosawa's ground breaking film, Rashomon, to illustrate the difficulty of determining the truth value of what we think we see and know.  Professor Porter gives us a careful summary of the film with his thoughtful comments on the challenge of knowing the absolute truth about what we experience.<br />When asked about what he knew for certain, Albert Einstein said that the only thing he could be certain of was the speed of light, and even that was open to question.  Kurosawa and Einstein appear to be in accord and Rashomon is Kurosawa's attempt to show how difficult it is to know the truth of what actually happened, even when an event is viewed by several eyewitnesses.<br />Rashomon is now available on DVD, courtesy of the Criterion Collection of Films, and the black and white print we see on the screen is sharp and clear and the sound is good.  This film does not translate well to the small televison screen.  I sat up close to my 32\\" Panasonic and wished I had a larger TV so that I might be drawn in more completely as a witness to the complex and engaging story.<br />The movie opens at the Rashomon Gate in feudal Japan.  A woodcutter and a priest are sitting patiently waiting for a rainstorm to subside.  Soon another man, a commoner, joins them and the woodcutter begins to share with the two other men his confusion about the facts surrounding a recent rape and murder.  We learn later that the woodcutter is an eyewitness to the crimes, but first he tells us about his experience as he watches intently an investigation/trial.  A judge is listening to a bandit, a woman, and a dead samurai, whose testimony is revealed through a medium, tell the judge their version of the rape and murder.<br />The bandit first tells us he is reponsible for rape of the woman and the death of the samurai.  Next the woman seems to indicate that she might be responsible for the death of the samurai, her husband.  Then the samurai, by means of a medium, indicates that he committed suicide.  Finally, the woodcutter tells us that the bandit is indeed responsible for the murder.  Each of these stories is visually recreated in effective flashbacks.<br />Lest any viewer think this problem is factual and straight forward, all the viewer needs to do is to write out his version of the various stories and then check with what even well respected critics have to say to see that the viewer's version will differ sometimes signficantly from various professional reviews.  Kurosawa demonstrates convincingly that in the telling of events each viewer is likely to put forward a version that enhances the way that viewer is perceived by others.  This film is about truth and lies and the point made is that the person we are most likely to be untruthful to is ourself.  If we are unable to tell the truth to ourselves, how will we be able to be honest with others?<br />Everthing we see and experience is filtered through the total experience of our lives.  In a world filled with competing stimuli, where do we focus our attention?  We miss more than we see, sometimes even things right under our very noses.  Reality is fabulous, as in this Kurosawa film, but he shows us that it is also as ephemeral as the light passing through the trees in the forest creating shadows everywhere.<br />Rashomon was made for a Japanese audience and was very popular in Japan. In 1951 it was shown at the Venice Film Festival and won the Golden Lion Award.  Since that time it has taken its place among the finest films ever made.<br />It is not without its flaws, chief of which, in my opinion, is the music score, particularly the adaptation of Ravel's Bolero, which distracts the viewer from the events taking place on screen.  Also, at the very end of the film a baby is found at the Rashomon Gate and the woodcutter takes the baby hometo add to his large family.  This plot device to soften the negative impact of the film on the audience and to give hope where little has been experienced weakens the impact of all the events in the story we have just seen.  For a film meant to be shown to a Japanese audience, this \\"Hollywood\\" ending seems out of place and untrue.<br />The greatness of the film is the story it tells and the superb perfomances of all the actors.  I cannot agree with critics who feel that some of the perfomances of the actors, particularly the bandit, were \\"over the top.\\"  This film is a highly visual, almost a throwback to silent pictures.  We learn about the characters from what we see more than from what we hear.  Additionally, the superb camera work is a most important part of the story telling process.<br />Rashomon is a must for students of the cinema and, as was mentioned earlier in this review, for anyone interested in trying to learn the truth value of knowledge.to add to his large family.

B0031RSA24|4|Interesting read and well researched. More people should read instead of assuming what they are brought up on. Enjoyed this read
B00MWD7XR6|5|love his work!
B00CUG8GAS|4|Interesting memoir of Rhodesia
B006BDHAX0|5|Really great for the brain once you start you can't stop it is so addictive to play really well made a must have for tension release
078401213X|4|Pi reminded me of Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco, minus Eco's seven years of research and spellbinding detective-story style. Overall, the film's pretty good if you're interested in numerological mysticism, but is  at times self-important and overreaching. Gives you interesting stuff to  think about, though.
B00HVJB4VM|5|Mr. Lewis has, again, revealed an unfortunate truth about our equity markets. It should not surprise anyone that there will be prosecutions and restitution made in the coming years. The hope should be that the regulators regain the strength and intelligence to protect public investing as soon as possible.
B00O7UED2A|3|I'm on level 4.... got to this point in about 30min. I'm hoping that it gets a little harder as I progress, but pretty fun so far. Certainly worth downloading since it's the faotd. Nice way to kill an afternoon. Runs smoothly on my Dragon Touch tablet - graphics are dated, but sufficient for this type of game. Basic collecting & puzzle solving here. This game may not break any new ground, but I've seen much worse in this genre. If paying for it, I would say 99 cents would be fair in today's app market, but no more (imho). I give it 4 stars because it was free, but otherwise I'd give it a 3 overall. Lack of originality is my only real critique. Otherwise it's a good game. Not great, but good.    UPDATE: Adjusting to 3 stars (orig gave 4). I just finished this game & it's VERY short. I finished it in around 2hrs of play (guesstimate). The puzzles are pretty easy, but fun I have to admit. I found no need for using the \\"clues\\" at all, but I'm a long-time, seasoned gamer. Still, considering the games short length, I must adjust my original assessment and suggest this game ONLY IF IT'S FREE (sorry devs!). There were 2 puzzles that stumped me for a few minutes, but I pretty much flew through the rest. I still say it's a great way to kill an afternoon, but beyond that I see absolutely no replay value with this title. I probably would've been bummed had I actually paid money for this game. Played it, now deleting it.     I try to be as honest and objective as possible when reviewing apps. Hope you find this helpful.
B00EBDXSOW|5|love it and love the band. Who doesnt love Metallica!!! I cant live without them hahaha and it was a great price too.
B00OGTDZP8|5|Fabulous book from a Fantastic person Full of Funny comics and phenomenal stories,<br />Thanks!
B00992CF6W|5|this game is awesome keep it going mojang : anyone who's a minecraft fan get this app immediately. well worth 7 dollars :)
B00IJJUIMY|5|If you like Harry then you will love this great story.<br />The sad thing is it could be his last
B006AX6ONI|5|I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Cuban's rise to success and the tips he gives to the reader along the way.
B007J4T2G8|3|Holy crap! It turns out that my Inner Goddess got as bored with the repetitive language in this novel as I did. By the end of chapter two it's crystal clear that Ana often bites her lip, blushes, and rolls her eyes. It's also clear that Christian's eyes are grey. Really really grey. Um, did I mention that Christian's eyes are grey? Nevertheless I found this to be a fairly interesting read. Steamy<br /> sex scenes even though I'm not into BDSM. Even found myself wondering near the end of the story what happened in Fifty's life that turned him into such a train wreck. The answer will probably turn out to be predictable if I can make it through book two in the trilogy. I'm a little hesitant about starting the second book. If the language is as repetitive as this first novel I may find myself rolling my eyes like Ana and wanting to spank someone like Christian.
1416972242|4|Really love and enjoyed this book and the first one. Really love all the characters and really enjoy the very interesting story line. Cant wait to read the rest.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Almost the other game that it isn't supposed to be but it is fun all the same no glitches so far
B004P7CNUY|5|worked perfectly
B009UX2YAC|4|AWESOME!
B0011TNVLY|5|What a great movie my grandson loves it especially the hot chocolate song!
B00GCE3TCE|5|really  good i loved this book leisel was a great charecter an i hope the author wrtes a sequle pleas do dude!
B000I9X7M6|5|I love this version of Romeo and Juliet for a number of reasons: in the first place I think that despite the change in time and place, the film remains true to Shakespeare's intentions for the story.  In addition Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes do a fantastic job portraying the emotion of these two characters.  I love Shakespeare's language and the rhyme and meter and while it takes a moment to get used to it in this updated setting, it rings more true to the actual story because of the maintenance of that language.
B00INXSJ22|5|It's difficult to top a release like her 2012 &#34;Tramp&#34; but if &#34;Are We There&#34; doesn't match it, it certainly comes close.  As with her last I've skipped around the songs fixating on one before discovering another, and I'll leave it up to others to analyze them.  This is the kind of music to savor, and I expect I'll be listening to this in my car over and over again. For fans of Ms Van Etten, this should certainly live up to expectations.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I'm hooked on Downton Abbey.  It's fast paced, terrific writing and great acting.  It make you want to know more about this part of history.  Great entertainment and a nice change from the, sometimes trashy, reality shows that seem to dominate TV these days.
B00AZMFJYA|5|This was a great buy.
0395645662|5|The Giver is a great book. I have read it twice because the first time I read it I was little and i didnt understand it. The second time i read it i enjoyed it much more, i would reccomend this book to juinor high students. It gives you an idea of what tyhe worl would be like without color and with  many other differences.
B008OOYALE|4|my only complaint is the price of items you need in order to advance in the game. 10,000 coins to purchase a dragon is too pricey for me. I still enjoy playing
B00AA7O6QC|4|Pretty good movie lots of action and cool to see these guys together and still kicking bad guy butt these are not the movies you watch for compelling story lines :)
B00005JMFQ|4|I only give this video 4 stars, although it's better than that. Because it is such a good film, it should be a family flick.  It is not.  The nudity makes it nearly impossible to watch in mixed company.  I first saw it on a plane and loved it.  I was surprised when I bought it and found extreme nudity and lewd scenes which were cut from the airline version.<br />As a guy, I first thought it would be a classic chick-flick.  It is actually funny on many levels and heartwarming on others.  I recommend it, but not for kids--and it's a darn shame, because with a bit of editing, it could be very enjoyable for them too.
B008O9V4C2|2|I'm a major Fagen fan and I find this album really weak and redundant as compared to say Kamakiriad.
B00FR0GT9Y|4|First of all let me say I'm only 25 and Boston was the first band I ever got into, back in the summer of 2004. So I have only been waiting around 9 1/2 years to hear this versus 11 years for some people.<br />I also don't know anything about music, I don't play, write or even listen to anything outside of rock really. But I do know what I like and I really like this album.<br />Is it as good as their first two? No, but I'm not going to compare them because that would be like comparing Chicago to Bachman Turner Overdrive; completely different styles.<br />Everyone needs to understand that Boston always has been done by one man: Tom Scholz.I would say that this is more a Tom Scholz solo album featuring guest vocalists than a Boston album, but that's just me. This album seems more personal, and mature if you will than the first two. Personally I think Fran Cosmo should now be Boston's lead vocalist as I really enjoy Walk On, but of course he's gone due to Tom suing him.<br />The other vocalists are very good in my opinion. David Victor I was surprised at, but I thought he was great.<br />Tommy DeCarlo &#34;the new Delp&#34; I've been waiting since 2008 to hear him, purposefully held off until this album to listen to him. He's like Steve Augeri of Journey, similar but different and in good ways, he not only fills Brad's shoes he brings his own in my opinion.<br />Kimberley Dahme's vocals do not bother me I liked With You from the last album and her songs on this one.<br />Tom Scholz singing sounds cool and scary at the same time in theory but in reality he's not too bad in my opinion. Singing on one song doesn't hurt anything and it IS his band.<br />Think Neal Schon singing 'In Self Defense' on Journey's Generations album: it's not the best song in the world but stands out because its different and it's still good.<br />Of course great to hear Brad Delp on a Boston album one last time. R.I P Brad.<br />The music itself in my opinion was great ranging from early Bostonto Walk On and a touch of Corporate America<br /><br />My complaints:  Why the hell was 'Didn't Mean to Fall in Love' included?! Yes it's a great song and one of Tom's favorite but it was just on the last cd and didn't need to be on something we've been waiting 11 years for!!<br />At least the 2.0 songs sound different (Did not listen to them as I just wanted to listen to the new stuff). But still they should be on a bonus disc or something or how about release the new stuff FIRST (say back in 2010-11), then go back and re-do old songs.<br />Or better yet: give us those old songs that never saw the light of day outside of 1970s concerts: Television Politician, Shattered Images, She's a Looker/Talkin' to the Wall, This Time and Hyperspace Pedal Blues!<br />Those songs capture the live spirit of 1976 Boston and the fans would love to have finally have them. True Tom has said he does not like those songs etc, but in that case just send all the money you receive from sales of those songs to all of those charities from the Walk On album. That way you won't have to feel bad for touching such dirty money and the fans will be happy.<br /><br />But what's done is done and it's Tom's band he can do whatever he wants and we the fans have no say. He does everything on this album (just about) and with Brad's passing and life in general I'm not surprised it took this long. Plus he is 66 years old, let's see anybody else try and do as well when we are that age!<br /><br />Final thoughts:  this album is awesome! It takes balls to have something incredible like Boston and rake it in bold new directions with each release and not just play the same tired stuff over and over. Music is something that constantly evolves and bands that have been around since 1976 need to adapt and explore new areas, whether it's pandering to whatever's popular, exploring new areas or both: Life, Love & Hope is a great album and I for one will enjoy listening to it for many years to come.<br /><br />So here's to 2024 (not a typo) and Boston studio album number 7. Hopefully it will be as good or better and we the fans will not have to wait so long, and Tom won't decide to re-redo the Greatest Hits to include Life, Love & Hope on it!
B009JZWO3I|5|Just the right balance of drama, comedy and action. Memorable characters and good actors. Also, I learned a little bit about our judicial system.
B00HCMG6LG|5|Totally enjoy playing with my daughter! Great time doing something fun together!
B003L77FYS|5|As they used to say way back when: The Plot Thickens~!  The cases that Castle and Beckett go on are more complex, as their relationship also gets more complex.  The energy never slows down, gets boring, or any other negative.  It is all high energy and snappy dialog, and lots of FUN!  I have reviewed Season One and Two, and this Season just keeps improving on the ideas that Andrew W. Marlowe originated.  You will note that I mentioned FUN on more than one occasion.  Humor is one of the main ingredients, and all the characters get in the act.  From the Captain congratulating the crew on a case well solved, and then adding &#34;You too, Beckett!&#34; to a startled Kate, and then saying &#34;Just pullin' your chain...&#34;  The characters continue to reveal things that tie more and more events together, making for a wonderful guessing game of what will happen next.  I'm sorry that you might find this series increasingly addictive, but that's what makes it FUN!
0399255370|5|Granddaughter loved it!
B00EI4V3X2|5|Works great is even better to use it when u watch movies
B004BC7MRM|5|You have to love Kid Rock. The man is a genius and a spectacular performer. His music is fun and energetic to listen to.
B0094BB4TW|4|So far, I am loving the crispness of photos, the layout of messages/chat.  I love how you can tap on a photo's comments, or a status update without having to go back and start allll the way at the beginning of the newsfeed.<br /><br />I have one major complaint, tho.  You're supposed to be able to tap on the gear icon next to Newsfeed under favorites, to be able to sort your Newsfeed by Most Recent, or Top Posts..when I tap on the gear icon, NOTHING happens! This is annoying. I want to be able to sort my Newsfeed by most recent. I have a feeling MOST PEOPLE do!! Please fix this, Amazon!
B002LFPAUC|5|I could do so many classic quotes from this series, but I wont. A must have for and John Cleese fan, The only down side was this was such a short lived series.  Just thinking about writing this review is bring back so many memories of this classic British comedy. Kind of a cross between Mr Bean and Benny Hill show LOL
B00729GQ0A|3|Decent plot, but kind of dies at the end as she tries to wrap it up. Disappointing ending and Charles goes from being strong to seemingly weak.
B00GRVV29E|4|Relaxing when you have time to relax!  Great for kids amusement. Very colorful images especially on a small 7&#34; tablet
B00HXYKYIE|5|After the twist at the end I want to go back and read it again to see the clues I missed the first read. Besides loving elephants, I always enjoy her books.
0316666343|5|Beautifully written tale of tragedy and sadness.  Then, love and spiritual hope. Another book that has these same themes that I recommend is called I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You.  I also think this is a well written book.  I love these books and rank these two as my absolute favorites. What I especially love about Lovely Bones is that I can picture it as a movie--a darned good one.  I can't wait.
B005CRQ4GU|5|I love this series.  It is really funny and entertaining to the reader. The for the great book Jeff!<br /><br />Lol
B00BAXFDLM|5|What a marvelous world Ann Leckie has created! Fully deserving of all the awards. Can't wait to begin the second book!
1455523550|5|My fiance suggested I read this, he could not have been more accurate on how much i would love it.  I would def recommend anyone to read it before they watch the movie.  I haven't seen movie yet but the book was incredible!!  :-)
B00KA87GCW|4|I just started playing, but am really enjoying it. Not too much fighting, just enough. Easy controls, free game, but I gladly would have paid a small amount for it.
B000FBJAEG|5|Went by fast and wild. Hard to keep all the names straight at first but at the end all things came together.

B00DR0PDNE|5|I use the chromecast downstairs and like it so much I bought one more for bedroom upstairs.  That should show that I  really like this product.
B0034G4P4O|5|Enjoyable movie! They did a good job sticking to the intent of the books.
B0038P59A0|4|If you're the type to nitpick the language, and little details, used in a film like this then this is not for you. This is the 19th century for the 21st century done right. The writing, acting, and special effects are wrapped up in a package that's beautiful to look at. If they were on a ship they would be swashbuckling pirates, as it is this is a grand who-dunnit adventure. Leave the history books at the door.
0316921173|2|I have no problem with authors writing extremely lengthy novels and have read my fair share of voluminous works (Karamazov, Ullyses, The Executioner's Song, Cryptonomicon, The Count of Monte Cristo [Penquin ed. 1300 pp being the longest book I've ever read]). What I've found over the years is that good books leave you unaware of the page count. The good ones do. Good books tend to be interesting. They tend to have interesting characters. This leaves the reader interested. It's something that novelists should, and usually, keep in mind. Wallace forgot it. He is to be forgiven as he was only in or around his late 20's when writing this tome and clearly did not have a clear sense of what the hell he was doing.    'Post-modern' or 'experimental' writing happens to interest me greatly, whether it was written 100 years ago, during the 1960's or in the present. Finnegan's Wake is good experimental writing, as is A Clockwork Orange. These are good books because they were written with a purpose in mind and not written for the sake of writing experimentally. As was clearly the case with IJ. This book is like a smart guy's House of Leaves, which is a dumb guy's Infinite Jest. No story, weak characters, obscenely long footnotes, which are completely misused often times, and just aimless meandering writing going nowhere slowly.    I didn't find the book funny. There are lots of funny books out there that are also considerd to be literary classics. I would use as an example Catch-22 or most anything by Vonnegut. Joyce was amusing in his own way. This was someone without a sense of humor attempting to be funny by creating outrageous scenarios. The scenarios were written in the same monotone voice. Maybe it works with Stephen Wright, but not with this guy and certainly not on paper. Herds of hamsters would be amusing if your kid was writing about them.    Finally, I lived in Allston for a time and the description did not hold true to me. The setting, I realize, was not in the present, but still it lacked realism. This hurt the book for me as well. He would have been much better served having the story take place in a fictional town.    I can't recommend this book for anyone as it is unnecessarily bloated, pretentiously experimental and has no real reason for existing other than satisfying the whims of the author. He should stick to essays, as he is a slightly gifted essayist.
B00GCE3TCE|5|I've never been much of a book reader, but after seeing the movie, I had to read the book. When I do read a book, it usually takes at least two weeks to get through it. I read this book in three days. Parts of it actually brought me to tears. No book has ever done that before. Best movie ever, and best book ever.
B009XIXVU6|5|Hosseini does it again. He is a great story teller and while this one meanders and covers many timelines, the reader is still able to make a connection with the characters. Well worth the read!
B008JGSM6G|4|A nice way to challenge your brain in a relaxing way. Interesting to play. I like the higher more challenging levels best.
0394800192|5|Great book.
0684867621|1|I had not read any Stephen King and picked up this novel as a sample.  A huge disappointment.  The story is weak and contains little suspense.  Given the nature of his success, I assume this work is not indicative of  Mr. King's abilities.
B00005JLK1|5|This movie has a lot of gore in it but thats not all it has going for it the director obviously put a lot of thought into the storyline.  We are introduced to this idea that a cruise ship in the 1950's just disappeared and noone ever found it.  Now in present day the ship is found adrift by a pilot.  A salvage crew goes out in order to pull the ship in and make a lot of money off it.  What they don't realize is that the ship has some plans of it's own for them.  This story has an excellent twist to it and when you hear the little girl ghost say &quot;let me show you something&quot; you had better sit back and enjoy the ride.  An excellent movie overall it also has some awesome extra features on the DVD, be sure to check them out.
B007SGM084|4|i can't believe how captivating as much of it as i've had time to read is. it embarrasses me honestly in wanting to be submissive and just find a strong confident man i can trust but not too much, if you know the feeling. otherwise, this might not be your cup of tea. that is why i gave it only 4 stars. i adore it, but i don't think it's everyone's cup of tea. i adore it so much, i sometimes spook myself out and forget i even own it.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is worth the $0.00! It is super freaking fun and addicting. Only thing is that I wish you could get the hoverboards for less coins. =)-:l<br />Anyway, this game is freaking swagitastic. Get it.
B00992CF6W|3|I love this app, it runs smoothly, but I can never get into a multiplayer match it always says that there isn't any servers I don't know if this is needed for an update or if it is just because I'm on a Kindle Fire HD. And also it always signs me out. But other than that the game is great, but I hope the problems are resolved soon =)
B00C2VIA52|5|Very fun, I enjoy the feeling of getting a really powerful card to destroy my enemies and doesn't ask for money unlike other games, definitely worth it to buy
B000002LAC|4|This album is dated and a little overshadowed by Trio II and the Emmy Lous Harris collection.  Nevertheless, it has some of the sweetest harmonies you can expect to hear anywhere.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|this is the best game you will ever play so awesome and you will here get mad at it!!!get this app!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5|Its Angry Birds, how in the world can you go wrong with it?  Throw the birds, kill the pigs and get your eggs back!
B00IRISI42|4|The title of this book is quite appropriate.  This is truly a fine spy thriller that forces one to forget the real world and become fully involved in an intricate plot that like a maze twists and turns  Quite a good read.
B00HBQWGXK|2|I love all the Reacher books...until this one. I really had trouble finishing it. Boring, blah, dragged on and on...very little action compared to other books. The other books have had a sense of urgency, I couldn't wait to turn the page...I found myself skipping over paragraphs, just to get through the book, to try and get to a &#34;good part.&#34; Which never came. Hoping this is a small bump in the road and the next book will be back to its old ways.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|Awesome better than the one on facebook doesn't crash all the time.
B00C6ZC2GM|3|The show has some excellent points and some irritating actors.  The flashback to the island are very tightly woven.  The characters are like comic book pages...one dimensional.  The only actor who acts with any depth is Tommy character.  I made the commitment so I will see the season to the end...and hope for the best.  BTW does anyone else find character Malcolm unnerving...is something wrong with his face?  And if it is possible, he is a minus one-dimensional.
B008HK3XKO|4|The color and texture of the case material is better than I expected. The stand works very well. The only &#34;con&#34; is if you slide the cover too much to the left before raising it, the Kindle may not turn on automatically. The orientation of the Kindle in the case doesn't seem to matter. Overall it appears to be well made and fits the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; perfectly.
B000V6BE6C|5|this is their greatest album to date. i love every single song on it (and thats saying something!) this has been my favorite CD to listen to for over a year now. i listen to other stuff too, but i always come back to this one. avenged outdid themselves with this album. i could go on and on about it, but you get the gist. this album is absolutely awesome and a must buy.
B000002KE2|5|Without an doubt Black Sabbath are one of the greatest rock n roll bands ever. Black Sabbath Volume 4 shows there leadership in fame, music, etc. I got this CD at fye music which they are rip offs they sell everything at high prices. But I loved this CD and I could go on for days telling you about each song but why? Trust me on this one Black Sabbath Volume 4 is there second greatest album of all time and my favorite song on this CD is SNOWBLIND. This is a must have for anyone you will be rocked out by the end of this CD so enjoy!!!!!!Was This Review Helpful To You????Please check out my other reviews on artist such as SRV, JIMI HENDRIX, VAN HALEN, CLAPTON, MORE SABBATH, ZEPPELIN, THE WHO, AND MANY OTHERS.
B00P7PK6JS|5|This should be a new classic movie for future generations.  Angelina Jolie was super.
B00DJFIMW6|5|These game is great . It's an Awesome addition to my gaming library. I love how it keeps you on your toes. I just wish you can earn more coins for the costumes . All sand all its an wonderful game. It's a must have.
B00T4837W2|1|I cannot rate it because I could not get it to play properly on my Android pad.  I kept getting the first three to four minutes and it would stop.  When I got it to play again it would go back to the original couple minutes.  Tried what was suggested to no avail.  Turned out to be a wasted 4.95.  Most of the reviews I read were favorable. I am now reluctant to try and rent a movie until I can find solve the problem.
B005LJJESY|5|This is such a great movie I've watched it repeatedly. People complain about the graphics but I think they are being ridicules. The graphics are fine, I mean they have to remake Green Lanterns (all of them) from CG. And the Aliens are wicked cool. I think they did a great job on the home world of all the Green Lanterns. You just have to flow with it and its an awesome movie. The plots awesome, the actors are awesome, the story is awesome, and the CG is awesome. It makes for a great movie.
B0071XO8RA|5|One of the best reads I've come across in a long time.  Checked out the story with the free version of Wool 1 and then picked up the entire set.
0440234743|2|I listened to the audio version of this book and found it to be so slow, boring and predictable that I couldn't finish it.  Very disappointing when compared to some of John Grisham's other legal thrillers.
B009CF7JDU|5|One of my favorites--on my top ten list.  This was a restored beautiful digital copy to watch and five stars only go to my top ten!
B007SGLZP8|3|This was a fairly good book after the first 70 pages.  I knew there would be a twist.  I was just not sure until the last 100 pages.  An ok read but he has written better novels.
B0013F1D02|5|Just wonderful!  In bed with a migraine today I decided to watch this movie.  Robert De Niro's performance is a tour de force--absolutely priceless.  Loved Michelle Pfeiffer as the 'wicked witch'!  I admire her for embodying the role & being totally 'ugly'.  Not sure many Hollywood actresses would go for it like she did.  Mark Strong is great as the evil prince--no wonder he was cast in &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; by Guy Ritchie.  I could go on with accolades for each of the actors because no matter how small the role they were all superb.  The scenery is absolutely gorgeous, in particular the Isle of Skye & Iceland.  All in all I highly recommend the movie, just not for little ones.<br />Oh!  My headache is completely gone...
B00LXLM05I|5|Fun dungeon crawler that quickly becomes an obsession!! The basics are awesome and the gem store is very reasonable. If you don't want to spend money to play this game then you don't have to.
B00B2GK4KW|5|Great!
B00A7ZWUJC|5|I Love Rihanna and I love some of these songs.  I will be buying a lot more songs from Amazon from now on.
B007SYWFRM|2|I keep trying to visit other villages and the game tells me either I am not online or to update. I am online and when I do the yes to the update it doesn't work. and there is one challenge that almost requires you spend real money if you want to advance. I also lost over 150000 coins in an instant and still have no idea how. if this gets fixed I might change my rating.
B00VRYCGLO|3|Good game so what.
B00555X8OA|4|I echo the reviews about the book being somewhat dyslexic - it's not quite sure what it wants to be. But, nonetheless interesting.
B00JT6OWZA|5|The game starts out quick, not boring.  Takes an alert mind and keeps moving. Humor is subtle. Really like it.  Hard to put down.
B00BLCHYKU|1|The acting in this show is horrible. The main character is rather annoying and was either not castes corrected or the concept of his character wasnt well thought out. The action is not enough to see past this sub-par performance
142311339X|5|I have not read this book but my two sons ages 14 and 16 have.  They both had big smiles on their faces when they finished reading The Heroes of Olympus.  Both boys were expecting the same old same old, as they have experienced with other book series from other authors, but both were pleasantly surprised by the twists and new characters in the book.  A big \\"2\\" thumbs up for the latest novel by Rick Riordan!
B004TTHLBE|5|This book is that first of its kind that I have read. I enjoyed each page, even if I did not grasp exactly how complex the plot was at the time. I picked up this book because it was assigned reading for a class. I now recommend it to people who enjoy good books.
B0040I09RM|5|Great show, great storytelling.
0062297228|4|I ask myself if I enjoyed the book simply because it was a new &#34;Hercule Poirot&#34; story or that the book itself was good enough.  I find myself falling somewhere in between.  It was nice to see the Belgian detective once again using his 'little grey cells' to bring a criminal to justice, but it does seem the plot is probably a bit more convoluted than it needed to me.<br /><br />While taking a break from his regular lodgings, Poirot has gotten into the habit of frequenting a small cafe known for its excellent coffee and meals. One evening a young woman comes running in and tells the detective of her fear that she will soon be killed, but that she deserves her fate and he must do nothing to discover her murderer.  Poirot is horrified by this and begins searching for the woman after she disappears.  Meanwhile, one of Poirot's fellow lodgers, the young Scotland Yard detective Catchpool, is sent to investigate three murders that have occurred that same evening at a well-known hotel.  As the two begin discussing their respective cases they discover that they may be connected.<br /><br />The author does her best to capture the feel and language of Christie's character, and generally succeeds.  However, I find that she tosses in a few too many red herrings and after a while we begin to lose track of things as more and more characters are thrown into the plot.  A couple of the characters that appear throughout the book may be ones the author hopes to bring back in any further books. Also, while the better known Captain Arthur Hastings is mentioned several times, he does not appear in the book.<br /><br />Not great, but any Poirot can be fun. I look forward to seeing if either Hannah or another author brings us more of Christie's wonderful creation.
B004DI7HZ6|5|A Discovery of the Witches<br /><br />\\"It begins with absence and desire. It begins with blood and fear. It begins with a discovery of witches...\\"<br /><br />The Discovery of the Witches is the most fascinating book I have ever read. My God, the amount of knowledge one must possess to be able to write a such complex story.<br /><br />It's not an easy read and don't go in hoping that it is. I think, that in order to completely enjoy and appreciate the story for what it is, and it is a piece of art, in my opinion, you have to have at least some basic knowledge about some of the significant historical events, old books or manuscripts, a little about biology or/and science. You don't have to know the exact details of the events or context of the manuscripts, but you need to at least have heard about dem. The rest is explained.<br />If you think that the chromosome might be some kind of rare plant, that grows in the Amazons, and the DNA is a new boy band, fighting for the spotlight with One Direction, this book is not for you!<br /><br />The story starts with a witch, Diana Bishop, going out and about with her day, doing her research in Oxford's Bodleian Library, going through her everyday routine, but this time, she discovers a very rare manuscript (which actually exists in real life, or existed, to be precise), by accident (?).<br /><br />She is a historian and young scholar at the university, and the descendent of witches. She knows she is a witch, she have known that her whole life, but she refuses to use her magic, because of what happened to her and her family in the past. She wants to be normal. She is aware that the vampires and daemons exists. She can feel them, but refuses to acknowledge dem.<br />The moment she touches the manuscript weird things start happening.<br /><br />Suddenly, she can feel every eye of every witch, vampire and daemon on her. And here is when we meet the vampire and the professor, Matthew de Clairmont. There is a lot of mystery surrounding de Clermont. Even though he is an employ of the university, he doesn't lecture or take on the apprentices. He is known for his studies of neutral mechanisms and prefrontal cortex (whatever the hell that means :-D), and his studies and publications on wolves. Which explains nothing about why he decides to approach Diana Bishop. And that's why Diana decides to dig around for information about him. Why the sudden interest?<br /><br />The more she discovers about him, the more suspicious he looks. But the thing is, Diana have enough secrets of her own.<br /><br />The most amazing thing about this story is the way author describes witches, vampires and daemons. She describes them based on her research, as a historian, and the tales that we (humans) have been passing on to the others, from generation to generation. There are a lot of actual facts. Regardless, if you believe that such creatures exists or not, there were times when people did believe that they did exist.<br /><br />Another thing that amazed me was the way author used historical events, the breakthrough scientific publications and well know classic literature, to twist/super-naturalize it, for it to suit the story, and make me believe that all I knew about it was not as important as I thought it was. It made me believe, that all that, was only a small pieces of the puzzle, of the bigger picture, in the Diana Bishop's and Matthew de Clairmont's story.<br />It was mind blowing.<br />It reminded me a lot of the move The da Vinci Code. That is the only thing that I can compare this book to. In the movie, at the end, outside the church, Tom Hanks says to what's-her-name \\"You know, we never actually found any evidence that Jesus was a \\"he\\" and not a \\"she.\\"\\". Movie ends and you left thinking \\"WTF?!\\". That is pretty much how this book made me feel. It made me doubt everything that I know :).<br />Usually, when I read a book in this genre, I adjust my expectations to sustain degree. I know that there will be either vampires, witches or daemons, that the story is fictional and that anything is possible. But with this story, it was hard to tell where the actual truth ended and the fiction began...<br /><br />This book can be analyzed from many different angles. One might think that it's about forbidden love and overcoming the obstacles. Others might think that it's about more important things like finding the answers to the questions like \\"Who are we? Why are we here? What's our purpose?\\". For me, it's about all of the above.<br />The thing that makes this story so realistic is that witches, daemons and vampires are asking the same questions as we, humans, have been asking for centuries :-D.<br /><br />I don't blame those who gave up on this book halfway through. The first half of the book is slow-paced. Not as in it's boring, but there is not a lot of action going on (fighting, killing, sex and so on). The author goes into a great details explaining things that Diana Bishop comes across or remembers. This book focuses on the fact that knowledge can be just as powerful as the physical strength (Learning, planing, strategizing, then striking). But it suits the story. You can't rush when you are asking such an important questions, right? :-). It have to be properly explained.<br />There are a lot of secrets surrounding two main characters, the mysterious manuscript and supporting characters as well. That is why the story can't be rushed.<br /><br />Even though the book was a 600 page brick and it took me a while to finish, I enjoyed it quiet a bit and can't wait to start the Shadow of Night.<br /><br />\\" Comperi, Comperi' she said.<br />'Merces amb tot meu cor' he said quietly.<br />Al rebeire.

B00004TH7Z|3|Bruce and Adrian rejoin after several solid Dickinson solo albums.  Unfortunately, Adrian is relegated to &quot;Special Guest&quot; status, letting much of the guitar work remain in the far less capable hands of  Janick Gers.  There are several very strong tracks:  The Wicker Man, The  Fallen Angel and The Nomad.  In the good category are:  Ghost Of The  Navigator, Brave New World, and The Mercenary.  The remaining four tracks  are plodding progressive efforts that nevertheless have some redeeming  value.<br />There is no doubt that this is Iron Maiden's best effort since  1988's Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son.  It almost erases the bad memories  from the past 12 years.  Sadly, the production quality is not quite up to  par.  The rhythm guitars are a bit muddy on the heavy parts, and Steve's  signature &quot;up front&quot; bass sound is often subdued and relegated to  bottom end status.  There are also quite a few questionable guitar solos  that bring down the overall quality of the album.

B000066NW0|4|It was very easy to get sick and tired of teen-aged girls singing dance-pop as there seemed to be an endless supply of them for several years.  Finally we have a new artist playing rock, and while one might be tempted to give it high-marks for that alone, the fact is Avril Lavigne earns high praise for her debut album, \\"Let Go\\".  Avril Lavigne was just 17 when she released this album in 2002, and while it isn't perfect or anywhere near the best rock album ever, it certainly was a breath of fresh air.    The album opens very strong with \\"Losing Grip\\", \\"Complicated\\", \\"Sk8er Boi\\", and \\"I'm with You\\" which are the four main singles from the album.  The fifth piece, \\"Mobile\\" was also released as a single, but only in Australia and New Zealand. Though these are all singles, there is still a fair amount of diversity in them.  \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Sk8er Boi\\" both have a bit of a Teen Pop feel to them.  \\"Losing Grip\\" is a heavier piece, and \\"I'm With You\\" is a ballad.  \\"Mobile\\" is a bit of a reach as a single, but is a decent piece and falls somewhere in the middle.  Next up is \\"Unwanted\\" is another heavier piece, and gives the album some depth with a solid piece which is clearly not a single.  \\"Tomorrow\\" is the midpoint of the album and one of the weaker pieces on the album, but still not a bad song, and once again it offers a bit of diversity from the harder style rock which is what most of the album is.    \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" brings the quality back up, and starts off a string of Teen Pop songs.  \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" falls into the same category somewhat, and is another solid contribution to the album.  \\"My World\\" is another teen angst piece, and continues with the Teen Pop feel of the second half of the album.  \\"Nobody's Fool\\" brings some more diversity to the album, with some mini-rap sections by Avril.  It is one of the weaker pieces on the album, but one can appreciate the attempt at having more than one sound.  \\"Too Much to Ask\\" is another weaker piece, but as with all the pieces on the album it isn't bad and doesn't detract too much from the overall effort.  \\"Naked\\" closes the album and is a little stronger than the preceding two pieces, but overall the second half of the album isn't as good as the first.     This is a very strong debut album for Avril Lavigne.  She co-wrote all the songs, some of them with Clif Magness, others with a group called \\"The Matrix\\", a couple with Sabelle Breer and Curtis Frasca, and then one with Peter Zizzo.  There is a fair amount of diversity in sound and her voice suits all the pieces well.  Overall, this album falls somewhere between 4 and 4½ stars.
B007REV4T8|4|Some beautiful photography, good performances, and real stunts help to make this newest Bond film worth watching.  But it's not quite up to the top Bond entries because of stale and overused plot contrivances in which the otherwise interesting villian uses computers and hacking as his weapons of choice.  The best Bonds set standards rather than follows them and frankly computer hacking is lazy scriptwriting.  Still, kudos must be given to the sheer flair in which many of the sequences are delivered, particularly the scenes in Shanghai and Scotland.  There are also a number of homages to other Bond films that are fun to spot.  Recommended surely, because it's so well made, but the sum of its parts are better than the whole.

0812550757|5|<BR>   This is the book where Orson Scott Card's talents really shine through. No one does emotional/ethical dilemmas like Card.<BR> <BR> The storyline: Ender Wiggin has become publicly known as The Speaker for the Dead - a new identity he created, after he is viewed as committing genocide against an entire alien race, after the end of the Bugger wars. Even though he saved the entire human race from certain destruction, the revisionist history makers have turned public opinion against him. The Speaker for the Dead offers his services on the interstellar communication network. Ender travels from planet to planet using lightspeed travel, which keeps him physically young but a tremendous amount of time occurs on earth, so most people assume Ender Wiggin is dead by now. <BR> <BR>   The story takes place on the planet Lusitania, where a alien race called the pequeninos is being studied. When one of the scientists studing this alien race has been killed in a ritual ceremony, the widow requests the services of The Speaker for the Dead. The idea is that a Speaker for the Dead comes and lives with the family of the deceased for about a year and goes to work were the person worked. The Speaker interviews all the co-workers, friends, teachers, and relatives of the deceased - anyone that knew the person. After about a year or a year and a half, a second funeral is held. All the community gathers together to hear the Speaker tell of the persons deepest hopes, fears,and aspirations. The Speaker tries to explain what drove the person to do what they did, with complete candor and total honesty. All the persons secrets are laid bare before everyone. The core idea is that we are a different person around different people. You talk and act very differently around your grandmother than a person does with their beer drinking buddies. You act different around your lover than you do around your friends. In essence, we have so many facets to who we are that no one person ever sees them alland truely knows who we are. <BR> <BR>   What make this book a facinating read is this: there is a small community of only around 150 humans studying this alien race. The entire planet is under quarantine. There is a degenerative virus that is highly contagious - a vacine has been created that slows the progress of the disease down to a crawl - it will take 10 years to kill you instead of a few weeks - but there still is no cure. So once you go down you don't come back -a blockade of battleships ensures this. The humans are confined to a fenced off area of about 2 square miles - this is all the area the humans have been given so that contact with the pequeninos is extremely limited - so their culture is not contaminated by the human presence. Only a small handful of scientists are allowed to make direct contact and study the pequeninos. <BR> <BR>   Ender falls in love with the widow of the man he has came to be Speaker of the Dead for. Ender discovers a terrible secret that will destroy the woman he loves and deeply hurt her children. So the dilemma that Ender has is this: Do you destroy yourself or the person you love? Ender is such a person of incredible integrity that he values the truth above all else. If he reveals the dark secret he has discovered it will severely damage the two two main groups of scientists working on the project - including the woman and her children who he has grown to deeply love. But if Ender didn't reveal the secret would betray his most deeply held values. It would be denying how he has defined his very core being from the beginning - he would have to throw out the essence of himself - because he could not live with the inner conflict.

B00000612P|5|Once upon a time, Rod Stewart was actually a respected singer. Even more surprising than that is how he once deserved his respect. This disc is the culmination of that, and the best album Stewart ever was involved it, be it solo, with the Faces, or during his sadly overlooked stint with the Jeff Beck Group.<br /><br />As far as classic title tracks go, things don't really get much better than this album's. Six minutes of pure, unadultered rock 'n' roll - while there's not an electric guitar in sight, he rocks with the best of them. And those lyrics... damn, THAT'S how ya play rock 'n' roll: Loud, fun and sleazy. Things mellow out considerably with one of the many covers on this album: the lovely, underrated Seems Like a Long Time. Nobody's gonna beat the King's version of That's All Right anytime soon, but Rod does a spectacular, rockling job here, and the surprise coda (I won't give it away) is bound to catch you completely off-guard. Next up is his cover of Dylan's Tomorrow is a Long Time, and I'd say it's the weakest link. But hey, look at its competition! Still a nice little song, but doesn't compete with the other tunes.<br /><br />Side two has got to be one of the best sides in rock history. First up is Maggie Mae, Rod's signature song. His funny, sly tale of loving an older woman NEVER gets old. Then there's Mandolin Wind, his best ballad; and I'm Losing You, his best rocker. Pure, unadultered chaos. The Temptations did a good version of this song, but this one's so much better... he turns that thing inside-out. And things close up with Reason to Believe, a ragged, good-natured ballad with some of Rod's best vocals.<br /><br />Okay, so Rod's descended into a walking self-parody at this point. But back while he was actually a legitimate artist, he was awesome.
B001POX73C|3|A cute historical romance, and well written. It was hard for me to get into because I couldn't identify with any of the characters - they are all rather vapid and self-centered. Nonetheless, still a good story.
B007K3JFUQ|5|Everyone in the family has watched this move. Was at a good price and plays nice. I will recommend future purchases.
B00821OX98|5|I watched seasons 1, 2 and 3 in a &#34;binge&#34; this month, and I enjoyed how the story arcs really hold together like chapters in a book. Great writing. Great characters. So sad when characters die. Special effects are stunning for a t.v. show.

B00DPKQ60A|5|I've loved Ariana Grande since I saw her on &#34;Victorious&#34; but I didn't know she could sing until I saw her singing on the show background. She sounded fabulous! I finally got to listen to her sing and I was just blown away. First of all, she does not sound exactly like Mariah Carey! There is a slight resemblance but personally, I prefer Arianas' voice! Her voice (in whistle tone) is pretty, pure and full. Mariah often sounds like she's struggling some. She has great moments though! I still prefer Ariana, though.<br /><br />ALL the songs are GREAT. My favorite is &#34;Almost is Never Enough&#34;, which is a duet she did with Nathan Sykes. BEAUTIFUL. I also, love her music videos. All are beautiful and not trashy. She is bringing that fun spirit back into music, which I adore! So many artists keep putting out sex, sex, sex or heartbreak songs, etc. It's refreshing to see a young woman just having fun, laughing, enjoying life and being CLASSY while doing it!<br /><br />On top of it all, Ariana is a sweetheart. She really is an amazing person. She's so kind and lovable. She's a lady and sophisticated. This young woman is more than worth supporting and I always will! Love you Ari!
B0054JZC6E|5|I thought it would b really stupid but it actually think it is really fun and fun and addicting I highly recommend. it
B008K8VDPU|4|5 star next update with USB MIDI keyboard.
B00003CWN2|5|From the movie making perspective, it is an excellent movie that depicts the reality of foolishness and selfishness in human beings through the  inspiration of a true but brutal story.  <br />The overall brutality had been  handled with extreme subtlety.  The violence happened in a flatline but  tragic condition.  The romances even elevated the intense emotions carried  out through the murder scenes.<br />However, this movie remains to be a  fiction produced by the moviemakers.  The real truth of the tragedy had  been covered up and polished.  Some irrelevant scenes had been added in  order to enhance the sadness and the confusion, such as Lana Tisdel present  at the murder scene.  That makes the movie a shakesphere fiction, rather  than a movie based on true story.<br />If the moviemaker had inserted some  comments about the added fictionalized parts, this movie will truly be a  success in any perspective.
B00K0OI42W|5|This is a classic and should stay a classic.
B00AF6MF9I|5|this game is great for passing time but you have to be connected to wick 24/7 so it can restrict you sometimes
0316098329|3|The story was ok, but I really found it tedious to read since the 5 year old is the narrator.  Often entire paragraphs are written in broken English and I had a difficult time getting through that.  I choose a novel because I want to relax and enjoy a good read, not because I want to plod through poor grammar.  As I stated before, the plot is entertaining and very thought provoking, but be forewarned that it may take some effort to get through the language.
B007HC3LHS|5|I choose a 5 star rating because I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, although it took me a while to get into the back and forth.  I was once married to a man who was diagnosed as having psychological sick jealousy, not such a degree as Lee though.  I am not squeamish and my favorite genre is horror.  One of the few (very few) books I have read that Amazon lets us have for free or for .99 cents that was like finding $20 on the street when we least expect it.

B000HKW7E0|5|Well worth watching...
B000Z1LOBI|5|I own the re-release by Prosthetic. Oh man! This is full of crunchy riffs and powerful grunting vocals from Chuck Billy. You bet it is like no other Testament release, but these guys excel on this thrashy death metal variant anyways. Just the energetic \\"The Burning Times\\" is worth the price of the entire album! Production-wise, this is just perfect. The rhythm section is intense and pounding, and the guitar riffs will get you air-guitaring until your wrists will melt.  However, it's a shame there are not too many flashy solos (I do miss Skolnick) and that \\"Hatreds Rise\\" sounded to me so close to Scorpion's \\"The Sails Of Charon\\". But besides those two very minor flaws, this is enjoyable... as hell -- he, he. Crank it up to eleven, bang your head and you'll see... It's just so nice when artists dare to throw you a curveball! Just hit it now out of the field... Great release. ROCK ON, TESTAMENT!!!
B0031RAOVY|2|Sad movie, not very attention-keeping!  Would not care to watch again.
B00MNYTWMI|5|The great thing about this game is that the player is directed from scene to scene from within the game. That's the main use of the strategy guide in other hidden object games. You don't need it for finding the hidden objects, not if the game developers have done a decent job of hiding them. I say nothing of those who cover the scene with heavy black shadows, list only black objects, and hide them in the black shadows, having scaled them down to almost microscopic size, because I quit playing those as soon as I discover it, having summoned the wrath of all the game playing gods upon their cheating heads. If you look at the solution for the mini games, it takes all the fun out of playing them. Midnight Castle is sharp and clear, the hidden object scenes are challenging but fair, you are directed from screen to screen, there are no mini games to interrupt the flow of the story. If you're a hidden object fan, get it at once!
B004XJRQUQ|5|This book was so good. I couldn't put it down. One of my favorite books by far. All of the action was great and me  interested.

B005544TRQ|5|Very entertaining and stimulating
B000060P79|1|Ok. Let me tell you something. I am not punk. I dont claim to be punk. but once this is for sure. This CD does not even come close to punk. These songs are aimed at kids? I'm 12 and I know a sellout when I see it. This band has nothing behind their corporate masks. You want punk? do NOT look to blink 182, sum 41, simple plan, good charlotte or NOFX to get it. if you want real punk with substance, look to The Stooges, Ramones, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag or, if your a moderner look to The Distillers or The Lot Six. These bands are real. Simple Plan has nothing. trust me. Unless your a kid whose selling yourself out big time, or an adult who already has, steer clear of this sh**t.
B000W9DSVW|5|I'm very happy with the purchase! It's in excellent condition and I'd buy another copy to give as a gift.

B0009UC810|3|What is The Blues Brothers? It's a mess of a movie. It's entire plot and premise can be summed up in one sentence. It's about 40-minutes too long. It's very inconsistently funny. So why is this movie considered a classic? Well, it does have a few things going for it. It features John Belushi in one of his few cinematic outings before his death. He and Dan Aykroyd both perform their own vocals in the music scenes and have surprisingly impressive pipes. Their backing band is energetic and fun, as are the large number of musical guests including James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, and John Lee Hooker. John Candy, Carrie Fisher, Twiggy, and Frank Oz are among the surprising guest stars. All of the musical scenes are great fun, especially the country bar and the Palace Hotel Ballroom scenes. The mall car chase is now an iconic comedy scene and the chase scene of epic proportions at the end is undoubtedly the film's high point. All of these positive aspects, plus some above average camerawork from Landis and Stephen M. Katz, are dragged down by a bloated runtime and a story that takes too long to begin, and when it does, it's almost over. It's no surprise that Aykroyd's first version of the screenplay was a 324 page, free-verse 'tome.' Over its two and a half hour runtime, the film evokes only a handful of genuine laughs, a disappointment considering the fact that it's a comedy by SNL comedians. The Blues Brothers may be short on laughs and too long, but there is just something about this mess, much like Popeye, that makes it ultimately appealing.
B009LMTDL0|5|Good read
B007SGM084|5|Love it
B004BSFC46|5|We recieved so many gifts with the birth of our first daughter, and many were toys. Well, this one bet them all! My daughter is 9 months and this is still one of only two toys that can make her stop crying in an instant and smile. (The other \\"toy\\" that can do this, oddly enough, is the stapula from the baby bullet. Its small and perfectly fits in her hand. She loves to weild that thing around and hit all sorts of things to listen to the different sounds. Ha!)<br />Bottom line: this toy is so good I am buying a second one in case, *gasp*, she ever loses it!
B00005QZ7U|5|This is one of those movies where you either love it or loathe it; there is no in-between.  It just so happens, I loved it.  Not only is it visually stunning, but the music is utterly amazing.  Ranging from Queen, the Police, and Nirvana, to Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Patti LaBelle, and the Beatles, Moulin Rouge captures some of the best music ever written.  Heck, this film even steals from Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music.  Even if you didn't like the movie, you have to admit that the soundtrack is awesome.  At any rate, Baz Lurhmann proved, yet again, he is one of the most innovative directors today.  Nicole Kidman plays the beautiful courtesan Satine, AKA \\"The Spakling Diamond\\" who falls in love with the penniless poet Christian, portrayed by Ewan McGregor.  The audience learns early on that Satine is dying, but this is kept hidden from both Satine and Christian, as they struggle to keep their passionate love affair a secret.  I reccommend this film to anyone who enjoys musicals, love stories, or both!!  A great supporting cast includes John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, and Richard Roxburgh.  All performances are \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\".  And who would've thought that the same kid from Trainspotting could belt out \\"I Will Always Love You\\" just as well as Whitney Houston?!?!  I enjoyed this film, and while it's definitely not for everyone, Moulin Rouge is a film I would highly reccommend to those who enjoy tragic romances or films with great music.
0938045768|4|This is a great book explaining the benefits of bodyweight training. The choice of 6 basic exercises is also good, and they make sure you have a balanced workout.<br /><br />The major flaw is in the progressions the author lays down for each of the 6 exercises. There are four exercises where, at a certain point, you need to switch from two-sided to a one-sided variation. This is too big a transition; I have not been able to make them, and from what I read on the internet, I am not the only one. I used the webaites by Al Kavadlo and beastskills.com for better instructions on these progressions.<br /><br />Another omission is that you will lack flexibility for a number of these progressions (especially the pistol squat and bridge), and the authors tends to neglect hat. More attention to that in the description of the progressions would have been helpful.<br /><br />But, as a motivational guide to bodyweight training, this is still a great book.

I stayed up \\"one more chapter\\"ing until 3 am everyday, I strongly suggest you give the book a try. The author writes the characters so well you feel like you have them figured out, then you get hit with a major twist! If you like mystery, thrill and love, you will love Gone Girl!

0385006896|3|As a fan of Sherlock Holmes, I really liked reading the four novels and fifty-six short stories contained in this book. However, the type is smaller than I would have liked so if you have poor vision I would advise you purchase the novels separately. Also, after reading through the book a second time, the binding started to warp and a few pages came out. Therefore, if you plan to give this book a lot of use, it might not last.
B00001ZULV|4|I admit that I came to Genesis after the departure of Peter Gabriel, which means that I was listening to top 40 Genesis versus the more challenging music attempted by Peter Gabriel. Despite the lack of experimentation and depth, Genesis did turn out one serviceable song after another, and a few of these songs are excellent.<br /><br />This CD focuses on the Phil Collins years, which makes sense from the title, \\"The Hits\\". As I noted above, Peter Gabriel was trying for a more cutting edge and artistic sound that some consider to be progressive rock. Typically that type of rock doesn't make for commercial hits, though the music is often artistically better than released singles. The CD also includes one song from the post-Phil Collins years, \\"Congo\\". Thus there is at least an attempt to represent Genesis throughout the group's existence.<br /><br />I was surprised to hear more keyboards in these songs than I remembered hearing. One of the characteristics of many popular 80s groups was their heavy reliance on synthesizers and other keyboards, and Genesis was no exception. As an example, \\"Abacab\\" from 1981 was strongly keyboard oriented.<br /><br />From the title, this CD must focus on Genesis' hits, and it certainly does. \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"I Can't Dance\\", \\"No Son of Mine\\", and \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\" are among the numerous top 40 hits that Genesis seemed to churn out regularly throughout the 80s into the early 90s. There is much to listen to from these songs, and it's the inclusion of these songs that make this CD perfect for the casual fan. However, there is more on this CD.<br /><br />\\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\" is a reggae-influenced song featuring the original five-member lineup from 1973s \\"Selling England by the Pound\\". This song seems a little out of place in comparison to the predominantly middle-of-the-road pop selections featured on this CD. The intro has a very progressive sound that becomes a flavor as the song evolves. The full-bodied sound is more alternative and challenging than much of Genesis' pop music years.<br /><br />Another song that seems a bit out of place is \\"Congo\\". This song from the post-Phil Collins CD \\"Calling All Stations\\" still retains a pop flavor, but with four members in the lineup and a styling that could recall Duran Duran at the peak of their popularity. I enjoy this song and am tempted to either borrow or buy the CD from which it comes to see whether the other music on that CD is consistent with this song.<br /><br />The last out of place song is a 1999 remake of \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" from 1974s \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\", hailed by some as a great progressive album. Several other reviewers have stated that this song is a great improvement over the original, and wish the rest of the album would be re-recorded. This song does sound good, but it is not a pop song. In some ways I would consider this particular song the best from this entire CD. I have considered buying \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" since it has been compared to other progressive albums I have enjoyed.<br /><br />You know what you are going to get with a Genesis \\"hits\\" CD. The pop was solid, generally very listenable and good; little in the way of breakthrough music. However, at least three of the songs give you a flavor of the breadth of which Genesis was capable. For the casual fan that enjoys Genesis' top 40 music, I highly recommend this CD. For those that preferred Genesis before Phil Collins became the lead vocalist, you may want to stick to buying the albums from the Peter Gabriel era.d is more alternative and challenging than much of Genesis' pop music years.<br /><br />Another song that seems a bit out of place is \\"Congo\\".

6305807043|5|The most unique movie I've ever seen in my whole entire life. I've never seen anything like it. I didn't know exactly what to think. But I'll tell you about it and maybe you can get something out of it.<br />A puppeteer named Craig Schwartz (John Cusack, who's great as always)gets a job in a business building on the 7 1/2 floor. He confides in the very tempting coworker Maxine (Catherine Keener) who shrugs him off thinking he's a loser. After finding a port hole in the mind of actor John Malkovich, Craig gets Maxine into his schence to let others in to Malkovich for $200 a trip. Craig's frizzy haired animal loving wife (played by Cameron Diaz, you can barely notice her in this great role) wants to go back in Malkovich more than once and likes the idea of being a man, and decides she wants a sex change and falls for Maxine, who Craig fancies. Hence, chaos, Maxine falls for Craig's wife, Lodi, but will only have relations with her through Malkovich. <br />This movie is the most original film of the year. I think the message in this film, at least for me was that we should be happy with are and not hold other people above us and just be happy with what we have and who we are. Because if you try and be someone else you'll end up like Craig Schwartz....(see the movie)<br />This movie has a wonderful supporting cast featuring Orson Bean, Mary Kay Place, Charlie Sheen, and cameo appearances by Sean Penn, Andy Dick, Gary Sinise, Winona Ryder and many more. But look quick, they don't pop! out at you. All in all it's a great film with some good points, some funny scenes and NEVER a loss of energy. It just keeps going and by the end you want more, which I think is a good element in film. Leave the audience wanting more......
B00FAPF5U0|5|I just cant leave  it alone.  Its good thing I run out of lives or I would still be there..
B000B8IA2G|4|Stargate: Atlantis was my first brush with the Stargate franchise - aside from having caught the dismal original movie on air - and I honestly didn't expect much. Being a huge science fiction fan, I expected to have seen most of it done better before. Well, it's all been done before, but never quite like this. The series takes all the clichés and stock plots, and put its own spin on it entirely. It has charm. It knows its own weaknesses and doesn't hesitate to throw a few wry comments into the cam. The characters are marvellously flawed and realistic most of the time, and delightfully witty to boot. The plots are hackneyed and old, but executed to near-perfection, and strung along into a coherent arc.  It's not the most original thing in the world, but it's fresh. If you're not a die-hard SF fan, you most likely won't be converted, but if you're new to the genré and like what you see, this ought to be your first stop, and if you're already fed to bursting and starting to get sick of Star Trek and Doctor Who, then this might just remind you why you loved them in the first place.

0345807294|5|I purchased this book on audio for a English class & it was by far one of my best books I've read thus far!!! I honestly felt as though I was watching a movie. I listened and sometimes I would go along with my hard copy as well! Will recommend this to all my friends. We are now in the Transparency time...
B00J4S962W|5|nice
B001DF6GVS|5|This album is amazing!  The extra track (#12) is nothing to write home about, but this is easily the best rock album of 2008...and it's even better on vinyl!
B008OIQYTG|5|Looks and sound great...Ordered it for dad, and he loved it. I personally would have been happier if the fact that it comes in Digipack was better outlined...
B00006AFUR|5|Just buy it, you won't be dissapointed. It is truly original from start to finish and will captivate you the whole way through. Don't be turned off because the frontman (Jared Leto) is an Actor (see him in Panic Room with Jody Foster), in my opinion he is one of the best rock vocalists out there right now. The vocals soar, the guitars are on point and the bass/drums/synth come threw with a mission to enthrall. A must have for any rock lover who needs something new and wonderful for his or her collection. Buy it and welcome yourself to the universe!
0679879269|5|I read the first book in this series when i was in sixth grade, and  finished the last one in Ninth Grade. I loved them then and loved them now (hell, i've read the whole trilogy four times). But recently i have gained a whole new appreciation for them. Having become enamoured in Nietzschian philosophy i have found numerous relations between the message in The Amber Spyglass and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Pullman's view of whats wrong with christianity is essentially the same as that presented in Zarathustra. Both present  the idea of living for a world that for all you know is not there as an effront to life itself and all it has to offer. These are the preachers of death. The depiction of the fallen angels as friends of wisdom is also a very Nietzschian idea.
B00I2TV3NO|4|very entertaining. Suspense
B0002V7OI8|4|I strongly disagree with the Amazon Editorial review written by David Chute.    For a film that is now a decade old, Deep Impact still proves to be a powerful, topical film driven by emotion rather than special effects. Granted, it's not perfect. In fact, some viewers will guess several of the plot twists long before they arrive. Predictability and flaws aside, it's still an emotional journey worth taking. Deep Impact is one of the better films of its genre, and is certainly far more enjoyable than \\"Armageddon\\", the film it is most often compared to.    If you enjoy your disaster pictures with an emphasis on character depth, I highly recommend Deep Impact. If all your looking for is a special effects driven action flick, then look elsewhere.    JM
0061854549|4|I liked the book. The experiments the author describes a quite interesting. I would have skipped the chapter about the \\"sexual arousal\\"  experiment. It is not because it is pushing the limits but more because it  is so glaringly obvious. There are probably hundreds of jokes on the topic  which corroborate the conclusion of the experiment.    Also the experiments are performed on college students mostly which is not  a correct representative sample - but the author acknowledges this.  Overall a good read - my expectations were that this is a book written  by a Nobel price winner - I had confused the author with another behavioral economist who got a Nobel proce a couple of years ago.  Compared to the expectations I was a little disappointed - since I was expecting a Nobel price level book. But overall a good book.
B0087ITBPC|4|A mother/son road trip movie is sort of an uncharted journey in the film world. That made this a very unique film from the start.. Based on an actual road trip that Fogelman took with his mother is probably what makes the movie so real. Streisand and Rogen have great chemistry and since the movie is 80% just them, that is a godsend. Joyce's constant need to interfere with Andy's life in almost every aspect drives him crazy until an explosion of unexpected drama on the part of mother and son. There are so many funny lines and situations that the theatre was filled with laughter often. The movie could also take a very serious, moving turn which can move you to tears.<br /> Streisand has always been an actress of immeasurable range from musicals (Funny Girl) to comedy (What's Up Doc?) to drama (The Way We Were) with each type being a blockbuster hit.  In her semi-retirement she works very seldom.  It took them a year to convince her to come back to her first lead role in many years.  Her Joyce is perhaps one of the most real characters she has ever played  Stripped of glamour she wears track shoes and sneakers.  She is just a regular mother who lives for the happiness of her son.  Rogen has rarely played such a straight character as Andy.  Anne Fletcher has brought out the best of them both.  The climatic showdown is pure real dramatic that Streisand delivers with a powerful punch that stuns the audience as much as Andy.<br />. I liked everything about this film and can't wait to see it again. Don't skip the end because there are a lot of clips after the credits of mother and son banter that is very funny.<br />This is a great film for parents and grown children. I wish my mother was still alive- I'd love to take her to see it.
B008JFUTUY|5|I chose this rating because the lyrics and melodies of Rodriguez appeal to me viscerally. Being a child of the sixties and coming from a city in the northeast, it reminds me of the things I saw and heard growing up. Nostalgic is a good descriptor!!
B00FFT1BJ0|5|Excellent music.
B008Y7B3NY|4|Wonderful story line, grandchildren and I enjoyed it very much.
B00AFROVQC|3|Good story line. Very easy read. Would be great for a young reader.
B00C7DGRL4|4|Very good action; enjoyed the show.  :)
B000JML90Y|5|This book is truly required reading for any biology teacher, but for students in high school it may be a bit yet trying. I would recommend Ernst Mayr for AP or anything by Sean Carroll for something more accessible and up to date for students, and leave this as an important piece of science history.
B004XJRQUQ|5|I loved the books but I think buying the individual books for the kindle is a much better idea than complete sets.
B002U3CCF6|5|Great story line, writing was a bit meh but I got over that. She seems to be able to grab your attention from the beginning and all the way till the end.
B006LSZECO|5|A really good read that keeps you guessing!
B00008J2DQ|5|Everyone of their songs on their cd's are amazing i dotn knwo what it is about it but it makes you keep on listening i've had their cds for years and i still listen to them over and over again. Sully Erna has an amazing powerful voice and is good at anythign he sings cuz i've heard some covers of other songs that Godsmack does and they are awesome. they had their new cd faceless come out on 4/8/03 and sold many many copies i can see why.
B001VSZ7RQ|5|Well, I was never really a Keith Urban fan because I'm not really a listener of country music, but having said that, this album, this singer has won me over to his side. I'm not saying I'm country now, but what I am saying is this album is so good that it made me interested in listening to everything he's done and so I am now officially a Keith Urban fan. It takes a really good voice; creative writing and good music to win me over and this album, this man did all that and more on this CD. It's worth every minute you spend listening and every dollar to buy such an inexpensive good time.
B00634GHJA|2|Why would anyone use this? I can take a picture and send it to any device anyway, without a special app. Seems dumb. Its like &quot;hey check out this app, it lets you make a phone call.&quot;
B00MUCX6AW|3|Above average movie experience.
B006VRDZ44|4|I love the prohibition setting. However, this story line a little hard to follow. My boyfriend and I were constantly asking each other questions on who is who half way through the season. I will be watching the next season.
0736430512|5|Frozen is the best books by far. My grand daughter loves them, she is 7, and really enjoys reading them all.  A must for all children to read.
B00TOMSZCU|1|It needs instructions.
B00I2WNYJW|1|What I read was not going to take me where I wanted to go. Not interesting.
B00AW57L96|4|Makes you think about the &#34;what could have beens&#34;. Slow start but once it picked up, the book became a real page turner.
B00FF8OKJE|5|Pretty good but I want to see the battle
B009FZHYKU|5|I love all the characters  and cannot wait to see the next season.  I wonder what will become of this larger group
B0091X2K0A|5|I have officially seen this movie 8,637 times, not that i'm counting or anything. I've probably seen it more than the first matrix movie, Big Lebowski and even Jay and Silent Bob Strike back which are also favorites. Stanley kubrik is a GOD. Sgt. Hartman in the first 1/2 of the movie is priceless. I now have healthy man-crush on Sgt. Hartman.<br /><br />You need to turn in your man card if you don't know these quotes by heart and there are so many daily situations we find ourselves in to which these apply. Bonus man-points if you can say them in Hartman's voice where applicable.<br /><br />Is that you John Wayne? Is this me?<br /><br />Did your parents have any children that lived?<br /><br />You had better square your a*s away and start sh*ttng me tiffany cufflinks or I will definately f*ck you up!<br /><br />I bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hose.<br /><br />Well, baby, me so h*rny. Me so H*RNY. Me love you long time. You party?<br /><br />not sure if its sad or awesome that I just typed those all out from memory....
B000UZQI0Q|5|Sanderson has done it again. And I loved it. It's just, the ending bring the whole of the book together. I am geniuley shocked at how much he can fit it and price together at the end. Its fantastic.
B007IXWL2C|5|This book was a great close to the fifty shades series and had more adventure and details that I think weren't there in book 2.
B008Y6UNT0|5|I am not one to try movies as most of them end up disappointing me that I gave them 90 - 120 minutes of my valuable time. But this movie was different. Excellent story line, and very well produced, directed and acted. It got me glued to my seat within the critical first 20 minutes. After watching it on Friday and rewatched it on Sunday night the second time, knowing this time the ending. I enjoyed the movie even more. It has been added to the list of 20 or so movies that like to watch over and over again.
B0064X7FVE|5|I think is app is the best. It is always correct and it has a better flow about it than most other weather apps. Easy to use to.
B00FB13Y74|5|When I got this and played it I had surprised to see that this was a pretty good game and I play it a lot
B00BGIBVRG|4|This movie was fun and made me appreciate the 40's. Getting older actually does have its perks. Movie was light and amusing.
B00E5Q1HJS|4|As an old time term fan and someone who suffered through some of the old trek movies I enjoy the modern touch even if it is not always faithful to what I remember from  the TV series.  For pure enjoyment you can't go wrong.
B00007BKVC|5|Thelma and Louise is a Good Action Road Buddy Film,I found it very entertaining.I Rate This Movie 5 STARS!!!!!
B007EECSFA|5|THE SECRET KEEPER by Kate Morton<br /><br />THE SECRET KEEPER is one of those novels that I cannot explain in words.  The amazing depth with which Kate Morton pulls the reader into the storyline left me dizzy and at times wondering about the world into which I was pulled.<br /><br />In 1959 Laurel Nicolson, then 16 years old, witnessed a murder on her family's farm and Laurel knew she had to keep a secret for fear her family would be torn apart. Little did she know that her entire life was built upon a lie. 52 years later, in 2011, Laurel will be called home as her mother lies dying and Laurel is determined to discover the truth behind that fateful day back in 1959.  Throughout the story we follow Laurel as she uncovers her mother's secret past through journals, photographs and the ramblings of a dying woman.<br /><br />THE SECRET KEEPER takes the reader on a journey that spans close to 100 years.  From the birth of an author to the death of woman whose heart had been broken too many times, the novel is divided into four sections that overlap each other as the story unfolds. Laurel is the daughter of Dorothy (Dolly) Nicolson, a beloved mother and wife, who raised a family and tended her husband with care and pride. But Laurel and her mother kept a secret that Laurel hoped her mother would finally acknowledge the truth.<br /><br />The novel travels back and forth from present day to a time before the start of WWII when Laurel's mother was a young woman in love hoping to start a life with the man of her heart.  Then in a span of a few years down to a few months, the war would claim more than just the victims of a bomb.  Heartbreak and sorrow, betrayal and pain, love and hate all mesh together when the lives of four people will become embroiled in a game of deceit and lies, and in the end, secrets that will be carried to the grave.<br /><br />The characters are as emotionally colorful as they are distractingly real.  You have empathy for a daughter about to lose her connection to the past, but with that comes the realization that everything she thought she knew about her family history had been a total lie. A death bed confession brings about a world of confusion when the mind of a dying old woman cannot be trusted to know fantasy from fact.  But something Laurel's mother said would trigger a waterfall of emotion and memories that start Laurel on a path to discover who was the woman they had all called Ma.<br /><br />THE SECRET KEEPER is an amazing, well-written and emotionally draining look at the family dynamics built on lies and deceit. The character development and world building draws the reader into the storyline as though you were part of the action and conflict.  Kate Morton's look into the lives of desperate people during desperate times and it takes the love of a daughter to uncover the truth of what happened in 1941 and how it affected her family and her life in 1959. I cannot say enough about this amazing story.  I was pulled in and held on for a ride that I will not soon forget.  If you want a recommendation about the next book to read, pick up THE SECRET KEEPER and unravel the mystery alongside Laurel Nicholson as she uncovers the truth behind a life hidden behind a lie started so long ago.ization that everything she thought she knew about her family history had been a total lie.

B000I5SY9Q|5|Certain movies take on broader social significance beyond the number of people who've actually seen them.  Catch phrases enter our culture from movies and people come to understand them even if they've never seen them.  Such is the case with \\"Network\\" a film whose catch phrase \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more\\" has been referenced so many times in popular culture that you know the movie's impact is quite broad and deep.  In fact that clip has become a meme of its own on the internet and YouTube, yet for all the people who grasp the phrase it's shocking how few have actually seen the movie and understand the point it was trying to make as it's one of the best satires ever made and clearly predicted the future of network television and media in general.<br /><br />Paddy Chayefsky, who provided the screenplay, had been involved with television since its earliest days, and \\"Network\\" is a look at the changes rippling through that industry as the first generation of pioneers gave way to the next and the tensions which result.  Television veterans such as division president Max Schumacher (William Holden) and anchor Howard Beale (the incomparable Peter Finch) find themselves at odds with a new generation of programmers like Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) and managers like Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) who want to radically reshape and remold television, and especially the news division in a more commercial way.  What ensues is the news division being subsumed into the entertainment division and a watering down of the reporting, a nod to the \\"infotainment\\" formula that would occur many decades later.  Chayefsky's screenplay clearly pointed towards what was coming in an astonishingly prescient way and the dialog is perhaps the sharpest satire I've ever witnessed.  The denouement of killing Howard Beale points towards the development of reality television in a way few could have expected.  While \\"Network\\" was satire at the time it ultimately wound up being astonishingly prescient as to what was coming to television.  The ensemble cast is perhaps the best imaginable and it's no wonder it was nominated for so many Oscars and that it won so many as well (for Finch, Dunaway, and Chayefsky).  It has also been selected for preservation by the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for its cultural, historical and aesthetic significance.  One minor complaint is that most prints of this film suffer from a murky and blurry quality that makes the film look like a bad second or third generation copy.  Hopefully someone will properly restore this film to make it look better, but even the diminished quality of the prints doesn't detract from what the film is saying.  Miles ahead of other films released in that era!ing astonishingly prescient as to what was coming to television.

B000ZHBB0Q|5|A CLASSIC. PROBABLY THE BEST COMING OF AGE MOVIE EVER. FLAWLESS. GREAT SCRIPT, GREAT DIRECTING BY ROB REINER. THIS ONE WILL BE AROUND FOR A LONG LONG TIME.

B00FAPF5U0|4|Excellent game
0061537934|5|I was unsure I would like this book - I'm more of a cat person - but it sucked me in from the beginning. What a great story told from a dog's perspective yet quite human. Enzo is near the end of his life and reflects on the journey he has taken, and that of the family he lived with, to tell a story that is at times tragic and alternately heart warming. Always full of love and compassion for those he shares his life with. . . Great book.
0861714911|5|VERY GOOD
B00BD99JMW|4|The series was good and overall the book was good I just hated the ending that's why I gave it 4 stars but I won't spoil it for you.
B000HF6XPY|5|One word: Epic.  This movie is basically the best of the best.  Yeah, graphics arent from 2014, but a good movie is a good movie.
B0071XO8RA|5|Like most people, I love reading product reviews, but never contribute to them.  Why?  Because we're AMERICAN! And we have a right to be lazy! It's in the Constitution or on a cereal box... or something like that. Whatever.<br /><br />However, I was compelled to write this review because Hugh Howey is a great human who also happens to be a great author.  There is not a huge overlap in that Venn diagram  The guy works tirelessly, he is in constant contact with his readers and he is providing a model for future authors to be independently discovered.  Now, none of that would really matter if he wrote terrible books - but luckily for you and I, he doesn't!<br /><br />Howey could charge three times as much as he does for this book and it would still be the best value you'll ever get. Read this book, check out the man's site and then enjoy the rest of your life. I love you.

B00G1J1D28|4|Mr Mckeown is wise beyond his years and I hope he's able to maintain that wisdom. The world has a way of taking that from people. Most of his book is based on a common sense approach to life. I disagree only with his recommendation on hiring, which would likely  result in lowered diversity in the workplace. Otherwise a well-thought out way of living.
B000R7HY0K|1|I have to agree with 99% of the writers out there.  This is such an obvious sellout it's amazing.  I can't remember a bigger screw up than this.  The only thing that comes even close is the first time the major networks played Midnight Cowboy and cut out approximately 40 minutes of the movie.  I may never watch another Tarantino Movie again.

Tapping the button turns it on and displays a power indicator of 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100%.  Tapping it again turns on a very bright flashlight which is handy.  The pack seems to hold a charge well and is good for several device charges.  Does what it's supposed to for a good price.

B000067J1H|5|This is my favorite movie. When I first saw the advertisements for this movie, I figured it was a stupid boxing movie (not to mention that I think Brad Pitt is way over-rated) so I didn't go to see it at the cinema. A couple of years later, I was up late at night and had nothing to do, so I watched it on HBO(or one of those similar channels). I'd forgotten the ads so I had no expectations. I just watched it unfold, seemingly leading nowhere in the first half hour. I've never enjoyed a non-adrenaline movie as much as I did this one. Edward Norton's performance is wonderful. The scene called &quot;Jack's Smirking Revenge&quot; on the dvd, is by itself worthy of an Oscar. Norton is believable in every second of the movie. The story is also brilliant. I read the book a while later and loved it, although I think I would be less pleased with the movie if I'd read the book first. Then I read Chuck Palahniuk's other novels. The man is a genius. Survivor, my absolute favorite novel of all time, is satire at its best. Oh yeah, the quality of the dvd is very good too.

B000002MJ0|5|My Bloody Valentine - Isn't Anything (1988)<br /><br />I would have to say I prefer this album to LOVELESS. The guitars don't fill up the speakers in a strange, otherworldly way quite like they do on that album, but there's still plenty of lush guitar noize to savour. It must be the unrestrained rocking-out which matches the dream pop that I really love - especially on the second side (beginning with \\"Feed Me With Your Kiss\\"). That side really JAMS in a gleeful kind of way - gives me a great feeling. \\"Sueisfine\\" is pretty trippy and I swear they're really saying 'Suicide' which is a twisted thing to gleefully repeat over and over. \\"Several Girls Galore\\" is darker and more sensual with bassier drums to match the seductive female vocals. \\"Nothing Much To Lose\\" is another highlight with absolutely spastic drums that do something different each time they cut loose. This song is one of several that takes dramatic turns, leading the listener to surprisingly different places - a bit like 2 or 3 songs in 1.<br /><br />Side 1 has some real gems on it as well, but I'm not too crazy about the slower songs \\"Lose My Breath\\" and \\"No More Sorry.\\" They're not great musically; they're a bit atonal-sounding in fact. However, I've gotten more used to them in time and actually have an appreciation for them. \\"All I Need\\" is another slow one which might take some getting used to, but its brilliance shines through with its V.U. pulse and shimmering guitar wash. To be honest, Kevin Shields doesn't have the strongest vocal quality, but I dig it nevertheless. These minor drawbacks aren't nearly enough to deny this album the 5 star rating it deserves. An alt-rock classic and every bit as essential as LOVELESS.
B007A2O3FO|5|I always look forward to Maggie Smith. This is a surprise, low level film that has fun characters and an enjoyable plot. Not for the super sleuths, just for fun. Great to See Julian Fellows too.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Very addictive once you get the hang of it. No need to spend any money if you watch how you play
B002QW7AJY|4|One Word AWESOME!!!
B00HL2EOU2|5|well made and proportioned
B001XV3LSS|5|Great movie that immediately overtakes you by the star-intellectual cast, and good visual effects . A must see movie .
B004XJRQUQ|5|Epic. Couldn't put it down. Definitely a must read series. Characters, plots and storyline just keep you going. Fantastic end to a great series, I will surely miss these characters!
0780747550|5|This is not your basic poor kid whining their life away story. If I had read this in high school it may have changed my life. Excellent book club read
B00F7YHDWC|5|If you have a kindle fire you can tap the screen and you will pass.. the plan one.
B002MQYOFW|5|Enjoyed this very much and recommend to anyone looking for a good read.  Haven't seen the movie but love the book.
B003VANOFY|3|It serves its purpose, but i felt it was to sensitive to background noise.  I Think if it had a foam piece over the mic then it would not have picked up background noise. I love the wireless feature, and for $75 dollars it can not be beat. Going wireless is there is no going back to wired ever again.
0439023521|4|The Hunger Games, in my opinion is an excellent book. The characters are well written, it grips you from the beginning and you will not want to put it down.
B00005YXZH|5|This is Wilco's masterpiece album.  If you are just checking Wilco out and you're not sure where to start, start here.  This album strays from the \\"country\\" genre under which ealier Wilco is usually classified, but maintains the flow and focus that is somewhat lost in A Ghost Is Born.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot really shows off the band's stylistic range.  Upbeat poppy songs like Heavy Metal Drummer flow seamlessly into country-like songs such as Jesus, Etc. and darker songs like Poor Places.  The emotional and melodic nature of this album allows the tracks to follow each other easily, and makes the whole album feel like one piece as opposed to 11 separate tracks.  However, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is a little melancholy, so beware if that's not your thing.
B00005JKHP|5|I am really glad that Robert Wise and company decided to go back and put in the new special effects and new scenes that were left out in the rushed 1979 release of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. This is among one of the absolute best &quot;Star Trek&quot; films ever made because you get to see what happens to Kirk, Spock, and crew after their famous 5-year mission in the original series. And plus, you get to see a new side of the U.S.S. Enterprise when they transformed it from a smaller ship (original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series) to an even bigger ship! And also, you get to see a couple of new faces, including Stephen Collins as Commander Will Decker and the late Persis Khambatta as Lieutenant Ilia. Some of my favorite improvements of &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; are as follows:<br />A.) The overture and main title sequences<BR>B.) The color of the sky on the planet Vulcan, Spock's home<BR>C.) Starfleet Headquarters in the future San Francisco<BR>D.) The Enterprise's warp speed sequences<BR>E.) Shots of the Enterprise's warp nacelles inside the officer's lounge<BR>F.) The improved Red Alert sounds<BR>G.) A full shot of V'Ger heading toward Earth<BR>H.) Shots of Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy, Decker, and Ilia outside of the Enterprise as they were heading toward V'Ger's source<br />This &quot;Star Trek&quot; film has pretty much everything that you'd expect from a &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, such as action, a great storyline, and new and improved special effects! And you also get a little romance thanks to Decker and Ilia. This is truly one of the greatest &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies ever made, alongside the other 8 Trek films. And like &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, there will be no other film like &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;...maybe someday.
B00006X06U|5|They are not what you think . They are not what they look like. They do not sound familiar.  This is not a collection of re-sung song but a breathtaking new album featuring old  Joni's moving lirics. The orchestra has deconstructed and reconstructed back again into a different form the \\"old\\" songs. Nothing you will expect will happen. A full male choir moves storming through the Sire Of Sorrow, Sex kills is aggressive and  biting with full orchestra and drumming, Cherokee Luise is as sad as it could possibly be, Borderline is gentle and moving and fluid. I hope  she won't keep her promise to quit singing and composing, she still has a lot to say and we still have a lot to learn.
B005ZOBNOI|4|I was totally surprised when I started reading this book.  It was nothing at what I expected. It was a deep look into the lives of cancer patients, their connections in group therapy.  It reveals what these dear people have to indure and has a little love story evolve.  Very tender and lovely story.  A must read.
B00004R99F|5|It was in great condition not open and is great for the family
B008C20TDG|5|They say it's a life changer. I'm only on day 15 but I think I'm a believer. Sleeping better than I have in years. And, believe it or not, it's not that difficult. Will follow up after I've  completed my first Whole30. Already planning my second. I feel great!
0679720200|5|This is a book I recommend to anyone who claims they liked &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.  Camus acheives the same sort of antihero in this novel, the detached, dispassionate protagonist that intrigues and mystifies us.  <br />This book should be read by all purely for the experience, for it is so much unlike the typical or popular styles that it is good exercise for the mind; in addition, it's a great story, and a classic.  Go get it!
B0063GORYU|5|I love having a game to play off line!!! So whenever I don't have cell phone coverage, I still have a game to play!
B0095ZMMCK|5|Never really slowed down. If you're a Clancy fan you'll likely enjoy this one as well.  I'd recommend it to others.
1451696191|4|I liked this book.  The well-developed characters are real people that I came to know and like. The story unfolds as Charlie, the main character, writes a series of letters to someone the reader knows only as Dear friend. The letters gave me the feeling that I was stepping into Charlie's private world. I got to know Charlie, his family, and his friends and saw the world through his eyes.    Charlie is a sensitive, intelligent, and creative 15 year old high school freshman. He sees beauty in everyday objects and experiences and describes them so the reader feels it also. Yet Charlie is also troubled. He is a social misfit at school. His emotions are sometimes extreme and excessive. The suicide of his best friend, loss of a beloved aunt, and his brother leaving for college affect him deeply.    Charlie's friendship with two seniors - Patrick and Patrick's stepsister Sam - helps to change his life. He learns a lot about friendship, love, and being who you really are.  Without giving away too much of the story I can say that Charlie comes to understand what real love is and the frailty that is part of being human.  Caution - This book contains matures themes.

B000683VI4|5|love this movie
B00M7URUUE|1|Absolutely terrible...complete misrepresentation of the biblical story.
B004LWZW42|5|X-Men has always been one of my favorites. I used to steal my brother's comic books and action figures as a kid. Honestly, I loved this movie. It was well done and had a great cast. I know that there are discrepancies between the movies and the comic books, but it is that way for any book-turned-movie. The discrepancies were easy enough for me to overlook in order to see one of my favorite things come to life.
0316228532|1|I loved the Harry Potter stories and I looked forward to reading something by J.K. Rowling written for adults.  Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the book--in fact, I couldn't get past the first couple of chapters.  It's just too dark.

B002MQYOFW|5|I LOVE this book.  The best part about it is that when you are done with it, you can move on to Book #2 in the trilogy!  I was worried it might be too graphic or gory for my taste, but it is perfectly balanced.
B003VANOFY|5|Needed a new headset after my turtle beach's decided to quit. I wanted to get a wireless, for two reasons: I wanted to be more free to move, and my last to headsets, the wires were what killed them in the end. So, I looked at the two leading headsets: This, and corsair vengeance 2000 (I think) and after looking at them both, I decided to go with this one. I was not disappointed!<br /><br />Build quality - 4/5<br />These look like a very well built pair of headphones, but when you feel them, it's plastic has a feel to it that just feels... cheap. But, I've dropped it once already, and it didn't even leave a mark. However, when I was plugging in the charger with the headset on my head (like a baws) I very easily scratched the plastic around it. Not a huge problem. One problem I do have is the power button. It barely presses in, enough so that you can't feel whether you're pushing it or not. Plus, it's very recessed.<br /><br />Sound quality - 5/5<br />Compared to my rather good Turtle Beachs, this headset blew my mind with its amazing sound quality. I used my headsets not only for gaming, but using Renoise music software, as well as other DAW programs, and it delivers that perfect sound you'd expect from professional studio monitors. Highs are crisp, lows shake like crazy, and mids are in that perfect spot between. The Dolby 7.1 is incredible. I can tell where any enemy is, behind me, to my left, right, and how far away even!<br /><br />Mic quality - 4/5<br />I really wasn't expecting studio microphone quality, but this one just about met my expectations; nothing more than that. The sound is a little tinny, but really, all I needed was to be understood by the other side of the conversation, so, that's perfectly fine.<br /><br />Wireless-ness quality - 5/5<br />I've had 0 disconnects, 0 interference issues, and 0 glitches/artifacts. I am able to get just about my house before it makes a short dubstep sound and disconnects. Not really much else to say here: Works great and as intended.<br /><br />Battery - 5/5<br />Battery lasted about 11 hours on my first regular-use cycle. I do recommend you break in the batter first by charging all the way, running it down all the way, and repeating that 3-4 times.<br /><br />Extras - 4/5<br />The macros are perfect, and even work with my keyboard's MR button. I can press MR, press a macro on my keyboard (and now my headset) and type out the macro I want to set. Then I press MR again, and it's set! This is VERY convenient. however, it will not be that easy unless you have a logitech keyboard with the MR button (I have the G110). One thing I wasn't sure about was PS3 support. I had seen reviews saying that it does, saying that it doesn't, and needless to say, I was getting confused. So, I plugged it in, and it works. Only as a voice chat device, as I was expecting, so no game sounds, plus no macros (obviously), but I wasn't expecting any more than that.ed about 11 hours on my first regular-use cycle.

B00IIUATDM|3|Very well acting but extremely emotionally hard to watch. I gave up half way through.
6305205620|5|You really don't have to be fan of metallica to enjoy this video because in the end it is just superb rock and roll. Everyone keeps saying that this concert seems &quot;unreahearsed&quot;. What? if anything i'm amazed about  how familiar and comfortable they are with every song they play and is it  me or is there a massive, pre-rehearsed stage explosion at the end (sorry  to give it away but its just too good)? You don't have to be a musician to  see these guys are flawless at what they do. I was simply blown away by  Kirk Hammets screeching guitar. He's playing like, a zillion notes a second  yet he doesn't even have to think about it. James hetfields volcals are  superb too. Those &quot;flaws&quot; people keeps noticing are deliberate,  he's just messing around with his voice. The audience are great, simply  RABID! There is a hilarious moment when Lars Ulrich crouches on the end of  the edge of the stage and simply stares at them with a wide-eyed  expression.<br />But anyway, the message is simple: if you wanna rock out or  just see a great concert, buy this DVD... or may the metal gods have mercy  on your soul!
B005GUQYIQ|5|Simon's cat is everything it is to have a cat and then some. His videos are great and his books are just as funny. When I get mad at life in general, I pull this book up on my phone, in a few minutes I'm in a better mood. It really works if you like and know cats. 5 stars!
B009JZTOG8|5|Didn't get the premise of the story at first but once I actually watched this series find it really interesting to have our storybook characters to real life quite appealing.  I hope this series continues a few more years.
B004ZMWUCU|5|This is a story line that many people can probably associate with. How people's past affect their everyday lives, how simple things that most of us take for granted are so far beyond those who have never received the love of family.  Christina McKenna takes the reader through the a turmoil of emotions that underlie a seemingly simple life.  A great read that really has you feeling for the characters.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Another winner by John Grisham. This book is easy to read and is engaging from start to finish.  Can't wait for the next one.
B000069CWE|5|Ok, the main theme of this cd is a &quot;Reanimated&quot; one.  As you will notice, on the front of Hybrid Theory there is a soldier.  Now, on the cover of Reanimation there is a robot.  Also, the songs have new names such as &quot;Enth E nd&quot; and &quot;Krwlng&quot;.  In my opinion the whole point of this is that the songs are &quot;Reanimated&quot;, the names are &quot;Reanimated&quot;, and the artwork is &quot;Reanimated&quot;.  The songs are remixes of the songs on Hybrid Theory, plus High Voltage and My December.  My personal favorites are &quot;1stp Klosr&quot; and &quot;Wth&gt;You&quot;.  These new remixed songs feature some of the top artists from rock and rap such as, Jonathan Davis, Jay Gordon, Chali 2na, and Aaron Lewis. And also some of the best unknown artists such as, Aceyalone and Rasco. This album is wonderful and the music is very interesting an layered, but as you all know, it was very hard to make an album after Hybrid Theory, but Linkin Park did very well, better then you would think.
0439023491|5|I loved The Hunger Games and could not wait to see what happened in Catching Fire.  I was a little worried that after seeing all the hype by people's reviews that I would be disappointed but I still loved it.  In fact, I read the entire thing in one sitting.  After The Hunger Games I was leaning slightly to Team Gale even though we didn't get to see him much.  I was hoping for more during Catching Fire and my one disappointment was probably not seeing more of him again.<br /><br />The story was again a great one.  Katniss and Peeta yet again find themselves having to deal with the fall out of the Hunger Games and the actions they took at the end of it.  Katniss did not realize that her actions may have contributed to the rebellions popping up in the districts & has become a symbol of that rebellion.  The Capitol's reaction will shock the reader and have you sitting at the edge of your seat.  There were a few things I didn't get how they happened but am hoping that is cleared up in the next book as you are again left hanging.  When is the next book coming out?  LOL.
B00FATEJYE|5|Get this awesome game. I been waiting for ever and now it's here. It an awesome game<br />You fight against everyone that why it awesome
B0044DEAUA|4|The only thing I haven't solved about my Buddy is that its signal is so strong, it reaches into the house from the garage, and the Buddy will be ringing in my car and I don't know it.<br />I need to learn to remember to turn the Bluetooth off on my iPhone when I'm home.
B00006M183|5|The privilege of being able to hear the gorgeous 'Thumbing My Way' anytime you like, as many times as you like, is alone worth way more than what you'll pay for this record. And trust me, you *will* play it over and over. <br />Ditto 'Love Boat Captain,' which sounds nothing like you'd probably expect. If you ever saw the old 'Love Boat' tv series with its corny theme song and may be fearing that the guys are going for some sort of smaltz satire with this one, relax. 0% smaltz here - 'Love Boat Captain' is an expertly constructed piece of music. And don't be fooled by that slow Hammond organ opening. The song begins slow and quiet but builds, ebbs and flows and ebbs again. Net result: This song rocks. Great melody, lyrics vintage Vedder philosophy, complete with a nod to another musician philosopher, John Lennon (&quot;all you need is love, love is all you need&quot;). Adding poignancy without being sappy or exploitative is a line referencing 9 fans who died a couple years ago at a rock festival in Denmark during PJ's set (&quot;lost 9 friends we didn't know, two years ago today&quot;). <br />The opener 'Can't Keep' is another terrific addictive tune. Listen to it a few times in a row... by the third or so listening it'll be firmly lodged in your brain forever. Gotta love those minor key change-ups. <br />If you're a serious fan and know your PJ catalog backward and forward, parts of the melody of 'Save You' may bring to mind 'State of Love and Trust' which can only be good. Another great, catchy, all out rock song. Crying shame radios all over America aren't filled with stuff like this. <br />'You Are' gets your attention from the first few notes - get a load of that funky guitar effect! I understand that's a thing (drummer) Matt Cameron brought to the studio. What can I say except IT WORKS! What a cool sound, what a super funked up song. The combination of swirly EV harmonies, a dark melody, and surprisingly romantic lyrics ('I am the shorelines, but you are the sea') make this one strange little love song. Everybody I know who's heard it names it as a favorite on this record. <br />These are just my personal favorite tracks so far. I'll skip going into detail about every track. If you're a PJ fan you already know to expect nothing less than expert playing and singing wrapped around original melodies with plenty of tasty hooks, and those everlovin' EV soulful lyrics. That's what you get here, only more so because there are bigger contributions from all the guys this time around. And if you're not necessarily a big PJ fan but just like real music created by people who obviously would rather be doing absolutely nothing else, you should do yourself a favor and check it out. If you don't come away with at least one new 'favorite song' to add to your personal list, I'd be real surprised. Something for everybody here. <br />As always with PJ: Repeated listenings at worthy volume with headphones for best effect. Gets better every time you hear it.<br />p.s. for those of you who are also'B'... unless I miss my guess, the DQ influence still sneaks in here and there lyrically. Ishmael would be proud!
B0006VBFM0|4|beautiful
B000002UJQ|5|I'm ashamed to say this, but this was the last Radiohead CD I bought. I wish I hadn't been so hasty to give Hail to the Thief 5 stars, because this one is far superior. <br />Airbag - Great intro, as usual. Different from the other songs, but still great. I love it when Thom sings &quot;I am born again&quot;, just the combination of notes is really...just great. Great song.<br />Paranoid Android - Very memorable. This 6 1/2 minute long epic song is one of the highlights.<br />Subterranian Homesick Alien - Meh. Pretty good.<br />Exit Music (For a Film) - Don't really understand this song, pretty haunting melody. Love the last lines. &quot;We hope that you choke, that you choke, that you choke...&quot; Great.<br />Let Down - Very beautiful underrated song. Absolutely LOVE the ending, with the duet. One part singing the chorus, and one part singing &quot;one daaaaayyyyy...you'll know where you aaaaaaaarrrreee...&quot; Beautiful. One of the three best songs on the album along with Karma Police and No Surprises.<br />Karma Police - Another great song. Also love the ending. Great lead in for the next track.<br />Fitter, Happier - Holy S***. This is some pretty disturbing stuff. Really spoke to me.<br />Electioneering - Unusually normal-sounding. But still pretty good.<br />Climbing up the walls - Another disturbing one. Has an &quot;I am pure evil&quot; feel to it. Creepy.<br />No Surprises - Best song on the album, hands down. I can't explain it. It's just pure genuis. Beautiful, peaceful, perfect.<br />Lucky - Ok song. I don't know, after listening to &quot;No surprises&quot;, this one seems kind of...I dont know. Still pretty good.<br />The Tourist - Typical for a closing song, I think. Kind of depressing.
B00BESNKB8|3|Not the best Quinten T. film when compared to Kill Bill films.<br />The action was decent and the humor was okay, overall it's decent.
B0069JBKHI|1|I cannot in good conscience recommend this product to anyone.  Those of you who are lucky enough to have this product function like it's supposed to...are lucky.<br /><br />I've been using this monitor for about 3 months now, and it's been an absolute mess.  We had absolutely no problems setting it up on any of our devices (iPhone 4s, 5s, and iPad Air), but that was the extent of easiness we've experienced.<br /><br />Straight up--This monitor doesn't monitor.  All day and night, it's constantly connecting/reconnecting.  I rarely see actual video of my baby in her crib.  It's always a still frame of her that was pulled from whenever it last connected.  Through the night, I'm woken up off and on by the horrific sound of the notifier telling me that my connection has been lost and cannot be found...and it SHUTS DOWN THE APP COMPLETELY.  While I'm sleeping.  And I wake up to silence.  No monitoring sound or video--Just silence--as it's reconnecting.  It's infuriating.<br /><br />The entire POINT of a baby monitor is to let you know if your baby needs you.  And this monitor doesn't do that.  Sometimes it acts possessed.  On occasion it DOES work, and when I had notifiers turned on for noise or movement in the baby's room, it would sound the notifier for EVERYTHING, no matter how much I messed with the thresholds.  Now?  They don't even work because for some reason, it just can't stay connected.  I've power cycled and removed the battery and done everything too many times to count to get it working like it's supposed to.<br /><br />And now, the app crashes with any notification due to the recent iOS update.<br /><br />The app hasn't been updated since October 2013, and it needs a TON of work.  The thresholds for temperature and humidity reset themselves constantly, and it appears that my connection problems might be related as well.  I don't have any issues with any of my other wireless devices in our house-Just this one.  Sometimes it will pull up the video feed, and there will be a cached still of the crib from an earlier session showing underneath a still picture of what's currently happening in the crib.  The supposed bluetooth connection is non-existent.  It will connect when you first connect it, and then it just shuts off completely.  I've never seen it actually connect and monitor using the bluetooth connection.<br /><br />Bottom line?  You want a baby monitor to monitor your baby.  And this product just doesn't do that very often.  It will cause you more frustration and headache than the bells and whistles are worth.  If it worked correctly, this monitor would be amazing, but it just doesn't.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I'm about to go buy another monitor.  Ugh.  Please don't waste your money on this.ere will be a cached still of the crib from an earlier session showing underneath a still picture of what's currently happening in the crib.

B000003B6J|5|The first five tracks of this groundbreaking disc are the most powerful in rap. Bar none. Period.  This disc is critical to the understanding, progression and growth of rap as a form of musical expression and art.  And because NWA spawned so many influential artists, this disk is critical listening for any student of rap.  <br />I am of two minds about the violent lyrics on this disc. I don't like the idea of violence, but I think its important to view the violence expressed on this album in the context of (1) what was happening in LA at the time of its release and (2) the fact that an element of rap is fictionalization and exaggeration.<br />If you are new to rap and just beginning to enjoy to the genre, I recommend this disc. It is an excellent entre both to the gangsta style and the talents of Dr Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy E, and the rest of the NWA Crew.

B00BP4W3WI|1|With a roomful of excited children, we were anticipating a good time watching ET. The streaming quality was terrible, movie stopped three times in the first six minutes. We finally gave up and watched another movie on Netflix. We could not even move to another TV to watch ET because the Amazon app determined we were still watching the movie on the first TV, although we could not exit once the app hung.
B00IX9UTLU|3|It's not 50 Shades but the tenson keeps you reading.  Who's messing with who and who will figure it out?
B00JB3NUHM|1|Worse than I could have imagined.  Really wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt, and we did, but wow.  Just bad.  How did they spend so much money to mess up such a great story?<br /><br />Noah is a psychopath, incest, rock people demons, and the &#34;birthright&#34; from the &#34;creator&#34; is symbolized by the snake skin from satan.  It wasn't even cinematically appealing or beautiful.  Just poorly done all around.<br /><br />Although it did inspire me to write a review, I've only done that a handful of times.

0439023491|5|Wow, rarely does a sequel live up to the excitement and hype of the original. Suzanne Collins absolutely outdid herself. Catching Fire is fantastic. This is the kind of book that makes people love to read.<br />I couldn't read it fast enough but wanted to enjoy every moment.<br />This is a great one.
B000KQGP2G|3|Scarsick is the long-awaited sequel to Pain of Salvation's masterpiece \\"The Perfect Element I\\", and a new experience in and of itself.  It picks up the story where it left off, and follows He, the male character of the first part.<br /><br />I will start with the downsides.  This album is not on the same league with other Pain of Salvation albums, at all.  The concept is not as humane and appealing as it has always been before (even in the remotely mechanical \\"One Hour by the Concrete Lake\\").  The lyrical content, while filled to brim with poetry and incredibly stunning writing, has shifted itself to a new ground that I wish they had left unexplored, or explored in a metaphorical way.  That's exactly what Scarsick is; straightforward, in-your-face, unrestrained anger and frustration reeking through the now much more simpler music.  The first half alienates you too much, and fuels your expectations for the second part, which are, somehow, not quite fulfilled.  The song, \\"America\\" deviates from the story and doesn't connect at all; a VERY loose end, something that didn't exist in the previous ones, and its purpose, while evident, smashes the overall nice album's flow, mood, atmosphere and context significantly.  The album, while managing to be angry at times, is overall too emotionless, catching emotion with a few songs, if at all.  The overall story suddenly reverts back to where it was and then ends after significant deviation; while this is connected with the story, it could have been better.<br /><br />As for the positive sides, PoS, as always, is coming up with something new in musical terms; \\"Spitfall\\" is a melodic rap-metal song, \\"Disco Queen\\" is a psychedelic/disco song, \\"Scarsick\\" is (unfortunately) similar to a nu-metal song with folk tendencies, \\"Idiocracy\\" is a ballad and \\"Enter Rain\\" is a closer; something for everyone.  The criticism of popular music and idea of popularity, and overall rundown capitalist society is appropriate mostly and very witty (save for \\"America\\", which is downright stupid) and it succeeds for the most part in conveying a social commentary through a child's eyes.  The band displays the fun they had and the thoughts they had in the process, so, to quote Daniel Gildenlow, it IS a very \\"band-oriented\\" album indeed.  It is more easily accessible; which is also a downside, because it doesn't keep you wanting to find out more of the intricacies (assuming there are any).  But the biggest upside is, PoS is trying something new.<br /><br />Overall, this is a bad album in the up-to-now almost flawless PoS discography.  It is subject to debate among many fans, but I would recommend this album for anyone and everyone, save for those who want to start listening to Pain of Salvation (for whom, The Perfect Element is the perfect start)save for \\"America\\", which is downright stupid) and it succeeds for the most part in conveying a social commentary through a child's eyes.

B007IXWKUK|5|Once I finished the first book I immediately downloaded the second, Fifty Shades Darker.  It brought to light many of the issues facing both main characters and their growing relationship with one another.  Of course after I finished this one, I immediately downloaded the next.  I cant get enough of this trilogy.
B007J4T2G8|3|So I just recently heard about the Fifty Shades of Mediocre phenomenon that has been leaving housewives gasping for breath and fanning themselves and I kinda get it. I read most of the book and skipped parts that were too bogged down in useless detail so I understand what made people love it and hate it. The book does have that simple, unsophisticated quality that makes it readable by most fifth graders,but there is NO type of intellectual stimulation. The character of Anna is relatable in that she suffers from low self-esteem and is finally finding her voice and control, but aren't we sick of that same tired, female lead character? I mean why can't a strong, confident Lisbeth Salander type of character be the female lead in a very sexualized loved story? The book does evoke Twilight for the millions of fans across the world, but I CANNOT STAND Twilight!!! After reading the first book when she finally agreed to leave his 'FIFTY SHADES OF CRAZY' behind I was intrigued about what happens next. However, I will not pay amazon another 9.99 to read some semi-amaeteurish story about recycled Twilight characters. I would read it if it came on fan fiction, but never will I pay to read the second part of this soft porn novel. I've read steamier books with more depth and loved them so I am not squeamish about BDSM. The story was just ok, not spectacular. PLEASE DON'T MAKE THIS INTO A MOVIE!!!!

B001RTSPVY|5|The Complete Second Season of Breaking Bad was everything I thought it would be and so much more.  The writers are wonderful and I love the different situations that Walter and Jesse get themselves into...well it's usually Jesse causing the problem because of how dumb he is and Walter coming to the rescue.  The characters are believable esp. the wife and the brother-in law Hank.  He so personifies his role with his bigoted attitude against criminals of different ethnic backgrounds but also gets creeped out by some things but has to put on a show in front of his co-workers about how big and bad he is.  All in all watching this series has left me wanting more.  Can't wait for season three to be repeated on tv or else I will most likely order it.
B002VPE1AM|5|On the planet Pandora, a mega-corporation and its military lackeys are preparing to blast the indigenous Na'vi in order to gain access to a valuable mineral.  In a last ditch effort to resolve the situation peacefully, genetically designed replicas of the natives are linked to the minds of human operators and sent into the wilderness to broker an agreement.  The stage is set for a cataclysmic clash of cultures.    Writer / director James Cameron has delivered big time with his first fiction film in ten years, which breaks new ground technically while telling a compelling and moving story.  No one injects human drama into special effects extravaganzas more effectively than Cameron.  Here, he indulges a fetish for technology that would shame Tom Clancy and juxtaposes it with a fascinating alien ecology and a noble race of arboreal aborigines.  Thankfully, he avoids heavy-handed messages with a tight focus on character, some incredible action sequences, and absolutely jaw-dropping visuals.  I hope it isn't another decade before Cameron's next film.
B004EBT5CU|5|Good buy.
B00LO0K9SS|5|Back with the same line-up as 2012’s brilliant March of Progress (2 years a quick follow up for these guys), Threshold have delivered yet another amazing chapter in their storied “journey.” For the past month – in anticipation of this release – I have taken pleasure in listening to the entire back catalog, highlighted by Nuclear Blast’s Definitive Edition series. Relishing in that plethora of melodic progressive metal brought me to the conclusions that I more or less already knew – this band is so consistently good, they write great songs and it’s astonishing they aren’t more widely appreciated. For The Journey, their 10th major label release since 1993, is filled with everything a fan of this band loves and yet something more. While they have always retained a consistent thread (the heavy guitar riffs supported by a diverse spectrum of keyboard sounds, the melodic choruses, the clear and intelligent lyrics, great grooves, etc.) Threshold has always given us something different with each release, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />Taking an unorthodox approach to this release, I first (before any listening) sifted through all of the lyrics and the producer notes (a great companion to the music and a trend that Groom/West started with the Inside Out Special Edition Series from a decade or so ago). A few trips through the lyrics/notes was enough to discern that this would be yet another great collection of songs – certainly this could be one of their most insightful, mature and inspirational albums to date (although Dead Reckoning has a similar vibe of fighting to do what’s right, to stick to where you are in life, taking the good with the bad, etc.) Writing a song like “The Mystery Show” in this day and age shows a confidence that goes against the grain of mainstream media and I applaud the band for this kind of boldness. It’s a great song with a much needed message.<br /><br />Musically fans will judge this release differently, but some will find this less “metal” perhaps compared to March of Progress. It’s certainly not as dense musically and instrumentally, but the songwriting here is the highlight, and the isolation of instruments and sounds only serves to showcase Damien Wilson’s fantastic voice. In fact, this may well be his best recorded vocal performance with Threshold, although Extinct Instinct (a much proggier record) was definitely amazing in its own right.<br /><br />For me, I think this release is the perfect blend of “Mac” era catchy melodic rock and the early more heavy metal with prog influences sound that characterized the band’s first 3 releases. On the same note, these songs have a dark vibe, fresh and different for this band. It all ties together so well, which is part of what makes these guys so great. Additionally, Pete Morten (the newest member on guitar) contributes a song this time around with the epic/orchestral “Siren Sky” and underrated drummer Joahanne James wrote the bonus track “I Wish I Could” which is included on the Euro digipak version. Fans of great music and certainly fans of progressive melodic rock and metal will find very little here to criticize. Consistently great, For The Journey is going to be on a lot of top 10 lists this year, and as with all things Threshold a collection of songs and emotions to enjoy repeatedly for years to come.some will find this less “metal” perhaps compared to March of Progress.

B000RZGIOA|5|While I don't think this is a five star movie (probably a solid three or four) something has to be done to balance out the idiots who are posting lower ratings for this excellent film solely based on their dislike of Paramount (who has finally come over to blu like everyone else).<br /><br />So -- if you want this film, buy it on BD because it is available (it's actually already in stores but Amazon has a weird idea not to make it available until June 3).  It's a very good film, terrific action, and the pic quality and sound should be excellent (read the reviews of it on regular DVD to get a better idea).

0385340567|2|I agree with the many reviewers who have expressed disappointment in this latest installment of the Jack Reacher saga. My husband and I discovered Lee Child's books last summer and sailed through every one of them. Although we eagerly awaited this year's publication, both of us felt Nothing to Lose was not up to Child's usual standards. The main weaknesses include too many plot lines wandering in too many directions, a villain who wasn't particularly villainous, and a basic underlying story concept that really isn't that interesting. A couple of really annoying  elements include a town named Despair: I can not suspend my disbelief long enough to accept such an idea. And don't get me started on the scene in which the townspeople rise up like residents of Village of the Damned. Let's hope Reacher regains some of his earlier power in the next book.

0143038419|1|This book has gotten a lot of hype and prominent bookstore placement...based not on good writing but likely a great publicist. Here's a narrator you can't even trust, let alone tolerate. Her skimpiness on the details for her ruined marriage gives readers the impression that the truth is being hidden from them in order to shape their impressions of her. Most likely this is the case because she fears readers might think for themselves instead of just listening to her side of things. Strike 1.     She's also an unreliable narrator because her circumstances are so uncommon to what most people experience in a divorce. It's rare for anybody to be able to flit off around the world with a wad of money when they feel that life has become too difficult. No, most of us experience tragedy (tragedy we have not caused, unlike Gilbert), and we have to muddle through. She doesn't acknowledge this or approach her writing with any recognition that yes, there are worse things in life than the problems she creates for herself. Strike 2.    I couldn't even finish this book, though I really tried. I can't immerse myself in a book where the narrator is so jarringly set on focusing you on herself. And the view is not great, it's irritating. The impression I get of her is that she is overwhelmingly, unshakably amused by herself. She's like a spoiled child who has been doted on and therefore expects others to automatically love her and agree with her skewed self-pity. \\"Don't you HATE that I had to give up my Manhattan apartment and my nice big house in the suburbs??\\" Strike 3.    Her \\"insights\\" about God and spirituality are shallow and depend on things that make her feel warm and fuzzy.  I read The Diving Bell and The Butterfly while trying to read Eat Pray Love...the books are like night and day. Someone with no real problems going all to pieces, and someone who has lost everything and remains optimistic. I think I'll learn my lessons from Diving Bell!
B00006JJ1O|4|I have this complex where I just can't give this group a five simply because they do not write the lyrics for this album (which, might I add were splendid.) I was first introduced to TATU by a bisexual friend of mine, and being bisexual, of course she owned the album. It's dance music with a twist. No, not the whole lesbian-themes issue, but with actual thoughts behind the words and emotion behind the vocals. I'll admit: boy, those girls can sing. They can hit a note higher than someone getting kicked in the balls, and harder than a nun would hit a naughty schoolgirl (having gone to a convent school myself, I shouldn't say that..but I did, so there.) It's not the conventional techno with just the same two sentences being sung repeatedly. I suppose that if you really are a lesbian and you like techno, you should listen to them. It's..empowering to say the least. I can't think of a better Russian psuedo-homosexual female pop duo CD I own.

B005S9EKCW|4|I call myself a musical fan, but there are several big ones I've never actually seen.  One of those is Les Miserables, although I have now corrected that at least a little by seeing the new movie version.<br /><br />The story follows Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman).  As the movie opens, he is finally being set free after serving a 19 year sentence.  But he finds that jobs are hard to come by to an ex-convict.  He is offered shelter in a church, but he repays that by stealing their silver.  When he is shown grace and mercy the next morning, it changes his life.<br /><br />When we next see him, he has become a wealthy man, a position he uses to help others.  But when he misses an opportunity with the young woman Fantine (Anne Hathaway), he vows to watch over her daughter Cosette.<br /><br />All the while, he has to watch out for the policeman Javert (Russell Crow).  See, Jean Valjean broke the conditions of his parole, and Javert is determined to see him face justice again.  Will he do that?  Or will his new life come tumbling down around him?<br /><br />I'd heard how powerful the story is, and that is correct.  It's amazing how quickly you come to care for all the characters in the film.  Yes, even Javert.  He is doing his job even if he is a bit too harsh about it.<br /><br />And I can see why this musical has been so popular for so long.  It is amazing.  There are so many great songs here, and they are all powerfully sung.  In fact, this movie is different in that the actors were actually singing as they were being filmed instead of recording the soundtrack months before hand and then lip syncing to the playback.  I do think that gave the film a much more authentic feel, which really kept the story real.  The orchestra that was then recorded later is still amazing.  Trust me, you don't miss a thing by this approach.<br /><br />I've have heard people saying that this actor or that actor was the weak link in the film.  And for fans of the show, I can see how someone might not live up to their idea of the character or favorite performance.  As a newbie to the story, I certainly couldn't find any flaws with the performances or the singing.  Everyone was great, and I got lost in the story.<br /><br />Now this isn't to say I don't have a few complaints about the film.  First, there was some shaky camera work, especially in the second half.  I'm still not a fan, and this didn't help.  However, I will say this was prevalent.  It was noticeable when they used it, but most of the film wasn't so bad.<br /><br />Secondly, I really would have liked some talking.  Yes, I know it's a musical, but they could have bridged some of the scenes with some dialogue.  I think the actors agreed with me because some of their singing was more talking in a couple of scenes.  There is just some exposition that can be said instead of sung.  Having said that, some of the scenes that I wouldn't have considered for songs if I'd been doing this made for some great songs here, especially in the second half.<br /><br />The movie is two and a half hours, and I feel emotionally drained now that I've seen it.  But it was so worth it.  Whether you know and love the music or are new the experience, go see Les Miserables.  You won't be disappointed.t not live up to their idea of the character or favorite performance.  As a newbie to the story, I certainly couldn't find any flaws with the performances or the singing.

0553805371|2|I can only assume the popularity of this book stems from Hawking's notoriety, because it's content leaves much to be desired.    First, from a purely technical standpoint, the treatment of some areas such as QED,QCD and the standard theory is quite clear and comprehensive. But others, such as M theory, Multiverse and Inflation, are glossed over.  Too much discussion about Aristotle and Kepler, no mention of Guth and Witten. By the end of the book, it's not even clear why the authors delved into particle physics at all, because their final argument has noting to do with the first 170 pages of the book.    Second, the book reveals a clear anti-religion bias that distracts from the subject, or is that the purpose ?.  The book promises to reveal a grand design, an explanation of why reality exists.  It also argues that there is no need for a creator, AKA God.  And yet, as the expected final argument arrives, it is in the form of a game... a set of laws called \\"the game of life\\" .  This game is shown to create its own reality.  But on page 179 Hawking and Mlodinow, referring to this game, clearly state...'we are the creators- we chose the initial state of the universe by specifying objects and their positions at the start of the game'.     Their final argument contradicts the anti creator tone of the entire book......pointless    I would suggest for those hoping to understand the current theories of the uiverse and physical reality, they read Gribbin's \\" In Search of the Multiverse\\"    For those looking for proof that God does not exist, they should first explain to themselves how to prove a negative (philosophically)
B00005YW4H|4|At last.  A new voice that's worth hearing.  Come Away with Me by Norah Jones is well worth the money you'll lay down to have it.  New compositions by Norah  include the cover title Come Away With Me and Nightingale certainly blend well with the more well known songs by Hoagy Carmichael and Hank Williams and others.  The overall experience is restful with just enough melody to keep the ears interested.  Jones voice is familiar at one time and completely new at others.  What an experience.<br />Negative criticism of this CD is unwarranted.  Most artistic endeavors need time to massage the soul.  It takes time to become a classic and not all classics are immediately recognized.  Read some to the reviews of Aaron Copeland's music and you'll see what I mean.  Critics of the day couldn't see beyond their noses.  Read reviews of any Faulkner book written by his contemporaries; same deal.  If you hear it and like it then enjoy it.  Norah Jones will become a great artist and the CD Come Away with Me will become a classic; a wonderful first effort.

B00004XONN|4|I tried my hardest not to be a fair-weather fan when I found myself wishing for another OK Computer upon first listen of this disc.  Three years and seemingly worlds apart, the two albums almost seem as if they came from separate bands.  Kid A has the soundscape of a dream (best executed in \\"Treefingers\\"), whereas 1997's OK Computer is more grounded in barnstorming rock anthems.  However, it was the mindless bass line of \\"The National Anthem,\\" and NOT one of the melodically complex ballads from OK Computer that first grabbed my ears and sparked my interest in Radiohead.<br />Tracks \\"Optimistic\\" and \\"In Limbo\\" have a more radio-friendly format, a mix between Kid A's rough sound and OK Computer's guitar-driven numbers.  \\"Idiotheque,\\" which I first saw performed live on SNL, is Radiohead's attempt at creating a straight dance song.  Fortunately for us, they fail miserably; the quality of the lyrics remain brilliant, as ever.  Finally, the hidden track on \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" washes the listener in the musical equivalent of glittering blues and silvers, a surprisingly bright ending to a particularly shaded disc.<br />The more experimental tone of Kid A may baffle some listeners unfamiliar with the band, but with the third or fourth play-through a greater understanding of Radiohead's musical growth is achieved.
B003V4AK8E|3|I've had a PS3 for years, but have never actually played an XBox 360. So this controller shape is new for me. I have to say that it feels pretty good. The shape fits my hands nicely, and the textured sides have good grip without being uncomfortable, even during long play sessions. I also like that the USB RF dongle has a USB jack on the front for recharging, although when I tried to plug a USB microphone into it, the mic didn't work.    This controller works just fine for games that don't require high precision, like Lego Star Wars and Toy Story 3. However, first-person shooters are another story. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a noticeable dead zone to the analog sticks. It's not unplayable, but aiming is definitely tougher than with my original Dualshock. Forget trying to play against experts online. Also, the D-pad is very flaky. When playing the hacking minigame in Bioshock, quick movements of the D-pad often register the wrong direction or don't register at all. It's very annoying.    A number of reviewers claim that the sticks on this controller don't have any dead zones, while others write that they're so bad as to be unusable. Opinions on the D-pad seem to vary as well. This leads me to wonder whether there might be QC issues here -- the problem may vary from unit to unit. Give the Pro Elite a try, but be sure to buy it from a store that allows returns.

0316056863|4|Not as funny as I had hoped.  It is more her life story versus a book written for laughs like something from Woody Allen.
B000UR9T7I|4|This is one of those movies where I can't quite understand all of the negative reviews that flood the internet.  People seem upset about mostly one thing (too many villans) and retaliate with one star ratings and uninsightful reviews.      The director wanted Sandman (and I'm glad he was included) and there was pressure from the studio and fans to include the New Goblin and Venom. (Given how the second movie ended, it would have been wrong NOT to include the New Goblin.)  Given that he was trying to please everyone, I think he did a great job weaving them all into the story.    The complaints that this one isn't as funny or bright as the other two is absurd.  Part of the story is Spiderman's struggle emotionally and using his powers for the wrong reasons.  To have a happy, cheerful movie with this going on wouldn't feel right.  And this was needed because this is how Venom is created.    I thought the CGI work with Sandman was absolutely amazing.  The previous movies were nominated for visual effects, so 3 had some big shoes to fill.  The action sequences are pretty cool, though for some reason, don't seem to match up to the first two movies.    I fully acknowledge that this movie doesn't really match up to the first 2, but I do think it's also highly underrated.  Take the negative reviews with a grain of sand (intentional pun).
B001AQR3E4|5|Nothing like seeing this on blue ray. This is my first time seeing it this way, and I am amazed at how much better it is. Not a fan of the vanpire sagas, but love this story,,,,,,,,,
B009T8XBBO|3|this downloaded and functioned fine (although load times on screens was slow) on my first gen kindle<br />I have played through to the second island - it is very repetitious and gets old so you need to play in small doses - I had some trouble getting the touchscreen to recognize my taps and would lose time before I realized the guy wasn't doing his job.... overall I will probably finish the game but see no replay value. I would not pay full price for this - maybe .99 - but I got as faotd. I saw no iap's so can not comment on them.
B00DUGCLY4|5|It was a fun game but hard.to beat. If your going to play this game make sure you are prepared. Thank thank you very much very body in the club getting drinks...... hahaha hahaha
B00102FELM|5|Monumental concert (line-up, songs, show, crowd, band energy and performance) and a real classic pure rock show. Very good editing this time. With \\"Live At Wacken..\\" and  \\"Amazonia...\\",  we have two excellent Scorpions products, very professional and two reference points about what quality music means. Rock on together with the best rock band ever - SCORPIONS!
B00DJFIMW6|4|I love this game! It's so FUN and addictive. I have it installed on my Kindle and step Dads phone. But,how am I suppose to get the Groo coins except the challenges which I don't gab  enough coins to do! That's a problem.
B00AB7HESI|1|I can't believe it , it won't download

0060936223|5|A poetic auto-bio about a gifted 20 something year old finding her place in New York. Rising to the top of artistic expression and relishing in life's simplicity. This book changed my trajectory.
B00QROI70S|5|Such a good movie. Highly recommend it.
B005CKPQHA|5|Cranston and Paul couldn't be better in their characters and each episode leaves you on the edge of your seat. Do yourself a favor and commit yourself to the show. You won't regret it.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I loved this book. It was hilarious and sad at the same time.  I couldn't put it down, I always needed to know what was happening next.
0812979680|5|This is one of the most important books I've ever read. Nassim Taleb is a brilliant economist, deserving of a Nobel Prize, IMHO. He presents a drastically different way to look at everyday experiences and circumstances around us, as well as at significant events that impact societies, countries and humanity as a whole. He does it often with self-deprecating humor that is becoming, although a snarky side occasionally peeks out. Great quotes are sprinkled throughout the text: “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is.”<br /><br />The strongest message is his advocacy of opinion makers and influencers having ethics and ‘skin in the game.’ He savages Tom Friedman, Stiglitz and mentions Paul Krugman, my hero, in an unflattering way. There is a lot of respect for Mother Nature and learning how adaptable and antifragile she is.
B004FHP9KA|2|Much too confusing.
B00000BKDX|5|This cd is incredible! Buy it! Also, Bruce and Adrian ARE back!!!! Yes, it's true, as of January 1999!! Look up their web page and see for yourself.(Iron Maiden.com) Live After Death is a 'must have'! Up the Irons!
B00IINPXLW|5|I love love love it it is so amazing and so awesome and I love the littel cartoons and the leveals are so so much fun
B008JFUUIA|4|Great movie to watch on a rainy or snowy day!😀
B00EMAGCJM|1|I borrowed this CD from the library out of curiosity. Other than the 2 songs commonly heard on the radio, the rest is pretty terrible and not worth your time.
B000002UB3|5|I've said it before- the Beatles (well, Lennon and McCartney, at any rate) are the equivalent of J. S. Bach. The melodies are lovely, the harmonies complex, the variations wonderful. Their commercial success is well deserved. They are head and shoulders above any contemporary classical composer.<br /><br />I am a professional traditional musician and a published and recorded song-writer. If you don't like the Beatles nothing I can say will change your mind. And if you do like them this review is pointless.<br /><br />But I wanted to say it anyway.
0307730697|5|amazing book about a true hero...hope they make a movie from this
B00514HDNW|4|As we all know...never judge a book by its movie. Though the movie did make me pick up the book. Great twist at the end.
B00G4I0DNG|5|Unfortunately, I've been to SeaWorld many times.  i'll never be going back.  The way they treat these animals on this documentary is unfathomable.  The film itself is very well done.  Hate that it had to be made in the first place.  Repulsive
0385473788|1|I know that the holocoust was horrible and something that we do not want to repeat again but Anne Frank is just BORING. im not prejudice and i feel horrible about the holocaust but what i don't get is why is this girl complaining about her life? she had it way better off then some people. And why this diary is even famous. Anyone from the holocaust could have written a diary and be made famous. But a real good diary would explain the holocaust more then her own love life. Anne Frank is the most boring person i have ever seen in my life. When i was in grade 3 i didn't even want to pick up this book but since i was forced to read it for a grade 7 school project....i had no other choice. i admit, there were some holocaust parts but for every PARAGRAPH there was about the holocaust...there were 30 pages about her &quot;peeling potatoes&quot; &quot;feeling depressed&quot; &quot;studying&quot; and &quot;peter&quot;. There was no action whatsoever and people say that you could actually feel what she was going through...i mean get a life people. I know it's bad being cooped up and all..but....ughhhhhhhaoiwerualishfd bad book. And also...i can skip like 100 pages of the book and still know whats going on. I mean WHY AM I READING A BOOK THAT TALKS ABOUT HER WANTING TO REACH PUBERTY. seriously. so if you want to read a book about food, and 5 other people, family trees, and useless things that will never come in handy in your life then i urge you to read this book. but serseiouly you will have wasted your time. read some REAL holocaust books
1451626657|3|While Catch-22 might be one of the most known and reviewed modern US novels, not everybody has actually heard of it, even if you are familiar with the \\"catch-22\\" phraseology. It is by no means a standard story told through a conventional channel, but rather a surreal picture conveyed through the novel use (and mix) of different techniques.<br /><br />So, why should you bother reading (and buying) it?<br /><br />Well, let's start with the simple part. The book itself is well printed, with the 50th Anniversary edition boosting some additional material, which, if you are a die-hard Catch-22 fan, you will cherish, but which otherwise doesn't really add that much value to the novel but for making it easier for the (younger and) newer readers understanding the context in which the novel was released and actually gained fame. This is one of the nicer paperback editions I have seen, probably only lacking the glossy paper and the hard cover. There are even a few (rather lost) pictures in between.<br /><br />Now to the real meat, the content.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book about WWII, go away, this is not.<br />If you are looking for a book as a bedtime companion in order to fall asleep, go away, this is not.<br />If you are looking for a book that is an easy read and does not require you to actually think about what you are reading, go away, this is not.<br /><br />Catch-22 is a book that requires the reader to work and think. It will not do the work for you, nor present you with any preconceived ideas or solutions, but it will punch you right in your face and stab you with a knife in the back and force you to react, to think, to rethink. If there is a merit in this novel (and make no mistakes, I think there are many), this is the biggest. Heller makes an astonishing and refreshing use of well known techniques to take you along the ride and seemingly without too much effort force you to face the brutal, cruel and often crazy world of war, bureaucracy and ill-understood free enterprise.<br /><br />Now, this force ride does not come along easy nor cheap, it will cost you quite some effort to get past the countless repetitions, the often seemingly meaningless dialogues, the vast amount of information that is being thrown to you without any aid nor indication what to do with it. Which is fine, as long as you know what to expect and be prepared for.<br /><br />My biggest problem with Catch-22 is the context, both in terms of time period as well as geographical/sociopolitical. If you are a US reader, you should have no problem relating to the book (if you are over 30 years old you probably have read it in school anyway). In the post-Korea and Vietnam world of the 60's and 70's, this novel hit on the nerve of a society that was just waiting for this kind of books (another fine example being M*A*S*H). However, the 60's and 70's are now far away, and many readers know this period of time only from the history books or from the stories told by their older relatives, so this novel seems a little out of context today, actually a bit outdated.<br /><br />I rated it 3 stars because of the outdated feeling of it, and because it is so difficult to really grasp that the amount of work seems a bit too much compared to the end-result.<br /><br />So, you have been warned, now it's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk to be \\"catched\\"!tood free enterprise.<br /><br />Now, this force ride does not come along easy nor cheap, it will cost you quite some effort to get past the countless repetitions, the often seemingly meaningless dialogues, the vast amount of information that is being thrown to you without any aid nor indication what to do with it.

B00499QUK2|5|The tongue in cheek dialogue and quick wit has kept me a fan of (good) British shows. To see a modern version of Mr. Holmes, is a delight for those of us who love good mysteries. And I suggest  to anyone that this Holmes and Watson is worth the viewing.
B000NDIAWY|5|What a unique and refreshing sound with equally impressive lyrics. With a soulful, \\"Melissa Etheridge-like\\" vocal, Brandi and the twins really hit the spot with THE STORY. Two thumbs up for this one, I say.
B004DLPXAO|5|App always works great.  It has the same features the Kindle has.  If I leave my Kindle home, I can just pick up where I left off while I'm out waiting on my kids.  I LOVE IT.
B001C4AFOY|5|Beautiful music gowns, scenery and music.  This story mixes politics, life, real life people feelings in the development of a world figure that changed history.  It is a great movie!!!
B00VRYCGLO|4|Pretty fun game
B003VANOFY|2|I have to say, I had high hopes for these headphones and I initially liked them but within a few hours it became clear that these are NOT high quality, unlike other Logitech products I own. I will leave the sound quality to people that actually know what they are talking about, but to me it sounds excellent when I am not having problems.<br /><br />The first major problem I have is apparently widely known with no solution or response from Logitech; the headphones will randomly turn off, requiring you to turn them back on. This isn't them turning off in response to a lack of input, this is them turning off while I am in the middle of listening to music or  a video. Sometimes they will be fine for hours, other times mere minutes. Google &#34;G 930 randomly turns off&#34; to see what I mean. One of the forum threads I saw had over 13000 views, but not everyone reports this, so I assume that some of the headphones are just faulty, meaning buying these is a bit of a gamble.<br /><br />My second problem is that the sound quality drastically degrades with multiple sound sources (in my case, Minecraft and a Youtube video or music). As soon as I start a second source, I hear crackling, mild distortion, and the volume drops, all of which stops as soon as one of the sources goes quiet. This is the deal breaker for me, as I usually multi task, be it for work or free time, and I will need to hear multiple things simultaneously and the first issue was at best an annoyance. This also is apparently known about as I found a thread on the Logitech forums (Google &#34;g930 sound distortion multiple sources&#34; should be the first result) where multiple people complain about this issue.<br /><br />All in all, I doubt I will buy a Logitech product again, as selling something as broken as this for such a high price is inexcusable. I would understand if I had bought some cheap off brand headphones, but not a well established company known for making decent quality gaming accessories. Seriously, what happened here? I might still use these headphones, but I know that somewhere down the line I will need something actually usable for all purposes and these just don't fit the bill.
B009UX2YAC|5|There are missions and rewards for more enthusiastic players, but this game can also be played to simply kill time. Items can be powered up to last longer and characters can be bought with money collected in the game. Every few weeks, the game's location changes, which keeps things interesting. All in all, quite fun!
B004MC8CA2|5|great read
B00BUCXVPI|4|Great Movie....4.5
B00190KZUU|5|Life is always a fable - One as you see it, a hundred more as others see it. All are true, all are fabrications and all equally insignificant.
B00E5Q1LTY|5|Movie was great love Star Trek
B00KIPY3GY|5|G5 has good games.
B00BAXFECK|4|Great easy reAd, never a dull moment.
B0001I562I|5|I used to watch this movie when i was a kid. I recived it with no scratches and in a prompted time.
B0049JPU8A|5|This album is incredible. The Script have really progressed with the tunes since their debut album. This cd is full of catchy songs, with more heartfelt emotional lyrics with plenty of rhythm & beat. Well worth the money. Amazing band, amazing music.
B00001QGIQ|4|i loved this movie because it was so charming. it helps children who are becoming moody pre-teens get through that stage of learning. it never gets too complex, but it hints at how different the world is from Sunday School while being age appropriate. it doesn't become condescending.  a lot can be accomplished if the family sits down afterwards and discusses its themes. the other reviews are far superior to mine, but i felt moved to offer my spin.  Classic Disney movies are never a waste of money because they teach, entertain or remind adults of the problems in being a human being, no matter how old you are.
B00BWBHIUG|3|Very good for children. But certainly something I am not interested in playing. It would have gotten a better rating but it was not the most easy navigation.
B005EVVESM|5|Great CD. Had a problem with shipping but all was fix the same day.
B007549YM4|5|Xavier Gens does it again, this film is awesome. Very dark and depressing. Solid performances all around. I recommend this!
B00DURGZHW|4|Enjoyed this movie a lot!
B001NLL93W|5|The fact that I read this book in only a matter of hours should be a clue to its amazing qualities. Cassandra Clare is a genius, complete genius! I haven't been able to put down any of the mortal instruments, and can't wait to see what the next books have in store. I feel like I need to slow down so I don't finish them so quickly...savor them a bit more (=
078322804X|5|Without problems, it was very good products.
B00QROI70S|5|I'm not familiar with the comic and had no opinion of this movie going in, but the overall rating was really high so we gave it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Lots of comedy, one-liners, good plot, good action, great throwback music, amazing effects.  I watched it three times before my rental expired.
B0010X8NF0|2|My husband and I could only deal with about 1/2 hour of this movie.  I don't understand why others rated it  so hight and as one of the funniest movies of the year (2007 I believe).  Slow starting and never really gained any momentum when we were watching it.
B0097HSS4M|4|Found this app to be easy to work with. So far no problems with it.Will have to use it more to tell for sure.
B00004XMTJ|5|This is a must, must buy. If you have ever seen it live on stage, this dvd will clear up any questions about the storyline. The upclose expressions of the characters are priceless. ALW outdid himself. You will watch this over and over again.
B0050R0YB8|5|This is my first time building a Lego anything of this size and its been a fun challenge working with my kids and its a very nice looking ship when is all complete
B00B4VI8MQ|4|THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST HOG, I HAVE PLAYED SEVERAL OTHERS LIKE IT AND I LOVE THIS STORY LINE TOO. I LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE GAMES ALIKE. THANKS
0307744434|5|Believe the hype.<br /><br />Like the titular black and white circus, The Night Circus is both light and dark, shining with the ethereal beauty of the wonders of the circus and shaded with the murky undercurrent of the undefined \\"game.\\" Easily one of the best books I have read this year. I could continue to gush, but part of the magic - of the story and the circus - lies in not quite knowing what to expect. Morgenstern builds a world I would wish to get lost in - at least for a night at Le Cirques des Rêves.
B002VPE1B6|1|Please note this review is about the product, not the movie.    There are zero special features on these two discs (blu-ray & dvd).  I was shocked to get this in the mail today only to find no special features.  Then I find out James Cameron has already confirmed a special edition due out in November with 20-40 extra minutes of additional footage and most likely special features.  Let me get this straight, we (the average consumer) made Avatar the number one grossing movie of all time and this is how you repay us?  By giving us the short end of the stick?    If you consider that this release has no special features, this makes Avatar the most over priced Blu-Ray disc I've purchased yet.  First Lord of the Rings, now Avatar.  We need to send a clear message to the distributors and movie producers that we will not put up with this kind of service.  I love this movie and have been eagerly anticipating it's release on Blu-Ray only to find it the worst released title to this format.    Shame on 20th Century Fox for this sub-par release, and shame on James Cameron for not sticking up for what is right.  He managed to make a fantastic movie be overshadowed by a home release that is unacceptable by screwing over the very people that made his movie number 1.
B000JQU4TW|2|These were the longest most tedious 200 pages I've ever read. The plot was good. The execution was terrible. So many words, so little story.
B00E8KLWB4|1|If I could give this zero, I would have.  Why do games have to involve spiritism?
B00RL9UZGW|4|I LIKED THE MOVIE BECAUSE DENZEL WASHINGTON WAS JUST RIGHT FOR THE PART.
B004A8ZWVK|5|This movie is great!  Everyone of our family members enjoyed this movie and we watched it over and over.  It was funny and sad at the same time.
B000FC2L1E|5|Voyager is the third book in the Outlander series. I loved it! Now I started re-reading the series in my Kindle. I loved reading it and listening to the audiobook at the same time.
B00280LYHS|5|Great book from the Percy Jackson series. Enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys greek mythology.
0345803507|5|Book in excellent condition.
B00632HWOG|5|I like having this app on my kindle. It's nice not having to go to the web area to type in the web address each time.
B008Y76VW2|5|Fun show enjoyed the story and the actors simple and about the characters.  Check it out see for yourself I thinkyou will like it.
B003EVWDR0|1|i spent my hard earned money on this so i could watch it on my computer with out a dvd and the instant video wont play!!! what gives Amazon!!???
B00L9B7IKE|5|Great page turner!!!
B00AECGQF2|5|This app is absolutely adorable. The graphics are amazing - it's like playing an animated movie. The motions are realistic and I love that you don't have to keep your finger on an item to use it (which can sometimes annoy little ones); just tap and go. It also has twice as many options as other games to keep you entertained. The first day I downloaded it to the Kindle Fire, my 3 year old played it until the battery died. Definitely worth the $3! I'm not sure why a few people have a problem downloading it - we had no issue at all. Please, please put more Toca Boca apps in the store!
B00E8KLWB4|4|This is a very exciting game. I enjoy it and it's free!
B00DPM7RJW|5|I like that the Ridge and Sydney both learned a new way to communicate their love for one another. I'm shocked that Hoover was able to. Are their love seem so much more profound then what love existed in the relationship with Maggie. I always fall in love with the characters in hovers books. I know this seems kind of ratchet and kinky, but I wish her characters had more sex and less innocence than usual. I think she did push the fam met this time around and let her characters appear more sexual than usual. Keep the different story lines coming.
B00B2V66VS|5|Almost better than bacon. Oh never mind it is even better than bacon!!! Even if that bacon was the best bacon ever!!!
B001SGEUNI|5|This group is hot !!!  In this day and age with so many different kinds of music this group  is ROCK solid.GO Lzzy !!!
B0087HT36U|3|this game is OK.  good thing it was free.  but you get what you pay for.  :-) Check it out if you like playing Angry Birds.
B00AFEY354|5|This is this generation's coming of age defining movie. It's destined to become a cult classic. Hopefully more people will see it.
B00EB9Z8YE|4|Covers all steps of the path, from passion and doing what you love. To giving back and recognizing the final reward.

1433502445|4|Great bible, the only thing it was lacking was a cross reference.
B00005QG9J|4|good cd, but it takes a few listens for most songs to catch you. Love &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.
B000002UZ1|5|This collection has a more generous selection than the &quot;red&quot; album.  The CD booklet has a few extra photos not found in the LP which make this more attractive than the original vinyl.<br />This CD starts with &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; which musically (and visually) portrayed a new era for the Beatles.  The essentials include &quot;Hey Jude&quot; (the 1st LONG single in history), &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; (the best &quot;weird&quot; song ever!), &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; (an anthem for the summer of love), George's &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (featuring Eric Clapton on guitar), John's politically incorrect &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot;, and what Frank Sinatra called &quot;the greatest Lennon/McCartney song ever&quot; &quot;Something&quot; (we all know Ol' Blue Eyes blundered!).  George also is featured on &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and Ringo proves he too can write with &quot;Octopus' Garden&quot;.  John is at his most surrealistic on &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; and &quot;A Day In the Life&quot; (with some help from Paul on the middle 8th and the anticlimactic orchestra buildup courtesy of producer George Martin).  Paul writes some of his best lyrics on &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;.<br />As I said in my &quot;Red&quot; album review, if you like the music of the Beatles, this and 1962-66 (the &quot;Red&quot; album) are the best place to start!
B0026772N8|4|Nice to re-read this book almost 35 years from first reading it. It's a classic that gets better with age.
B001GCUO5W|5|Bought as a gift for my son but I watched it with him.  Was a great movie and I really had no idea what was going to happen at the end and I almost always have the twist or plot figured out before the rest of the room.  In this case that was not true.  The ending leaves you hanging with some questions - which is refreshing for a change - instead of all the predictable Hollywood garbage that is constantly regurgitated onto the screen.  The cast was well selected, the dialog was pretty on the mark for the time and it was creepy.
B00J1IQUYM|5|A book within a novel with a hidden story. visual and engrossing. not your typical apocalypse movie - that's the setting
B00005QZWI|5|While Peter Jackson's film was one of the best ever made in any genre, and the acting was marvelous - if Tolkien was the movie's heart,  Shore's score was the soul of The Fellowship of the Ring.  When I first heard that Howard Shore was scoring LOTR, I was quite unfamiliar with his work.  I had no idea what to expect but was more than pleasantly surprised after seeing the movie.  The soundtrack to the Fellowship of the Ring is almost Wagnerian in scope, full orchestra, heavy brass and percussion, and chorus. He put the choruses to much greater use than Jerry Goldsmith did in \\"The Omen,\\" John Williams in \\"The Phantom Menace,\\" backing not only action sequences, but love, friendship, and goodbye sequences in the film.  Depending on the mood of a scene, he uses his music to paint the emotions of the characters before they have spoken a single word, as heard in \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" - to accentuate the action sequences, as heard in \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum\\" -  and to make the characters in this wonderful fantasy seem almost tragic, heroic, and completely three-dimensional, as heard in \\"Amon Hen.\\" <br />Almost every composer has her/his own unique style. (There are a few hacks out there blatantly ripping of the classics - note for note.)  This soundtrack is not one endless string of melodies. Shore's scoring makes abundant use of solo flutes, violins, recorders, solo treble voices to create music that is both familiar but completely original.  At times Shore's LOTR score has a Celtic flavor, but not enough to make you feel you are at a Riverdance concert.  While William's music is highly thematic and very structured - verses, choruses, repeats, etc., Shore's music seems to be thematic but with less structure, and very intense.  Percussive in the action sequences.  In the theater my hands were over my eyes during the Khazad Dum sequence.  I now realize one of the contributing factors,  other than my fear of heights, was the score. On the other end of the scale, Enya's Elven touch on her solo vocals in mesmerizing.  If you are buying this CD for the toe-tapping melodies you'll be sadly disappointed, but the job of the composer is to write music which blends with the action of the film - not produce a hit record.<br />There have been some wonderful soundtracks out there in recent history.  The Shawshank Redemption.  Glory.  The Red Violin.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Phantom Menace.  Just to name a few.  And The Fellowship of the Ring can take its place with them as one of the great scores of all time.
B000WGWQG8|5|This miniseries is captivating. Well casted and need I say more... It is an Emmy winner, for sure...
6305841861|1|Evil Dead 2 is a movie(like the first) I don't appreciate, Is pointless and no plot, just gore and of course Young dumb people staying in the woods, Why would you stay in a creepy cabin? Mama didn't raise no fool, But that's horror movies, people doing dumb stuff. Although Bruce Campbell is a legend.don't watch if your queasy.

B00A757EFW|2|it was really to hard to do on my Kindle.  Didn't care for it and it was boring compaired to the newer games on here.
B00J1IQUYM|5|I'm glad I read this book.  It started out pretty slow and hard to reconcile characters without a map, but I'm glad I stuck with it.  A low key book about the world as we know it (electricity, gas, cell phones, the Internet ((why is that capitalized?)), disease, etc.)  disappearing.
B00018D3RI|4|I first viewed this show on dvd and might I say i'm impressed.This had some great stories and cool actors.This show holds up well today,too.
B00FN811SY|5|This app is a must for anyone wanting to know the truth about GOD!  I am sure everyone will benefit from this translation when searching to know and have a personal relationship with Jehovah (PLMS 83:18).  When reading, I hate to put it down it is WONDERFUL!
B00005JOA0|5|A fine time piece to watch
B00FLDG5AA|4|as usual anything that clapton puts out is great, hearing clapton and allman brothers playing together is such a treat wished there was more and some old derek and dominoes tunes was a nice surprise and sounded good
B008Y6UNT0|5|Although I know this could never have happened, I love how the movie showed that racism is taught. Beautiful story about two young boys trapped in the madness of the Holocaust.
B001TKD4ZI|5|What another great book. Every time I read another book, I can't wait to get to the next one! Good, great, stupendous!
B005ZOBNOI|5|OMG BEST BOOK EVAAA YOU SHOULD TOTES READ IT #yassssssssssgurlyass<br />LOVIN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LIKE FOR REAL GURL READ IT ITS FABOO
0061992860|5|This book is really tiny, fits in a little pocket of your bag. Very well thought out info and diagrams. Hope I don't have to use it, but glad I have it.
0316096199|3|I was a bit underwhelmed with 'The Lovely Bones' - started out great, lost me entirely by the end - but I expected great things of 'Lucky'.  Yet again it starts out well, the opening chapter is horrifying, moving and completely unputdownable - but as we move away from the actual rape and its immediate aftermath all Alice Sebold's faults as a writer surface again.  She seems unable to select material which will be of interest to the reader and fills pages and pages with irrelevant detail of her family life and unnecessary background detail. The book comes alive again when she spots her rapist in the street but in between I found myself losing interest.  We all know the argument about real-life not being as tidy as fiction - but in this case it WAS tidy - the rapist was identified by Alice, caught and punished (a much more satisfactory ending than that of 'The Lovely Bones', ironically). I wish the book had been more scrupulously edited to focus on the essential elements of her story rather than filled up with padding. I felt cheated at the end of the book - at the beginning I felt that I would be with Alice throughout her every step of her journey to find justice and recover from the trauma she suffered but somehow this connection was lost and by the middle of the book I had no idea what she - or indeed anyone else involved was thinking or feeling.  What a shame as this could have been a truly great book and an inspiration to rape survivors everywhere ...
B000FC1LOC|5|my sisters keeper is so touching and suspenseful. it kept me reading til midnight and sometimes longer. sometimes i put down the book crying and in other parts laughing as hard as i could. reading that book was always a great tiem and the surprising ending, loved it.
B00K7C17QW|3|Was able to play..  Like the game, great graphics. Now, after this last update, won't play. Just stays on the main screen..
0062082353|5|I highly recommend this book.  A great read about the Navy Seals and a great American hero.  Sadly he's gone now.
B002ZG97EC|5|I think the kids and I have seen this movie over 10 times, I still laugh everytime. Can't wait for part 2 to come out.
B00COGXGNQ|4|Though rather predictable, this movie was done well. The actors did a good job and though I haven't read the book, the end plot twist did not come as a surprise to me. I won't say anything about it in case there are some who haven't read the book or seen the movie. Both main actors are talented and I hope Julianne Hough continues in her career and gets some great roles.
B00687Q0VC|5|Excellent and very entertaining mini series. I learned a lot about the history of our country and appreciate more the sacrifice of the early patriots, both men and women, who gave up much to win our freedom.
B000XJ5TOK|5|This film has hot chicks, and it has zombies. That's really all you need in order to make a good movie. Buy this.
B009G7ZYPY|5|This is the fourth CD I have by Susasn Boyle - I love her voice - it's so clear and<br />beautiful.  Some of our most beautiful songs are on this CD including Send in the Clowns and Memories.

0399162097|4|The lead character Rose talks about her life, starting at the middle.<br />Rose lived with her mother, father, brother, and sister, until the age of 5 where she is sent away for a little while and her sister is gone. But where did she go? Why did she go? Rose never feels whole again after this.<br /><br />I am so completely and utterly confused, but nevertheless I enjoyed it and only put it down when I had to eat, work, and sleep.<br />There were lots of &#34;oh wow&#34; &#34;does that really happen&#34; and &#34;what's going on&#34; thoughts going on in my head.<br />This book was very enlightening and I enjoyed it quite a lot.<br />I recommend this book for 18+<br />I received this book thanks to goodreads first reads.
B0000VAFO0|3|Never seen this movie but I heard a lot of talk about it.<br />Besides that &#34;Michael&#34; character is eye candy for me.
030758836X|1|Ok, my opinion of this book changed (significantly) as I read it. The story line seemed fairly interesting from the start and the character development was actually pretty decent (although \\"character\\" itself is clearly lacking with these characters, but that was the whole point...well done so far author!). There were a few flaws with the first half of the book (without giving anything away...specifically Nick's flashbacks to his wife crawling on the floor make no sense as the story unfolds...when you read it you will know what I mean), but all in all the book kept my attention.<br /><br />About three quarters of the way through I was still intrigued (although there were a couple points that seemed rather unbelievable (the wife's initial plan for herself...seriously???) but I was still willing to cut the author some slack there).<br /><br />Then..........the last fifty or so pages were brutal. BRUTAL!! I plowed through those last few chapters as quickly as possible, not because it was a page turner but because it was so ridiculous I just wanted the pain of reading it to end! What a total disappointment. It completely ruined what was up until the end an entertaining read. The ending was so stupid and unrealistic I cannot with good faith recommend this book to anyone. That being said, if you take this book on vacation with you and only get about 3/4 of the way through it before accidentally leaving it behind in your hotel room, then kudos to you! You did it perfectly!
B00SXK316E|5|Can't wait to watch Volume 2!
B001XRLWPQ|5|Nice like all the series
B005I64U5C|4|I know I'm in the minority, but I actually liked this movie!<br /><br />I've been a huge fan of the Green Lantern comics since I was a kid (I'm 50) and was thrilled to see it come to life on the big screen.  I felt it lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />Many of these reviews are comparing Green Lantern to other comic-based movies.  Is that fair?  It's a movie, in it's own right.  We watch THIS movie, and not four others side-by-side.  Was this as good as Iron Man?  No.  Better than Daredevil?  Yes.  How does it compare to the X-Men movies?  Better than some, worse than others.  Does it really matter?!  If we're going to rate it based on comparisons, let's really compare it to all the movies out there.<br /><br />If you didn't know who Green Lantern was before going to the movie, you definitely got some back story, some adventure, some action, some very good digital effects.  What more do you want?  Could it have been better?  Yes.  Could it have been worse?  Yes.<br /><br />I had fun, I enjoyed it, and the telling point of this, I think, is that I enjoyed it enough to want to own a copy for my home to watch it again.<br /><br />This particular version of the movie is the Blu-ray 3D version.  I happen to be a tremendous fan of 3D and was delighted with the effects in this film.<br /><br />As to the digital/streaming/ultra-violet crap...others have written much about this.  WB should probably be fined for false advertising.  Fortunately, my purchase was not made for this particular venture.  In fact, I'd rather they left it off altogether and saved me $5 on my purchase.
B00ILHW6AG|5|I gave it 5 stars because it was scary thought provoking. We all have our very own image of the afterlife and now what. But you just can't and will not stop reading.  Keep it up, I'm always surprised and I love it.
B00BD99JMW|5|Loved this series
0060254920|5|This is a replacement book for my granddaughters.  It's a wonderful story for children, and my granddaughters love it as much as my own children!  HIGHLY recommended.
B00HDMMISA|5|This was a wonderfully written, funny, suspenseful story. The characters have depth and are believable, and the feminist undertones are touching without being over the top. A lovely book!
B000KIE11Q|5|Good
B0052UZIFA|5|Runs great on both my DX and galaxy tab. Fun game just wish pop cap had done this a long tims ago.

B00KGL7Y6Q|4|Very good.  Watched it twice.  Great cast.
B001TCHDPS|5|I love this guy.  I can't believe that he was not popular in the US.  The music he writes and records is timeless.
B000XUBFE2|5|What a wonderful book!!!! I truly enjoyed reading it.  I like a book that tells it like it was.  War is a terrible thing to live through but sometimes good things can come from it.  Very moving and different.

B000UR9QGW|4|Evil Dead II is much better than Evil Dead.  It leads in to the Army of Darkness very well.  I am very pleased with the movie.
B006IGZWB2|5|Great story, hard to believe what some folks had to go through just to gain their deserved dignity.
0780622650|2|I was never a fan of the original \\"Lost in Space\\" TV show, so I didn't know what to expect when I saw the '98 film adaptation. Well, I'm not a fan of this film, either. This is not a fun sci-fi movie: the characters are dull and annoying (Penny and Will Robinson, especially), the acting is wooden (except for Gary Oldman), the dialogue is stiff, and the story is nothing special (and it does get way too complicated in the third act), and even set designs are not really interesting to look at. I'll give the movie credit for Oldman's performance and for its special effects, which are actually pretty decent. Besides that, this movie is really lame. It's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's still boring, silly, and downright unenjoyable.<br /><br />Grade: 3/10
B00B89WXYS|5|I am already looking forward to their next album...I mean &#34;disc&#34;.  They really know how to put everything together and make really great music.  Best with headphones so you can really experience the orchestra
B0040I09RM|5|Great series.  Only bad thing is it finished!  But, what an end.  Brilliant.
B00EI4V3X2|4|I love them but my only problem is the ear cups are a little to small for my ears. It really hurts after about an hour or so of gameplay. Other than that the sound is top notch and everything is clear and amazing.
B002KDUDG6|5|Michael Buble captures perfectly the sound of the Sinatra Era! It made me buy/download some Sinatra songs! He is a class act! Great collection of songs!
B0091W7K6K|4|Rotary dial telephones - no mobile devices here.  A classic car chase scene.  This is a great watch for us Boomers.
B003G4W49C|4|At a surface level it is an entertaining light read that will capture the imagination of young teens and adults. However embedded within its pages is a fantastic study of human morality.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I love it!
B000LPQ6DE|5|One could ask why we need another version of the classic novel, Jane Eyre. And actually my son asked me that as I began to watch this new Masterpiece Theater production. You could say that he might have a point there, except that we Jane Eyre addicts need regular doses of our heroine and her Mr. Rochester!<br /><br />Actually, there should not be any reason why this classic shouldn't be re-made periodically with different casts, different screenplays and a different director/artiste at the helm. There is so much in the novel to mine and use in any production.<br /><br />This one did not disappoint. My favorite is still the Timothy Dalton version, but this is a close second. The leads are wonderful, and I liked the updated take on the romance aspect, which took a few liberties, but was enjoyable.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00688628M|5|So well done you watch again and again
B0036UMM84|5|One of Barbaras best films , great music and great songs by both her and kris kristofferson. Gives u that real 70s feel and sound.
B000ZLFALI|5|Across the Universe, like the Lennon song from Let it Be, is about some younger people's experiences as they go through life as adults.  They discover love, enjoyment of place, the desire to take a stand on something important, consequnces of rash decisions, thought-leaders, and harsh individuals who wish to run roughshod over others.    If everyone watched this movie, the world would be a gentler, more understanding place.     The movie is very very good.  Its clever in how it incorporates names and ideas from various Beatles songs, as well as the songs.  Yet, the plot is not predictable. The movie is subtle, e.g.: there are reasonable and tolerant police, and harsh police, etc.   The acting and direction is superb.    After you see this movie, you will want to watch \\"Help!\\", \\"Hard Days Night\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and perhaps even \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\"
B00IK6H2O8|5|We could not have loved the movie more. Tom Hanks made a surprisingly good Walt Disney. Would recommend this movie to anyone
B005V2S7FW|3|I was too busy to really do much with it. I just took it off because I'm not ready to pay for premium,  though that's what I probably really need. Installed on advice and recommendation of a friend's friend. Will probably reinstall.
0345345061|4|I had hoped for more with this book but I bought it with a particular essay in mind for school work.  However, for hardcore Tolkein fan, this is a great treasure trove of essays, short stories, etc.
B007SOQBCM|4|Great for the most part stops every now and then but other than that it's great.<br /> I like it I get to see all of my favorite channels and people.
B004Q3RDUW|4|Not as great or as moving as The Kite Runner but still a wonderful look into the horrible experiences of the very beautiful Afghan people, who, like you & me, just want to live their lives in peace. They have endured war, danger and everchanging governments for so many years. It is heartbreaking. Hosseini is a wonderful author who so obviously knows of what he writes.
B0087DFIYA|5|I loved the movie.  I am glad to see Mel back in action.  This movie will keep you on your toes.  I would reccomend this movie to everybody.  Perfect movie to add to my collection.
B00KA87GCW|5|Don't want to put it down. Can play for hours
B007TMON8M|4|This is a great app. It challanges you and you can play in free for all mode wich gives you unlimutid explotions and you can drag things and in regular mode you have to build a structure that can hold water and snow and a bomb shack that can support an explotion and protect the dummy and tons of cool things. And if you want free for all mode you tap on a level and then there should be an options thing in the corner. Tap it then tap on the finger pointing up then onscreen you do it should say finger test then tap the begin Icon and at the top corner Onega you begin you should see little pictures tap one if you tap explotion then tap the screen to to cause an explotion and if you tap the finger you can drag things. I rodent rate this full stars because I recamend this app for older kids because it is very hard and when I complete a level it even asks me to type my name in to post my score and it seais that people rarly complete a level Wichita is why it asks for my name to post my score. I hope you enjoy this app!!!
B003ZSJ212|1|I'm just lending my voice to the cause.  Please boycott this product to show that Lucas' changes are unacceptable.  I've already cancelled my pre-order.
B00BAXFECK|5|A wonderful and compelling read.  I would recommend to book clubs and readers interested in art history it is a journey that makes one think
B000BJS4SU|5|Was never much of a radio friendly Mayer fan. But being a huge blues fan, after while  I ran across this disc. Simply a fantastic live blues album. Even the radio friendly crap songs he has take on a whole new meaning with John's natural blues swagger. I sure wont look down at his other recordings anymore. Killer recording.
0307588378|4|Arrived in good time -
B003H9MSPG|3|While I have been a fan of nerf guns ever since the longshot, this one is a bit of a dissapointment.<br /><br />This gun's functionality is great. The clip system allows for fast reloads.<br />But the gun is very average.  It is supposed to be a sniper rifle in every way but the ranges are just as good if not lower than many nerf guns.  It has a reverse plunger system.  This means that the insides of this are very similar to that of other non- sniper nerf guns (recon, alpha trooper, raider).  This makes for a very average gun.<br /><br />If you want this as your first nerf gun, it will work and function properly but be warned this IS NO SNIPER. It shoots no farther than any other nerf gun.<br /><br />In the end this gun will work fine if you buy it, but it would be smarter to invest in a different nerf gun.
1451627289|5|With such a vast catalog of work, it has become increasingly difficult for Stephen King's output of the last ten years or so to measure up to the past, or to be deemed \\"King-worthy,\\" so to speak.  Mixed opinions abound when it comes to the final three Dark Tower books, Cell, Lisey's Story, Duma Key, and Under the Dome, not to mention  the Bachman novel Blaze and the two collections, Just After Sunset and Full Dark, No Stars.  Despite this long-running lack of concensus, 11/22/63 looks like a bit of a comeback for the Stephen King brand.  For one, noted director Jonathan Demme signed on before the book had even been released to helm the film in one of the fastest turn-arounds from a book's release to a movie adaptation King has seen in years.  When an Academy Award-winning director wants your manuscript before the public even sees it, it's usually an indication of a pretty good book.  Add to that the fact that it's being praised by critics and fans both and 11/22/63 comes out a success all around.<br /><br />As a longtime King fan, which admittedly adds a certain bias, I was fascinated by the story, which went in different directions than I expected.  When I first heard that King was writing a book about going back in time to save JFK, I was interested, but less than thrilled.  Time travel is hardly an original concept, nor is the idea of changing the past, so I wasn't sure where King could go with that premise.  Well, he answered my doubts and then some, as far as I'm concerned.  The simplicity of the rabbit hole is perfect, and classic Stephen King.  I'm glad he didn't try to go the sci-fi route with some sort of time machine; instead, he chose a sort of interdimensional portal, not too different from those used in the Dark Tower books.  I was also captivated by the concept of the past fighting back, creating obstacles in proportion to the changes attempting to be made. It all had a feasibility that allowed me to completely suspend my disbelief, as the inexplicable existence of the hole, its random location, and its odd \\"rules\\" (opening on the same date and resetting with each use) made it seem that much more real, and made for incredibly fun storytelling.<br /><br />The book did satisfy my expectations of actually following Lee Harvey Oswald around and intimately observing his furtive lifestyle.  It felt genuinely chilling to experience him as a literary character, and looking over his shoulder had a dark, voyeuristic thrill that kept me turning pages long into the night.  As far as the assassination itself, King ignores some of the more plausible conspiracy theories, but his narrative tells the story of Jake Epping and Sadie, not of Oswald, so that makes sense.  I was almost disappointed when I first realized the book would go this route, but the characters and their stories are so rich and compelling that I lost that feeling quickly.  Jake, in particular, is one of King's best protagonists in many years, a thoroughly likeable, realistic character whose motivations are noble but believable.  He's very easy to root for, and you agonize over his pain.  Sadie and Deke are great characters, too.  King did a fine job of delivering both a mesmerizing plot and fully drawn characters.<br /><br />Speaking of delivering, the end of this novel does exactly that.  Given some of the ambiguity in recent King novels, I thought much would go unexplained, with Kennedy maybe being shot by someone other than Oswald without revealing the shooter, or Kennedy being saved but the changes to the future not being shown.  Not so.  Like early King novels, most everything is explained in an amazing conclusion that idealizes nothing.  King might be a liberal politically, but he has no agenda here to that end, knowing like previous authors of time-travel fiction that altering the past could never lead to a positive outcome, and certainly not to anything we could predict with any accuracy.  The infinite variables make the idea impossible, and readers andJake learn this together in heartbreaking fashion.  While I do have a preference for King as one of his fans, you don't have to take my word for it that 11/22/63 is a great book.  It's earning well-deserved praise from everywhere as one of his best.eartbreaking fashion.

B00E34A9FU|5|The Dead had just been in Europe for a 20 show trip, and now they were touring up the West Coast. This concert has been of mythical proportions for a lot of reasons. I'm glad the Dead decided to release this one to everyone and not just to Dead.net. The quality of this show is like uncanny, I just listened to the first 2 CDs and the quality of the music is even as good as something like Europe 72, but without the overdubs. It's 3 CDs and a DVD to watch. It's in Eugene ,Oregon in late August and it is like 107, so a lot of folk are walking around sans clothes. But you would not know it listening to the Dead. A great set list too.<br /><br />  The songs on HDCD sounded great, very good quality. If you want the full DVD set, get the Deluxe set. The DVD has 8 songs ,Promised land, China Cat/Know you Rider,Jack Straw,Bird Song,Dark Star,Sing Me Back Home, and Greatest Story Ever Told.<br /><br />  Garcia sounds as good as I have ever heard him, He just seems to have his strat plugged into an Amp. Not a lot of effects, Garcia was playing with the band really together, the vocals are really great. I had seen the film on youtube before and knew it was good. They really made the CDs sound great, it was a 16 track recording, not 2 track like most of their releases. I thought the movie was going to be longer, They really did a lot of improving in the film, the colors are much better, wanted to see them play more songs, but fortunately, The CDs all sound great. The Dead did a lot of work improving the sound quality on the CDs, great mixing and mastering. On the film, wish the cameras had stayed on the Band more and less on the totally nude people, but you can't change that now. Probably the best version of Bertha that I ever heard. Also, China Cat/Know You Rider was like a perfect version. The vocals were great. I'm glad that I got this cheaper version, the best thing for me was the CDs, they sound great.
B007J4T2G8|5|The writing is vivid, reels you in and leaves you wanting to know more about all the characters - even those that play small roles... I found myself completely wrapped up in the narration and would highly recommend the trilogy to anyone who really enjoys descriptive literature and a good time.
B0089LOG02|5|Could not put it down.  Makes me know how blessed I am, and realize all the hardships these poor orphans faced in those days.  Gripping!
1430300612|5|I learned so much from this book. Not only will you learn about her experience with a stroke, you will learn a great deal about how the mind works. I think for the first time doctor's will know what kind of care is essential and necessary for someone to recover from a stroke. Even if you don't know someone who has had a stroke you will obtain valuable information from this book. Highly recommended.

B0006SSOHC|5|I thought this would be scary! It wasn't but that's ok! It was a great movie, though! Obviously it's about this psycho and he has this puppet thingy. This one part a girl is trapped in all this gear and she has to get out of the chair she's trapped in and then her time starts ticking. I think she has one minute. And she has to find the key and it's in this guys stomache so she has to cut him open so u see lots of blood. I did think the puppet was scary!

B006X08FDA|5|--------------------------------------------------<br />Carolina Chocolate Drops<br />\\"Leaving Eden\\"<br />(Nonesuch, 2012)<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />A richly diverse, challenging record from a vigorous, intelligent band... another wily mix of old-timey music and backwoods blues from a contemporary band that mines the more obscure corners of the African-American musical heritage. The Chocolate Drops hearken back to the 19th century minstrel show days and the bluesy jug bands of yesteryear.  Their fourth album pushes the group into more self-consciously modern territory, with songs such as \\"Country Girl\\" and \\"Leaving Eden\\" that stray from their more traditional roots, and bring them closer to the style of Americana groups such as the Be-Good Tanyas, Uncle Earl, et.al..  You gotta love their unruly sound, though, with the squeaky fiddle and super-plunky, thrashed-out banjo, particularly when paired up with now-arcane, old-school instruments such as the hambones, as heard on their version of \\"Ruby, Are You Mad At Your Man.\\" Highlights include \\"Boodle-De-Bum-Bum,\\" a great jugband tune that's one of many styles in an eclectic mix that adventurous Americana fans will want to check out. Fun stuff! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)

B0014DBZT2|4|I won't waste your time with overused and flabby adjectives.  Suffice it to say, Nick and his Bad Seeds cohorts slide into middle age with chops, prowess, and style.  If you liked his previous work, this should suit you just fine.  If you've never listened to the father of Goth-lounge then this is just as good a place to start as any.  Of course, the teens might find him boring, but then many think if one isn't wearing eyeliner, one has no street cred.
B00DR0PDNE|5|I bought two and I love how you can load them both on one device and switch programs from another room......I can watch some of my movies from my tablet and that is great because i dont have to use the HDMI
0385341008|5|A wonderful story with love, humor and some fascinating but little known history. Loved it.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Like it because I played miniclip as a kid.
0061906220|5|A simple but captivating story book with a catchy tune.  Kindergartners love to hear Pete the Cat - and it's got a great closing message.  It's all good!
B0001XAOLQ|3|epic movie
B003XWEQ1G|5|This story really is different in a lot of ways.  Once you accept that, it is really an enjoyable film.  And it fulfills what a movie is to me:  entertainment.
B00J89SIYE|5|Just love this vinly of Dolly, just can't get enough of listing to it! Just love the duets! It is worth every penny! Well spent!
B007MB5OCE|5|THE BOOK IS QUIRKY AND I LOVE THE UNUSUAL CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK.  THE PATH THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS TAKE IS AMAZING AND AMUSING.  VERY ENJOYABLE READING!
B009UX2YAC|5|great game
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Downton Abbey is a beautiful trip back in time. It's a great binge watch! This is a must watch show for anyone who loves the Brits and period tv!
B0026P3G12|5|I love every single song on this CD! Usually I really like 2, maybe 3 songs on an album. Not this time. Every one is completely beautiful and moving. I don't think Susan Boyle is capable of singing a bad song. I can't explain what it is, but there's something touching about her voice. I waited a long time for this CD, and now I can hardly wait for her next one.
B001QOGYBI|4|I used this video to culminate a book unit on Fantastic Mr. Fox. My students enjoyed the movie more than the book. The movie gave better understanding and made the story more entertaining. I highly recommend it.
B00HGJ18C2|3|I don't like that the game doesn't automatically load the cards once you have won the game. It is tedious sending them all to the top and wastes time. It also doesn't give your actual score as far as I know.
B002M5E2DW|5|Very helpful & enjoyable. The principles outlined in the book really work. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to expand their spiritual life, and make the journey more enjoyable.
B004SEUJKU|5|People complain about multiple releases.  I collect movies and most popular movies are released several times on the most popular media form.    Short of remastering the film frame by frame I doubt that you will ever get the picture or sound quality of let's say \\"Pirates of the Caribbean.\\"      Face it Orion (the distributor) was not a major distributor and the Terminator was not expected to be the cult hit that it became.    There are many movies on the market which picture quality falls short of our sophisicated expectations.  As our audio/visual technology advances most of the movies that you are purchasing now will look like trash.    If you like the movie and have the money to spare don't let a review dissuade you.  See for yourself.  Rent a copy from Netflix or Red Box then make your decision.
B009CPJHY4|4|very enjoyable, Judi DEnch is superb as always and was nice to have a happy ending! I have recommended it to several people.
B00FLML7HW|5|This product is all five movies but only the theatrical versions of the films. No special editions or special features. They literally took each disc from the blu-ray cases of the original packaged stand alone titles, for each movie, and put them in one special blu-ray box. So you will see the phrase &#34;disc one&#34; on almost each of the discs. So no special features or extra content.<br />Aside from that, this honestly was a great deal. I bought this on sale at about $29.99. Honestly it is worth it to have all 5 movies for such a low price, which is about $6 a bluray movie.<br /><br />I preordered the following for a complete XMEN collection:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K7IPGS6?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B00K7IPGS6&linkCode=shr&tag=swiclu-20&linkId=J6AEXYKWSF3T353L<br /><br />Cheers!
B00CMQX84A|5|My girls 5 and 8 love this movie. They love the songs (we even bought the soundtrack), the style, and the dancing. My oldest even had a TBM birthday party. It is hard to find movies that are not animated that are appropriate for this age group so I was very impressed to see Disney put out this great option!
B00Y6QF0PE|4|Great quick read.  So cool to hear the story from the other point of view.  Especially the last few chapters!
B00E8KLWB4|4|I am enjoying this game. I like that it does not make it to easy or too hard. I like the music really well.
B00IWULQQ2|5|As good on DVD as it was on TV the first time.
B002PEP4U0|4|Amazing what you can do when you just try! Despite a lack of education and resources, the main character succeeded in quest for bringing electricity to his village.
B000U0O9FM|5|I've loved this story because of the movie. So I read the book to see what it was really about. It was (and I knew it would be) better than the movie
B000VZUWZW|5|It's like watching my life in so many ways. Thanks TBBT.
1401235425|4|I like the secret society of the owls and their agents the talons.  I just didn't think they needed to include it in all the other Batman comics.  I am interested in seeing the Owls and Talons again but not anytime soon.
B00005MP58|5|This rendition of Jane Austen's novel superb, simply amazing! When I first read the novel, I was so taken by it that I immediately started reading it once more after reaching the last page. And so began hopeless addiction to the story. This screen adaptation is probably the closest a movie/series will ever get to capturing the essence of the book or what the author had in mind. The story was retold to perfection and the actors played their roles so well that Jane Austen's characters will be forever immortalized in their faces. Mrs. Bennet was superb, Elizabeth outstanding, and who could forget the annoying Mr. Collins? And ladies be warned! you will fall in love with Mr. Darcy! I watched the tape version countless times but I must admit the DVD set takes the tediousness out of the whole process. All in all this is quite the collector's item and well worth having. Viva Pride and Prejudice!
B005HEK3JW|5|I grew up watching these episodes and it's great to revisit them from time to time.  They never get old.
B00G4NUQYM|5|Fun, challenging game. I learned New words after solving the scrambled answers. Go in settings and check that option.
B004FPZ2LI|4|I enjoyed reading the book but surprisingly like the movie better.
B008HK3XU4|5|The case is strong and durable. I have already spilled something<br />on the case and it came clean with a couple of swipes! I love it<br />Thank you
B00MASEK74|5|Yes!
B00T4837W2|4|Awesome tale
B0064MPXFA|5|I have watched this show since day one and this summer I thought I would start over just to refresh my memory about story lines, characters and relationships and how everything connected and I was again reminded how this is probably the best non-cable show out there. Good stuff.
B00GH4R95C|2|My rating is based on my Amazon  movie going experience and not the actual movie.  Movie was great!! Sound quality was REALLY low and had to up my volume when people were talking. It was like the actors were whispering to each other.  Very disappointed and hope this doesn't happen again.
B003TSEL7S|5|This is book was really good! It was so good! It was cool when they fighted enceladus! Loved it so much!
0679882820|5|My 2 yr old grandaughter and I love this book.  Great price, quality and shipping.  Will deal with this seller again.
B0063GORYU|3|Addicting.
B0020BUWX2|5|Great story of love and tragedy.  I was happy and then sad. Then left wanting more.  Adam drew me in and both mia are old souls.  Bravo.  Well done!
B003O86FMW|5|This book was much more predictable than the first book. There were a few surprises, but it was nothing like the continual surprises and building excitement of book one. I still love the characters, still am dying to know who (if anyone) she gets together with and what will happen.<br /><br /> I have to say that for me, finding books to get lost in is tough. Little things usually annoy me like those \\"oh isn't this a bit too convenient\\" moments. But I let the rare few in this book slide because I like Katniss so much.
B0049J3QAY|5|I watched this movie with my daughter when she was a child and with my son now.  It is a great children's movie.  I think it helps the children to not be scared of the dark or what is underneath the bed.
B00NWLIW0E|5|It freezes after a bit and is annoying when it does that. Great game... but do not save up for this. And buy it&eth;&reg;&eth;&reg;&eth;&reg; still great graphics but small map for five bock
0425263916|5|I enjoyed the continuing story and look forward to the next one,  Entwined in You.  It is suppose to give up more info!!!
B00005JN2Z|4|I don't like Tom Cruise. I don't like him, his Scientology `religion,' his strutting style of acting, or the horse he rode in on. BUT. He's really good in Collateral. He plays a ruthless hit man out to eliminate 5-6 people who might potentially testify in an upcoming high-profile trial. He hops into a cab driven by Max, superbly played (I mean, SUPERBLY) by Jamie Foxx, and sets off on an all-night shooting spree. <br />Cruise doesn't change one whit throughout the film: he's a killing machine, period. <br />But Foxx. Omigod, Jamie Foxx begins as a taxi hack in a nowhere life and slowly becomes the reluctant hero of the film as he valiantly (and very improbably, but hey, this is an action movie, so sit back and just take it on faith) tries to save the life of Cruise's last and ultimate victim: the pretty DA in charge of the case. <br />It's exciting and edge-of-your seat tense throughout, and only 3 things really bothered me: 1) It's not believable that a car would overturn and crash to smithereens without either of the occupants getting more than a bruise, and Cruise's clothes don't even get mussed up, 2) It's not possible for women to run that desperately fast in 3-inch heels, and 3) The very last scene of them outside at dawn overlooking a freeway and parking lot was just...empty. Anticlimactic. <br />Anyway, it's a terrific shoot-`em-up film, if you like this sort of thing. <br />
B007L6VR6M|5|I had never seen this movie before purchasing it, but it is definitely worth watching over and over. Fantastic movie, fantastic cast.
0061714402|5|Awesome read!
B003HFFVDQ|5|This is an extremely solid album, their best in far too many years. I've never been one of those \\"I liked them before they got mainstream and sold out\\" kind of people, because who cares, in all honesty I don't want genius to go unrecognized or unrewarded, but my expectations of artists very often goes unfulfilled: they need to keep the faith. Chemical Brothers veered off course for awhile, but they're finally back on the right path, all cylinders blazing. This is seriously a beautiful album filled with many masterful touches and some fantastic textures.
B00ALCBU4M|3|Back in 2006, \\"Company of Heroes\\" became the highest rated real-time strategy videogame for the PC.  Developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ, news of a film adaptation inspired by the video game and true events from World War II began to materialize.<br /><br />But due to the unknown climate of the video game industry and THQ filing bankruptcy, not much was known about the status of the live action film.<br /><br />While Relic Entertainment was sold to Sega in January 2013, thus prolonging the life of the \\"Company of Heroes\\" video game series, the film which was originally to be released in theaters is now being released direct-to video on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.<br /><br />Directed by actor Don Michael Paul (\\"The Garden\\", \\"Who's Your Caddy?\\") and written by David Reed (\\"Supernatural\\", \\"Battlestar Galactica\\"), the low budget World War II film would star Tom Sizemore (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Black Hawk Down\\", \\"Heat\\"), Chad Michael Collins (\\"Lake Placid 2″), Vinnie Jones (\\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\", \\"Swordfish\\", \\"Snatch\\"), Dimitri Diatchenko (\\"Chernobyl Diaries\\", \\"Get Smart\\", \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\"), Neal McDonough (\\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\", \\"Minority Report\\", \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\"), Jurgen Prochnow (\\"Das Boot\\", \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", \\"The English Patient\\") and Richard Sammel (\\"Inglourious Basterds\\", \\"Casino Royale\\").<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Company of Heroes\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition and featured in 1:78:1 aspect ratio.  First, I need to emphasize that this film was made with a low budget and this is not a huge World War II production.  While Director Don Michael Paul knew the budget limitations for \\"Company of Heroes\\", for the most part, he was able to make things work by focusing on the characters and for surroundings, making things ominous by having the characters in snow and around trees and branches.  But skin tones do look natural, close-ups were very effective and black levels were very good.<br /><br />The film relied on characters taking action during the dark or in the snow and for that, it does give an ominous presence towards the film. But what makes the film feel like World War II is through the costume design by Anna Gelinova (\\"Hitman\\", \\"Expendables 2″).  While I'm not an erudite on World War II garb, the crew did their research in trying to make the film look as authentic as possible with the limitations that they had.  You're not going to see a wide shot of a plethora of tanks or hundreds of soldiers but the shots and action sequences were carefully planned.  I didn't need so much to see blood spurting out as much but the film does look good on Blu-ray and for the most part, I do feel that with the budget that the crew had, they made the film feel right in terms of presentation.  I didn't notice any aliasing or specks or any problems with picture quality during my viewing.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Company of Heroes\\" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Fortunately, there are a good number of heavy action scenes that utilized the surround channels with efficacy.  Dialogue is crystal clear, as well as musical score by Frederik Weidmann (\\"Hostel Part III\\").<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, Engish SDH, Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin, Traditional), Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified), Dutch, French, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Company of Heroes\\" come with the following special features:<br /><br />  Deleted Scene: Kestrel and Squad Meet in a Safe House - (2:57) One deleted scene.<br />  In the Trenches - (10:28) Featuring interviews with Director Don Michael Paul, producer Jeff Beach and the cast and discussion of the differences between the film and the video game.<br />  Fabricating World War II - (5:41) Director Don Michael Paul discusses making a war movie and trying to make it look authentic as possible on a low budget.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Company of Heroes\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows for one to download their film to a computer or on select Apple and Android devices and to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />The first thing that fans of \\"Company of Heroes\\" will wonder is \\"if the film is any good?\\".<br /><br />I can understand.  A low-budget war film that went straight from direct-to-video and a director who does not have an A-list film to his credit may turn some people off.<br /><br />But you never know as one may be able to make something incredible as Stanley Kubrick accomplished with a very low budget for his film debut and his war film, \\"Fear and Desire\\".  Or something disappointing and not worth your time.<br /><br />With Don Michael Collins, I have to say that when it comes to a popcorn action World War II film, he was able to create an entertaining film despite operating with a low budget.<br /><br />First, let me just say that this is not a film that is deep in plot.  Nor is it a film where one who is used to watching big budget action, will see a plethora of tanks, soldiers or a film about company bravado like the \\"Band of Brothers\\" TV series.<br /><br />But what we have is a war film about a group of soldiers facing a significant challenge in recovering a defecting German scientist who is in charge of a secret weapons program.<br /><br />While some may feel it is farfetched to have four soldiers (two Americans, one British and one Soviet) accomplishing a mighty task, this is not one of those films where you search for World War II accuracy.  Like the video game in which operations are inspired by true events but not exact events, having played many World War II video games, part of that excitement in the video game is trying to defeat the enemy, with what you have.  In this case, not much of trying to defeat the enemy with a large military force but to find the German scientist and leave!<br /><br />I don't care to see much in a war film is the overuse of blood squirting out of someones neck nor do I want to see a love angle in a war film.  The film incorporated a little of each but nothing that made me feel too bad about the film.<br /><br />As for the positives...a positive factor about this film is that it incorporates a few well-known names who have appeared on major big budget war films.  Tom Sizemore is best known for his roles in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down\\", Neal McDonough had appeared in \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" and \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\", Jurgen Prochnow of \\"Das Boot\\" and \\"The English Patient\\" and Richard Sammel of \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" and you have others who also appeared on bigger budget film as well.<br /><br />With a tight schedule, low budget and only a day to film with a tank but still make the film feel believable and authentic, I just felt that with what Don Michael Paul had to work with, he and his crew did a good job.  Anna Gelinova was able to make the costume design feel right and to have cinematography focus on locations that take part in the dark, around snow or dirt, the crew and cast managed to make things work!<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality was very good.  Great detail on close-ups.  Lossless audio also featured good use of the surround channels and there were a few special features included.  It would have been great to have audio commentary included with this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Company of Heroes\\" is a popcorn action World War II film that may not be as memorable compared to many other World War II films out there, but I did find it entertaining.  Will fans of the video game enjoy this film?  I think that it will be subjective, but I do feel that for its low budget and the fact that the film does star a several well-known talent, the end result was much better than I expected.n a low budget.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Company of Heroes\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows for one to download their film to a computer or on select Apple and Android devices and to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />The first thing that fans of \\"Company of Heroes\\" will wonder is \\"if the film is any good?\\".<br /><br />I can understand.

1451627289|2|I looked forward to reading this book as I thought it was a significant departure from mr. Kimg's usual style. I found this book had a very slow start and hard to follow the action. He uses so much detail that the story frequently got lost. It was hard to become invested in the characters and I couldn't wait to finish the book.
B001FB55HQ|5|Thank You!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5|Romantic, enticing, sexy, romantic drama. Very addicting, you cant put it down. Highly recommend to anyone who loves books like 50 shades.
B00136Q342|5|If you are Johnny Cash fan, this is the must have album. Most of the big hits are here, and the best versions of them out there.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|Excellent reading.  I was getting tired of mystery books & enjoyed this very much.  I do recommend this for everyone that like David Baldacci's books.
B00GRXA7GG|4|When nobody has the time to play with me, this offers a lot of options. There are some great background and tile choices, as well as several arrangement s to chooose from.
B00571F26Y|4|Dr Davis' book is a good explanation of why there has been such an increase in gluten intolerance and celiac disease in this country. Not to mention the skyrocketing incidence of obesity and diabetes in adults and children. I recommend this book for anyone who is considering going wheat free.
B000WC3AKI|5|It's amazing. Love that natural disasters movies.I know it's a old movie but is great and keep you at the edge.
B003G8Y4QO|5|Definately the best season
B0000039QA|5|Biggie, Pac, who cares, it is all about good music, and both released some exceptional albums.  As for Life After Death, I don't like it as much as Ready To Die, but there is no doubt that it is still an absolute classic.   <br />I like Big's humor:  For example, the ending to N*ggaz Bleed, the start of Nasty Boy, Brooklyn's Finest (from Reasonable Doubt, Jay-Z). <br /> <br />Long Kiss Goodnight is an ok diss song toward 2pac, but the whole yo yo yo yo yo yo is somewhat annoying.  Also, Puffy sounds a bit funky yelling. <br /> <br />The entire album is a classic, some of my favs are: Somebody's Gotta Die, N*ggaz Bleed, Miss U, Going Back To Cali, Ten Crack Commandments, You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills you).
B003YL4LYI|5|More!  Can't put these down- need to know endings.  Love 'em.  Awful to spend every waking moment reading - love it!!
B007TBZ63Y|4|Rick Riordan writes an amazing third installation of the Olympians series! It may be a little less action-packed than the third Kane Trilogy book, but it keeps moving nicely. There's a romance element in this one, and it's nice to see Greeks and Romans together at last! It's a page-turner that'll keep you going until the last page, and perfect for the pre-teen reluctant reader who needs a solid story line to draw him/her in!
B0068857QA|2|I has a liberal subtext slapped all over it. F**** you liberals!
0393072231|4|Michael Lewis is a very talented writer and this book is further evidence of his talent. He has chosen to the tell the story of the sub-prime crisis through the eyes of the people who realized early what was going on and decided to short the market. Fair enough; very interesting perspective. I was hoping for a more comprehensive view, looking at the bankers, regulators, politicians and borrowers as well. Perhaps that is too much to ask, but that is required to create the definitive book on this sorry mess. Or I guess you can stitch together Too Big to Fail (Bankers), On the Brink (Treasury), Definitely Wasn't my Fault (politicians and borrowers), Still Not Sure What Happened, but not My Fault Either (Rating agencies) and add it to The Big Short and The Greatest Trade Ever (shorts) and make your own summary version.    Side note, IMHO giving the book low reviews because it is not available in Kindle is not helpful.
B000JLSM00|5|This is a candidate for best movie, if not best Western.  It explores racism in white settlers and Comanche warriors.
B000CCD0HQ|4|This is where Top buckled down, got their sound straightened out, and focused on delivering one killer blues-rocker after another. Yeah, they had done so before with Rio Grande Mud (another good one), but this was a tighter, better album. Which is why it produced the group's breakthrough hit, the dirty-voiceover-meets-Hip Shake-riff-meets-stellar-guitar-solo La Grange. It didn't break the Top 40, but it came close enough and is today justly a classic rock radio staple. Speaking of which, I assume you've also heard cuts like Waiting for the Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago and Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers. Both songs are essential ZZ. Scorching, brilliantly simple blues-rock. Actually, that's what the whole album's like, so if you like those you shouldn't forget about Master of Sparks, Move Me on Down the Line or Precious and Grace. Those seven are good enough to make this ZZ's best album ever. But it's second to Deguello because some of it isn't very impressive - Hot Blue and Righteous could be my least favorite classic-era ZZ Top song, I don't know. But I'm not a fan of it. Ballads never were Top's strong suit in the first place. I'm not exactly blown away by Shiek or Have You Heard Either. But this should belong to anyone who appreciates the little ol' blues band from Texas.
0525951652|5|There are way too many people giving this a bad review because of the Kindle price. While that may be a problem it does not have anything to do with the quality of the writing or plot of the book. Write Amazon/Kindle and complain about the price. Review the book for the quality of the book.
B00005J6T1|5|this is my favorite madonna album ever. it's beutiful songs will stick in your head for weeks! my favorite track is &quot;Everybody&quot; it is a dance classic! other satandout tracks include &quot;holiday&quot; &quot;Lucky star&quot; &quot;Burning up&quot; and &quot;i know it&quot; but the rest of the cd is great to! now on to the remixes. Finishing the cd are two remixes of burning up and lucky star. These remixes are both longer and better than the origanals! The burning up remix is the most notably different song from the origanal, it's beat is so much better! and the lucky star remix is also better! Go to your record store and buy this CD!
B00003CX8Y|5|You have to see it, and I have never heard anyone say they hate it, or even dislike it.  Its a classic a must have! One of the greatest disney movies ever made
1439148953|4|A great read.   If you grew up in Brooklyn or anywhere in the 50 and 60's, even better.   Now looking forward to reading Mr. Toibin's other novels.
B00EL8I8IS|5|Holy moly!  The action starts quickly, and doesn't really let up.  Just the way we like it!<br />Scary/Creepy as heck, too.  Highly recommend!!
B008Y7045C|3|Not bad
B00IUBXPEY|5|Just as good as the first actually better.  The acting is good and the storyline keeps you engaged.  I haven't read the books but after watching this movie I want to read the next one before the movie.
B009O2XY12|3|Game was &#34;free&#34; but I wasn't playing too long before I had to start buying more bubbles to continue. I enjoyed the game until pay time then quit playing
B00EL8JCGU|3|This movie kept my interest, but somewhat predictable.  Brad Pitt does a great performance.
B009LDD4V4|5|Love Bones and had a great experience with Amazon!
B00BHMF578|4|Great acting.  And although the outcome is known to history the way the story is told makes for something of an edge of your seat nail biter.
B000E6ET1G|4|This is seminal psych, more toward garage than psych, but is good garage, fast paced and well composed, not campy. The sound quality is quite good and clear. It's an interesting compilation.
B00DH7P6WU|3|I guess I'm spoiled after having purchased so many collectible Barbies.  These newer fashion dolls are nice in that they are fully articulated, but the features leave so much to be desired, and clothing too.  I purchased these at a much discounted price so I can't complain about the relative value.  And the children love the new stories and characters so they are very pleased with them.  There are enough really detailed reviews of the pair that I don't need to go into detail here.
B0028KGD8I|5|This is probably the only place I have seen a bad review for Dexter on. This is  great Show and everyone I know absolutely loves it. The first episode of season one take a while to pick up, but after it's smooth sailing through the rest of the seasons. It's a psychological thriller, and at times it can be a little gruesome but it is the best show I have seen in a while.
B00B0LPWU6|4|Denszel was great as a functioning alcoholic while still being an excellent pilot. Loved this film, although the ending was rather abrupt.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is really good<br />It is better than temple run I think u need to get this game it is good for kids
B00PTB7B34|2|Why don't you make it easier for us to play the game, isn't that the purpose of playing games? Instead of trying to wring every last dollar out of us with your ridiculous pricing and timelines...
B00NOPQU2K|4|Excellent
B002XMGGK6|3|An intense thriller that contains more than one nail-biting scene. There are also quite a few gruesome scenes in the way of horror movies. Gerald Butler delivers his role with aplomb. This movie asks a lot of moral and ethical questions and answers possibly none of them. Although I wouldn't look at this film for moral fiber, I'd definitely turn to it for a diversion, and for another look at how divisive the justice system is. The most bothersome thing about this movie is the fact that the title isn't hyphenated.
B001L5VYFI|4|I first bought this double-LP my freshman year in college. It was compiled from five shows in the summer of 1970 from the Filmore East in New York, the Chicago Auditorium and the Forum in Los Angeles.<br /><br />While i thoroughly enjoyed CSN's debut, I've always felt they were at their best with  the mercurial Neil Young in tow. That's what makes 4 WAY STREET one of their most enjoyable albums. Sure, they include a lot of material from their individual solo careers (including hits like Graham Nash's \\"Chicago\\" and Stephen Stills' \\"Love the One You're With\\"), but like any great band they were greater than the sum of their individual parts. Listen to the interplay between Stills and Young on the 14-minute \\"Carry On\\" or the vocal harmonies on the acoustic \\"Find the Cost of Freedom.\\" When the band was in sync, they were magical.<br /><br />In addition, the original vinyl release has been expanded from 76 minutes to nearly 110 minutes. Granted, about ten of those 34 minutes are simply extended between-songs patter and applause. However, the original release had only seventeen tracks; there are now twenty-one. The added tracks include \\"King Midas in Reverse,\\" one of the final singles by the Hollies before Nash left the band; David Crosby's \\"Laughing,\\" which would later turn up on the Byrds' reunion album; Stills' \\"Black Queen,\\" which finally appeared in studio form on 1991's CSN box set; and the Neil Young medley \\"The Loner/Cinnamon Girl/Down by the River.\\"<br /><br />Even if you own all of their studio albums, 4 WAY STREET belongs in every fan's collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B0036S4B6M|3|Pretty good story. Good character development. Would definitely be interested in watchkng the show on Netflix. Really enjoyed the book overall.
B004U7JYXS|5|Package came in QUICK! It was exactly as pictured!
B00701L5XS|1|When opening this app on the Galaxy Tab 7, it loads then locks up and the device has to be turned off.
B009UX2YAC|5|My kids had this game on their iPhones,  I'm so glad they made it for the kindle, Alot of fun. Try it you'll love it too.
B00H83EUQW|5|i am a space nut, loved the movie but had to forgo some of the facts of distance in space and one other part of the film i know was wrong. watch it and youll see what i'm talking about
B00H8AXJR6|4|2013R: A good movie that reminded me of why I hardly drink anymore, and how the 'living in the moment' bs aka: 'fun' can take years to recover from.<br /><br />Didn't really understand one scene where it looked like one of the kids got hit by a car, but in the next scene appears to be ok. Not sure what the message was there. (still scratchin my head)<br /><br />It would help generations if the we changed the name of 'alcohol' to 'depression', and put that on every alcoholic beverage in America. That way it would read '100 Proof = 50% Depression by Volume' to give a true glimpse as to what each bottle/can actually contain(s).<br /><br />Again, a good movie. Sad, but true. Enjoy MFJLabs 4x
B009HEJXFS|5|I Like all the Men in Black. This one has a twist at the end. Can't wait for more slick.
B000099T2L|5|THis album shows that Beyonce is here to stay!! THe girl is an incredible writer, singer, and performer,unlike Ashanti. This album is extremely soulful. Her voice is like none other of the female artists today. She is in a class all by herself!! Her ballads are beautiful!! This is definitely an all-purpose album.
0784011680|5|I absolutely love this movie. Everything about it was absolutely perfect. I felt like I had to wait forever to get this, but it was so worth the wait. This is one award winning performance after another. I absolutely love it. You should DEFINITELY get it for yourself and your family.
B00BFUUMO8|5|The best park builder ever<br />Aka a glacier tournament will come in Jan 12 2015 there is already a battle area for Jurassic and aquatic.<br /><br />#best in the world
B000B8QEZG|4|First CD I have purchased in a long time with no regrets.<br /><br />Every song is memorable, the lyrics are empowering without being preachy. Hypnotic beats keep you locked into Madonna's world and literally make you feel like you're in a highrise dance club.  My mind takes a trip everytime I play the CD, which is nice when you're sitting at your desk for 8 hours a day.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me from giving the album 5 stars is that song #5 \\"I love New York\\", was subpar for me...in fact, Id go so far to say it's 'stupid' compared to the rest of the album.  It's the only song that seems silly and has nothing to offer me.  But, cut that song out, and the album is absolutely snap.  Finally Madonna gets fun again and does what she does best: make you want to get up and dance :)
B00L9B7IKE|3|I started this book yesterday on the recommendation of two friends and finished it today.  I don't usually care for plot-driven fiction, but I was sympathetic to the flawed narrator and I was just plain curiious.  What a romp!  This isn't a great book but it's certainly a great diversion for an afternoon.
B00005JMEW|4|This film is mostly geared toward anyone who loves 70s exploitation films, particularly martial arts films. Although I think Quinten is a very creative filmaker, I dont think he is a very good action director. Hardly in the catagory of John Woo!  But it was a decent effort. The over the top violence was obviously taken from Japanese director Miki (Dead or Alive, Ichi the Killer etc..) I'm giving 4 stars for the creativity and the homage to asian filmaking. If you liked this movie then do yourself a favor and check out the japanese and chinese directors and the films that KILL BILL is referencing... Dead or Alive, Ichi the Killer, Any Chinese language John Woo film and of course any Shaw Bros. martial arts film (Dirty Ho, Invincible Shaolin, Fist of White Lotus just to name a few good ones.)
B004DLPXAO|5|I love downloading books and reading them on this app.  It is very easy to use and adjust to what I need
B003Q6D2B4|5|It was great. Movie had humor, funny, blunt. shoot & bang them up movie. What more could you ask for.
B003O86FMW|5|Once I started I couldn't put it down.  I already have the third book on my kindle and will start reading it immediately!
B000000H57|5|I take 5 star ratings very seriously.  This one deserves so much more than 5.  I've sat down before and really put a lot of thought into making a top 20 albums list of all time (for personal fun, and not just a quick 5-minute deal...  a LOT of thought into it), and guess which album ended up #1?  Ahead of things like...  (probably going to get shot for this one) Pink Floyd - The Wall...  The Smashing Pumpkins - Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness...  Tool - Aenima... <br /> <br />Yes, October Rust.  Most commercial album?  I really couldn't give any less of a damn because it's the most erotic, beautiful, dark, somber, entrancing album I own and have heard. <br /> <br />If you're a huge October Rust fan like me (well, I'm also a huge Type O fan, but I'm talking about the October Rust sound in particular), don't waste your time trying to satiate your hunger by finding something else that sounds like it.  There's nothing out there.  Or if there is, I hope someone posts another review here and informs me.  The closest things I've found are Moonspell - Darkness and Hope, and Paradise Lost - One Second.  But all listening to Paradise Lost did was make me want to listen to Type O, so I traded it not long after purchasing it...  however, I do still listen to Moonspell sometimes.
B00AECGQF2|5|I love this game you can do so many things like styling hair doing crazy pica its a lot of fun you should get it
B000NQRE9Q|5|My son has a great fondness for classic movies, especially adventures. Even after almost a year of owning this movie he has watched the complete adventure several times. It has been an opportunity to talk about many subjects, especially WWII. I did not realize at the time of the purchase how this would be a great way to open up discussions about sensitive topics.
B003IVDPC8|5|Music where you can hear the lyrics!  Wonderful collection of song tracks.  I wish I could have been at this concert.
B004H4XI5O|4|I loved the stories, the research on all things memory.  Well written and researched, I learned a ton about how our memory works while being entertained following the Author's story from outsider to the US championships.  Just beware that this is NOT a book on techniques to improve your memory.
B00002N9ER|5|I use these to hold my jeep's license plate on the winch fairlead rollers. Works perfectly, holds strong.
B00KY7PEAA|5|The game is fun but it takes time but when u get started it is very fun.<br />You can train men and build stuff then get ready for battle because when your protection is gone your going to have to fight to stay in the game.
B00881VLCE|5|This game is super awesome!!!!!!! I love it there are tons of levels and it is so easy to use!!
1591842972|5|I'm fascinated with success stories, for some reason Steve Job's heroic journey has captivated me more than most. I mean the man has VISION, so sorely in absentia as regards contemporary leadership, and that might be understating things, lol. Say what you will about Mr. Jobs; THE MAN HAS VISION! and executes on same.    Mr. Kahney simply tells a great story and documents his POV nicely. That's it, this is a great story wonderfully told. I couldn't put it down.    As well, this fun ride isn't a bad business management, leadership tool either; each chapter having interesting summations of Mr. Job's and Apple's methodology as relates to company and product successes, while also detailing why some things did not work.    I highly recommend this book.
B0051ANPZQ|5|That was a great summer read for school or even on your own, so many great parts. I found out about the book from many of my friends so I decided to try it and it was worth it.
B004UJTG6Q|5|This was very disappointing. Was not what I exspected! Will not recommend. This gets a thumbs down!  Amy
B00HOGGUZW|5|interesting game but becomes monotonous
0345803485|4|Does it live up to all the hype and whispers?  Yup.
B00G5G7EXY|5|The music, the writing, the animation everything is great! My 5 year old loves to watch it over and over :)
B004SJ3BCI|5|yipee Angry Birds! I don't have a cell phone so I've been coveting this game ever since my niece showed me how to play. Thank you for offering this on the new Kindle Fire HD, loving it. 5 stars.
B008XG1X18|5|pinterest is a whole new world!! :) love it!! it gives so many ideas especially for holidays and special events!
B0000DZ3EN|1|If this were not an Oz film with some allusions back to the Wizard of OZ, this would be even worse. And I WANTED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE! This movie was very disappointing with only a few redeeming qualities. <br /> <br />The plot has little value, what is the plot other then going back to Oz. <br />The characters are so unbelievable, Tic Toc, Pumpkin Head, and the silly guys on wheels are so poorly designed. I never got a sense of caring about any of the characters let alone did they reach the character development of the original where each had a mission. These characters just seem to be in the present, doing what  is right in front of them with no motivation of their own. Another matter of question is why the character don't move their mouth, Tick Tock moves his moustache and the pumkin head barely moves. One would think that since 1939, they could come up with some great characters with great graphics or at least make them adorable, none of which have come to fruition. My God, what happened to the scarecrow, really pathetic compared to the original scarecrow. I wonder what were the art directors of this movie thinking? These characters look like some high school theatre project, without the naive simplicity and innocence. There is no real plot, no higher purpose, no real goals, no great lines, if this was not a sequel to Oz, it would have little value at all. Too bad the new Dorothy did not have a movie to live up to her fine acting and child spirit. Gad, the tin man and lion are jokes. Why does she call the lion the Cowardly Lion cowardly, did not he become courageous? <br /> <br />Dorothy stands out as a child to be reckoned with as an actress and character. The fact that Dorothy looks younger is also odd as well. She is sweet, strong and did a good job, too bad the film did not live up to its promise.  <br /> <br />The new bad guy Nemo has a playful side which is amusing, neither all bad nor all good. The only character who wants something valuable, King Nemo, wants to become fully human, at least he has some goals and he is killed off.   <br /> <br />Simply put, this movie lacked imagination. I am not sure why some people feel a need to defend it as something special, perhaps just to be different. I wish I could have liked it, but my imagination does not go that far. <br />
B006LSZECO|2|If you saw the end of the Sopranos you'd get the same feeling reading this book.  Almost like the ending came from that very style.
B006964E8S|5|A great read from beginning to end.
B00C1BU7V8|4|d, day-lewis does it again... an oscar worthy performance by far... history at it's cinamatic best... Sally Field owns Mrs. Lincoln as no other actress before her.... see it, buy it
B004K583KA|5|This is five star, because all of the recordings are nice interpretations, and some are as good as it gets.  I studied with Rilling for 10 seasons at the Oregon Bach Festival, and he was an absolute master of the Bach Cantatas.  Some of these are very early recordings, and he changed considerably in recordings done much later, but they are still serviceable.  For the price, these can't be beat.  They are slightly more romantic than the overly stylistic/authentic recordings of Harnoncourt and Gardiner, but a lot more like we listen in today's performances, if anyone is brave enough to present them. All in all, a best buy.
B00005JLKB|5|\\"Smallville\\" presents us with a teenage Clark Kent. Clark struggles with his superhuman powers while also coping with his undying love for Lana Lang. The problem is, Lana has a boyfriend, Whitney. The romance and the angst between Clark and Lana is so relatable, and the emotions potrayed so outstandingly by the actors. Lex Luthor is a good man. Clark has saved his life, and he is grateful. Lex enjoys his friendship with Clark. But, he also believes that Clark is an enigma. Lex is unbeknownst to the fact that he will eventually become Clark's enemy. Just as Clark's story is the developement of a hero, Lex's is the development of a villain. Lex struggles to not become like his tyrannical father, Lionel Luthor. Lionel is a cruel businessman who holds immense power in Metropolis. <br />The acting, the scripts, and the stories are superb!! Tom Welling portrays a relatble Clark Kent, Kristen Kreuk is excellent as Lana Lang, Michael Rosenbaum plays Lex perfectly, John Glover (who is only a guest star in this season) is filled with deliciously twisted malice as Lionel Luthor, Allison Mac is flawless as quirky journalist Chloe Sullivan, Sam Jones III is great as Clark's friend Pete, and John Schneider and Annete O'Toole are good as Clark's loving parents.<br />The first season presents us with the begining of developement in the characters. It is a superb show, and one of my personal favorites I'd recommend in this season is the episode titled \\"Cool\\", about where Clark and Lana have a \\"non-date\\". CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THIS SEASON IS OUT ON DVD!! :)
B007J4T2G8|4|The book was quite graphic but still an enjoyable read. Fun story, ultimately a fantasy. Interesting that it has been so utterly popular. It must speak to the fact that we are sexual beings at the core.
B006P4FBUE|1|What used to be a decent app was absolutely ruined with the last update. Most features were taken out, and you have to pay real money for any song better than \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\". Uninstalled within 10 minutes. DO NOT PURCHASE. There are better piano apps out there completely free.
B000063DHL|5|Some people don't like this album, but I love it.  The songs are all good and really speak to me while at the same time maintaining the essential metalness. <br /> <br />1. Caught Somewhere In Time- 5/5- cool intro.  One of my favorites.  Really fast, great riffs. <br />2. Wasted Years- 5/5- nice message by Maiden.  Really good song. <br />3. Sea Of Madness- 5/5- heavier, like their older stuff.  The heaviest on the album. <br />4. Heaven Can Wait- 4.5/5- good song, but the chorus is kind of upbeat for the lyrics. <br />5. The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner- 5/5- my favorite song on the album, and one of my favorite songs by Iron Maiden overall. <br />6. Stranger In A Strange Land- 5/5- another of my favorites.  Great synth work and guitar solo. <br />7. Deja Vu- 5/5- ever hear one of those songs that creates the illusion of being longer than it really is?  This is one of those.  Nice. <br />8. Alexander The Great- 5/5- and now it's time for a history lesson by Iron Maiden.  Great musical work and excellent closer. <br /> <br />A strong effort by Iron Maiden, resulting in a great album.  Buy it.
B0092SPYQG|5|I wasn't really a Papa Roach fan.  My wife wanted me to buy this for her.. Its actually really good. Its their best one yet.
1401307787|5|Just beginning to read it but I know it will help me calm down.
B006GECE9Y|1|couldn't ever find it on my kindle and get it to load and run
B000W9DSVW|5|this is such an awesome collection of three BluRay discs that I got on a deal for 14 bucks recently. the movie makes a lot sence when you watch one after another. I rememebre watching the Ocean's Twelve and couldn't remember why Benedict was following all the 11 people, becuase by then I had already forgotten the Eleven movie events (I have a poor movie memory). So, watching one after another made a lot of sence and the watching experience much more fun. Bottom line, amazing collection and worth watching all three moies!
0140177396|4|Not much more can be said about John Steinbeck's novel 'Of Mice and Men',that hasn't already been said.  The book portrays the classic struggle to achieve the American Dream, and while watching 'American Beauty' I found  numerous parallels to 'Of Mice and Men'.  The main characters in both of  these works struggle with the status quo, and end up dying because they are  unable to conform.  'American Beauty', in my opinion, is a modern day  'Of  Mice and Men', showing the confusion and strife of middle class,  white-collar life, instead of the struggle of the lower class, blue collar  life portrayed in Steinbeck's novel.  The industrialization and growth of  the middle class since the baby-boomers of the 50's has brought our country  towards a more suburban life.  However, we constantly thrive to be more  than we actually are, as reflected in American Beauty.  A family tries to  live at a higher than possible standard, and ends up falling apart.  While  Steinbeck's novel reflects the opposite, the underpriveleged class trying  to live at a simple level, both works are the same story, told at different  times and with different circumstances.  The two works present us with a  common theme: the limits of society. As hard as it is to accept, there are  some things which we just cannot achieve.
B00MEQUNIW|5|A great American film, about life and time and family and growing up and growing older.  Plain and simple, but not simple.
014241543X|5|If I Stay is a masterpiece.  The story is beautifully written, just lovely.  I would highly recommend this (and I haven't been a \\"young adult\\" in a long time!)
B008JFUNTG|5|loved it
B002LC8HF0|5|This book is good in detail and I despretly hope that Brandon Sanderson will make another book, maybe with a daughter of one of the important characters fighting the danger of the new world. And have her with her own crew, with each having something to do with Feruchemists or maybe the secret metals. He could also do something with Mare, or maybe Alendi, and his life. It was great and I think the entire series has been beautiful and creative, like creating a need for everything, down to microb!
141971189X|5|kids cant wait for the next one
B00K25GL7Y|5|Absolutely amazing. I played MTG 2015 and really enjoyed that. This is 10 times better.
B00CWY76CC|4|Good game. Challenges were different from other \\"escape\\" games, but not so hard as to be impossible. No need for tips, as long as you search the rooms thoroughly and think critically. Can't wait for more rooms to be added.
B004XUMMFE|5|It's not flawless, but it gets so much right, I don't care!  Like Tim Minear said at the 10th Anniversary Firefly Reunion, the creators were right, they had the right ideas, the right crew, performers, writers, directors, everything, except Fox's executives, who must be thanked for throwing money at what they never understood long enough for Joss Whedon, et al, to get these made, and of course, Serenity, the unprecedented film made after a cancelled and single short-seasoned show.
B00GIXY4M8|5|I thought it was very good as, if not better, than the other X-men movies, which were incorporated nicely into this flick.
B006Y5EDRG|5|Great. Wish it was still in air
B00G32OER4|5|okay
0316098329|2|This book's first chapter was interesting and well-written, but so creepy that I couldn't go on and abandoned it. It should be billed more as a horror story, only for those who like anxiety-provoking and nauseating situations.I had thought that maybe it would switch to the mother's voice later and get better or less creepy, but am glad I quit and read a few reviews instead. I  am trying to understand why it was so popular, but am still mystified.
B00CO7FI4U|5|I enjoy John Rebus. Story is sophisticated, believable, and familiar. I could hardly wait to pick the book up each time I put it down. Also enjoyed so much that I hated to finish it.
B002XLBC0Q|5|If you love vynal, you will definately need to buy a copy of this fantastic release.    The artwork on the cover is as sharp as the original back in 1975 and the FridayMusic labels made similar to the Atlantic release with the green, white and red look great.    The real bonus is the gatefold cover with all the lyrics printed.    There was a very limited pressing of the Nightmare album in France in 1975 with a gatefold (before they reverted to the non gatefold cover) but even if you do have a copy of that hard to find record, you definately need this one in your collection as well.    This is simply another outstanding issue for any Alice Cooper or vynal collector, go and buy one!
0156027321|3|I believe reviews stretching a bit to say that this is some sort of quest for God.  I purchased this book partially based on that hype.  I may not have been so dissapointed if the concept of spirituality had been omitted in reviews and summaries.  Apart from a short stint in the beginning, in which the main character tried to become a member of multiple religions (not for any great reasons), this book has little to do with spirituality, in the usual sense.  <br />This is an adventure story.  Some interesting things are learned about animal behavior.  If the reader does not mind a great deal of brutal gore(sort of an antithesis of spirituality, in my opinion), then it can be very entertaining.<br />I found it a quick, easy, read; and would recommend it to those who enjoy adventures.  I would not recommend it for those on any sort os spiritual quest.
B00BWYX2MG|5|I applied it to my summer gloves and winter gloves and it works great on my GPS and Droid phone.  I don't know about the longevity, but enough remains in the bottle to reapply if necessary.  Great product for motorcyclists!
B00DUGCLY4|4|Saw everyone was playing this game. Decided to try and I'm hooked. It's a very interesting game to play.
B007J4T2G8|5|This wonderful novel was like a Harlequin Romance for the upscale with  a shot of miracle grow. What a fun and entertaining read. I can't wait to read the next two in the series!
B000ZLFALI|3|ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a musical for those who love the Beatles and/or the Vietnam War era anti-war protests. Specifically, it's for those who love the Beatles though.<br /><br />Paying homage to almost all the Beatles' songs of this era, Across The Universe paints a set of narratives across the silver screen against the lyrical backdrops of such greats as `All My Loving', `Let It Be', `Come Together', and `Hey Jude' to name a very few. All of the character names are also either pulled directly from Beatles tunes (Jude, Maxwell, Lucy, Sadie, etc.) or from the times (JoJo as Jimi Hendrix, etc.).<br /><br />Although very cleverly put together as a whole, the first forty minutes of the film are scattered and much of the music forced into the plot in order for it to make sense. The constrained script plugs along, trying to take wing but more often than not, falling back to Earth and trying again.<br /><br />About an hour into the film, however, Across The Universe finds its wings and gets aloft. After Max (Joe Anderson) gets inducted into the military, there's an incredible sequence in which we see a platoon of soldiers carrying the statue of liberty across the jungles of Vietnam. Never have I seen something so contrasting yet beautifully explored with regards to how the U.S. felt as boys were sent to fight in Southeast Asia (`Liberating' the Vietnamese by trampling down their country). The song `I Want You' is interspersed here with the lyrics \\"she's so...heavy!\\" cut from it. Amazingly done.<br /><br />The story is really about love and tolerance during a time of incredible bloodshed and governmental turmoil. Lead actors Jim Sturgess (as Jude) and Evan Rachel Wood (as Lucy) do a fine job of making us care about this conflicted couple and how in love they eventually become thanks to their similarities but also their differences. Jude wants to stay out of the war and focus on his artwork, while Lucy is forced into the Peace Movement when her brother (Max) gets drafted and shipped out. Lucy finds that peace at any cost is too high a price, while Jude's eyes are awakened when he pulls his head out of the proverbial sands.<br /><br />The drug culture is explored in-depth as our would-be lovers trek across the U.S. in a psychedelic bus after drinking some \\"purple punch.\\" The visuals are wild, and the colors even wilder as their \\"experience\\" drops them into the hands of Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard, [[ASIN:B000J4QW8Q My Super Ex-Girlfriend]]) who sings, not surprisingly, `Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.'\\" His blue buddies are indicative of the LSD experience for those who wanted to \\"turn on, tune in, and drop out.\\"<br /><br />The ending is well rendered if a bit predictable. Love cannot be denied amongst these terrible times, so Jude and Lucy must find a way to make theirs work.<br /><br />If it weren't for the terrible beginning, this film would've gotten an easy five star rating. But it faltered so much in those first forty minutes that I'd be lying to myself if I said the middle and end made up for all of it. It didn't. But Across The Universe is still a musical worth watching. Just get past the beginning and you'll be swept up in the nostalgic music and characters.peace at any cost is too high a price, while Jude's eyes are awakened when he pulls his head out of the proverbial sands.    The drug culture is explored in-depth as our would-be lovers trek across the U.S. in a psychedelic bus after drinking some \\"purple punch.\\" The visuals are wild, and the colors even wilder as their \\"experience\\" drops them into the hands of Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard, [[ASIN:B000J4QW8Q My Super Ex-Girlfriend]]) who sings, not surprisingly, `Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.'\\" His blue buddies are indicative of the LSD experience for those who wanted to \\"turn on, tune in, and drop out.\\"    The ending is well rendered if a bit predictable. Love cannot be denied amongst these terrible times, so Jude and Lucy must find a way to make theirs work.     If it weren't for the terrible beginning, this film would've gotten an easy five star rating. But it faltered so much in those first forty minutes that I'd be lying to myself if I said the middle and end made up for all of it. It didn't. But Across The Universe is still a musical worth watching. Just get past the beginning and you'll be swept up in the nostalgic music and characters.

It was a tale which gave life to my belief that even though we may be downtrodden, subjected to others direction in our lives and our lack of it, there is hope.  The movie  does the story justice beyond what most would.  It shows that we can,  someday through hard work and perserverance, become that which we so strive  to be.  Human. It shows, also, that being human is less a matter of what we  look like than how we feel, and who we are. A movie, and short story, that  I would recommend to the youngest and oldest of us all.
B003UAKE9Y|5|This is one of the better animated movies out there, and it has a great lesson in it. I have watched it several times, and each time I see it, it stimulates the imagination. Not for the very young as there are some  scary scenes
B004GHNIRK|5|good book worth second reading.
B00G5G7EXY|5|This is an awesome movie.  My grandchildren love it and we have really enjoyed watching it.  (about 5930 times)  =)
B004TI5N38|3|Good story. Seemed like the author didn't quite seem to see how to provide smooth ending. A good read though.
B004MC8CA2|5|What a valuable resource.  It is GREAT!!!
B00HGJ18C2|5|I Love playing solitary on my kindle!
B004X6PRO6|4|An interesting story that I can't really compare to any book I have read before. It's narration was different, unlike any I have seen before. It seemed happy, sad, cold, and pleasant all at once. It was different... and that's all I can say.
B00846TTDG|5|For what this movie is worth, the acting isn't too bad but it does have good action to it, over all a really good movie.
B00003CX5P|1|Every single image has so much going on in it, because it's... his way of making the best possible movie he can. I don't get how the haters say that this is worse than the original trilogy, can't they see that each scene is like poetry, you know, they rhyme.<br /><br />If people are complaining about some of the later scenes what they don't understand about this CGI Mona Lisa is that it's stylistically designed to be that way, and while we can't change any of that we can diminish the effects, although I think George may have gone too far in a few places.<br /><br />And for all you dumb Jar-Jar Binks Haterz, he's the key to all of this, because he's a funnier character, than Star Wars has ever had.<br /><br />So if you're on the fence onto whether or not you should watch this CGI gold, just know that it'll be great, it's gonna be great, it's gonna be great, it's gonna be great, it's gonna be great.
B000001FFJ|5|In me.  Fantastic that his best album has none of his best songs.  It's an archlike unity.  Doubleplusgood.
B00FEN000S|5|This is a wonderful action movie. Do not go into this movie expecting to take apart the story. Enjoy the action and immerse yourself in the movie.

B00GRPD0J0|1|The app doesn't open at all times. It sends notice that g mail stopped working until you click many times.
B00C7DGRL4|4|Enjoyed this movie.  Different than what I expected, but a lot a action.  It was a little creepy at times.
B004B32532|5|Nice movie by Jodorowsky, loaded with bonuses.<br /><br />The only complain i have to do is about the bluray boxes the american industry always uses, a this cheap one, as it appears to be mabe by paper as the plastic is so soft you can shred with your own hands. I always exchange these boxes for a decent hard ones.
B0097GVJWQ|5|thks is such a great game. I love it. I had a lot of fun playing. cant wait to play the next one.

B008H4LQQS|4|Decent game if you're bored. Nothing that'll hold your attention for weeks to come.
B00DP8XSQ2|1|I deleted it.  It works like a bad modern cartoon for children with the same look. I like seeing what is over my head but this isn't it.
B008LXZFH6|5|Classic Ferrell!  Really funny!  Christina Applegate rocks!
1558908374|4|In 1996, Disney remade the animated classic \\"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\\" into a live-action movie.  The plot was kept very similar to the original, with enough variation from the original to keep the plot fresh.  I found this version to be enjoyable and sufficiently family friendly that I have enjoyed watching it more than once.<br /><br />Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) is a fashion maven who loves fur.  Cruella is also more than a little wacko.  Anita (Joely Richardson) is a mousy designer who designs new fashions for Cruella.  Off in another orbit, Roger (Jeff Daniels) is an unsuccessful geek video game designer.  All is well with the world until Roger and Anita's paths cross, courtesy of Pongo and Perdita, their pet Dalmatians.  One splash in the pond leads to another, and the next thing you know everyone is married.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line we learn that Cruella's latest love is spotted fur, and Cruella has her eye on Dalmatians to provide her with a new fur coat.  Initially Anita and Roger are blissfully unaware of Cruella's new obsession, until Cruella attempts to buy the puppies.  After Anita and Roger refuse, Cruella calls on two bumbling henchmen Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams) to steal the puppies.  Fortunately for all the dogs are smarter than the bad guys and the good guys alike, because they end up needing to save themselves.<br /><br />The beginning of this movie is a bit cumbersome and barely held my interest.  However, once the dogs take center stage the movie picks up and gets quite funny in places.  When the dogs take over in the search for the puppies and then plot the escape of the puppies I got several good laughs and a lot of smiles.  Even better, Cruella De Vil is sufficiently cartoonish that she is unlikely to scare nearly anyone, which is why this movie is rated G.<br /><br />There is always danger in remakes.  However, I think this remake works.  This remake does not replace the original, but is an addition to the original that can stand side-by-side with it.  Each version has its charms, and I will resist the temptation to compare the two very much, instead leaving it to the discerning viewer to determine whether they have a favorite.ion to the original that can stand side-by-side with it.
