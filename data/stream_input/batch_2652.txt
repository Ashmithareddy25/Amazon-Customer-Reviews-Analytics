B005LAIH2C|2.0|\\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" starts off with a fairly clever premise, but it never comes up with anything particularly interesting to do with it. It would appear that, since stuffing their witch captor into her own oven, the precocious youngsters have grown up to be renowned, Medieval bad-asses, hired by a village to investigate the mysterious disappearances of a number of its children.<br /><br />As the title characters, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton do what they can with woefully underwritten roles, but the movie itself quickly degenerates into a succession of redundant action and fight sequences (inexplicably, with modern firepower) that fail to excite either the imagination or the pulse and that ultimately go nowhere.  And the ending feels way too much like the start of a franchise. Well, as they say, forewarned is forearmed.
B000068FXR|5.0|The first of what I consider the strongest five consecutive LPs released by any band. If you can come up with another band's 5 consecutive albums that were consistently strong, more power to ya. I can't. I usually get into trouble after three. Crisis? What Crisis? showcases the melodic sound that would only get more epic in time. Check it out and enjoy a truly unique band with an unmistakable sound that will have you running to get the next CD.<br /><br />Cheers!
B00COMLLX2|3.0|I really like the game. I got the Zen pinball game and I thought that the separate Star Wars and Marvel packs unlocked all the tables for Star Wars and Marvel inside the Zen Pinball HD game. I was wrong. They do not unlock the games in Zen Pinball HD when you purchase both packs separately. When I did open one of the packs only one table was unlocked. And even though I purchased the Star Wars and Marvel pack with one table unlocked in each pack it did not unlock it in the main Zen Pinball HD program. If I knew this I would have made the in app purchases through Zen Pinball HD where ALL the tables are so that I wouldn't have to use three programs to play the same games. Having one program that has all the tables and having two other programs with just the Star Wars and Marvel tables is very confusing especially when you buy both separately and they are not unlocked in the main program with the rest of the tables you purchased.
B000068FY0|5.0|You know how they always ask you things like if you had a record player, cd player mp3 player or whatever with unlimited batteries, what 1 or 2 CDs would you want to have with you? Well, this one would be way up there. This album showcases what Supertramp did best. Melodic, epic prog-pop without the self-indulgence of so many other bands of the time. To be totally honest, I should state that I prefer the Supertramp 'Live in Paris&#34; version of the songs on this album better. I should also confess that if I were stranded on a deserted island with unlimited batteries, Gilligan and I would build a battery-powered coconut raft and sail away to safety.<br /><br />Cheers!
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I love the app!<br /><br />It is amazing! I love how you can choose one of the following covers, page amount! It is so better then all the notebook apps combined!<br /><br />It is so worth 1.99
B000068FXX|5.0|From the first time I heard this album, it worked its charm on me. Epic, melodically perfect pop/rock music with provoking lyrics, and no shortcuts. Every song on this record (I can't seem to use the term CD or whatever) is a work of art, best listened to with your eyes closed and your headphones on. I used to put this album on when one of my daughters was having trouble sleeping. It really is as pretty and inspiring as music gets.<br /><br />Cheers!
B004I744AS|1.0|This app is a ripoff. It did not let me look up the words I wanted to. I suggest that you do not get this app.
B000069HJI|5.0|The last Supertramp album that really deserves the brand, it is also a good indicator of the direction Roger Hodgson wanted his music to head. The songs are melodically pretty, and their is a kind of light bluesy/jazzy aspect to the album. After this, the duo of Hodgson and Davies went their own ways, with what I consider to be an accompanying veering into a pedestrian rock-pop sensibility (Davies), and a rather tiresome ethereal prog pomposity (Hodgson.) I am sure that both men have legions of fans that will disagree with me, but I stand firm in the opinion that after this, the magic that was Supertramp disappeared. Thank God for recordable media so we can revisit that which touiched us so deeply.<br /><br />Cheers!

B0014H32MG|3.0|I always enjoy Stephen King books. The depressing thing is that this type of TV Reality show is becoming more and more likely. In fact they had a couple on for a while &#34;Bounty Hunter&#34; and some &#34;tracking&#34; show.  Kind of creepy.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I binged watched season 1 and 2 and loved them. The girls are all so model-like and even walk like they are on the runway. But the boys are so cute and fun. I love their banter. It gives me an understanding of law practices that I haven't gotten from other shows. Forget any real life exposure, however.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Got to be one of the best games for the kindle. But with out spending a lot of money real money you will never get far in this game.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I held off on watching this movie in theaters because of very mixed review from movie critics, and a 55 average on Metacritic. I finally got a chance to see it on Blu-ray, and man I'm sorry I didn't go see it sooner.<br /><br />This is hands down the best movie I've seen in years. Even at 3 hours running time, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. I can't remember the last time a movie had me fully engrossed on this level. The style of the film, having multiple stories across multiple timelines all tying into one another in various ways, directly and indirectly, is ambitious to say the least. The fact that it succeeds in remaining cohesive and interesting throughout is a feat in and of itself, but it goes one step further by telling stories that would all hold up on their own, with characters you genuinely grow to love.<br /><br />I won't even attempt to give a plot synopsis, as that would take many paragraphs, but suffice it to say that the movie is about life, art, love, and fate, and how each life effects one another. It may sound corny when summed up into those four simple words, but the movie is so genuine in the presentation of it's message that it's hard not to be moved by it. The writers did a fantastic job crafting such a bold story.<br /><br />The actors had quite a challenge making this movie. They all play multiple characters throughout the film, and each character they play is different. Wildly different. Each actor had to portray several characters with different personalities, different accents, different ages, races, and even genders. We often see actors play several characters across several movies, but they remain the same character within each movie. It was really impressive to see the same actor play many roles within the same movie and pull it off.<br /><br />The special effects are top notch, and never look fake or cheesy. One thing I was surprised by was the amount of action in the movie. I didn't expect much action, and although it isn't on the level of a Michael Bay movie, there is certainly more than enough to satisfy fans of previous Wachowski movies like The Matrix. The movie is beautiful, with detailed sets and costumes, lots of CGI enhanced backgrounds, and gorgeous cinematography. Interestingly, because the focus of the movie is on the characters and not on the action, and the action is used sparingly, it brought more weight to the action when it happened. The stakes were higher because characters can and do die throughout the movie, and you're emotionally invested in them.<br /><br />Now, good makeup and special effects do not a good movie make. Fortunately for Cloud Atlas, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is through the deft hands of the directors that everything comes together to make an unforgettable experience.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it now. If you have a Blu-ray player, the stunning visuals demand HD viewing. Don't be dissuaded by the negative, jaded critics. Cloud Atlas is a masterpiece.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I really like this game.  It has several different types of games to play.  I recomend it to anyone who likes to play games.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Definitely takes brain power.  My kids and I loved this app.  I would recommend this game to anyone. Get it.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|my child and I love this movie-especially great on ipod during storms-great distraction from thunder storms since my child hates loud noises
B0030MKGKY|1.0|Pointless movie with over the top escapades that leaps beyond the believable and and lands face first in stupidity.  UXO work, and the Iraq war in general, is a gritty, adrenaline pumping, drama and does not hollywood cliches to make it interesting. This movie is unwatchable.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is a fun game. It plays well on my Fire.. It is like two games in one. Matching and build your aquarium.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I missed portions of season two, and was happy to receive the full second season. This is one of the best dramas on TV at this time, and that it is on HBO is awesome. No commercials, etc. Now I can watch it any time I want to.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is super addictive and entertaining. I definitely have a hard time putting it down. And you cant beat free!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is not to easy, not to hard. I wish it had more levels, but this is a free game, and they do promise more levels soon. Let's hope we don't have to wait too long.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|There are some bugs with the tags but overall it works great. The notebook stacking limits the tree complexity to two branches. Three or four are needed for college level. Topic maps would be a great addition if implemented in an intuitive way (easier said than done).
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is my first Reacher book...vaguely familiar to the Mack Bolan books  I read i high school. Cant wait to read the next one.
B00A11AN6O|3.0|Works with GoodSync very well but it takes a long time to create the folder structure. Amazon UI is seems to be morphing into a social media site. I think they should move toward content management instead.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Three years later and it's still one of the greatest books I've ever read. I've reread it a ton of times and though it isn't challenging to read the plot is perfect.
0307951154|3.0|This is the ninth of the sixteen books that features Harry Hole the emotionally and physically scarred and damaged cop. Self exiled for several years in Hong Kong ( wouldn't north Korea have been a little more original?) he hears and obeys the siren call of his native Norway. This book is discursive and, unlike some of the earlier novels which are crisp and fast paced, the author rambles and is inclined to stray off-piste. I didn't like the rat narrative device at all as I found it detracted from the meat of the story. Read the first rat narrative but skipped the others. Rat emerges from its hole (no pun intended) at intervals tempting me to set a rat trap. The strands of the story zoom off in all directions like a debt ridden person seeking a credit card balance transfer. A firm editorial voice was lacking. That said, I can't wait for the next Jo Nesbo offering and contrary to what readers may think after reading this review, I do enjoy his books.
B003H6KRIE|4.0|My wife is very taken with Damon and the trilogy. I bought this for her but enjoy it as well.
B00821OX98|5.0|Im not really a hard core sci-fy fan, but this series kept me captivated, had a great story line. I recommend you give it a chance you won't be disappointed.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|Works and looks great! It doesn't make the phone bulky (like other cases). I would recommend it to anyone who needs a case.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Witty humor. Real character  disturbing but true reality of WW2. Title of book story, memorably told. One of the best books I read. Interesting vocabulary:)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book is an easy read. I felt conflicting emotions towards the heroin but it's good enough that I feel I must finish the series. I need to know how it ends
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Good number of characters to keep one guessing. I've never watched the \\"Bones\\" television show but I might  do so now.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|starts out slow but gets fun fast. You end up watching the clock, waiting for more coins.  Then you learn to drop coins so all the good stuff gets pushed to the middle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|cool game that will keep you wanting to play more. cant wait for more rooms to be added. soon I hope.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I lost count on how many times I have watch this movie but it is a classic that never gets old!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game.  My children love it.  They are 7*6*and 5..  I am a fan of Myst and Riven so I have a background in this type of format.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I like about 50% of the songs on this album.  I bought it because of &#34;Rumor Has It&#34; and &#34;Rolling In the Deep&#34; but other than a couple more songs, I really don't listen to the whole album.  Just wondered what the &#34;fuss&#34; was about.  She has a lovely voice and her music is crisp but unless you're a big fan, just &#34;download&#34; the two songs you REALLY want to hear.  :(
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Doesn't seem quite as fast paced as the previous too, but does keep you wanting to know what happens next.  Of course a bit of history and other details are thrown in.
B008PUXMP2|5.0|If you are an Amy Winehouse Fan this is a must have.  It has all the songs from her first two albums, Frank and Back to Black!  Also, includes a third album of never before heard recordings from Amy Winehouse.  This July will be the anniversary of her untimely death and I think this is the best way to remember her talent, love for music, and her unique voice as both a writer, singer and musician.  Please get this and you will never regret it!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Awesome app keeps me connected to my timeline and also allows me to update my status easily and faster than before
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I chose this app to get updated weather info at the touch of a button.  My life depends on the weather and I need accurate and reliable info.  Who can give this more than The Weather Channel?  The official channel for Weather.  I would not count on any other!!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is super fun! You really have to spend your upgrade stars wisely! It is especially fun to use heroes to your advantage!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Another Nelson DeMille spectacular story. Great and interesting characters. His books are long, but so well written that you don't want to miss a word. I've loved every one I've read.
B008VBYN80|4.0|It's good and all but...the energy thing is a little cheesy cause I need my money in the game.it's also bad a little bit because to get friends you have to within into gameloft or Facebook to get friends.I don't have a Facebook account or Facebook because I'm. This game is fun other wise. it takes a lot of diamonds though to have lots of fun but anyway it's good
B00632HWOG|5.0|It downloads quickly and it is just as easy to access my email on my tablet as it is on my laptop.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Guys this game is like on and j. It's fun it's rough but it's fun.  No harm meant and no offence in a rapper and ty
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love how quick and easy it is to search for something on google.  I use it all the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I love it I would definitely recommend this game to everyone best game ever I just reached 250,000 awesome a must buy game
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Its facebook I am able to access it like I can on my phone and my laptop.  I now have it on my tablet.
1476727910|5.0|While reading The Humans, I'm sure I'm not the only one who was reminded of the television series 3rd Rock from the Sun, and at one point, of the ST:TNG episode Encounter at Farpoint. There's a bit of The Doctor in our alien protagonist as well. But don't be fooled into thinking this novel is some sort of knock-off: the execution is fabulously unique. Matt Haig takes us on a brilliant and imaginative journey through the human experience, the best and the worst.<br /><br />With short, easy-to-devour chapters bearing titles such as Detached Nouns and Other Early Trials for the Language Learner and The Melancholy Beauty of the Setting Sun, I raced through this book. I could not wait to read more, but I didn't want to miss a thing.<br /><br />And may I just say, I am completely jealous that the Vonnadorians can consume books in capsule form! Seriously?!<br /><br />I can't rave about this book enough. It's thoughtful. Wise. Funny. Tender. Uplifting. Thrilling (there was an awesome unexpected twist!). I was hanging on every word, each moment for its own reason, all the way to the very end. The Humans swept me away; it is by far my new favorite read of 2013.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. I did not receive any other compensation for this review.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|When I first downloaded this app it was great.  But as time went by it wouldn't update my location correctly.  I would take my tablet on trips and when I would get home it would not give me the weather at my house but where I was and I had a hard time resetting it to my current location.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed is another masterpiece by Khaled Hosseini.<br />This is very humane and touching novel.<br />Highly recommended<br />Kudos
B009NY43NY|1.0|I can't even remember when I've been so /incredibly/ disappointed in a book. Or in an author. If, indeed, CH even WROTE this 'novel' (and I use the term loosely).<br /><br />Like all the disappointed reviewers before me, I was totally flabbergasted while I was reading this last book in the SVM series. Continuity meant nothing. Neither did characterization. Neither did established plot lines. And, most certainly, neither did anything so mundane (to CH, obviously) as fan loyalty.<br /><br />I saw that CH has done her fair share of fan-bashing since the negative reviews started pouring in. I, for one, do not believe that she couldn't see this coming. Not just because she blind-sided the Eric fans of the world -- which she certainly did! -- but because she broke that unwritten contract that authors make with their loyal readers. I can't think of another author who would have the narcissistic audacity to treat their readers like CH has, and then come back with insults to THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE HER FAMOUS AND RICH. And then is self-absorbed enough to actually think that, no matter what she does or says, we will all be standing in line to buy/read the coda she's going to foist on the market, later this summer. Not hardly!<br /><br />SPOILERS TO FOLLOW.<br /><br />But enough about that. On to the \\"story\\". Poor Eric. He was totally emasculated, basically passed-over, and comes off as a helpless wimp. Does that even remotely /sound/ like Eric?! He should have known something like this was coming, though -- I mean, look what CH did to Bill in earlier novels. She made sure to kill off any remaining fan loyalty for Bill by consigning him to the role of neighbor rapist. Great move.<br /><br />The whole Sam thing made me uncomfortable. I have guy friends that I love like brothers ... and the idea of jumping into the sack with them makes me feel kinda creepy. That's what the \\"Sam as HEA\\" felt like to me. Creepy. And the sex scene was ... bleh. Slippery seals, with your best friend and boss, whom you love like a brother? Yikes. Gross.<br /><br />Why do that to Claude? I just don't get it. Not to mention that she tossed all the pre-established rules about the Fae out the window. Ridiculous!<br /><br />Even the awesome Pam takes some hits. Other than describing her clothing as \\"suburban chic\\" (but I think sounds more like \\"matronly\\"), Pam is hardly THERE. Well, hell, NONE of the vamps are! I say again -- ridiculous!<br /><br />The whole book feels like a slap in the face. Like CH is pissed off because she lost control over her characters because of True Blood ... why couldn't she realize that there were whole crowds of us who didn't watch the show, who couldn't care less what HBO did with the story, who like to picture characters and scenes in our heads, and thus don't give a rat's patoot WHAT happens on TB?! Why should that matter to her STORY? More of that narcissism, I think. She's gotten too big for her britches, as Sookie would say.<br /><br />Many reviewers have gone over all the inconsistencies in the book, so I won't re-list them here. I'll just agree, whole-heartedly, because I noticed them too. I also noticed the reduction in quality. The sophomoric style. The raggedy progression of events and the plot holes. If this really /was/ written by CH, then she was MAD when she wrote it. Mad enough to slap all her loyal readers in the face, hurriedly tossing off this mess slap-dash, not caring who she hurt. Not even caring that she's hurt her rep among her readers -- because I'm also one who is not going to spend another penny on anything she writes. An author doesn't get to keep doing crap like that to me. I will not be reading anything else by this \\"author\\".<br /><br />Charlaine? This is the dumbest thing you've ever done.friend and boss, whom you love like a brother? Yikes. Gross.<br /><br />Why do that to Claude? I just don't get it.

B004LROUW2|5.0|I wasn't prepared for 1Q84.<br />I would compare it to a great and complex classical music composition. Maybe a Mahler Symphony or a Bach Oratorio.<br />It has a clarity and a tempo that are addictive.<br />There is nothing conventional about this book<br />Mesmerizing will describe it best
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was saddened by the final few chapters, however the novel was brilliant. Suzanne Collins is a very gifted writer.
B00CISAPJS|5.0|A lot of the movies using large amounts of CG result in mediocre acting, ie Oz the Great and Powerful.  These actors pull it off.  Kudos to the director.<br />Good clean fun entertainment.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie is absolutely awesome. We saw it at the show in 3d and decided to buy it as we have a 3d tv. You will love it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Characters very 3  dimensional and grow and change with the seasons.  Costumes and set are realistic and amazing. People who say &#34;I won't like it&#34; - try it and love it!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The movie was really good except it kept stopping at different intervals and was very annoying. Felt if I was paying that kind of money it should play perfect. I watch it on tv. Good series
B005DD7TI0|3.0|The concept was really good but the execution left a few things to be desired ie...there were things that didn't get explained.
B002413TY2|5.0|If you like any of the &#34;Transporter&#34; movies, then you will love this one too! I streamed it, but I'm seriously considering adding all the &#34;Transporter&#34; movies to my DVD collection.

I would keep it too... lol... yes it is that good.<br /><br />Shipping was lightning fast... as expected with amazon prime.<br /><br />Buy it... you won't regret it.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I started to buy just the episodes I really like but will eventually buy all the seasons of this Star Trek ~  I think there is a lot to talk about with someone who also likes Star Trek ~ any of them ~ because of the strong characters and the use of technology ~also I think the premise ~ that they are lost and far away from Star Fleet ~ in the unexplored Delta quadrant is very intriguing ~  The viewers alone or with someone in conversation can add your own theories and there is quite a lot to talk about and share.  Also, the captain is a woman which is important.  I recommend this version of Star Trek.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a fun little brain teaser, only problem is no hint button. So I do see a potential rage quit problem.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great running game,that, combined with the wonderful hilarity of Despicable Me's minions makes for a game for the entire family to enjoy for hours on end. With increasing difficulty challenge yourself, your friends, your family, and yes even THE WORLD!!!!

B003G4W49C|5.0|I picked this up upon my friend recommending it and I do not regret it at all! Once I started reading it, I was totally hooked. Couldn't stop reading until I was done. Very exciting to go on and read the next book of the series.

B008UUPOVM|5.0|We're a family of Hoot Owls. While TMS is a departure for AY from the early OC style, it still has plenty to recommend it. An especial favorite is Dementia, which seems to be Adams comments on his current career trajectory. All in all, an enjoyable album--and we can't wait for the The Midsummer Station Acoustic EP coming out on july 30th!! Wish Amazon could get it up for pre-order already!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Very good book.  Cute story read it in 2 days couldn't put it down I strongly recommend it:) I loved it.

B005529EI2|1.0|Amazon didn't even present to me the option of buying this in 'hd' before I purchased it. The filter results showed 3 Lord of The Rings Extended edition videos, none of which specified SD or 'also available in HD' until I purchased it, and hopped on the ps3 to see that the HD version was a completely different item. You can't even upgrade your SD purchase to HD if you accidentally purchase.<br /><br />What's more, there's NO option to return it or contact support -- even if you've purchased the HD version in addition to your SD copy -- less than 3 minutes apart.<br /><br />Be warned.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is my second read of Zusak's work.  It's even more gripping than the first encounter.  Zusak is the real &#34;word shaker.&#34;  He finds true warmth of human spirit in a most harrowing tale.  It's a love story of immeasurable depth.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game,  but way too short!  Love how it made me think,  but not so hard that I would give up. Add more levels please!
B0091GRI0O|5.0|I have read many translation of the Meditations and this is one of the best. It is more literal and less poetic than others but still highly effective.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great problem solving puzzle, not too hard not too easy. Makes you use your brain. Waiting for more levels! Hurry, please.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I liked this show and I can't understand why they're canceling this show. This was something that made you think and the combination of these actors were dynamic and she was cute and had pretty legs to booth.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It has nice color combination &amp; easy to use tool. Those bigger keys made this app most usable. I liked when I used first time ..
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I think they could've done a lot more. Nice additions to an already great story. It fell short of my expectations and I wasn't expecting much. The end was terrible...
030789701X|4.0|This guide is awesome; not just in detail, but in presentation as well. The hardcover really helps make this tome feel legit. For a world as open ended as Skyrim's, then a guide such as this almost feels required. If you ever get stuck, then pick one of these babies up. You won't be disappointed.
B00772M1F6|5.0|The music JD McPherson puts out is different than most, fun and interesting to listen to.  I would recommend it to anybody who likes rock n roll and rockabilly.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|The contents of this package, while slim, are still awesome enough to keep your friends jealous. Despite the collector's edition dragon egg replica, I enjoy the case itself the most. I just like the material, it feel so authentic. I'm gushing I know, but that's what fans are supposed to do. The first season of 'Game of Thrones' on Blu-ray is beautifully tragic. I mean that in the best of way. if you haven't seen this show, then now is the time. Once this beast is fully awaken, it won't be stopped anytime soon.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I love this movie! Good quality as well! I can't really fill out the rest of this review with anymore useful information.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Just when you thought the show was over and that there was nothing left to love, producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss punch through the atmosphere. Overall I enjoyed Season 1 more, but mainly because of Sean Bean's portrayal of Ned Stark. Season 2 is darker and full of jaw dropping moments. At least one bowl emptying one. This show is amazing and Peter Dinklage is God's new favorite son.
B00322PKBW|5.0|I don't mind the noise of this watch, it's lightweight I actually forgot i was wearing it today.At the end of the day, i just put it in a drawer so i don't hear it at night when i head to bed.<br /><br />Delivery was quick.
074401493X|4.0|The Last of Us is awesome, amazing, and probably a few more cool words that begin with the letter A. It truly is great and this guide helps out those of us who are looking to get the Platinum trophy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There are so many things I could write about this book but the review would be long... really long.<br /><br />It stirred my emotions (all of them, hundreds of them, all at once - it was quite exhausting at times), made me think that, perhaps as a society, we're already standing on the precipice and peering over to see if the fall will kill us or if we'll be lucky enough to land on that outcropping called salvation.<br /><br />As time has passed, so many have written, fictionalized, about the darker side of humanity.<br /><br />As time has passed, so many have read these stories and, perhaps, didn't believe that a such a dark society could be fabricated out of the minds of men...or that our society could ever reach that level of self destruction... perhaps that will be our eventual downfall. That cliff, that precipice, is coming up fast.<br /><br />Hugh Howey has joined the ranks of those wanting to answer the question \\"What if?... How do we survive?... How do we change?... How do we avoid?... How do we fight back?<br /><br />His world is captivating, real, terrifying.<br /><br />His writing is poignant, emotional, thought provoking ... perfect.<br /><br />It had me from page one and didn't let me go until those last words. I sat for a moment, at the end, and thought 'is that it?' ... 'No! that can't be it!' ... *sighs* 'That was it.'<br /><br />I laughed... I cried... It became part of me.<br /><br />Highly recommended...to everyone.<br /><br />Sidenote:<br />I think that there is a double meaning with the title. Wool can be used to clean, purify, erase the dirt and expose what is hidden beneath and yet Wool can be used to hide, deceive as in 'pull the wool over your eyes.' Just sayin'.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This game is great. Each level is short. You can play this without making a long term commitment(all men like that! )  good time killer if needed.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have been looking for the perfect camera bag for what seems like an eternity.  I was at a camera store and found a Canon Backback that was very similar to this one.  I shoot with a Nikon... I didn't bother me that it was branded, as i figured I could always patch up the logo if I cared about branding.  I didn't buy the bag at the store because I looked on Amazon and found the same bag for less money.  When I returned home I looked at the Canon bag and then I saw this bag as a suggestion.  This bag was MUCH less expensive than its Canon counterpart and seemed to have a little more room to grow.  I purchased this bag and I have been so happy.  I am a petit person and sometimes backpacks are made for larger backs, this one fits me perfectly.  The straps and back are well padded.<br /><br />You can put a ton of gear in this bag. I currently have a D90 with a 16-85 lens attached, a speed light, a Lensbaby, a 35mm lens, a 50mm lens, a 70-300mm lens, and a 60mm macro lens.  I'm sure If I reconfigured the interior I could find a way to put more gear in the main compartment.<br /><br />There is a pocket on one side for easy access to whatever readily accessible thing you might need. The main interior has two zippered pockets to store extra batteries, SD Cards or whatever else you can think of.  The secondary section is roomy.  I usually store my keys and cellphone in it as well as my iPad.  The very front zipped pocket is also very handy for holding business cards or other small items.<br /><br />The straps are easily adjusted, which I like. There is also a way to carry a tripod on one side of the bag.  I do not use it for that, instead I use the loops to hold my Lensbaby bag of optics.  It is a great bag.  I wasn't all that fond of the &#34;Amazon&#34; labeled zipper pulls, but that is not a reason to not buy this bag.  So far it feels very sturdy and it is much easier for me to carry than a traditional camera bag (of which I have four) since it is a backpack it allows even weight distribution so my back doesn't hurt from carrying heavy equipment on my shoulder.  I highly recommend this bag.<br /><br />Update:<br />It is 2017 and I am still using this bag! I have this bag and take it everywhere. I've upgraded my camera and my lenses, but not this bag. The stitching is still holding strong and it still protects all my gear. It really is a great bag.ack doesn't hurt from carrying heavy equipment on my shoulder.  I highly recommend this bag.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|I had seen this movie before having ordered this edition and simply wanted a hard copy for myself. The package arrived right on time and the quality of the item was astounding. Not only is the extra material a must see for any weightlifting enthusiast, the physical quality of the item is just unbeatable. I would highly recommend this item.
B004TI5N38|3.0|First, let me tip my hat to any author who can produce a work that others will read, and I did read this book all the way to the end.  Second and like many others, I felt that David Baldacci's John Puller was just a little too reminiscent of Lee Child's Jack Reacher.  Having read all of Jack Reacher's published adventures, I was hungry for more and felt somewhat satisfied reading about John Puller.<br /><br />Similarities aside, I was a little put off by Puller's seeming mastery of things seen and unseen.  Near the end of the book, he goes for a run and, without ruining the ending, the events that unfolded seemed a little contrived.  I was also a little suspect about Puller's feeling the military is the end-all-be-all of precision and order.  Having served for more than 20 plus years and counting in the military, I am proud of the accomplishments of my fellow service members and the mission that we serve.  This written, no one service is infallible, yet the author has created a character that appears to have drunk the kool-aid and, given his described size and weight, gone back for seconds, thirds and fourths.<br /><br />Long and short, I liked the author's attention to detail and ability to tell a story.  I think that David Baldacci, who is a very good and commercially-viable writer, decided to appeal to the &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; reader base by creating the &#34;John Puller&#34; character.  As the saying goes, &#34;Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.&#34;
0345803485|5.0|My only problem with the book is that when I ordered it, thru no ones fault but my own, I ordered paperback. I was disappointed when I opened the box to find paperback. But, as I stated, my own fault for not paying attention to the fact that it was paperback and I prefer hardback. I will not return it, as it's my fault, but would advise everyone to pay attention when ordering.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|Great Music. Great voice. New sound. Love the Cd Cover. Rod Stewart only gets better with age. Would recommend it.

B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have this on my iphone and was excited to now have it on my kindle fire.  I don't mind if some things aren't on the kindle version.  The best golf solitaire Ive played in a long time
0553801473|5.0|Definitely worth reading. And if you haven't started reading this series, you are missing out. A Dance with Dragons was thrilling and entertaining the ENTIRE time. Didn't seem like there was a single slow moment in this wonderful book. Buy it! Read it!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|It was a great book with sadness and mystery and happiness  and over all a wonderful book I recommend this  book to lots of  young people.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|I wish I have followed all the negative reviewers suggestions and not wasted my time watching this movie. If not for the performance of ELizabeth Banks, there would be NOTHING memorable about this movie.  Her acting ability is the ONLY redeeming thing about the flick.  Seriously-Don't waste your time, especially if you are a minority, as it seems the only people worthy of featuring in key roles are white people and Latinos who look white, who went to Africa to adopt a black baby.  Could it get any more cheesy than that? Sure Chris Rock played a bit part with bumbling group of fathers and what did they give him-a token part and an overweight wife. WHAT!  You have one of the funniest comedians in the world  in your movie and the best you can do with him is make him a side circus performer.  He couldn't get real part and an in shape wife like the rest of the crew?  The producers of this movie had a great opportunity to really make something memorable, but they packed it with too many boring couples in a a pathetic attempt to cover every conceivable problem from trying to conceive to carrying, to delivery.  If I could have given it a ZERO I would have.I give it two thumbs down and a WHAT THE WHAT!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My son a showed this  game to me an  I couldn't put it down. Very addictive and challenging. Couldn't quit thinking about it.
0307950654|1.0|Death Comes to Pemberley was my first book by P.D. James. I am a fan of both Jane Austen's work as well as mystery novels such as those by Agatha Christie. This book spends almost 40 pages rehashing what happen in Pride and Prejudice while giving a little bit of background to the characters' situation at the moment of the novel. After this it is all downhill and it becomes boring. Starting with the murder victim which is a character nobody cares about, so it follows that even speculating who would have motives to kill him is practically impossible because a) we know (or care) next to nothing about the victim b) we know little about why anyone in the novel would care to kill him c) or we just must accept the easy guess at the murdered is what is being presented. All boring choices. The author practically telegraphs the (also very boring) solution in the beginning of the novel, yet I refused to believe these characters would have some weight in the solution to the murder because I thought it would me more interesting to have the murdered be one of the characters we all know from Austen's previous work. Again I was bored with the solution, and it is perhaps my own fault for expecting an Agatha Christie sort of mystery.  To me it doesn't have the fluff I expect from Austen spin off, or the craft I would expect from an interesting mystery.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Every song was awsume.Love Stevies voice,always have.This cd really takes me back.I recamend this sond to long time fans of Stevie Nicks And I think its a great cd for new fans.Enjoy!.
B00CFQMVLS|3.0|Hard to believe as most of this series is but still enjoyable to watch. Good action and car chase with plenty of JMac humorous comments.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My daughter was very happy and excited with this complete collection of the Harry Potter films and it wasn't expensive at all.
B009MYAQOA|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this historical fiction story.  I was heading to Chicago and decided that I should get some history of Frank Lloyd Wright's life before visiting where he began his career in Oak Park, Illinois.  Having the deluxe reading group edition helped me with even more background information into the particular buildings, happenings, and features of the time.  Very readable!
030758836X|5.0|A title with many meanings. This book had me going until the moment when everything changed and my mind was blown. I must have said, &#34;NO WAY!! It can't be&#34; out loud several times. Definitely had a nice twist. If you like the suspense thriller with a little bit of romance, you have to read this. Can't wait for the movie.
0345529057|5.0|I haven't read a book since high school but this series is absolutely amazing. I can't stop reading them!! Buy them!!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I picked this up because of the novelty of a fantasy set in Phoenix, AZ. I was not disappointed. I laughed out loud in places--the narrative is full of clever zingers--and it was refreshing to read about gods other than Greek or Norse. Not to mention the fun of witches and the Druid, himself. Highly recommended for people looking for their next Dresden fix.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it. cant wait for updates. please hurry and update so I can play more. I love this game alot
B00BW0QC8G|4.0|I've been relying on the [[ASIN:B0024IGH3A Belkin Core Laptop Backpack]] for 3 years now for commuting and traveling. The Belkin Core is a minimalist, no-frills affair. By contrast, the Case Logic BEBP has twice the pockets, twice the capacity, and twice the heft. Although it comes with a tag proclaiming \\"Light Weight,\\" everything about it feels beefy to me. Even the zippers are heavier (and, as a result, louder). Comparing it to the Belkin Core is like comparing the MacBook Pro to the MacBook Air. It's different because it's tailored to different needs.<br /><br />If you need to carry around, say, a bottle of water and a pair of circumaural headphones in addition to your laptop, the Case Logic BEBP is a great choice. If you just want to sling your laptop and a pair of sunglasses on your back, go for the Belkin Core.
B009G41CG2|1.0|It is not easy to do anything. I was never able to win any of the games I played and was unable to backup and retry. I would not recommend this game at all.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved the series so much!  A happy ending, but a sad one too.<br />Definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys action, heartbreak, and real consequences in a story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's fun and stuff so yeah I guess you should get it but I'm watching Hannah Montana so I should get back to that
B008JFUPK8|2.0|I am a huge Superman fan but I feel that the Superman depicted in this film did not have as strong of a moral character as other Supermans since the 1940s. To me, Superman should be a beacon of light in the darkness, not a source of destruction. I want a Superman that stands for truth, justice, and the American way-a Superman for my children to look up to as a source of good.<br /><br />In additiont, the story was extremely full of holes. Lois Lane not only has the amazing ability to track Superman down quickly in a huge city reduced to rubble, but she also must have picked up on some of his amazing speed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a very interesting look into a family completely turned upside down by tragic events in the story.  A dad's struggle to defend his son when the real question was, &#34;How well did he know Jacob?&#34;.  A surprise ending keeps the reader guessing until the end when all is revealed.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Excellent writing. I cannot wait for the second half!!  I hope that will not be too long of a wait !
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great story, amazing acting, graphics are flawless. Original. A unique story of hope and triumph. Valuable lessons even for a kid.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I cannot wait to read the book because the movie was pretty amazing. Don't see why people are saying it is another twilight when it isn't. Saw Twilight first, liked it and then read the books which did not disappoint so I am more than sure the book will have me glued. I love how Stephenie Meyer gets so much criticism but she keeps making hit after hit.  You can't deny that the woman has talent and knows how to keep readers wanting more from her.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I put this series on my to-do list when I first watched GoT season 1 on HBO. This series is absolutely phenomenal, and I can't wait to finish this book so I can pick up #4. Highly recommended!
B0026QC0TA|5.0|This was a great movie to watch with a good plot. It had not just 1 or 2, but a few famous stars which was a pleasant surprise. Danny DeVito is funny as always.
B00004CZAS|1.0|My wife was really looking forward to this DVD, which was her favorite film, however she was devastated, because the DVD was inoperable on our DVD player as well as others. My plan is to never order from this source again!
B000O5B4C4|1.0|I don't tell you about the movie because the video didn't have any sound or talking in it the sound track wasn't there. The previews had sound but the movie did not.
B003UYUP58|5.0|I am a molecular biologist and work for a biotech company actively developing drugs for cancer. This book inspired me while also grounding me in the reality that a universal cure for cancer or treatment type will probably never be found in my lifetime. What inspired me about the biography of cancer were the stories of the afflicted, researchers, advocates, epidemiologists and doctors that persevered and continue to fight the incredibly, complex and malicious disease that affects nearly everyone directly or indirectly. Like Jon Krakauer, Siddartha is effortlessly eloquent and the extent of his research is impeccable.

034580404X|5.0|If you are an individual who is intolerant of alternate lifestyles, I encourage you to pass this book by. If you are a reader who loves a good story and doesn't mind exploring something new, this set will keep you up all night reading when you just can't put the book down!
B005JABU82|5.0|first, got the item 2 work days earlier then expected, was rather surprised and very impressed. had a great time putting it together, it combines both the series i really enjoy and my love and assembling/putting together kits and/or models. it is a little back heavy so poses without a stand are a little limited but still well worth it. 5/5 stars, will certainly buy from this seller again.
159463176X|4.0|As expected, Khaled Hosseini captures you quickly into a great story.  Happiness and sorrow fill your heart as the story unfolds.
B003ES61EE|4.0|The product is works as advertised and it seems to have a durable built and materials.<br />One small comment, the non-brushy end is smaller than it seems on the image.
B0091QS88K|5.0|I have submitted many positive reviews on the Dr Panda apps. This restaurant app is no exception. It is a wonderful interactive app for kids to practice their \\"cheffing\\" skills. They can prepare a meal for a customer and get applause when it's done. My 3 and 4 year old daughters love the Dr Panda restaurant app. There is a full version of this app that you can pay for (which I have on my Kindle). But this free app is still quite fun.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Many of the games are fixed to lose no matter what.<br />That part of it doesn't seem fair.<br />It would be good to just get shuffled cards.

032147404X|1.0|I picked up this book because of the reviews. After reading a small section, I put the book down. Picked it up a year later, I quickly remembered what a shining A he is.<br />I want my money back you narcissistic Prk.

B008EKOIN8|5.0|For anyone interested in how food and the availability of nutrition has shaped human societies this is a must-read.  Pollan has done a great deal of research and condences it down to an enjoyable read sprinkeled with his own adventures in cooking.  This book contains valuable discussion of how industrialized food production has changed the way we eat.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great way to waste time.  Spent a morning off with coffee and my tablet happy as a clam.  Make more!
B008OOYALE|2.0|Addictive game but it quits working occasionally and traps you in whatever screen you are in.  It became annoying to have to uninstall all of the time.
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|The violence in the movie Django is very graphic, including torture, and a little too much for me.  I stopped watching during the castration scene.  Yikes!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a good first game of a good game series. In fact I give it a ten out of ten. I also can not wait to play the sequel to this game or the games that came after the second game. I also recommend it to any gamer even those who are not interested in match 3 type games.
1451695195|3.0|I believe in the author's sincerity. He's also very intelligent and a good writer. And I think he's genuinely trying to offer people something that he thinks will help them feel more hope and consolation in their lives. The problem is in the title (which is admittedly probably the publisher's decision, not the writer's) and with the lack of detail given to support the author's conclusion that his heavenly experience occurred while his brain function would not have physically allowed for such an experience. There is NO \\"proof\\" of heaven in this book, but there is some anecdotal evidence that is perhaps worthy of a little more credibility due to the writer's neurological expertise. The trouble is that he relegates his discussion of the alternative explanations to a tiny little appendix that barely scratches their surface. And he leaves out what is perhaps the most important and valid alternative explanation: The possibility that his experiences occurred while emerging from his coma rather than while in the midst of the depths of it. For a person with a scientific mind who wants to see strong reasoning, this little appendix is not only insufficient but very disappointing. Now, it may not have been the intention of his book to get into too much detail about that. His goal may be more to tell his story as he experienced it and let the reader decide. But if so, then there's no reason for such a bold title, and those of us who have a healthy dose of reasonable skepticism will just have to keep waiting for more to emerge from this author (die-hard materialist skeptics will never be convinced of course, but that's another matter).

1455527475|5.0|The book describes the author's 12-year career with Goldman Sachs, covering his rise from low-level to mid-level employee. I enjoyed the quality of the writing: it is direct and brutally honest.<br /><br />The author claims that there was a marked degradation in GS company 'culture' over his tenure. He claims that in the good old days, salespeople were evaluated both on production and the extent to which the employee embodied traditional company values. Nowadays, salespeople are evaluated only on production. True or false? The author fails to produce objectively-verifiable evidence to support his claim. The skeptics among us may be tempted to claim that GS has always been about unbridled greed - any changes the author noticed during his tenure were due to the 2008 financial crisis exposing what was always already there.<br /><br />It's possible that the author's horror at what he considers the predatory practices of GS salespeople should be directed instead at commission-based sales in general. Salary-based salespeople are generally in the game for the long haul, while it's tempting for commission-based salespeople to sell crap to their clients, collect their fat commissions, and then bail out just before the company exhausts its customer goodwill and collapses (or receives a gov't bailout if it is too-big-to-fail).
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really enjoyed the game. It was a challenge but not too difficult for a beginner like me.  I look forward to what's next.
B00CNKPZYG|5.0|This book is so special because there are so many surprise inserts, the art work is fantastic and the pop ups blow your mind.  You don't have to be a Harry Potter fan to appreciate/enjoy this book, infact you may become a convert. I got this for my 6 year old grandson who is a consumate Harry Potter fan. I actually didn't want to give this book up as I am so impressed with it.  I'm going to order another copy just to keep as a collector's edition.<br />Besides the magnificent pop ups on each page, each page has a extra envelope in the corner or a smaller surprise pop up to open . My favorite is the coiled snake with it's scary open mouth and the other is the owl in it's cage. The first page has a big  purple envelope to open and there are 3 mini posters enclosed. Each page is an adventure. How something this intricate can be massed produced is beyond me. Children of all ages including myself will treasure this book and go back to it over and over again. Worth twice the price it's selling for. Don't hesitate to purchase this wonderous and most special pop up.
B006PTZNSY|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of Nicki but there were a few good songs on the CD.<br />Her previous CD was better, in my opinion but this one I would not suggest unless your a huge Nicki fan.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Saw these guys on PBS - really like their music.  This a good representative CD of their music and very enjoyable.
0596805888|5.0|Lots of recipes in this book I still want to make. The ones I have made have been great. I love the information it provides and found myself picking it up to read at different times throughout the day.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is funny and surprisingly touchy. I can't imagine most people not enjoying it. And the minions ... too cute!
B004W25KKW|4.0|I read this book in a couple of days. It tells an interesting story about something that would sound boring to many people. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Enjoy this game as a card game and I think once I have gotten on to it as a single user on my Kindle I should like it.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|I can see why my British friends love this book. It is witty, sarcastic and caustic, a bit much for my American taste, but it is the dry humor I recall from my year in London.  I have a hard time staying with it after the first few chapters. Still it makes some funny and true observations about growing up female.  Plus the author writes about her experience of growing up in a small British town, admittedly an experience different from my own, so maybe some things got lost in cultural translation.  If you are more sentimental than edgy, it may not be for you.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|Put on for my 6 yr old granddaughter. She says she really likes it. It's easy to play and fun
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the chemistry between Gideon and Eva. They have all these obstacles to overcome from past mistakes. The way they need each other, the strength  they draw from each other is inspiring. And there is a little mystery and intrigue mixed in the story. I can't wait to see how things finally unfold!
B00005N6KG|3.0|I wear these headphones eight hours a day at work. They are very comfortable, however they don't last long. Now that the price has risen significantly, I certainly won,t be buying these again. Instead I bought Jabari's revo headphones which are very comfortable and meant to last.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like the game a lot but since the last update I have problems.  How do you obtain vaccine and roots to cure sick animals?  They are not available in the infirmary and I cannot find them anywhere else.  Please advise. -
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good game ,but needs more levels than just10. Easier to see on my kindle fire. Bring on more levels I'm ready.
1591840562|5.0|Its a must read, also a text book in many entrepreneur classes. Definitely interesting .Guy Kawasaki is a great mentor!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Doesn't run properly, on first attempt, didn't get past splash screen and it force closed.  Tried again, got to the elevator screen but once again force closed.  Droid Bionic, Jelly Bean.
1591845831|5.0|I like Guy Kawasaki's book they are very good read humorous and a very good take on entrepreneurship.Love this book!!
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I decided to give this album a go on Youtube and thankfully did so before taking the leap and actually dropping money for this pile of dung.<br /><br />While I find solace in the fact there are plenty self-aware people who have rightfully given this a 1  - star rating, I find it even more disturbing that there are more 5 star ratings to counter balance. We as consumers and the listeners of music cannot support such crap and grant a stamp of approval on such  questionable avenues of musical expression. I am no fan of Kanyee, but am a fan of some of Kanye's music(earlier recordings in particular) and his potential as an artist in comparison to the rest of the participants in-line with the  so called 'mainstream'. With that being said, I honestly don't even know what this is with the only explanation would be  it coincides with his ever darkening personality laced with negativity and misconstrued self glorification and collision with certain aspects of that fame life. Basically he's fallen off and lost his edge by trying to be edgy.<br /><br />I hate to say it but the majority of people who give this such a high star rating are the kind of  individuals who try far too hard and seek out to be  different and original, in which isn reality are anything but as it doesn't come from a place of originality. If you actually played this crap to someone as an unknown artist they would more than likely adopt a similar view.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|absolutely love it.  lose track of time when playing.  needless to say play it for hours on end. will play it again and again.
0143119680|3.0|If your looking for more books about vampires and their \\"forbidden\\" relationships with humans (or in this case witches) you have come to the right place. With striking similarities to Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series, Harkness attempts to create her own world of magic, inter-species war, and a love story which boarders on the clinically obsessive.<br /><br />  Although this story had great promise at the beginning it fell flat about half-way through. Diana and Matthew become so \\"in-love\\" with one another that most of the plot is captured between their constant make-out sessions. Side characters become less fleshed out and more two dimensional as they become consistently preoccupied with Diana's eating and sleeping habits.<br /><br />  In the final chapters (which seem to drag on a bit) you learn that anything and everything special that could happen to an individual has happened to Diana, and in many ways the whole world seems to have been created to evolve around her (and as a by-product, Matthew). At this point, although I was determined to finish the book, my willingness to suspend belief and entertain the author's ideas was at an end.<br /><br />  The one thing I will say is that, in the last chapter, Harkness leaves the readers on a significant cliff-hanger pushing even the most skeptical to consider buying the second book... if nothing else to see how it ends.<br />In the end I give it three stars because, although I was able to finish it, I would hesitate to suggest it to others.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|I enjoyed this book, and am not into fashion like this chic.  I admit the character was very shallow.  I honestly think people are really this way, and this was a look into their heads.<br />By the end of the book I enjoyed the character much more and some of the instances that happened we made me feel sorry for her.<br />Overall, it was an entertaining read, good for a a few days at the beach or something to take your mind off something more serious.  This requires little to no in-depth thought.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Great cast recording, very enjoyable and vivacious. It is understandable why it won Best Musical at the Tony awards, along with Best Original Musical Score (Cyndi Lauper).  Always enjoyed Ms. Lauper's work as an artist and her growth though the years. This recording proves she is still going strong. The Kinky Boots CD is a great  addition to add to your theater collection, weather you've already seen the show or not!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good u take care of your own horse like grooming it feeding it picking up poop and change the stables.
B000026FJ6|3.0|I love this album, so much! I was so excited to receive it only to be crushed by the fact that I couldn't play it! It would not play at all in my primary computer, and played with errors in my studio computer. I remitted the disc back to Amazon and requested a replacement. I encountered the same problem. I am unable to enjoy this album. I keep the disc, but I had to download the tracks from alternate sources to enjoy them. I am sorely disappointed by the Active Audio component of this disc which seems to render it unplayable in computer CD drives, which are the only form of CD player I own. If you intend to play this disc on your computer, I suggest not purchasing it. Instead purchase the album as a download only.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a great mind game.  Very addictive game!  I am having a hard time putting it down!  I wish it would generate your energy level quicker.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|my children and I have enjoyed playing this together! We would recommend this game! The puzzles get harder as you go along!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers.everyone in my family has it and love it.And I also love how how we go all around the world Miami and Paris.just amazing.
B004GYY714|4.0|Great for listening to radio stations whilst away from home. Couldn't get my local radio station though, but plenty of others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never EVER read a book so fast in my life, this book Is definitely a page turner. I read for hours upon hours just wanting to know what happens next! It has the perfect combination of romance and thriller, I've already recommended this book to everyone I know. It's amazing! Now onto losing hope (:
B007WPM7SO|5.0|We wish it was a longer series. We really enjoyed it. I am becoming a true of of Eddie Redmayne!
B008I43DYU|5.0|It is easy to use and the numbers and characters are big enough to use it without wearing my glasses.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I put off reading and even seeing this series for years, but gave in and finally read them on my Kindle.  The last book was great, so decided to watch the DVDs, Part 1 and Part 2.  Loved them!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I am trying to become more interested in taking photos since my friends are always asking for them. I do have a hard time using this app. Since I can't see what I'm taking a photo of.....why is the lens in the front.....
B007REV4T8|5.0|Saw this in the theater, and it was great, so had to get the DVD to watch it agai.  Kind of makes Bond more personable since it provides a bit of background on his childhood.  I didn't like the song \\"SKYFALL\\" when I first heard it on the radio, but after watching the movie, I can see the connection and it was a great theme song for this movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Most self-published books are weak, at best. This one isn't. Try it, you'll like it. Now I'm off to get some more.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great story in the continuing saga of Spock and Kirk.  Story was good too, but I felt a bit sorry for the villian - after all, he didn't ask to be created to be the way he was, and he was only trying to save his \\"family\\".  But evil is evil and he had to be defeated, although he really Wasn't...spoiler...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app, let's you know how much charge you have left an how much time for the different applications you have.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome but gems are a bit hard to get so fun though so very very fun tat it
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Slow, Boring couldn't finish it.  Seemed like a documentary which would have been fine but drug on and on, no likeable characters.  I would bots no.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved the game just wish there were more levels.  The instruction on how to play need to be a little clear.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this it is so fun play it a lot can't wait for more levels my kids love it so much
0743277708|5.0|I've heard of this book since I was a kid, but always passed it by as a kid's bunny book.  Now in my mid 30's I've finally gotten around to getting a copy to read.  I just finished and I write with the tears still drying on my cheeks.<br /><br />I am basking in the glow of completing my first read through, and partly sad that I will never be able to read it again not knowing what happens.<br /><br />This book is 30 years old, yet it is already known as a classic, is compared with The Odyssey, and found on nearly every top 100 books of all time.<br /><br />It is deserving of every praise piled upon it.<br /><br />It is a \\"Must Read.\\"
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|Its a really fun game but has one catch B-) it crashes alot during game play. I will just get on a game then it either says  lost connection or ur acount has been selected on another device. The creaters need to fix that one problem other wise its a great game.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|The pack is very good overall. The only thing I had against it was the non-removable straps. Oh, never give five stars, that means there is no room for improvment
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I was caught up in this story right away. I loved the cultural differences which were apparent from the very beginning. I highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in India and the culture there.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|This book traces another epoch in our lives through the lives of families that we can relate to. We have been seduced by so many political parties and religions with their many cruel and selfish leaders over the years. Wars have been fought and millions have died or been mutilated in their names. And today we stand no closer to finding peace as it illudes us despite so much suffering. At the end, it is only the bonds between families and friends that give us joy and hope into the future.<br />Ken Follet takes us through these journeys with so much sensitivity.<br /><br />John
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Loved movie and story. Would purchase or view this again.  Good buy! This is a must see film. Loved actors.
1878424319|5.0|Easy to understand the author's point of view yet these simple guidelines are not that easy to incorporate into everyday life.  Although it will take a conscience effort to use these Four Agreements, I am certain there impact will be life changing.
B0073TBYTC|5.0|My book came within a couple weeks of my purchase, maybe not even. It was a great book and was in good condition.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Wonderful characters, suspenseful plot and sweet love story.  The ending left me wanting more.  Hopefully the author writes faster then Martin.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|A friend lent me his copy, and as a die hard Beatles fan I was very hesitant to watch someone other then the Fab 4 sing their songs.  WOW.  Those kids are amazing and the choice of songs tied to the story is so well done.  I liked it so much obviously I bought it.
0307887960|5.0|We loved the successful results.My son has maintained his12kilo loss and is as thin as a stick however after 3 months of doing without I had a chocolate and cookie binge for a few days. Then lost the surplus ,but once again its the carbs that I am craving.this week probably because it is winter in my part of the world right now.
B000EQHHJW|5.0|This opera met all our expectations. It had wonderful sound quality and the music was performed excellently.  My husband loves opera and he viewed this on the computer and raved about it over and over again.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Really fun game, just need more levels...rated 3 but would give 5 if there was more than 10 rooms. I'm hooked and I want more lol
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game,  challenging but not so that you cannot advance,  can't wait until new floors are added!  Great job!- Adults -Difficultly level for ages 13 and up
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Hours of fun. Really makes you think,love games like that. Hopefully there will be tons of updates. Love the hero's.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I had purchased this for my son as a gift.  My family watched it together, and we enjoyed it very much.  It was beautifully done!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|My son was semi interested, after a while he had lost interest. My older son was the same, said was predictable.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|you sitting on the edge of your seat. The suspense is always fantastic. Mr Hall is a great actor. Wondering what he will be doing<br />when the Dexter series is done.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|It's a lot like all those other bubble games for except if you want to use the extra help it will give you 1 free chance & you have to pay for the rest. Don't give up, just get better at it.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|First off, Soderbergh needs to quit being the cinematographer on all his films.  He doesn't do a great job at it.  Many unintentional blurry scenes.  However, a great thriller.  Not the twists I expected.  All the actors did a great job!!!
B00797MB0O|5.0|This is not a story with a happy ending.  It is not here to make you laugh or say \\"aww\\".  This is a rough watch about believable people.  I loved it.  If you're willing to feel uncomfortable to experience a different story this might be for you.<br /><br />The performances by Charlize and Patton are amazing.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This movie was really boring.  I fell asleep in the theater watching this.  It was a complete waste of a date night and paying a babysitter.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|With all the movies available to rent, this is one of the few I truly enjoy to watch over again.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|This movie was terrible.  The only star it gets is for Hawke's good performance.  This movie has been done so many times and there was nothing new about this film.  It was not good at all.
B004INHTK4|5.0|Loved the book! Perfect storyline, loved the originality!! Best book I've read in a long time! I also enjoyed the writing style.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I purchased Nemo's app for use on my Kindle Fire.  I figured I would play it... and then teach my two grandchildren to play. We enjoy playing other apps together.  I'm very comfortable around computers and apps, so maybe it's just me, but I cannot figure out how to play this game. Is there a Nemo's Reef for Dummies out there?  If so, I'd be glad to increase the stars in my rating.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Would have given it five star rating if it didn't lock up at times. Still it is an enjoyable card game and I recommend it.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|I would like to see a rating between &#34;I like it&#34; and &#34;I love it&#34;. That is where I am with this show.  I takes some patience to get the whole picture -at least the first episode.  Once you get your bearing the show is quite good.  The imagination that went into this show is amazing.  Pens that are transducer, responders-whatever that means and other works of imaginative genius keeps this show appealing.  You never know what work of imagination you will see next.  If you don't care for imaginative shows this would not appeal to you.  I personally this it is a real hoot.<br /><br />urknight68
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game since I love horses this teaches me a little bit more stuff to know about horses
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|I gave this show four stars because it is a well rounded show.  It has adventure, crime, sensual appeal and the story lines have, thus far, been excellent.  The teams work as teams should but , at times , there is friction.  As far as I am concerned that makes the show honest.  Where there is more than one person in any given area for any length of time there will be friction.  The stories have a cohesiveness yet have a certain autonomy.  It is a program I can watch knowing I will enjoy it.<br /><br />urknight68
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Could not put it down. I got briefly excited when she mentioned the Planned Parenthood in Rogers Park that I go to. And I got weird looks on the L for laughing out loud. Thanks, Tina.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|This show is fun to watch.  It comes with a surprise package in every episode.  It is short on edification but long on fascination.  Men and Women who are really monsters, a telephone booth that is a time machine.  The writers keep you guessing and in retrospect keep you laughing.  The people/monsters are like nothing I have never seen.  Not scary not really funny but hilarious that they would use these figments of imagination that are so ridiculous.  Watch it because it is always good for a laugh.<br /><br />urknight68
B004XZR63M|5.0|I wanted everyone I know to read this book.  It is very inspiring and insightful.  I didn't particularly like the &#34;Republican/Tea party&#34; type views, but it was good that this book pulled and applauded life lessons from both sides.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I started reading the trilogy through a friend who lent me the 1st book , I had read the reviews and I wasnt sure about it, the opinions were so divided! Either you hated or loved it, no in between. So I finished the 1st one, and I liked it quite a bit despite the fact that Anastasias vocabulary is a bit annoying (but true, my baby sisters all talk like that!) and the whole thing is pretty unrealistic, not the sex, though its pretty exagerated, but the whole young rich guy with helicopter that buys you stuff and turns you into cinderella! So once you get past all that, the book is fun, entertaining and hard to put down, do not expect it to be enlightening, life altering or anything like that, its NOT, but its a lot of FUN!!!!!<br />So I recommend it! The love story is sweet and intense and all the characters stay true to themselves... Its a good read!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's The Weather Channel app, so what can I say. It's a great tool to use when you're wanting to know what the weather is like. Just like the internet version, you can check the day's weather, hourly weather, 5-day or 10-day weather, etc. It's a cool tool to keep handy.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Book 3 is pretty much the same as the previous 2, they still have too much sex, and too much money, and everything is still intense, I dont want to say too much because I dont want to spoil it for anyone, but the story takes some twists and turns and you get to know the characters a lil more, specially because our naughty author gifts us with a lil bonus at the end that gives us a lil more insight into Christian Grey.<br />It is a good ending to a cool, fun, endearing, sexy trilogy!<br /><br />Two thumbs up!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I was waiting for something that would do magic the gathering and this is way above my exspectations. i havent played the full version but im buying it as soon as i can.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very realistic and fun game. I admit some of the upgrade prices are steep but it isn't unattainable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was fun and it was totally cool trying to figure out what clues were for. i would get this app it is very addictive.. i just wish it had more levels
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I saw the movie first and although it was good I much prefer the book as it it goes into more detail. I have to say though that seeing the movie first did give me the context for the book. Without seeing it I think it would have been more difficult to grasp the disjointed storyline go the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's free, and SO worth the inconvenience of the infrequent advertisements used to pay for the site. I like the overall setup. The option of being able to chose a random or winning hand, having a 'hint' button available, and being able to undo a play, makes this game a REAL KEEPER in my book!
0316247545|5.0|This is a perfect companion to the &#34;Friendship is Magic&#34; series as a whole, and I'm very impressed with the quality of the material included inside.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Exceptional cast... exceptional writing! One of the best shows on television. period. Thank you for making it available on Amazon Prime!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I don't have this app on my kindle yet, but my friend has this app on her kindle and it is totally amazing, you should definetly get this app.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read other reviews from people who were disappointed with this book. I disagree. I thought it was great! I am very satisfied with the ending that Sookie got. If you have been a fan of the series I definitely think you should give a shot. I'm glad I did!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I like it so far. Wish there are more cars though. All in all its worth it for all magic fans every where.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this is a game were you can make a pet home for an animal in the pet store to buy by your coins you got and bling, it is very fun and it has no end! : )
B002361MLA|5.0|The true way to lasting peace and wholeness is within, not without.<br />Tolle has a gift for helping you understand this concept.<br />There is no question he is an enlightened individual. His teachings can help anyone in their search for wholeness.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The first half was great but then different characters appeared and you couldn't figure out who they were and what the purpose was.  The last twenty percent of the book was also excellent, but it took a month for me to come back to the book because when I lost track of the characters I lost interest.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love this game. it's  very challenging and it helps you think and analyze the game so that you could escape the room.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is one of the best games I've played. I recommed it highly. If you want to be challenged play this game your mind will run wild.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is fun so you should play it it is free you can unlock cool things with bannanas and other stuff
B003UYUQZW|5.0|It's one of those movies that makes the transfer from game to movie perfectly, and has both a storyline that one can follow and enough action to keep you in your seat.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|good game. I wish the badges were easier to get. besides that everything works great. should be more interaction with other players as well
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|free to download, but you have to buy stuff to play the game. I took it off my kindle after
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game  so much I totally recommend it. It can b  educational for people who don't really know allot about horses. it's easy to make money and there are tons of horse varieties including a zebra and unicorns!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Really enjoyed the first book, looking forward to watching the hbo season again to see how it compares! I'd recommend!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Very helpful and always there when I need it. I always found the answer answer to my questions.it can be used by all ages.
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|I love George Benson. I came to him late in life and have bought as many of his recordings as possible. I have enjoyed playing the disc.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|this app sucks its not realistic or scary the soundtrack sounds like it was made by a four year old. i dont recommend it sometimes slenderman even glitches out of the game! i barely bought and i dont enoy it . the controls are also all over the place. i wouldnt even give this any stars if i had to give it one
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is well written, interesting & you def get caught up in it! I recommend it to everyone. My friends & I love it.
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|The endless plotting with the Hardman character was a real bore. In general, the episodes dragged in a way that they didn't in Season one. The writers seemed really off their game. Hope things pick up with Season 3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each episode of season 3 left you wanting more. I can't wait to see what's coming next. The costumes, personalities & locations kelp getting better.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was a nice story, but quite easy to solve. Achievements make it a bit more longer to play, though.
B00144VBBS|4.0|Toby Keith has the kind of voice that will make you stop and listen to what he is saying.  I love the richness of his voice.
B000000WFU|3.0|A friend asked me to take this CD off and put something more &#34;listenable&#34; on the player.  At first I couldn't see why, but it's true, the &#34;non-words&#34; get a bit repetitive and tiring.  There are some gorgeous passages, but the whole piece is not conducive to listening clear through..
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This  is definitely some of the most fun I've had on my kindle Fire. This is a very fun game with an entertaining story and multiplayer! I also like the signature thing. If you are bored of your kindle I suggest you get this.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|What a great book. I could not put this book down. His accounts of drug use are unbelievable. The end if the book when he discusses sobriety are very encouraging. This is a must read for anyone who is into music and/or has lived a crazy life of alcohol and drug abuse and desires to get clean or is in the process of recovery.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I selected this film. I am not familiar with the comic book character so the whole experience was new. I loved it. The story line, the characters, the &#34;realms,&#34; the dialog, the direction, the special effects all captured me from the start. The bottom line on this movie is - I have to see it again.
0757302661|5.0|great advice!!<br />great reminders!!<br />great guidance!!<br /><br />this was a useful tool to use with the reinforcement from my midwife. my first kid was 11# - no drugs needed!
B000002AH7|4.0|with his own version of the &#34;concert for aranjuez&#34; and other tracks in the same spanish way, Miles captures the escence of the peninsular, heart beating music with his own, identifiable stlye. His trumpet warms the blood in several passages, and the arrangements, specially the plates, triangles and all the percussion in general are incredible. May be one of the first approaches from an American to music from other cultures, and boy, what a fresh start!. With Miles, it couldn't do another way...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the game so far.  Graphics are pretty clean and the puzzles are about right in difficulty.  nice little diversion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun brain teaser. Shared by a friend.  Having lots of fun trying to figure it out. Going to share with other friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have it on my I-Pod touch and my Kindle Fire and I love it. It is easy to use even, my two year old niece even plays it. I would recommend this game very much!!!!!!! =-) &lt;3
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It keeps all of my favorite music in a safe place, it's great and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B000063IPX|1.0|BEWARE! No &#34;Blow On The Jug&#34; and inserts / printing are AWFUL. Wish someone had warned me! Amazon says 3 more words are required so &#34;This CD SUCKS&#34;!!!
B00915G6YE|5.0|5 stars because I got what I expected on time and in good condition. I have bought previously and have not been disappointed. Thank you
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. This game is a lot fun to play for all ages. Can't. wait for more levels to be added.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The special effects were magical,and the storms in the Pacific are historical.I cried,and laughed,but the friendship bond in the story was not of a predictable nature.It certainly was heartwarming -the aspect of two diametrically different species bonding based on extreme circumstances was woven through -to the end
044024613X|2.0|I liked the book when I first started to read, but then it went off on all these tangents.  When I finished the book it totally went off the deep end and stopped explaining what the heck happened and wht all these people were killed or hurt.  Ended up not liking it all
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Don't know what you people talking 'bout there is no porn ads on mine unless they removed it or something idk but it's great just like the actual YouTube :)
B008CPZNL6|4.0|This app is very useful for keeping all my social and news sources together to give me my status at a glance throughout the day.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This app is just amazing! Very high quality graphics and lots of dinosaurs! I wish you could start off with more bucks. (The things you usually have to buy). But it's one that has stuck with me for a while!
0547848412|4.0|I have seen the movie and then I ordered the book; it was a mistake. I started reading a few pages of it, but really, do I want to finish it to the end like ti finished the movie? I don't think so, but I will pick random paragraphs and or pages to read its story. But I do like the cover page.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A nice little game.  Requires a lot of lateral thinking and some creative ideas.  You will probably have to stop and ponder things more than once.  For free, it's a great value but short for now (they have said more levels are coming).  Recommended.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|As the headline suggests Sunshine is quite different from other movies of its kind. All space travel movies have a mission as the foundation of their story. What sets Sunshine apart is this mission is not about exploration nor answering the ominous (but almost always predictable) distress call. The crew is charged with reigniting a dying sun to save life on earth. However impractical, the mission calls for them to do this by detonating a bomb the size of a small state.<br /><br />Like any other Sci-Fi film you must dismiss some degree of reality and logic. This is all a part of the fun. With a harmonious cast of actors, their performances breath life into the roles of the typically-unlikely, yet always-necessary group of experts with the burden of saving mankind resting squarely on their shoulders. Facing obvious obstacles, the group is met by its greatest challenge when it comes in contact with the last ship to attempt the exact same mission.<br /><br />Fans of movies like Event Horizon, Mission To Mars, Red Planet and Alien will probably concede that Sunshine's strengths in pace, casting and story make it a very likeable picture. Though it never reached wide release it offers an engaging and tense experience for viewers who, in my opinion, will be quite pleasantly surprised.
B002WWKZJK|5.0|Of all the Georgette books, this one is my favorite.  Funny and full of adventure.  A great heroine and handsome rake.  What could be better?
0142420891|4.0|This sequel to IF I STAY does a good job of telling the tale of WHERE SHE WENT. I found it slow reading at first and became irritated with Adam for not REALLY moving on with his life. If you read IF I STAY and wanted to know what followed than you need to read this. If you haven't read IF I STAY, then you SHOULD!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! I could use it every day... which I pretty much do... It isn't slow and you can see everything very well on the kindle fire.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Addictive fun.  Wish you  can save when you are in the room. I didn't lime to start over. Can not stop playing.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This season was just as good as the first. I had never even watched this show until Season 2.  It was at my friend's urging that I watch this show and I'm very pleased she pushed me to watch it.  If you're anything like me, I would catch The Good Wife every now and then on tv, but never with much consistency.  It wasn't because I thought the show wasn't good.  It just happened to be a timing issue.  That's all.<br /><br />Season 2 is just as addictive as Season 1 and Season 3. By the way, once you watch Season 2, you'll WANT to watch Season 3 in succession and in one sitting.  It's great acting and quality writing all in one fine package.  Watch it and you'll be happy you did.

B008RJ6TTC|4.0|This is a very good detective series and every episode is like a mini movie with good acting and many different characters . This series will be a timeless hit no matter how old it gets.
1611761808|4.0|Great story that provides insight to current issues our world faces.  It is an inside view with depth of understanding.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I Love every song on it. This is really awesome. you should already know if you like them or not.
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|The end stories were not as exciting as in previous seasons but, nonetheless, I was sorry to see the series end. It was great while it lasted. Wish Arthur and Merlin could have grown older together in the end. I particularly loved it because I didn't have to struggle with what was going on during the entire series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an excellent game to play. I love to play because it has exiting moments and it always changes its places. It also has many prizes and themes.My opining is that its better than temple run mabey you should try it one day and love it.  Evelyn avelar
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|My friend suggested me this book and I am so grad he did.<br />This book is so well written that you can see the character's face. There are many moments in this story that you'll never forget.<br />I just loved the whole atmosphier created by the 3 main characters.<br />Now I finished reading the whole book in 24hours and going to read it again as I miss them. I miss the croocked smile of Augustus.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great app would pay for it , it's free and would recommend for all ages it's amazing best app ever and you can connect with you friends

B0053O89RY|5.0|One of the best on-going comedy series ever!I Adore the clever scripts,and the wonderful actors who portray the down to earth and delightfully funny characters! Thanks to all involved(especially screenwriter Christopher Lloyd) for bringing this wonderful comedy to us.
B000ICZD5M|5.0|Classic 80's Sci Fi. Not my favorite David Lynch Film, but one of my all time favorite sci fi flicks.
B009D5VNLS|3.0|I recently purchased this movie for my seven year old daughter, but I guess not all children have the same intelligence or should I say created equal !  Both my seven year old and my three year old sat down to watch this but after about 45 minutes my seven year old wanted to change it and watch something else. Strangely though my three year old daughter wanted to continue to watch it !  I think it was not holding her interest due to the heavy Scottish accents used in the movie, and although the brief parts I did catch were amusing my two young daughters never watch anything with ANY violence of any description so this probably was what was off putting to at least one of them.<br />I'm sure if we check back in another year or so then I will be able to offer a different opinion. With it being a fairly new movie the actual quality was faultless, animation -wise.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|If you love authentic Hawaiian music this is the CD for you; nevermind that it's a movie soundtrack but instead be grateful that the producer's of this movie chose to give meaning to it's soundtrack - it's timeless and evocative
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|I can't say &#34; I &#34;  love this or even like this movie, so if it was me i'd give it a one star. Reason being they really tried to make this movie too much like your typical American film for adults..it's no wonder our little daughters ( and son's )  begin to act the same as the trashy stars we have to endure in the pathetic garbage that Hollywood consistently churns out !!<br />Four stars only because it's a movie my two young daughters turn to watch quite a lot and it does keep them glued to the screen allowing me to get other chores done.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Hadn't read a Nicholas Sparks book in a while, so I thought I'd treat myself to a story I knew I'd enjoy.  I wasn't disappointed!  Easy, fast reading; entertaining, easy story to relate to - very HUMAN, which is why I love Nicholas Sparks!  Turn off the TV and curl up with a good book!

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT film, with BRILLIANT actors, telling an EXCEPTIONNALLY moving real story! Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.<br /><br />As you probably already know, this film tells the true story of Bethany Hamilton, a very promising young American surfer, who suffered a bad accident in October 2003, as the result of which she was very seriously and permanently injured. This is mostly the story of her struggle to overcome the results of the accident, return to a normal life and especially go back to her great passion - professional surfing.<br /><br />This is a rather low key film, made with a rather modest (by Hollywood standards) budget, but nevertheless it packs an enormous punch, with some scenes being simply breathtaking. It was made possible by skilfull filming, good scenario, strong dialogs and a little bit of very discreet but extremely well made CGI.<br /><br />All actors did their best in this film and for such a little production quite an ensemble cast was gathered:<br /><br />- AnnaSophia Robb, who plays Bethany Hamilton, is of course the main star and she is AMAZING, as excellent as she was in her big break \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\" (and gosh, did this girl grow well since then!). I sincerely believe that she has the potential to become another Natalie Portman in the future!<br />- Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt play Bethany's parents and they are both GREAT<br />- singer Carrie Underwood, winner of \\"American Idol\\", makes here one of her rare appearances in cinema - and she is excellent!<br />- Craig T. Nelson, a Hollywood veteran specialist of second roles, plays here the surgeon who treats Bethany after the accident, and his calm and low key performance is an asset to this film<br />- Kevin Sorbo, mostly known for portraying Hercules in the 90s, plays here a role rather unusual for him - and he does it very well<br />- Branscombe Richard, an actor of Hawaiian ancestry known for his huge size and unique facial features and haircut, appears here as a Hawaian ex-surfing champion<br />- Lorraine Nicholson, young daughter of Jack Nicholson, appears here in the role of Alana Blanchard, Bethany's best friend - and also a great surfer herself<br />- Jeremy Sumpter, who in 2003 was an impressive Peter Pan, appears here as one of Bethany's brothers<br />- smoking hot model and surfer Sonia Balmores Chung, Miss Hawaii Teen 2004, plays here Malina Birch, Bethany's nemesis in surf competitons...<br />- last but not least, REAL Bethany Hamilton (filmed from some distance) appears in some scenes showing her impressive surfing<br /><br />This film is deeply immersed in Christian teachings, as in real life Hamilton family was (and still is) very religious. However, there is no heavy hammering of Bible on the viewers - the message is discreet and softly spoken. This film tries to tackle with one of the hardest questions a Christian can be asked: \\"Why does bad things happen to good people?\\". It is hardly a spoiler to say here that there will be no fully satisfying solution given to solve this riddle - but some elements of answer, quite important, will be provided. Those answers will not satisfy everybody - but those who so wish can find more elements in the Bible, and especially in the Book of Job.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is an excellent, wonderful film, which should please adults and young teenaegers alike. I recommend it with whole my heart! And to end this review, I will give the last word to Bethany Hamilton (who is now 23 and just announced her engagement), who said in her book: \\"Surfing isn't the most important thing in life. Love is.\\"ars here as a Hawaian ex-surfing champion<br />- Lorraine Nicholson, young daughter of Jack Nicholson, appears here in the role of Alana Blanchard, Bethany's best friend - and also a great surfer herself<br />- Jeremy Sumpter, who in 2003 was an impressive Peter Pan, appears here as one of Bethany's brothers<br />- smoking hot model and surfer Sonia Balmores Chung, Miss Hawaii Teen 2004, plays here Malina Birch, Bethany's nemesis in surf competitons...<br />- last but not least, REAL Bethany Hamilton (filmed from some distance) appears in some scenes showing her impressive surfing<br /><br />This film is deeply immersed in Christian teachings, as in real life Hamilton family was (and still is) very religious.

B00CEF014E|3.0|Good for a quick read, this story lacks substance but moves well through the plot. Awkward in places, detailed and realistic in other places. Go read this book.
B00C9U9YLA|5.0|I got the limited edition Vinyl and everything is amazing. The graphic art is really good and complements the great job the band did with the set of song they chose.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, either you buy the digital version or the Vinyl.

B003204MQS|1.0|This movie was so boring and slow to develop that it is probably only the second film that I stopped watching without finishing (the other being a Christian movie that Netflix labeled as Horror--seriously). Not only that but the characters aren't very likable. Movies that were supposed to have been filmed on a Handy Cam are hard to do in my opinion because the person holding the camera usually talks too much and gets on my nerves--this dude is no different. After Paramount acquired the film they tried to remake it but during test screenings it was deemed too scary, I wish they had succeeded. I should have known better than to try and watch a film that had received critical acclaim.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game...temple run 2 is even better!  If you're competitive and like chasing achievements, you'll enjoy this.  Been playing for months, still fun.
B005FDXT32|5.0|Tony Montanna is awesome. Say Hello to my little friend. One of my all time favs. One of Pacino's greatest roles.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I can't say ENOUGH about this movie!  One of THE BEST.  I've watched it already about 5 times.  It's SO FUNNY, sad, and touching, the two main characters have SUCH charisma and chemistry together.  LOVE Bradley Cooper.  He is OUTSTANDING in this movie!  Jennifer Lawrence is ALSO outstanding.  LOVE HER!!  The other cast members are brilliant...Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker and others that will be familiar to you.  It deals with mental illness and gives you just a taste of how it can turn a family upside down.  Don't miss this film.  I HIGHLY recommend it!
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Even though the Theodore Boone series is written for kids, I enjoyed it as well as his adult legal stories.  Maybe that is because I may never grow up.  I remember Nancy Drew and these books are in the same vain.  Young people should read these.
B008220BP2|4.0|THIS is definitely a new twist on a Zombie movie, and THAT's exactly why I liked it.  Very humorous, still has some blood and guts to it but ALSO has some ADDED romance.  It's funny, cute.  The two main characters have charisma.  It works!  I guess if you are a REAL die-hard Zombie lover this may NOT do it for you but IF you like a Zombie movie every once in a while and are looking for something a little different THIS is your movie!
0143122010|5.0|I read a review of this on-line after being annoyed with news coverage.  It's a great book, and I am glad that it was available, and in such great condition.  I recommend it, and the seller as both being well worth the cost and minimal effort required to buy.
B006R6ZP6U|2.0|The synopsis sounded interesting and the story wasn't bad, but it felt more like a horror movie than an adventure.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty fun and highly addicting! the levels are all different with varying difficulty in figuring out what to do. definitely recommend it!
B001AZFO14|3.0|Not the best action movie ever, but good.  Good guys win in the end, steadfast reliable proves out over young and strong.  Endurance matters.

B005H9B44A|4.0|Surprisingly the darker parts of the movie are probably the more compelling, but the telling of an old mythology strung against present day has some merit.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I'm glad I did not read any full story-lines for this movie.<br />It was unexpected, and such a joy to watch.<br />I highly recommend,<br />and put it on the chick flick list, as one you can go back to often.
B00136JM6S|5.0|I just love Laura Nyro.  She wrote ALOT of famous sons.  Here she sings her own and you'll know everyone of them...<br /><br />Bruce, well you know how I feel bout him.

B009PK9SB8|5.0|I got GoPro Hero 3 balck and as you know there is no view finder no display so you cant see what you shooting. You can use your Wi-Fi with your smart phone or tablet, but it will drain your battery. On Wi-Fi you will get 35 to 40 min of shooting time and the gopro will get extremely hot.<br />With this display I get over 2 hours recording time and its so much easier to navigate in the menus.<br /><br />#1 benefit is that you can see what you will record, you can aim your camera.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|This latest installment of the Rebuild series is not a disappointment. Asuka Makes in incredible entrance, Mari makes a memeorable one, Shinji goes epic Bad-Ass and stuff goes boom, crunch, splat, and every other violent sound effect like its going out of style!

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love these movies. I practically grew up with Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and Star Trek, so watching these movies with my children is a joy for me. Even &#34;Indiana Jones and the Space Aliens from Uranus (a.k.a. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull)&#34;. The transition to HD didn't seem to do a whole lot for the older films and a lot of the special features are recycled from the DVD box set release. Even with those little drawbacks this is a must have for fans of Dr. Henry Jones, Jr.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I LOVE this game! It's fun and so addicting! Love it because you earn coins and gems easily and you don't even consider in-app purchasing cause you find money so easily! LOVE AND YOU WILL TOO!

1451695195|1.0|DOCTOR WHO PENNED BEST-SELLER `PROOF OF HEAVEN' UNDER FIRE FOR FALSE CLAIMS<br /><br />By Cheryl K. Chumley - The Washington Times, Wednesday, July 3, 2013<br /><br />A neurosurgeon who gave an account of his near-death experience and journey into the afterlife in the best-selling \\"Proof of Heaven\\" is facing fire from doctors who treated him after his slip into a coma and say his book is full of falsifications, exaggerations and nonsense.<br /><br />\\"Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey Into the Afterlife,\\" written by Dr. Eben Alexander about his personal near-death experience, has sold almost 2 million copies and has been on best-seller lists for more than 35 weeks. But doctors who treated him say it's filled with misstatements and inaccuracies, the Daily Mail reported.<br /><br />For instance, Dr. Alexander recounts in one chapter how he screamed, \\"God help me,\\" the Daily Mail reported. But Dr. Laura Potter, the emergency room physician on staff the day he supposedly screamed that phrase said it didn't happen. He had a tube down his throat that would have made such a scream impossible, she said, as the Daily Mail reported.<br /><br />Dr. Potter also said Dr. Alexander didn't slip into a coma from E. coli bacterial meningitis, as he claims in his book. Rather, doctors placed him in a medically induced coma and he maintained consciousness -- albeit he was hallucinating, she said.<br /><br />Doctors who refute Dr. Alexander's account of his trip to heaven also say that he has a past history of fabrication. They say he falsified medical records on one of his patients to disguise the fact he operated on the wrong spot during spine surgery, the Daily Mail reported.<br /><br />Read the article in the Washington Times here:  [...]
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I used this bag a lot since purchasing it and am totally happy with it.  You can buy some great camera bags for much more but this one does the job for me at a very reasonable price.  Lots of interior storage and easily can be configured to individual needs.  The bag itself is very light but when full of my equipment it weighs quite a bit but has held up to all the stress of lugging it around national parks, New York City, and many other places.  Very sturdy construction.  Save yourself some money and give this one a try.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read ALL of the Jack Reacher books and I'm a fan of Lee Child (still in disbelief that Tom Cruise somehow became the outward face of Jack Reacher!). I was skeptical of this book because of the hitch-hiking coincidence/bad guy connection. However, I was bored so I bought it anyway.<br /><br />Like all Lee Child books, it's readable...you want to find out what happens. But this one fell FLAT. There were a couple of surprises (probably not ones you will like a ton)...but generally, it felt rushed. The ending was TERRIBLE and an editor really should have held it up to close out better.<br /><br />Jack Reacher has been a good formula in the past...but if you've read other books, you're probably starting to feel it go stale. Time for a shake-up, Lee!<br /><br />My advice: buy it if you're bored and need time to go by (i.e. on a long airplane ride), but be prepared for disappointment.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|the original show was boring and so were the movies even thought they tried oh so hard to make them exiting.  this movie/new beginning for the show brings new life to old stale stories.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It sounds odd at first, a space western, but Joss Whedon pulls it off and does an amazing job.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Full DVD set<br /><br />Cons:<br />DVD menu isn't the greatest
B000E6EGXM|5.0|At a time when patriotism is a &#34;sacred&#34; principle, this composition is a sobering reminder of what is required when a leader declares war.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I have admit a lack of knowledge regarding the details of the life James Bond creator Ian Fleming as well as those surrounding Germany's invasion of France in the 1940's.  However,  my ignorance was swept away by the vivid description of  author Damian Stevenson.  Stevenson's remarkable knowledge Fleming is clear throughout the story, and the result is a gripping tale of intrigue. The inspiration for 007 are clear in this real-life adventure. Highly recommended!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Come on magic on your phone what's not to love about it.  Any fan of magic will have to buy the full version immediately.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Easy to read and perfect as a summer book. I needed something light to get my mind off other things. This book worked!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I saw the interview of Dr. Alexander with Oprah and decided I wanted to read it. It is an eye opener and a faith restorer. Loved it
B005HSL626|5.0|My family and I loved this app until update began R - rated movie ads.  Get rid of them and you have a 5 star from me.<br /><br />UPDATE!  The movie clips have disappeared, and now the family I are happily slicing flying fruit!  5 star fun, in 1 minute games!  Thank you!
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|The first two Mad Max movies are among my all time favorites.  While these certainly look and sound great in HD, the set is very lacking on special features.  Despite this, it's nice to have all 3 on Blu Ray as I await the release of Fury Road.
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|This is great simple fun that would get 5 stars, but I took off 1 for the frequent connection issues and another for how easy it is to accidently spend the in-game currency.
B004EJUMT2|4.0|Though I like their 2nd album much better, there are some great songs on this album for sure.  Above all, I really give a lot of credit to Ghost because they focus on strong melodies and catchy tunes.  Overall it very much has the vibe of old Alice Cooper and Blue Oyster Cult sounds.  It's also extremely nice to hear an album that's not over-compressed to death in the mastering stage, and it's a very clean recording.
B00004YTIQ|1.0|I would not recommend this product. We own the pool it was made for and it sags into the middle so water that gets collected on top just weighs it down more. It is very thin and not a all worth $15! I'd rather use a tarp weighed down with rocks...it would be easier to get on and off anyway! Save your money and pass on this product.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Ghost is by far the most musical and interesting of the newer metal bands I have heard recently.  There are great melodies on this album for sure, and they seem to favor the overall presentation as opposed to virtuosity -- which is fine with me.  I greatly look forward to their next release.
B001IF277K|5.0|Good value and excelent product! I recomend everyone to buy it. Just arrived and I used it. Good rate price/benefit.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|While the quality of this disc is great, the movie itself is probably the first Die Hard I can say that I don't absolutely love.  Don't get me wrong -- there is action galore, Bruce has some great lines, and there are some cool (though very impossible) stunts, but it just has a different tone from all of the other Die Hards.  If you're a fan of the series, you should definitely see it, but keep in mind it's sort of an odd take on the &#34;buddy&#34; picture.
B00447L4JG|5.0|In the non-Blu-Ray world, some of us have to look hard to find extras. If you even remotely like this film..get this version! It's moderately priced, and the extras are like getting a 2nd disc! The digital remastering has it looking even more sensational than it already was..oh, did I mention the extras?
B001QERPDO|5.0|The Script in general are amazing but this album is my favorite. Love all the songs. Its in my car now and thats all I listen too.
B001974DG0|5.0|Very very good book. You really get into the book.<br />Can not put it down. This book is good from page 1 to the end.<br />I had read a lot of his books before starting to use an E reader<br />two years ago. This is my first book of his with an E reader.<br />I highly recommend this book.<br />Some of Mr. Koontz's books are too deep and are less interesting.<br />This book is definitely a good story.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What a great and unique way to write a book about mbies. Felt like a real price of American history couldn't put it down.
B005J2UM9S|4.0|If you're a fan of the ghost shows (I like Ghost Adventures with Zak Bagans), I think you'll like this movie. The suspense pace is really good and well done in using all the ghost hunting toys to get multiple points of view. No over the top gore (which actually would have hurt the movie). This movie left me with a vague sense of dread and a fear of the dark for one night, which is just what I want from my horror movies.
B0083B3KOQ|1.0|This uploads to the net to convert. If you have a video file you want to convert you basically have to post it to the internet. After 30 minutes I was only at 3%. Not worth the time. I would prefer to do it on my device. Maybe ok if you want to convert a document, but anything larger is a waste of time.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I watched the whole Phillip Phillips season of American Idol and love this CD. Great songs. Mellow and easy to listen to.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Great soundtrack for fans of the Star Trek reboot films. Michael Giacchino does it again and creates another great series of tracks which progresses the orchestrated backdrop in the same way that Abrams and crew develop the characters from the beginning of the first film to the end of the second.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Those of you bitchin about the cost, find a little patience! I've been playing for weeks and haven't spent a dime! I love this game!
B000LXHK22|4.0|I enjoyed the performances of the entire cast, the locations were a beautiful escape to where I would never have been able to see or experience such a different lifestyle.  Corporate Greed, Romance, Family ties, Humor it had it all.  A wonderful escape, and a fun trip with many life lessons to be learned and shared by all.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book ever!!! Cannot wait for house of Hades to come out in October!!!I am definitely going to re-read the series!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game you can fed ride and be in shows i love this app great for all ages.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I liked the fact it was based on a true story.  Very poignant and thought provoking. Makes you realize what is important in life.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I played magic back in 1997 during the original run and got out and sold all my cards because girls, parting, and cars were more fun to a 20 year old. Huge mistake! I wish I had all those cards now. I've been dying for an easy way to get back in without being destroyed by &quot;He who spends the most wins.&quot; This app is it! It eases you back into playing, money is not the bottom line and it is helping me become familiar with all the new rules, cards, and tactics that have change since I quit without overwhelming me. This has truly made my day and it will get me back into the physical version because the transition will be so much easier. Well played &quot;Magic,&quot; you've found a great way to get me back in the game without costing me a fortune. I look forward to hours of gaming and fun. I can't wait to explore all the little nuisances of the game.<br /><br />One huge request though to the developers: Please update frequently and keep the game fresh. Please dedicate server space and keep the speeds fast as people join. And please continually address any bugs that develop with a game this massive and intense. If you do, I will be a player for life. This game alone is reason enough to buy a Kindle Fire!<br /><br />Thanks again for giving me a little of my childhood back! I've missed this a lot!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The movie had a good message with a modern twist using video games to hook the kids.The characters were fun.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I just expected more I guess.  I felt the author was just trying at times to get words on a page and see where it goes.  I will continue to read the series but hope next book is better.<br /><br />I know many people who read it in a day but it didn't keep my attention like the 1st two.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This is a light, fast read, but I laughed all the way through, and I would read it again because there are so many hilarious scenes. Tina Fey's depictions of her awkward teen years as a super nerdy &#34;theatre kid&#34; alone make this a worthwhile read, but the rest of the book is equally tight.She's one of the great humorists of our time and she does not resort to mean-spirited derision of others, which is refreshing. On a more serious note, I would recommend this to young adults who feel like outsiders--Bossypants shows that high school and college years are not the be-all and end-all.
B009P1WES6|5.0|A twist on every page. One of the few times you feel for the murderer. Could not stop reading it. I can not wait for the next book
B00CL68BK2|3.0|A bit contrived and not exactly an authentic portrayal of mental illness.  Bradley Cooper really shines in a role that is really far & away his best work.  Certainly worth a few bucks & your two hours on a rainy night. Recommended.
B000WDROYK|5.0|Excellent story, beautifully acted.  Carice Van Houten is a wonderful actress and I hope to see her in movies here in the US.  Normally I hate movies with subtitles but my friend from the Netherlands recommended this and he was right.  Gripping story of a young Jewish woman during the Nazi occupation in the Netherlands.  Highly recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. Simple yet challenging. Work out<br /> for your brain. Hope it has more levels.. just got it and can't put it down.
1400031354|4.0|Mma Ramotswe has agreed to marry Mr J. L. B. Matekoni and this is the story of their engagement, sort of.  The main focus is the development of Mma Ramotswe's detective agency and how it grows.  Like the first book of this series, it is done in simple discreet stories that all have a beginning, middle and end.  It makes for easy reading.  There are no dead bodies.  There are no wild and crazy solutions that you could not have thought of in a million years.  Just this problem and who, what, where, when and how, or most of those, and the solution is simple.<br /> The best part of these stories is the pride Mma Ramotswe has in her country, and the explanation of the society they have.  The title comes from a saying they have in that country referring to something I have forgotten.  It is an eerily satisfying life they live over there: happy, generous, obliging and considerate of others.  I have read where some British will address each other as Mr. and Mrs. no matter how familiar with each they are, and found it strange.  Here they do the same.  You never find out Mr. J. L. B. Mateloni's name other than that.  I guess they are being respectful and that is not a bad thing for anyone to do for others.
B00BXHLM1K|4.0|The Tosca is, by far, the best I have ever seen.  Terfel is a very evil, and complex Scarpia.  He was born for this role.  Jonas Kauffmann, perhaps the best tenor we have these days is a tall, handsome Mario, in splendid voice, and a wonderful actor.  The surprise for me was Gheorghiu.  I must reevaluate her.  She was a wonderful Tosca.  Her Tosca was very moving.  The Vissi d'art was a heartbreaker.  This whole production made dramatic sense.  The sets were magnificent.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.<br /><br />The Rigoletto was fine, but I found the setting, moved to Rat Pack Las Vegas, very distracting.  Beckszala is in wonderful voice, good looking, and a fine actor.  Lucic was mostly a heartbreaking Rigoletto, but Diana Damrau quite uneven.  She got better as the opera progressed.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This was amazing.  I love the heroine.  I liked reading about Stopckholm and the rest of the Swedish sites and places.
0789723107|4.0|I bought this after reading at the library.  It is full of good advice and short enough that I can flip through the book and a new web site I've made side by side and see if it conforms to the rules of style and brevity.  It was worth owning a copy at work.
B0015DROBO|5.0|My mother was born in Malmo, Sweden.  So it was great reading this book.  I only iwsh she had lived longer as I know she would have enjoyed it so much.  First I saw the movies and got caught up in the story.  Then I ought the book.
B0053O89WY|3.0|The comic book jokes and references to products nerds may buy are still funny.  But Season 5 was nearly free of science related humor.  So the series is far less compelling to me.  It's like they wound me up, reeled me in, and now it's time to cash in.  Too bad for them I do not buy very many action figures, t-shirts with slogans, or tickets to nerd related events.
B000JLSLZQ|2.0|Good movie. No DTS, no Blu-ray audio. Audio is everything for a movie like this. Why studio release the blu-ray like this?
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I can hold my phone or iPad up to the sky and see all the constellations.  How cool is that!!
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Unable to view the movie I paid for. The download speed was so slow that the screen resolution was unviewable, and the screen would freeze. Never got to watch it.<br /><br />It is apparently a problem with the Amazon service and my Panasonic DMP BDT210 3D Blue-Ray player. This has been going on for many months now, with no fix in sight. I guess I will have to give up on Amazon download service.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is great, but I wish that they would take away the limit of gifts you can receive. Most of my gifts I do not get to collect. What is the point of the limit?
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game is relaxing,addictive,peaceful, and best of all a great way to spend a rainy afternoon when you cannot  go outside and watch the rain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever this is the world's best game I love it and ply it all the time it's the best
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Wish it would let me play the advance boards but it doesn't win enough or give enough chips to play the boards that take 10 chips per board. Only give 20 chips once a day.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Love this app. Use it all day no matter the weather.  It's clear and concise and seems to be always right.<br /><br />.
B000I3P3EM|5.0|Great story line and Great series of movies.  THe DVD was in perfect condtion.  Would recommend to all of my friends.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome, challenging game.  It was well worth the$2 paid.  I would recommend to all! Some levels are challenging, but the hints help you without completely solving it for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|please make this game free at least for a day because I know a lot of people who want this app for free on the kindle fire. I think it would mean a lot to them because we are all minecraft fans. thank you
B0089LOG02|5.0|Amazing how these children existed and that so many were in this sad and terrible situation.  I imagine that many of the stories did not turn out even close to successful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read this book at least 5 times and you find new and exciting things each time you read it! Suzanne Collins has outdone herself on this series! Bravo!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Its a great cd every thing that everybody said it was i realy enjoyed just layin back and listening to ir
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful app that helps a person stay in God's Word and build on their faith.  There are many translations available and you can quickly switch between them.  The highlight and note feature is easy and I love how they can be organized, and your notes can be public or private, and shared with fb or Twitter if wanted.  I am also pleased with the fact you can highlight in many different colors and not just standard yellow. I personally love the many many devotions and reading plans available.  So many Bible Study tools in one great app.
B00BP29SAA|4.0|My 5 year old son isn't that good at navigating games yet and it didn't take long for him to get and hold his attention.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really addicting. There are parts that are hard to figure out. Just a tip... some items you collect go with other items.
B003B02PEU|5.0|This book keeps you on the edge constantly. Could not put it down. Loved it and looking forward to reading his other books.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This was a great action movie.  Each character had some development which was nice.  This Hulk was much better than the last iteration.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|I wish I'd read the books first before watching the series - probably would have rated it 5 stars.<br /><br />The characters are so diverse and Martin is a master of weaving the story of each of these characters along a journey for the battle of rightful rulers.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Classic Tom Cruise movie.  Secret agent, beats everyone up, bad guy loses, good guy wins, happy ending.  Doesn't take any thought to follow the movie.
0374533555|4.0|Great point but not delivered in way most will get it.  Not certain of authors motives in this delivery.  Very important point.  Author has lots of notoriety but over plays hand in what he can expect from reader. Shame as root is important.
020161622X|5.0|It is just as the preface has said, \\"you will become a better programmer by reading this book\\".  I work (seemingly live) in a small programming shop, and I have been wondering for a long time about how to improve as a programmer faster than I have been.  I started working in an environment surrounded by individuals that have been programming for the most part by themselves for the past 10 years or so without other people's input, and I think I can say that there are some huge issues.  But identifying issues is not good enough for me, I want to also present the best solutions possible.  This book has, even in the past two weeks vastly sharpened my ability to determine what is a \\"good\\" way to go about something and a \\"bad\\" way.  The sections on testing are great, since the whole idea of unit testing is novel to me, this shop had never implemented such a thing.  Basically it is giving me a view of what an ideal programming environment would be like.  I would like to reach that place.  I am beginning to understand how much work it will take to get there...
0060555661|5.0|Always a classic and worthwhile read.  Keep it hand to look up subjects rather than watch tv sit coms.  No 4.5 minute commercials to struggle through.  Good advice.
B002TU1Q3Y|4.0|The postscript says the author read 200 books while researching this novel. I believe him. The level of detail is incredible, and on top of that it's a really good yarn. Telling the story form both British and German perspectives, and making a mistaken raid the subject  must have been quite new at the time. Recommended.
0470876417|2.0|Tried to follow but frustrating.  Situation more urgent and complex then fits the methods described.  Remember the model isn't the end game you are interested in a tool to help you get to the end game.
B00AYE8C70|5.0|BEST OF THE BEST<br />CREME DE LA CREME  nothing better. Now available for PC. Try it you will not be disapponted.
B00AR0DN3Y|3.0|It's a thrilling story of courage and human endurance, but as a non climber I found descriptions of the climbing sequences to be very hard to follow
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was so enthrall end by this book.  Such a page-turning story. As yellow roses have always been my favorite flower, I may change to something more optimistic.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A story that changes course so masterfully that you cannot relax for one moment. When you think that you know what is going to happen, you do not.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Read book because of TV show on A&E. some bad language that was not necessary which may keep me from reading more of this author's books. Enjoyed the setting and subject matter.
0156027321|5.0|The movie was fantastic, but received more information reading the book! Excellent!  Understand now some that I missed in the movie!  Excellent!  Marion Edwards
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is on point.  It's large buttons make it easy to do functions. I recommend this Kindle app for Kindle users.
1451697686|5.0|This book is a must-have if you are interested in decluttering and making your home greener. The cleaning recipes are fantastic and I loved learning how to buy bulk foods!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Young love, insecurities, joy and pain. This book had it all, can't wait to get Travis's side of the story.
B004UHL9EK|1.0|This worthless app for some ignorant reason requires Internet access to start and stop a timer.  At track meets in timbuktu, with no cell service, one cannot use a simple stop watch timer in this app as one should be able to, because the ignorant app requires Internet access and closes down because there is no Internet. There is no reason whatsoever for this app to ever once access the Internet, yet, it won't run without it.<br /><br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Absolutely love this movie! Kids have watched it probably 50 times since it arrived...love the minions! Must see this movie.
0061537969|5.0|Fabulous read!  A must read for every dog owner and dog lover.  Keep the tissues handy.  A terrific story indeed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game! Sad there was only ten levels! Hope they come out with more soon! My whole family got into this one
B009LQKHIO|2.0|The idea of the story is good. I found the \\"steamy\\" scenes to be a bit much. The real issue for me was the blatant and distracting spelling and grammar errors. I had to make myself finish the story because I needed to know what happened. I don't believe I'd recommend this book.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My granddaughter just loves this game.  She gets very involved with it.  Bot much more to say except that it was worth the money.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I watched this movie growing up, live how they put all the stereotypes together in one room having to deal with the pressures of being a teenager and surviving their home lives as well. A classic!!!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Just needed this for a school project and I like you can still get it for a good price after all these years
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Oh my gosh! This is the best app, in ever! I listen to it all day long, recharge it then listen to it all night too. I'm so glad I got it. I so recommend this app! Everyone should get it. It's free too!
B00915G6YE|4.0|A great series that I will never tire of watching. Excited to see the next and final season whenever it comes out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just amazing. It's so educational and fun. It really gives me something to do when I'm bored or when the internet is down.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It is a fun app and is amazing. I really like my daughter's playing. So much fun to watch them play.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is so inspirational. Regardless of the critics out there; it's certainly a must-read! The subject matter is only piercing because she speaks the truth.  Take a step back and think about the situation holistically; women are not at the forefront, and often it's society, but often it's because we don't blaze our own trails.  Sandberg is on point, and I couldn't agree more! AWESOME BOOK!
1449433251|5.0|Beautiful complete set to have of Calvin & Hobbes.<br /><br />Great quality paper and comes in a great case for display.<br /><br />Easy & fast transaction & fast shipping.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so addicting and fun I cant get enough of it its so cute...........................u need to try to get it when
B00942G4UA|5.0|This film changed my diet! It is frightening that people eat what they do without knowing it's origins.<br />Also that GMO's have been in our food products since the mid 2000's. Definetly check this one out!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I love challenges and puzzles. Anything that gets me thinking and having to figure what to do next is a game for me and this was it!! Looking forward to more!!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Worth $6.99 awesome game pretty good story mode and multiplayer has an huge armory of weapons buy this game trust me u won't regret it
B00DHNAQ2Y|3.0|while it does have its entertainment value....do not expect boomstick material. This is a reinvention of evil dead and has a bit of throw back material, but alas its just not the same.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|It's not a bad set.  Just kinda makes me sleepy.  Guess I got burnt out on the Batster from watching it as far back as the 60s.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />AU<br /><br />//(~_~)\\
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is my new favourite  author. She has such a distinctive voice and hits her regional locales dead on. Even though you think you know what's coming, it's still a major shock.
159463176X|5.0|This third book by Hosseini didn't disappoint me. It reaches new heights even for an author who always entertains.  I love a good story and he seems to know just what a good story is.  I'm already anticipating his next book. I wish he could write one a month. I'd be first in live for each and every one. Buy it. You will enjoy it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just love this novel. I love all Sylvia books. I can not stop reading them after I start reading it.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is super good. Get it. I think you should get it. It is like texting but a little different. Super fast
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can not wait for the next book, I read this one in 3 days, so good I could not stop reading.
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|I've been a fan of Joe for a long time and this CD doesn't disappoint. More I listen to it the more I like it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome. It's a time passer and it's great for kids. My favorite thing about this game is that if you die you have a chance to try again as long as you have enough keys
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We loved doing this game as a family! Loved the way it made the boys think! We can't wait for more rooms.
B001ECQ4AS|5.0|Going into this show, knowing practilly zip about it and considering myself as not really interested in horror stuff, I found myself really liking this show. While not many episodes spooked me, I got extremely interested in the culture of \\"supernatural\\" beings and the story archs of Sam and Dean. The show did a good job of delivering plenty of both aspects.<br /><br />While this season does have an episodic feel, I don't mind that as, without viewers posessing knowledge of the creatures and antagonist that Sam and Dean are trying to find, how else could this show get to 9 seasons now?<br /><br />Now I do have two slight issues with this season. One, how does this show get so many hot girls? Now don't get me wrong, I like seeing hot girls and they are usually needed in many horror stuff, but this many????<br /><br />Two, SPOILER ALERT SO STAY AWAY FROM THIS PARAGRAPH NOVICE\\"S. Why didn't they kill off John in the last episode. I totally predict that's how his character arch ends so....<br /><br />Great season and I'm looking forward to more.
B00CFITJKW|1.0|In the first mission when you try<br /> to land the plane just crashes and can't get the plane to go strait
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not bad for  a free app.  Something to pass the ton with.  Challenging at times.  Kiddos liked it, too.<br />Good game.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Kids love it helps long road trips keeps their nemo story going and going. Slow at first but they got the hang of it
1451673442|4.0|if you liked the secret, you will like this book, been sharing it with every one I know, even my daughter
B0091REZMW|5.0|its a really fun game .I think. the graphics are awesome keep on adding rooms its a lot of fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME PLEASE LEAVE YOUR COMMENTS.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a great time with this app! Makes you think and keeps you moving forward.<br />Gets everyone involved to remember somethings but thats what makes it fun!
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Okay the movie did not follow the  story from the book completely but to me this was refreshing. I was not looking for that because I have watched many movies from books and they seldom do. This does not take away from the good acting and  cliffhanger. I hope the next movie is ready is ready by 2014.  I will watch it too.
B0086700CM|5.0|you should really have it. It's the best game ever and never delete it. Have it forever and keep it forever.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved the way Drew talks to the reader and sets the stage.  Emma Chase does an excellent job climbing into Drew's head and makes the reader rooting for him the whole way!  This is a fun and easy read, I hope we get to see what is next for Drew and Kate!!!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A beautiful story from the dogs perspective.  Best thing I've read in years.  Very well written.  Couldn't put it down.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game! Great graphics, good puzzles. Unfortunately, it left me wanting more and I would have really liked for it to be longer. Nevertheless, worth the coinage. Looking forward to more chapters.
0425263991|4.0|I liked the book very much.I just wanted a little more interaction with the older characters from her other books.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|The Angry Birds (no mater which game) is so addictive it is unbeleivable. I love the games and play them as often as I can. I am disappointed when it is finished. I wish the games would come out faster.
B000JQU1VS|1.0|I ordered this to read on my Kindle but decided that I do not like to read on the Kindle.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I love Angry Birds. It is such an adictive game series. I wish that new games would come out faster so I can start agin,
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Daft Punk music at its best (Digital Love and Aerodynamic are some of the best techno tracks ever made) and the legendary japanese animator Leiji Matsumoto working together to bring a fascinating story told only by music and anime.<br /><br />Any fan of these genres will be rewarded by watching this.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Fun to play many challenges Reccomenfd this game for everyone Great family game Good for the whole family to play
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Action packed with great graphics. I might watch it again if my wife will let me do to the great sound which she says is too loud.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This is a nice Clever movie with a good ending. We noticed the review was lower than expected but I am glad we decided to watch it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone regardless of age. But first I would recommend that they read the first book in the series in order to understand this one better. The three books are not stand alone.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I mix sound for a rock band and this app is perfect for me. Many times we will discuss tunes to learn and this supplies all the info I need.<br />It is very fast (5-10 seconds typical) when searching and even finds TV shows through their theme music.<br />I highly recommend this to any music buff who racks their mind trying to remember who did a particular tune, when,  and chart rating.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|The 30 pin connector does not fir the new ipads.  I had to buy another adaptor from Best Buy to make it work..
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I enjoy reading up about the Royals past and present. I don't feel the Madonna recieved enough credit for this one. I remember seeing her in Central Park while filming this great work. My hat is off to you Madge! Well Done! Cheers!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was sad to see the google reader go away-- but feedly has been amazing. This app is excellent and syncs with my account perfectly.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I think it may even be better than google reader.  I didn't like some of the views that are the default ....but they can be changed to list view which is what I was accustomed to.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The bag fits the Canon 7D with external battery pack comfortably.  I really like the high quality of the closures and the abundance of pockets to store extras.  Buy it.
B00BXHLM1K|5.0|I listened to this on the radio in New Zealand, we get the Saturday matinee delayed by around 4-6 weeks, was so impressed I had to buy it, the DVD is magnificent, the stage setting blew me away as did the cast, thoroughly recommended
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Very easy to read and fascinating tale of the greatest American to ever live. A must read for every americaan
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game I love it aka their in Paris! This is the best game but one thing I don't like is all the adds for games you wouldn't want its crazy :( I wish the makers didn't have all that . YOU WILL HAVE TO GET THIS GAME !
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It is a fun game with cute graphics from the movie. It does seem a little repetitive after awhile but good entertainment for little ones.
B00DCX08MW|4.0|this thing is a LOT of fun,when i get more practice i will buy the full version,this is on par with the F-18 carrier landing app,and that is a real hoot.
1400049628|5.0|This is a wonderful offering for all hardcore Zombie fans, and especially as a companion to \\"World War Z\\", by the same author. It is one of the most well thought out books in it's genre that I have read. It is presented in a style very similar to actual survival manuals, but given the fictional(hopefully!) subject matter there is some dry humor thrown in here and there. A fun read, from start to finish.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game make you think like a leader<br />And make some new tactics<br />Also to think how to save some money<br />MAXI TRIPLE H
B00CWY76CC|5.0|keepsnme guessing on my toes# cant wait until I can continue on. what's next on floor 11? oh boy check it out!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|You should make it were you are able to do more than just that in the game.e cuz there are better games
B004EPZ0H0|5.0|This is a fascinating story of the development of HeLa cells for medical research, interspersed with chapters on the family story of Henrietta Lacks and her children, in a generally balanced and well researched book. The author's style changes moderately between chapters dealing with the science story and the chapters dealing with the family, which provides a contrast similar to reading two books about the same subject matter at once. For the most part, the changing styles work. HeLa cells are becoming less critical in the study of medical science now than they once were, so I am told, but certianly they deserve their place in history and the woman who unknowingly donated her cancer cells to begin the whole process also deserves to have her otherwise humble life story re-told.
1609611543|2.0|Inordinate time on Celiac disease, not everyday consumer oriented.  Bit radical on suggesting wheat is the root of all obesity and cancer foundation.  Good recipes in the back and final chapter gets to the allowed and bad list.  Only meaningful chapter in the book for me.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book. It really liked that you got so many different points of view. It helps you remember there are many sides to a story. I can not wait to read this to my class.
B005HEW7JG|4.0|Bottom Line: This is a solid series and you could do far worse than to watch this series. While not my favorite series in the Star Trek Franchise, I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />The original Star Trek was intended as sort of a cross between CAPT Cook's journey of exploration and a western set in space. In many ways, this series is a return to that basic premise. Indeed, the CAPT Cook aspect is pretty strong, the Star ship Voyager is transported in space to a quadrant that will take years, maybe even generations to cross.<br /><br />However, unlike CAPT Cook, CAPT Janeway has a mixed crew.  The mission that resulted in her ship being stranded in the Delta Quadrant involved chasing a group of insurgents that are fighting the Federation over a treaty that resulted in them losing their colonies to an alien empire. As the crew progresses they pick up a few strays as well. A Borg that has been separated from the collective. A survivor from a destroyed planet. Last but not least, Tom Paris, a former Starfleet officer, turned insurgent, turned informer, who finally freed from his father's expectations and his failures, becomes one of the most important crew members.<br /><br />While a part of the crew from the beginning, the \\"Doctor\\", an Emergency Medical Holographic (EMH) Program, provides the basis for some very important episodes that address the nature of humanity and reality.<br /><br />Seven of Nine (Jenni Ryan),  a de-assimilated borg, becomes a very interesting character as the series progresses. While I suspect that she was introduced as a character to encourage more teen age boys to watch (Jenni Ryan has a fantastic body and they dress her in skin tight cat suites), she becomes a venue for many interesting stories about what it means to be an adult (she was assimilated by the borg as a young girl and is somewhat immature), what it means to be an individual who is also part of a team, and how one builds meaningful relationships with others.<br /><br />Chakotay is the commander of the insurgents. He becomes CAPT Janeway's first officer. As a former Starfleet CDR, one suspects that he might have been senior to CAPT Janeway until he left Starfleet to become an insurgent and she got promoted to CAPT. One also get the idea that other than the adventure of Starfleet, he had rebelled against authority and becoming the ship's executive officer was not an easy transition for him.<br /><br />Many of the early episodes deal with how the Voyager crew finds fuel and food as they cross the Delta Quadrant.  While helpful to the storyline, they aren't always the best episodes. In my humble opinion, the best episodes are in season six.<br /><br />I recommend this series and will probably watch it again in the future.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. I am looking forward to updates! Keep them coming. Felt like Indiana Jones!  Need some hazards to be real fun.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Kept me guessing all the way through.  Baldacci did his usual great job with this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|one of the rummest game I played in a looonng time. I will recommend it to all my family and friends.
B000FVE3BG|3.0|This watch is way to big, the strap is cheap looking, don't buy this watch because of the deal you are supposedly getting. This watch may look great on the picture but in reality it's huge and the quality is decent at best.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|I had just about given up on horror flicks when this movie first came along. Sure, it's absolute campiness might make one wonder what's so horrible about evil dead creatures? They seem so friendly ...oh wait, only not. I've never wanted to laugh and nearly pee my pants in fear. It's probably the only horror flick that I would recommend to anybody.
0385344333|3.0|I've read them all...multiple times...and Reacher is probably my favorite fiction character.  I have to say this one is just not all that great.  Some strange plot decisions and a somewhat unbelievable ending.  I just didn't get the whole \\"terrorist bank\\" angle. Sorry Mr. Child...this one's a miss compared to your other books.
B0030B621W|5.0|I had never heard about this movie before; I happened upon it by chance. It took me quite a few days to get around to actually watching it, and I am happy that I finally did. Like many of the other reviewers, I thought it would be like A Space Odyssey, but I am happy to say that I was wrong. Even though the movie is basically based inside a campsite based on the moon, it was beautifully done. It has a great story to match as well. Sam Rockwell did a fantastic job playing both of the main characters in this movie and Kevin Spacey's voice is perfect for the character GERTY. On a biased point, I love any movie that puts a light on corporate greed, and the concept in this movie about corporate greed is very believable!<br />This is not an action film. So if you are expecting to see explosions and aliens, you are better off renting Transformers or Aliens. This is a movie that relies on a great story instead of action and it definitely exceeds expectations. I highly recommend this.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Enjoyed immensely. Alexander gives equal time  to both theories. His explanations for both sides are understandable f<br />For a layman as myself.  I highly recommend this book for those who are still searching.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Being a nursing student, I am required to take a Nutrition class. As part of our grade, my professor assigned a paper for the class to do about this movie that counts for a large percent of our grade. I am glad that he did.<br />This movie definitely opens your eyes to what you are actually putting into your mouth. We all know that the food companies are crooked and that they have been treating farmers like crap, but to actually physically see it and hear from the farmers themselves is a whole different ballgame.<br />There is a part in this movie where they are showing you the inside of a cow's stomach, and I just wanted to throw up. And the way that the chickens are raised and how they don't even have the strength to take five steps was just appalling. I am just like everyone else, I put too much trust into food and I need to start paying more attention to what I am actually eating. This film will have you spending a lot more time at the grocery store examining your food, which is a good thing.<br />I am very grateful that there are people out there who are doing all the research for us to put a light on what is really happening in the food industry. I will be recommending this film to people that I know and I hope that everyone else does the same. This is an important film that everyone must see.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Wonder Zoo is pretty cool, but it takes too long to load. and, it costs way too much money to feed dinosaurs food even half likely to come to your zoo. The graphics are cute. I think you should make it so animals get sick. I think that peanuts are too hard to get, and you don,get any when you level up!!! The helicopter idea is cool too, but it costs lots of peanuts for an extra one. They want you to spend money. You can`t buy an iguana unless you have two hundred peanuts! But altogether, I recommend this game.
B0030DL3FU|5.0|I've been running this processor for about 3 years with an ASUS PRO P7P55D-E MotherBd.  I'd recommend this one to anyone that's looking for a solid non-gamer Desktop build.  I'm not a gamer but I use the Desktop several times daily.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is fun. I would recommend it, especially for those who like games like Temple Run. I really like that you can get different characters, but I wish you did not have to pay to activate them each time.
B005K17RU0|1.0|so I updated on July 3rd and now this app does nothing but suck. why on earth did you mess with a good thing? .the new layout sucks, it does nothing but freeze and crash. you cant swipe it, you cant open the maps and its horrid to navigate now. put it back the way it was or change it to something that works.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|That a out all I can say. It truly is the best book ever. I can't wait to read the second book.
B000VX4X22|5.0|The shoes are perfect and they fit exactly as I have desired. I recommend to buy these shoes but for fashion wearing, don't expect them to be a companion on the boats, they are well priced and comfortable, why not wear them on weekends or whenever you want with jeans or chinos.<br /><br />I am happy.
1611761182|3.0|Although my husband and I enjoyed this book, we felt. Book One held our interest more as each of the characters was introduced. We are both in our seventies, thus we were less familiar with WW I than WW II making it more interesting.<br />The second book  also seemed to have much more detail, sometimes too m
B0061S073A|1.0|Somehow while in this app my son STILL managed to default my Kindle to factory settings AND change it to Japanese. So much for letting him use the Kindle if the child lock can't keep him out of the settings.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The plot was good, but there were too many characters to keep in mind, especially with such hard names to pronounce.  I liked the way the author told the events from several characters' point of view.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is an incredibly emotional and wonderfully written book. Khaled is a very insightful and gifted writer.  Highly recommended read.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I was so excited to see another book by this author, I have been waiting a long time and sadly was left a little disappointed. There are too many stories intertwined together in this book to let you really feel for any of the characters and an unsatisfying ending. I still gave it 4 stars because he writes well and so much is still interesting just don't expect the same quality as his other 2 books.
030758836X|5.0|For all those who love a plot with many twists, &#34;Gone Girl&#34; is for you.  It was hard to know who was the &#34;good guy&#34;...
B003WE9TU8|4.0|This book is written as a collection of accounts from various people during World War Z. It gives a shocking and vivid account of the human experience during this apocalyptic nightmare of a scenario. I thought it was well written but got a little repetitive towards the end.<br /><br />I loved how the book gave a view from from different pairs of eyes and addressed the problems faced by mankind dealing with this affliction. If you've seen the film and are expecting a hero centric story you will be disappointed this book isn't written that way, unless you concede we're all heroes when the chips are down. The book doesn't contain the solution in the film and there is no account of reaching WHO headquarters in Wales.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film but it mines the book for details rather than follows any script based on plot. Both the film and book are enjoyable but they do not really tie in as such. The clue is in the title, the book is an oral history of World War Z. The book celebrates the human spirit in times of adversity, it doesn't veil the darker parts of our psyche but is extremely thought provoking. You cannot read this without thinking what would I do?<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of zombie films or books but this one caught my imagination and although not as enjoyable to read as The Passage by Justin Cronin I think there's definitely material here for a sequel of the film.
B004LP3AYI|1.0|I have been waiting to download this book for two months now!  I find it hard to believe that a book that has been on the market for years is this hard to edit.  After reading the first in this series, I was ready and eager to dig into the second…. But again, though I have been trying for almost two months, it STILL isn't available to download!  VERY frustrating!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|after I got the hang of how the game is played, it quickly became one of my favorites.  look forward to new levels!!!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is very fun and addictive. I play it every chance I get. It's exciting to get new dragons.
0061733199|5.0|Very happy with this purchase.  I only have pros to report.<br />The book has more content than I expected.<br />The pages are (waxed?) allowing the book to be a bit water or dew resistant.<br />Plenty of pictures and illustrations.<br /><br />Again, very happy with this purchase.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|This is a nice game but the devs needed to do a little better at the flight system. In other words this game is very fun for people that like flying planes.
B0089LOG02|3.0|Was interesting subject matter but a bit hard to follow in beginning, going from past to present and back again.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I usually enjoy Nicholas Sparks books and this was no exception.  Although the storyline was frustrating at times and somewhat predictable, the characters were likable and there were a few surprises.  I thought the ending was a bit over-the-top, but I still would recommend the book. I especially enjoy the depiction of the southern town and the caring people there. This makes a great book to bring to the beach or on an airplane trip.  It won't disappoint.
B000HL093A|5.0|not for the faint of heart....non stop action....thrill ride of sensory-overload....masterfully acted on all counts....fast paced tarantino-written screenplay....oliver stone directing at his best...simply amazing
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Like Fringe JJ Abrams hit a home run with this TV show and I miss the action, suspense, and cast.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Use this on my Kindle Fire, and it is the most useful app I have.  I always know exactly how much time I have left, whether it is for reading, games, online use, or watching videos.  The amount of customizable information makes it even better.  This app is the BEST app you'll own!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the movie so I read the book. Impressively better to say the least. Going to purchase the second right now.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game IS have trouble putting it down.<br />ore games lime tbi&szlig; it reminds me of the nancy drew mysterys. I couldntget enoughof them<br />!<br /><br />!!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app is really loud. I have a big house and it still wakes up my brother and his room is far 15 feet away from mine.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Is book galvanized me to offer to mentor young women in my firm, especially those in an office with no senior women who may not be having an optimal experience.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I LOVE Neil Gaiman's books, and this one did not disappoint. As soon as they are in paperback, I hope to buy a classroom set for my students.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|My kids could not be happier!  Easy to blow up and so much fun to watch them.  Highly recommended for the toddler/ Pre-k age group!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This use to work on my kindle fire but now it just spools and doesn't load locks up or lets me review a few items and then locks up!  So frustrated cant find another facebook app that works either!  Makes me want to get an ipad instead!
B000AXWV40|5.0|i dont think this is the best westbound funkadelic album, but it the most solid therefore more appealing to non funkers. can you get to that?
B00AZMFO6I|2.0|One couldn't ask for a better cast of distinguished actors. Maggie Smith looks lovely. Tom Courtenay gives a wonderful performance. The direction by Dustin Hoffman was ok.  The English countryside scenery was beautiful. The operatic singing was beautiful. There was a touching love story where Maggie Smith's and Tom Courtenay's characters realized they truly loved each other.  There was a happy ending.  What I didn't like were all the fart jokes, crazy skirt chasing, vulgar swearing, peeing jokes and trying to \\"make-it-real\\" meanness the characters showed. Did like the overall message that if you aren't having any fun you need to adjust your attitude, no matter what your age.  Life is fun and it holds surprises.  That doesn't mean we have to stoop to the same sophomoric humor they use to sell \\"American Pie\\".
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that more people should have this game because of the the new version<br />it let's you light stuff on fire and make cake. But only one thing that I want was for this to be free.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I found it very hard to set up. Was very disappointed with the game - it wasn't very interesting and too time consuming...Stick with Angry Birds.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Watched with my grandkids and was not expecting much, (The Wizard of Oz is in the top 5 of my all time favorites), I have to say I thoroughlly enjoyed this film!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Really enjoy this game, I like the different birds and being able to crash into something other than pigs...enjoy the challenge of trying to hit a moving target.
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|A fun tower defense that has moderately complex strategy and placement. Plenty of challenges later on at higher difficulties.<br />Lots of levels
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|The game was very easy and not challenging. Not up to the usual Angry Birds standards. I was very disappointed.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|An unusual tale, told in the first person, of a boy who discovers his grandfather's tales are all true after a series of fantastical adventures.  The book ends with many unanswered questions that make the reader eager for the next installment!  Can't wait to see how the characters fare!  A good read.
B00008ADPF|5.0|Well I have to say this is one of the best rock albums that I have heard.In my opinion this is Nickelback in their prime. Buy it you will love this album if you love this band. This album overall is one of Nickelback's heaviest albums. The Long Road is way better than the All The Right Reasons album. \\"Flat on the floor\\" is a very hard punching song. \\"Feelin' way too damn good\\" is the song that got radio play and we all know.\\"Another Hole In the Head\\" is a great song that could have should have gotten radio play and has a great riff. \\"Throw yourself away\\" is a heavy rocking song too. \\"Figured you out\\" is a great riff and is another song you will love if you like Nickelback. \\"Because of you\\" is another heavy hard song that has a great riff and great singing that represents Nickelback's youth ful sound
0061726834|4.0|When I read the description of this book I had a flashback of the Pretties series by Scott Westerfeld. In Lena's world adolescence is measured in the number of days until her 18th birthday when she can finally accept the cure and become one of the masses who will never be plagued with the heartache that befalls people in love. She thinks the most important day of her life is when she goes for the evaluation that chooses the path of her life from the moment she completes the procedure. She will have a husband chosen from her, a college handpicked for her, and the number of children dictated to her. She will have to make zero choices and live a life of blissful ignorance and a numbing lack of strong emotions.<br /><br />Then she meets Alex. Her whole world gets turned upside down and the government she has known all her life starts to be questioned. She wonders whether the procedure is truly as good as everyone who has undergone it claims it to be. As her feelings for Alex grow, her faith her dystrophic society sway. How can she give up the boy she loves for a life she thought she wanted, but isn't so sure of now?<br /><br />This book was pretty much what I expected of it. There were a few surprises along the way but it was pretty predictable from the beginning. That does not, by any means, mean it was boring or made me cry any less. I am a softy when it comes to love stories and especially when there are obstacles for the couple to overcome. This is no lock of obstacles for Alex and Lena, that's for sure.<br /><br />The end of the book leaves the reader on a cliffhanger. What will become of all my favorite characters? Hana? Lena? Alex? Gracie? I can't wait to pick up the next book and delve back into the world Oliver created for Lena and Alex.<br /><br />Review Posted on: [...]
B005VPXR3Q|4.0|I really enjoyed it. In my opinion Stephen King has a lot of very remarkable  talent.  Kathy Bates and James Caan certainly brought the movie to life. They were the perfect actors for the part.there was a lot of talent in this movie.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels!  Having said that, I did not expect this book to be as good, but hoped that it would be a delightful extension to the original.<br /><br />To be honest, it did have it's moments, but on the whole, it seemed to have problems with pacing...too wordy in some areas and wrapped up too quickly in other areas.<br /><br />I belong to a book club that chose to read it.  The group was divided over it...about half of the group didn't like it, about a quarter loved it and the other quarter were on the fence.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Well written, with a pace that makes it hard to put down. Like the best science fiction, this story is thought provoking and provides insight into a fantastic world. I would strongly recommend this book to any friend looking for a good read on a summer day.
B001DJLCRC|1.0|A very good friend of ours told us that this was his favorite series ever.  We usually respect his judgment on things but this time it was a bomb.  My husband and I both hated it!
1594204217|5.0|The book is informative, entertaining, another must-read for people who are are invested in learning all they can about what they put on the table.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|This was purchased as a birthday gift -it was perfect and the price was right. This was very easy shopping.
1849531986|5.0|My hubby loved this book. He said he could relate to every page. He said it should win the Nobel Prize because of how many men can relate to it. Definitely a page-turner. ;D
B005HSL626|4.0|I got the app for my 4 year old grandson and he likes it.  I have not played it as of yet
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read all of the author's books and they have all been great reads. In every book I get very attached to the characters.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|The book was fun, but I haven't read the author's other work so there were parts where I was a bit lost in terms of the expanded post-Nemesis universe.....(New officers in relationships with regular characters, marriages, things like that). There's also a big of a slog through the middle where everything is told from the POV of Noonien Soong.<br /><br />The writing is pretty good and the story is interesting.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|My husband loved it. It really works and the knives get sharp in a few minutes. Well done product and with a good price
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This app is amazing and it is a ton of fun to play for the whole family. It is easy to play that my 3 year old son can enjoy.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Thank you for sending me a new charger.  It worked great. Must have been a defective initial charger.  Thank you

B003VPWXRO|5.0|This really is an amazing story. I laughed, cried and was utterly amazed in Portia's story. This is a great read.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|i think this might be a good movie for mothers or mothers-to-be but i didnt much care for it. it wasnt as funny as i thought it would be :/ the acting was fine enough but it just seemed to be lacking something
B000641D2Y|3.0|Sort of a loose copy of the first movie in the series, but still has some funny scenes and touching moments. Adults and not-too impressionable children would have fun with this movie.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Works wonderfully on  my android phone & Kindle Fire HD! WOuld recommend highly to anyone. Never have a problem with it
B0012HF5NC|5.0|This movie is exciting, scary, fun and campy all rolled into one, with some great one-liners and memorable scenes. Plus it's full of wonderful actors. For Sci-Fi and Disaster film buffs, this is a must see.
B007SGM084|5.0|I choose this rate because you are a great writer and I truly enjoyed this book .

B006FE83UE|5.0|One of my favorite, all-time movies, that embodies the innocence of childhood, the grace of Southern Charm, and the horrors of racism as we follow three children, two whose father has been assigned to defend a black man accused of beating and raping a young, white woman. It's a story of dignity as Atticus Finch, an honest God-fearing man and father, takes seriously his role to prove the accused as being innocent, and the respect with which he treats the accused and his family.<br /><br />In the meantime, we follow the lives of the three children during one summer, one who is a summer visitor and based on the life of Truman Capote, who was a neighbor of the story's author Harper Lee. The big mystery for the children is, who lives in the big, old scary house down the block? Their goal in life that summer is to find out who lives there. Most of us who grew up in the era where we had a lot of freedom to play outside and didn't have any fear about it will not only relate to the things those kids get into, but the horror that one hateful,white racist tries to do to Atticus through his children.<br /><br />Even though this is seen through the eyes of children, I wouldn't recommend it for children, especially young children---it could cause nightmares. Gregory Peck's finest role.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Works great. This does help with the underwater pics. We will be buying more from you soon.. Thank you thank you
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Mysterious, plot-twisting, funny and romantic movie where an average guy manages to get himself mixed up in a murder plot of national significance. One of my favorite Cary Grant movies that will keep you guessing until the end. A must see for old movie buffs, Hitchcock and Cary Grant fans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is not just another mindless way to pass time. This game actually makes you think in order to solve puzzles and escape each board. It is fun and increasingly challenging.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|One of the their best season. Some one is getting married sorry not telling who or when, just watch and find out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its a great game because it has lots of clues puzzles and lots of mind thinking in this game it's great

B008HJGPVO|5.0|Worth the money - you get what you pay for where a Stylus is concerned.  The group packaged stylus sets last about a week a piece.
1250012570|5.0|Plot: 8/10<br />Characters: 10/10<br />Setting: 10/10<br />Pacing: 10/10<br />Style: 10/10<br />Cover: 7/10<br /><br />Pros: I absolutely loved Rainbow Rowell's writing style. The conversations between Eleanor and Park were always creative and witty. Characters were believable and raw...the author has definitely captured what goes on in a teenagers mind!<br /><br />Cons: I did not like the ending at all....I really would have liked to know what happened to them.<br /><br />Verdict: This book is a great read! Its funny and awkward and heartbreaking all at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have recommended it to my daughter as well since I'm sure she will be able to relate to Eleanor.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this CD and have played it over and over.  It's a great CD to pop in while I am driving to the coast.

0307352153|2.0|I'm very disappointed. This book is the first book I've read where I really wondered about the endorsements. Cain has a vendetta against extroverts that just doesn't stop. She treats introverts as if they are the finest, untapped gifts of the universe, and she treats extroverts as if their behaviors are intentionally hurtful and sometimes even malicious. ...and I'm a high introvert and find that this consistent thread throughout the book diminishes her credibility.<br /><br />There are repeated assumptions about the introvert population that are false and directly conflict with the various studies and authors (such as Jung) that she uses to justify her claims. Cain/s reviews of studies make it clear that she is picking and choosing only the parts that support her thesis at the moment. If readers believe her words about introverts, they are going to make many assumptions about their family, friends, and colleagues that are harmful to the relationship.<br /><br />I understand that this is &#34;pop psychology&#34; however, I wish the author had taken a more balanced approach. In my opinion, the book is a few hundred pages of extrovert bashing. Hopefully, her nonstop attacks on extroverts will be a heads-up to readers to question the credibility of the author's assertions.
0307346609|2.0|This was not my favorite book to read. It actually took me more than one month to read, which is not something I tend to do.<br /><br />I felt that at times it was confusing because it would just jump from one even and/or person to another without specifying whom said what.<br /><br />Either way, I will be watching the movie to see if I like it better.
B00821OX98|2.0|It's a little silly and unsophisticated. It's about on par with your average tv miniseries. Reasonably well acted. Thin story line.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Very much enjoying my Hogwarts film fest. All the movies are here, complete. No frills. Simple DVD version, in a single box. Sometimes the simple things are the best. This is one of those times.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|its great for free. never played too much so I'm learning on this and the difficulty level adjustment is great.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I loved the avengers film (rented via Love Film) but did not want to buy without at least a directors commentary, preferably an extended cut.<br /><br />After research, the extended cut seems unlikely to be released in the near future (USA or UK) but I decided to order the Region 1 Blu-ray disc, fully expecting to have to sacrifice a PC drive change to play region 1 films (Disney said it should be playable in the UK, but I took that to mean using multi-region players). I am happy to report that the disc plays in at least Regions 1 & 2 on my Samsung internal drive!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I had to read it because I loved his first two books.  I enjoyed this one but do not consider it on par with the other two.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|An interesting, but troubling story that leaves far more questions than it answers.  Why does Andy so defiantly defend Jacob?  What happens to Laurie that drives her to her disastrous choice?
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I just started playing ten minutes ago and I am on level 5.  I am sitting waiting  for my daughter to complete and this is a great way to wait! Good choice. I don't know what to do at first or what I needed., but it became clear after a minute. Glad I downloaded this. Hope you enjoy.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|ever since the new update the game has reload each time all 59mb of if. makes me not want to play it
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Unlike other similar games, this one is worth the money once you complete the free portion. Only a few freezes. Well developed.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it!  It really makes you think.  It doesn't just give you obvious clues.  You have to be a sleuth at heart to appreciate this game.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|A wonderful continuation of this series! If you thought you loved Ender's soul before just wait until you read this book.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Her music is enduring.  Now have 3 of her CDs and enjoy them all.  Will buy another when she brings out a new one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is hands down my favorite book of all time. I read this when I was 13 and I fall in love every time I re-read it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like how you can unlock different characters. I like how the further in the game you go the more challenging the game becomes.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Now then, alot of people complain about this movie. \\"Its not deep\\", \\"It's Cliche'd\\" \\"style over substance\\". And is it any of those things? Yes, it's all of them and more. BUT IT'S FUN! It's not the greatest film in the world, It's not the next godfather or goodfellas, but it wasn't trying to be like those films. It was trying to be an all out good time, and by god, did it succeed. If you want \\"the godfather\\", Go watch \\"the godfather\\",but if you want true old school gangster action, go watch this film.<br /><br />  Granted, I've actually never watched the godfather, or scar face, and the closest I got to watching good fellas was Animaniacs, but those are on my to watch list. In fact, the only other gangster movie I saw was \\"Johnny Dangerously\\", which is hilarious by the way. But still, I think that this was a good place to start.<br /><br />  True, this film isn't accurate when it comes to the real life story of the \\"gangster squad\\" and Mickey Cohen, but it's a film. A ton of other \\"Based On A True Story\\"  films are pure BS, so what makes this any different?<br /><br />  When it comes down to it, this is a film that you just have to take it for what it is, and what it is, is entertaining as hell. Plus, this film actually makes Ryan Gosling Badass, and that is a nearly impossible task to do.<br /><br />  But that's just my opinion, You'res may be different, and if it is, it is wrong.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|This game reminds me of the old arcade game Galaxian or Space Invaders. This is actually a good thing because I loved both games. I like the elements of all the power-ups and shields. And the different maneuver modes are good too. Lots of action.
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger Games is an incredible achievement for the arts.<br /><br />From the incredible direction and very applicable special effects to very touching and believable writing. The loss of the beautiful, little girl and the resolution of the winning couple (to die together, rather than comply), were both heartbreaking, breath-taking moments in this futuristic drama.<br /><br />Strangely the music scoring was incredibly marginal and the closing songs should have tormented some other movie. I don't see any record-breaking sales in the Hunger Games soundtracks release. I actually watched the entire end credits and turned the background songs down...and then mute.<br /><br />Hunger Games deserved a Henry Mancini-quality score and at least one commercial hit.<br /><br />A final thought for the thinking, coherent minority...<br /><br />Like other futuristic scenario movies, Hunger Games is delusion-ally optimistic projection of our future...considering the reality of \\"the convergence of crises\\" just ahead, coming right to us.
B00D1HC8VS|5.0|This was always one of my favorite Wings Albums. I wore the cassettes out twice. I've been waiting for this re-release on CD. Brings back many fond memories - driving my Alfa with the tape deck blasting!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Nice to see a storyline that is not a Hollywood formula movie.  Touches of  humor throughout, lots of fantasy and great CGI effects.  I like movies that leave you wondering and open the door for discussion with fellow viewers.
B0001I561E|5.0|Kids love it.  I love it--wish more were made like this.  Everyone encouraged to see t and smile or a while.
038533348X|4.0|While staring out the window of our rental house at the rainy beach, I grabbed this book from the shelf in our bedroom. I was a bit ashamed that I'd lived 39 years and never read any Vonnegut. I laughed out loud at times. Great read. I love his humor and thinly-veiled social commentary.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I don't care that people say I don't think you should get the app. I love this app its amazing and it alway gets the answer right!!!!  Stop writing bad reviews!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0019NG73G|5.0|Everyone has a tradition or two in their back pocket. My tradition is watching this superlative blu-ray release every 4th of July. Like so many other viewers, I was introduced to this story of the great battle by Michael Shaara's classic novel \\"The Killer Angels\\" [[ASIN:0345433726 The Civil War Trilogy: Gods and Generals / The Killer Angels / The Last Full Measure]] - the title alone is enough to draw the reader in. And the follow-up novels penned by his son, Jeff, although not in the same pantheon as his father's book, are mandatory reading for any Civil War enthusiast.<br /><br />\\"Lucky\\" movies has scenes or dialog/acting that stick in the memory year after year. For me, \\"Gettysburg\\" is blessed with several memorable moments: 1) A defiant Martin Sheen's as General Lee (who referred to his Union adversaries as \\"those people\\"), admonishing the truant Jeb Stuart (did he lose the battle for Lee?) with his curt dismissal of Stuart with \\"we will not speak of this again\\", but more potently, Lee giving Pickett (Stephen Lang) a new assignment for his division after the infamous charge when Pickett answers with a breaking heart \\"General, I have no division\\", and the look on Lee's  face at his belated realization of the horrible mistake he made.<br /><br />Not to be forgotten are Jeff Daniels as Col. Chamberlain, Tom Berenger as the reluctant Longstreet, Sam Eliot's memorable turn as the calm and confident Buford, the touching performance of Richard Jordan as General Armistead that firmly anchors the film in an era of sentimental words and thoughts when men were not ashamed to weep at nostalogic songs or poetry, or lace paper valentines, or exchange coffee and tobacco with their enemies during the lulls between battles.<br /><br />\\"Gettysburg\\" is the perfect tribute to the valiant warriors of 1863, and to the memory of Michael Shaara whose essential novel helped to keep the memory alive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not too frustrating. Gets harder as you go along. Have not had any bugs or problems with the game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is one of those books I would never have read if I hadn't been going on a loooong plane journey. And for that, it was perfect: addictive, not requiring too much brain power to follow the twists and turns. I was hooked early on, and read voraciously until the (yes, annoying) end.<br /><br />Having said that, this is also one of those books I ended up cursing, because it could have been so good if it hadn't gone so badly wrong. Still reading? Okay, here are my gripes, and they do contain spoilers, so you've been warned!<br /><br />1.) Amy. Yes, she was fun to hate, but ultimately she was irritatingly unbelievable. You all know the term Mary Sue? Well, Amy is the anti-Mary Sue: so good at being bad that I stopped believing in her long before the book finished. Don't get me wrong, I love the Amy's-a-sociopath twist as a concept, and didn't even find it predictable. But as it played out, Amy's character became more and more impossible. No one is good at everything, yet Amy is apparently knock-out gorgeous, MENSA smart, and so charming that no one ever questions the certifiably bizarre things that happen to her. She's able to get the best of everybody, all the time, and I think that's why the book's ending annoyed so many people, including me. It's not just that we expect the villain to get her just deserts, it's that she doesn't even have to struggle not to get them.<br /><br />2.) Amy's parents. Never mind that their bestselling book series would never get off the ground in Real Life, how can two well-educated psychologists fail to notice that their daughter is a sociopath? Even allowing for a bit of denial, given their stillbirth history, it's hard to believe they never noticed anything weird about their daughter's recurrent victimhood. Parents know when something's not right, and parents of sociopaths generally admit to having known, even if they never spoke up before the proverbial s--- hit the fan.<br /><br />3.) Amy's disguise. So she dyed her hair, put on glasses and gained a few pounds. The woman is all over national T.V., and more to the point, the people in the hotel admit to watching the news stories about her. They are suspicious of her and ultimately steal a lot of money from her. Did they seriously never click that this was Amy?<br /><br />4.) Amy's planned suicide. Really? I mean, REALLY? This woman would never actually kill herself over a cheating husband. What would be the point? Where would her satisfaction in revenge come from if she dies as well? Makes no sense.<br /><br />5.) Desi. Another apparently clueless victim. Yeah, he thinks she's hot and he's a bit neurotic to boot. But again, no suspicion of her after what went down with them in boarding school, and what he knows went down when she framed her husband for murder?<br /><br />6.) The fingerprints on the stuff in the shed. Amy hauled all of that stuff up to the bedroom and put her husband's fingerprints all over it and he never woke up? What about the forensic guys - wouldn't they see that these things had not been handled in the way a real, waking person would handle them?<br /><br />7.) The crowning glory, the pregnancy. First of all, she got pregnant mighty fast. But second, and most important, I can't see how she would ever have been able to do it without her husband knowing. I've been through infertility treatments. Unless you've signed something, both partners have to sign off on everything, every step of the way. So yes, I think in the end that the conclusion was a dirty trick.<br /><br />And so - an entertaining read, but so very, annoyingly flawed!
B005LAIHGI|3.0|Warning! Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />There is some funny slap-stick humor. For example, when Aladeen (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) was told to take the garbage out. He took the garbage bin and...<br /><br />There is also some dark humor. For instance, the scene where Aladeen looked at the window of a store in New York, talking to himself \\"Why is this happening to me? All I ever did were stealing my country's wealth and executing people who disagreed with me. Why does it always happen to the good guy?\\" (I don't remember the exact words but these are very close to what he said.)<br /><br />However, it's very difficult to rate this movie because of its extremities. It vividly illustrates the word \\"extreme\\". Yes, many of the jokes are so over-the-top that they were either very funny or very disturbing.<br /><br />Case in point, at the 31st minute,in the grocery store named Free Earth Collective, he made politically incorrect comments and jokes that might deeply offend women and immigrants.<br /><br />Another example, at the 53rd minute, in the grocery store, he made fun of one of the taboo subjects that might cause extreme discomfort.<br /><br />The scene when he helped with delivering the baby was too much for me. At first, instead of helping the woman, he tried to have sex with her! To me, it looked like a rape attempt. It's very disturbing. Then he spent hours trying to deliver the baby and talking on the phone at the same time. It's disgusting.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this film:<br /> Production Budget: $65 million<br />Domestic:  $59,650,222<br />+ Foreign:  $117,897,130<br />= Worldwide:  $177,547,352<br /><br />So, it's a big flop in North America. It lost about 5 millions. However, it made a profit of $111 million dollars overseas. That's a huge amount.<br /><br />Because of all the reasons above, I gave it 3 stars.
0345803507|5.0|awesome bookl!!  a must have!!  this is the 43rd book of the 3 part series!  HURRY run out and get it!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is excellent it has all the thing you'd want in a gaming mouse, High dpi, Customizable buttons, cool LED lights and it just feels good in your hands.<br />There aren't really any bad things about this mouse. The only thing i would like to change is where the scroll wheel is it is a bit low to what im used to but it still works. One of the best gaming mouse out there for a very affordable price.
B00AB16ER6|5.0|The Winery Dogs are the latest supergroup consisiting of drum wizzard Mike Portnoy, bassist extrordinaire Billy Sheehan and funky guitarist virtuoso Richie Kotzen.<br />These guys mesh together like a fine wine and provide an fresh vintage of hard rock. The end result is much better IMHO than Black Country Communion. Kotzen's funky compositions, Sheehan's crazy base lines and Portnoy's manic drumming are a tour-de-force for the ears! Standout tracks include- Elevate, Criminal, Damaged and The Dying.  Fans of Glenn Hughes, Soundgarden, Mother's Finest will love this. Definately worth a TASTE (i.e. LISTEN).
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very well written drama with twist...I couldn't put it down. Was very shocked with the ending and how it finally ended.
1612930425|4.0|I sincerely believe this classic is inescapable. Every reader (or at least every female reader) will read this book at some point of their lives, if only to find out why everyone seems to love Mr Darcy. I speak from experience. No, really. I made a vow to myself in fifth grade that I'd never touch that book unless I'm forced. Yet here I am, years later, answering the question on if reading the thing is actually worth it. Does the book live up to all the hype and fuss?<br /><br />In a word, yes.<br /><br />The story is about Elizabeth Bennet, a girl who's ahead of her times in terms of marriage. Throughout the book, you see her say no to the proposals of two prosperous men, groan over how floozy her sister Lydia's getting, ship her other sister Jane and Mr Bingley more avidly than any fan girl, and exchange witty remarks about it all with her (awesome) dad. Oh, and she also melts the Ice King Mr Darcy's heart (after bashing it to pieces, of course) and finds true love.<br /><br />Basically, it's a romance novel. But it's such a funny, witty one that you barely even notice.<br /><br />What I love most about the story is the characters. If I wrote down the entire plot, most people, including myself, would find it boring. But here's the thing. Austen made her characters so real - ridiculously, wickedly, hilariously real - that you just can't help but root for them. Their development is by far the best part. And I admit it, I squealed and danced around the room in Mr Darcy's second proposal. I'm happy to report he's nothing like Edward Cullen.<br /><br />My main complaint about the story is that for all the competence and character-building of Lizzie Bennet, she does nothing at the climax of the story. Granted, there was nothing that she could do - women didn't have that much power back then, and I guess it was enough that she wasn't actually the one in trouble - but it still annoyed me. The protagonist should do something. It's pretty much a rule.<br /><br />Still, it was a great book; its highlights were its fun dialogue, absorbing characters, and the ironic, flowing Jane Austen voice. Recommended for anyone who likes a nice, if sappy story about love of all kinds.
B0062YADWI|3.0|I bought this as a key-chain.  It is much more solid and stronger than the round ( cross-section ) type carabiner.  It holds 25 pounds with no sign of flexing.  The clip-lock has a nice tightness.  I haven't tried more weight, but I'm not a tester.  I couldn't figure out where it was made, so I assumed it was China.  We can't make this here in the USA?  It is just metal after all.
0786838655|4.0|When I first had the book in my hands, I stuffed it in the back of my bookshelf like the unwanted birthday gift that it was. And there it may have stayed, unloved and un-cherished, if fate hadn't intervened in the form of homework procrastination.<br /><br />My cousin found me on my bedroom floor a few hours after I looked at the first page, huddled up and reading like my life depended on it. The story had yanked me by the collar and pulled me in like a Cerberus grabbing a chew toy. It had everything! Friendship, adventure, an oh-so-snarky protagonist, you name it. (Except for romance. But he's twelve in this book, and the world's probably better off with less romance novels anyway.)<br /><br />Percy Jackson thought he was a normal kid. Then his math teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him, and things get weirder from there. All of a sudden he gets attacked by a minotaur, his mom goes missing, and his best friend-turned-satyr plops him in Camp Half-Blood, the only place in the world where it's safe for the children of Greek gods (who are alive and kicking, by the way). When Zeus accuses Percy of stealing his lightning bolt - just his luck - he and his friends must find the relic before an all-out war can begin.<br /><br />What can I say? I loved it. It's everything a story should be. It's even what I like to call a `break-in book'; the kind of book that people would enjoy even if they don't like to read, or better yet, gets people to start reading. The best part is definitely Riordan's voice; his witty, hilarious monologues endear Percy's world to anyone who reads them.<br /><br />It does have its fall-backs, however. I didn't really feel all that much in the emotional scenes; in some cases, I guess it was a tad anti-climactic. And while the story's nice, there weren't many themes we could learn from. I don't like my books being preachy, but let's face it, the best stories are the kinds that teaches their readers something, too; and this book just doesn't have that. (It did, however, teach me an impressive amount of Greek mythology that dazzled my teachers.)<br /><br />Other than that, the book is awesome. I'd recommend it to readers and non-readers alike. By the way, for the record the only reason why I didn't want to read this book at first was because of the cover of the one I got. I know the saying, but still. Tacky tag-lines? Strange horned thing wearing underwear? Gah.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subwaysurfers is the best game ever because it gives you missions that you really want to beat.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This storyline fills in a lot of details & background that lead into the original Wizard of Oz, and it does so wonderfully & magical.  If you were unable to enjoy this movie, you need to get on Prozac or something.
0425263924|5.0|The passion that is displayed by these two characters is what most humans are missing. If there was a choice between having money or passion I believe passion would win! Its one thing that money can not buy!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I like a good old shoot em up bang bang movie, and with Arnold it is just the ticket, of course it is predictable, but it has some twists and turns....I like when Arnold..........
B00130UFY2|4.0|Had to complete the series by getting the 3rd Bourne movie.  These are so action-packed and engaging, and Matt Damon does a great job with the role.  They are worth buying, because each time I watch, I catch a few more details that weave his story together.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for the next Season (4) to be available!!!<br />Characters are portrayed as if you are living in that time.

B008MEM24S|1.0|Wow. I really wanted this game but it costs money and I only get free games. Why is it only free on iphones, ipads, and tablets.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|The main story itself was good. However, I could of done with out the over exaggerated vocabulary when talking about the book within the book. At times I felt the author went thesaurus happy. I did however love Augustus and grace. Their characters were believable and made you see things in a way healthy people rarely do.

0312330537|4.0|The country India is the main character in this long and semi-autobiographical novel. I was blown away by the start of this book. Lin (his alias) has escaped from an Australian jail and looks to hide in the mass of humanity that is India. I have never been to India, but feel I have after reading that start of this novel. Great language and insights. I loved the first half. Each scene and each character seemed so real and engaging. Lin is turning his life around, and it's an inspiring story. He falls in love with a woman, a people, and a way of life in a country. This did not have the tightness of most novels, and feels more like a memoir in its meandering pace. That was okay for the first 400 pages. I especially loved when Lin moved to the ghetto of Bombay and stumbled into running a free medical clinic for the poor, in spite of his lack of any formal medical training. Memorable stuff. The second half of the novel lost me. I was less interested in the story and the people, and I confess that I skimmed much of this. Yet this is the first novel that I did not read completely which I still rated with 4 stars. That's because the first half is so engaging and fresh.
B00DB31Y3U|3.0|Yeah, I know its shorter than the previous game, but its still enjoyable. It still doesnt seem to offer anything new besides new background  and helicopter. The levels are pretty much the same. I feel like its not the best game, but one to play when youre bored.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|This isn't my first purchase of AKG headphones. The first time I went with the AKG brand, I picked up a pair of their earbuds (don't remember which kind)... big mistake. The quality was garbage and the sound quality was lacking. I picked these up because I saw the lower price tag ($255? c'mon), and while it is the most I have ever spent on a pair of headphones, these things are GLORIOUS! Forget the 400+ hour \\"wear-in\\" time you may read about, these things sounded amazing out of the box; they may not have had an adequate setup. I personally have a digital out going from my PC to an Onkyo receiver and then the headphones are plugged into the 6.3mm jack on the receiver. With this, I'd say I'm getting the crisp sound that AKG promotes from these headphones. While this setup wasn't what I was initially intending them for (was planning to bring them to work... probably won't be happening now), the sound quality achievable from this things is truly incredible. If you're considering them and have other high-quality sound equipment with which to connect them to, it won't be a waste of your money.<br /><br />10/10 Highly recommend

B008XG1X18|3.0|I have a kindle fire and had heard about pinterest so i got the app. At first i loved it. There's so many cool thing on it, but after the first day i would go select something to pin or look at it and it would send me back to the first page i started on. Super annoying!! Then i would have to track my way back to where i was and it would happen again. Most of my time was spent looking for what i already found and getting frustrated. I love pinterest but hate glitches.<br /><br />Another issue i have found is that sometimes when i follow a link from a pin, it doesnt have what it says in the caption. Sometimes it's advertisements or only has pictures that should have a recipe or step by step instructions. If the glitches were fixed and there was a little more quality control on links I would definitely give five stars.

B006WQLH7G|5.0|i have to say I gave Avast a full 5 stars because this in my opinion is one of the Best if not the Best internet security companies out here. I personally have been using Avast Platinum Edition for the past 8 yrs and I have NEVER had one single problem. My computer is protected and I have no worries. This is also very affordable, and that is something that we all need in this day and age. I would say try the free 30 day trial that they offer! I don't think you will be disappointed . Oh and one more thing, you can get this regardless if it's your home,school,or office, I would recommend this to everyone!!
B00AF82WTO|5.0|May not hold to the book as closely as other film adaptations, but the acting is good for the most part and you get the best of the book's intentions. Like Miss Austen's novels, I always wish the happily-ever-after lasted longer.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|To use this app to full potential, one should use it along with the full program on a laptop or PC. It is great to use as a keeper of notes from the web as well as from meetings and other sources of information. It allows for tags and folders to better organize information across different types of electronic devices. Highly recommended!

1400052181|3.0|Brief Summary: Reporter Rebecca Skloot tells the improbable story of a woman, her cells, and the plethora of scientific discovery her cells have led to--all shadowed by the racism and medical neglect that allowed the science to happen in the first place.<br /><br />The Tsundoku Scale: Middle of the Pile, 6 out of 10.<br /><br />The Good: Foremost, this is an important book; it tells a story that needs, and most certainly deserves, to be told. What science has discovered through the HeLa cancer cells, taken from the tumor of a black woman named Henrietta Lacks, is mind-boggling. From curing Polio to finding new drugs to combat cancer, these cells have found there way into everything--and Skloot successfully captures the magical allure of these cells. What's more, she is able to effectively connect these cells to the people behind them, and bring to the forefront the pitfalls of cold, unrestrained eugenically based science. The irony is not lost on Skloot, nor the reader for that matter, that some of the most important cells in scientific history, have come from a black person. She does not overlook the fact that a black people, enslaved and persecuted by whites for never being \\"good enough,\\" somehow end up being more than \\"good enough\\" to significantly improve science, and to drastically improve all of humanity's chance for a better, disease-free life. Skloot's call for justice for the Lackses rings clearly and passionately throughout the novel.<br /><br />The Bad: Though this book has essential, revealing research, it is not a great book. It's just a good one. Skloot's urgent mission to tell the true story of Henrietta loses its pull as the novel progresses. The story alternates from a non-fiction narrative on Henrietta, her cells, and their history, to Skloot's own personal investigative research on the Lcks family--but the two stories do not mesh well. One scene in particular is a prime example where Skloot curses out Henrietta's daughter Deborah. For though the scene emphasizes Skloot's frustrations and Deborah's own insecurities, it ultimately ends up feeling clumsy and disconnected. The reader can clearly understand the toll the research has taken both on Skloot's subjects, and on Skloot herself from the simple curse. Nonetheless, she continues to explain what the scene means, and in over-explaining, she diminishes the power of the scene. More often than not, Skloot leans towards being too obvious in her approach, continually telling rather than showing her story to the reader, which takes away some of the story's luster.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It is an excellent book. It moves slow in the beginning and hops around a bit too much, but not enough to make it a bad read.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love how it was written from the guys perspective, made me laugh multiple times. I cannot wait for the second book to come out!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|It was so complex and the language hurt my ears.  It could of been a great movie, just take out the nastiness and make the plot work.  I expected so much more out of a Tom Hanks movie,  His acting is supurb but he chose to please the world and add the bad language and disgusting acts.It took a way from his genius preformance.
B00BTHWFEC|3.0|Like many, I had been waiting for this one for too long. Has it been a disappointment? No. The production, as everyone says, is perfect. Ozzy's singing is incredibly fine, and the songs have the good old feeling of the first 3 albums, altough a little polished mostly with the help of the production, and more refined, which is a good thing. BUT... with all due respect to Ozzy, Geezer and Tony, who touched my life with their music for decades, plus with all due respect to their effort at this stage of their lives, overall this is a slightly above mediocre album. There isn't one single song (such as she's gone and dirty women for example, which are the only songs that I regularly listen to from Technical Ecstasy) that will make me put this disc on to listen to every now and then. Not musically but feelingwise for me it's like Never Say Die, Ozzy is singing, it's BS and I will listen to it. Once every 2 years or so...

I was surprised about the ending as I do believe that the sprites of a loved one does watch over you. The loss of my daughter in law and her not being with us to see how her children are growing up . This story helped me to heal and move on with my life and find comfort knowing she is just a whisper away.

I'm still not sure exactly why the father was on trial.  And the ending?  Really?  After I expressed my disappointment with The Dinner, which was recommended very highly, and which I hated, I was assured that Defending Jacob was a much better book.  Wrong.

1781162646|5.0|Stephen King is, well, the king for a reason. Compelling characters, flowing prose and a story that builds at just the right tempo.<br /><br />Twenty-one year old Devin Jones has just been dumped by his first true love. He decides to repair his life by spending the summer at Joyland, a mom-and-pop carnival in North Carolina. Devin does more than repair his life, he learns that life sometimes involves not only death but death beyond.<br /><br />A King book is always hard to put down and this one is no exception. Stayed with me long after the final page was turned.

B006CC0YB0|5.0|What an amazing album. I'm not really familiar with a lot of Mark Lanegan's solo stuff since I mostly know him as a contributing artist for Queens of the Stone Age and other stuff. Bu this album is REALLY solid all the way through. Think like Johnny Cash, Trent Reznor, the Cure, and Tom Waits all got together and made an album.... that comes almost close. Really excellent.

Having only recently started gaming on computers, it was tough to get used to for a while, but the settings are fairly intuitive and allowed me to get the mouse acting how I wanted it.  I like the customizable weight, as it initially seems a bit light without some weights added.  Great bargain for only $40...it's got all the features of a high end mouse and fits a casual gamer's budget well.  Overall, I'm very pleased.
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor & Park is a whirlwind of a novel, it is packed with raw emotion and beauty in each and every page. It's been way too long since I enjoyed a contemporary novel and I was beginning to think maybe I wasn't cut out to read the genre. E&P restored my faith that there is still life left in Contemporary fic and that it could still wow me! I heard how powerful and emotional this novel was, but nothing could prepare me for what Rainbow Rowell had in store for me.<br /><br />  Eleanor & Park is a deep, heartbreaking, and so painstakingly real of what it means to fall in love. Both Eleanor & Park aren't the typical stock characters that are so commonly found in YA lit. For one, Eleanor is kind of overweight and she has extremely curly red hair. Park is half Korean and he's a pretty sensitive guy who isn't afraid to experiment with who he is. Rowell's characters are groundbreaking because they are unlike any other characters I have ever seen.<br /><br />  Eleanor & Park don't just deviate from the norm, they are proud to be unique and standout from the crowd. It was interesting to see their relationship progress from the awkward bus scene in the beginning to the heart wrenching conclusion. Watching the pair slowly, slowly learn what it means to be in love was just something else and I quickly fell in love with both of them. It's nearly impossible not to fall in love with E&P because they are such a wonderful couple and they complemented each other.<br /><br />  Besides being a heartbreaking romance, Eleanor & Park is a deep and profound read. Rowell explores parental abuse, gender roles, and being different. I loved how unconventional and unique E&P's relationship was. This book is heartbreaking, you will definitely need several tissues while reading this book. It's not just the ending that's heartwrenching, I found Eleanor's siblings so upsetting. Maybe I'm just unrealistic, but why have kids, if you're not going to treat them well? I kind of hated Eleanor's mom, but at the same time I felt so bad for her. I was so annoyed how she didn't stand up to her husband and tolerated him. Seriously, I know it's hard but you need to be strong for your kids and protect them.<br /><br />  Overall, Eleanor & Park has the perfect amount of adorable, fluffy romance and heartbreaking, thought-provoking moments. You will fall in love with E&P, and you will, without a doubt, root for them from the very beginning. Rowell is an expert at making complex, lovable characters and these characters gave me hope that maybe true love can exist!<br /><br />  Thank you, Rainbow Rowell,  for renewing my faith in Contemporary-Lit! I will definitely read Attachments and I'm so excited for Fangirl! The ending of this book was so fitting and perfect but I am still debating whether I should be crying in a corner or singing 80's love ballads. I'd highly, highly recommend reading Eleanor & Park and no review could do this beautiful book justice. Eleanor & Park is a beautiful, bittersweet book that perfectly captures first love and will make you swoon and cry all within a few pages.t the same time I felt so bad for her.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|When I first downloaded this app I didn't expect much but within the first level, which was also the easiest, I already found challenge and it only increased as I went through the levels. This game really makes you think about every possibility there could be to get out of the room and also to think outside the box, as things aren't always what they seem. I finished it in a day because it immediately sucked me in. It's addicting! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good challenge and a way to push their mind. Get this app!

1423140605|4.0|Rick Riordan had a great start with the Percy Jackson series. The writing wasn't spectacular, but the stories were fun and the characters were very likable, adding up to a really cool kids series. Now we're three books into the Heroes of Olympus series, and... well...<br /><br />There's not anything bad about \\"Mark of Athena\\". The writing is about on par with the Percy Jackson series, and Riordan has managed to stay faithful to the characters that he created in that universe. In fact most people who loved the Percy Jackson series will very likely enjoy \\"Son of Neptune\\" and \\"Mark of Athena\\". We're still getting Greek and Roman myths placed in a modern day setting, lots of action, lots of banter and humorous sarcasm, in fact everything that made the Percy Jackson series so much fun. Except that now it's been cranked up to 11, which at times can be great, and at other times can just drag on for seemingly little purpose.<br /><br />While the Percy Jackson books usually ran 300-400 pages, \\"Mark of Athena\\" weighs in at a staggering 608 pages. In my opinion that may be a little long for a book marketed to the 10 and up range, but that's not really the problem. Riordan sticks with his typical \\"quest\\" formula from the Percy Jackson series (go here, meet this person or god, fight this monster, get a clue and progress to the next level). But here it gets dragged out for so long that a lot of the \\"stop here, do this\\" moments feel forced and unnecessary. It just seems like this story could have been trimmed down a little bit. At the same time, Riordan was trying to develop three main characters rather than one, so I understand the increased length somewhat. But in my opinion the formula started to get old about halfway through the book as a few of the stops seemed like unnecessary padding.<br /><br />As I said, the story is told from three character's points of view: Annabeth (who is still awesome), Piper (who is still \\"blah\\"), and Leo (who vacillates between quirky side-kick and sociopathic jerk). It's not first person so it reads a little bit different than Percy Jackson or the Kane Chronicles, but here I think it works really well. However by this point the characters are quite a bit older than they were back in \\"Lightening Thief\\", but they still talk like they are 12. This is likely due to the target audience, but even so parts of the dialogue just sound ridiculous coming from a supposedly 17 year old character.<br /><br />Others have noted before that Riordan seems to pair up every character in his later books, and that really comes out in Mark of Athena. Of the seven chosen demigods, there are three pairs of sweet hearts. One of the subplots actually involves a character who feels like the seventh wheel. Unlike Percy and Annabeth's relationship that grew over five books, here characters are just paired up from the start. Again it seems very forced and contrived, and I'm not sure why Riordan felt the need to have so many couples right from the start.<br /><br />Now I may sound really critical of this book, but I actually did enjoy most of it. While I do have some problems with how bloated and formulaic Riordan's writing has become, \\"Mark of Athena\\" really is a fun book for Percy Jackson fans and has some really great moments. The last few chapters are definitely worth reading, even though you have to wade through almost two novels worth of material to get to them, and give a great twist ending to set up the next novel.d sociopathic jerk).

B00B69UQJY|2.0|I'm a big Depeche Mode fan but this album (Delta Machine) made it feel like I've heard these sounds before in the 80s and early 90s.<br /><br />The music isn't new. The rhythm, hues and beats are done before. I was looking for something fresh and innovative (given that this is their new release in years) but it was more of the same ol', same ol'.<br /><br />While there are some vaguely likable melodies, there's nothing to keep you hooked for long. I felt my attention wavering and after a while, it becomes tiresome listening to this uninspired work of music (disappointed to say so since I loved them in Violator, Songs of Faith and Devotion, and Ultra).<br /><br />In the end, I was just waiting for Delta Machine to be over with and done.

0061353248|3.0|Purchased as a school book for my daughter.  Only bought it because it was on course list, otherwise would never have considered it.  Didn't read it so completely neutral.
B00992HA4Y|5.0|I ordered this as a gift for a friend and when it showed up we both watched it and loved the movie.  My friend keeps this movie in the bedroom to watch over and over again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is one of my most favorite games to play!!!!  I do agree that it would be more fun if the coins &amp; prizes accumulated a little faster, whether you are on or off line. Also, I would think that the computer would KNOW what prizes one would need most and give the player more chance to get those prizes first. All in all I still love to play this game.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I got this to help my Nieces from accidently destroying thier grandmother's copy and they are already starting to wear the DVD disc out.
B005K17RU0|1.0|loved this app until downloaded the updrade.  has destroyed the look and feel and severely impacted the useability.  now looking for a new weather app.
B00947N6UG|5.0|I got this movie for my Nieces and they love it. it had everything they wanted in a movie and that made thier mother happy.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Best app I have.  I use all of the features, which are many.  Best buy for the money.  Great product!
B005LAIHCM|4.0|This is not as good as I expected but Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic in it.  It's a good movie, just not great.
B0053O89XI|5.0|I love this comedy, it is the best comedy ever, i love it.the bluray fills all my expectations.i really enjoy it.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Squeee!  Long awaited and better than I could have hoped.  No, it isn't too long and no, I don't think the story drags.  Watch something else if you don't like it.<br />That being said, the goblin king's chin neck is gross.
1781162646|5.0|i just love stephen king and not having to leave the house to get was totally up my alley. thanks
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Great new series.  Good characterization of a teenager and the mentality that if they were just...pretty...it would all be ok.  A relatively fresh take on post apocalypse too.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I have worked with foster children most of my adult life - I found this to be an achingly authentic portrayal of what that life can be like for children.
B00422LESO|4.0|The story was well written.  Anything Austen is fun and this was a different twist.  There were times that the pace of the story was slow for me.  I will read more by this author.  She has won me over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just  like Temple Run. It's challenging and cool, because as you go on you see new levels! Also you get to pick a character and earn money in - game and hover boards can also be bought in - game. This game is entertaining and fun for all ages! I would recommend this app.
B000002KDS|5.0|My second  favorite Alice Cooper record (after Billion Dollar Babies). I love all the songs on this one. Any fan of Alice 1.0 should own this.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I gave it this rating because their intentions worked. Their best album to date.<br /><br />It is a cross between the Discovery album, music of the disco era, and their original electronic style. Note the similarity between<br />sister sledge &#34;We are Family&#34; and &#34;Get Lucky&#34;...<br /><br />If you like all these three above I would buy it. They went retro and it worked.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|After all the bad reviews i wasnt expecting much, i thought maybe was like 808s&Heartbreak (Different but not bad at all), but man this is beyond my expectations, this is is plain garbage.<br /><br />I loved all your albums, even i like 808s... but theres no words to describe this album, stupid lyrics with no meaning (I dont even know what the hell is he talking about in some songs), the beats are annoying and barely listenable, i expect some type of improvement on your next album, if not youll definitely will loose a fan.
1611761921|3.0|The storyline is excellent, but the audio version is lacking.  Since I routinely listen to books rather than read them, I consider the audio presentation 40% of enjoyment, and Johnathan McClain seems more interested in reading this book as fast as he can, rather than recounting the events in story form, as if the voice were Jack Reacher, himself.<br /><br />Mr. McClain's fast read creates problems when attempting to delineate between various characters speaking.  Additionally, there is almost no pause from one sentence to the next, nor any break where there is a change in scenes.  Thus, I was forced to listen more than once to several passages in order to figure out the change in sequence from one place to the next or from one character to another.<br /><br />Until I listened to this book, I was under the mistaken assumption that the voice would be that of Dick Hill, but now having experienced Johnathan McClain's presentation, I will not waste my time listening to anymore Jack Reacher novels when Mr. McClain is the presenter.<br /><br />I would rate the story a B, and the reader an F, thus my rating of C.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|love the series and the movies were ok I used to watch this when I could when it was on tv now I own it and plan on watching it often!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael at his best ,always smooth and easy . Some nice new songs and of course his classic vintage songs. Michael you always put me in a good mood!
B008S4FZHI|5.0|I love Patricia's books - everyone is well written, holding you on to the edge of your seat, waiting for the next chapter to unfold, not being able to put the book down till you get to the end to find out what happens. Well done, Patricia, yet another brilliant book - now for the wait till the next one...
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I like most of the songs in this album. I usually dont like every song on a Megadeth album. This is the case for most bands for me. So, as long as there are a few good songs on the album, I consider it a good album. We all have different tastes so its different for all of us. I like how versital Dave is, he can sing a softer relaxing song, or a happier song, or a song that expresses disgust or annoyance about an issue. I also like how the band has not changed alot since even Countdown to Extinction. Bands that change alot show they have not found their real place yet. I actually dont keep track of Megadeth band members other than Dave, so in this case im writing about how the music sounds and how the lyrics are.<br />I have heard dave on intervies talking about real issues in the world and this comes out in many of their songs, which I like. He is not just whinning and crying about himself like many bands have. Also I have heard him talk about his christian based faith, and I am glad to support a artist with this faith. This is definately not christian music in my opinion, but this music is much more positive than most secular music because it does not teach you negative habits in the lyrics, and real issues in life, the country and world are adressed. There are lyrics about nice things too. Dave seems to be well aware of all the evil sublimanal messeges and negative messeges in the lyrics of most popular bands, and this is one of the reasons I believe that he has for keeping his lyrics non-harmful. Although the artwork and even the band name uses the theme of 'death', I do not believe that dave is a 'lover of death'. instead, the band uses art and lyrics to show you things. Many agencies and people in this world love death, and I believe this is what the band is trying to show.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I and my family have all very much enjoyed this special 'Christian faith and morality based' movie.  It has proven to be a special motion picture experience.
B00498YZH8|5.0|the kind of movie about a girl who is tough and gorgeous and smart and selfless. got to be watched with nice snacks that you eat ever so slowly.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Having read all of the J. K. Rowling's Potter books and more, these films have proven to be great reflections of the Potter series of Rowling's writing.  In reading her fantasy books I have found a current author reflective of J. R. R. Tolkien s &#34;Hobbit&#34; series of fantastic fantasy authorship.
B005SZAEYO|1.0|I really wanted to like this. I'd heard good things from reliable people...<br />But I've really gotta ask what they were smoking. This show is just a conglomeration of stale horror tropes strung together on a hope and a prayer. If it weren't for the great performance of Jessica Lange there'd be no point watching it at all.<br />By the end of the series I was just watching to see how bad it could get... how much more ridiculous crap they could shovel on. I wasn't disappointed, there was a load of it.<br /><br />I'm guessing, based on what I've been told that season 2 is more of the same but with a different tale and cast of characters. I just might watch it when I'm feeling like a good laugh. Otherwise, this is pure MST3K stuff... except for Ms. Lange of course.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|The DVD worked good not to mention that this is such a great movie! I would definitely recommend getting this.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Great price on this ESV study Bible!  Although I like a paper Bible that I can write in and study hands on...I love having this on  my iPad through my nook app:)
B0052TDGQO|3.0|Scotty has a strong voice, but the sound is on the same level, lacks excitement. I hope in the future he can improve, his style.
0425263924|4.0|Not the firey ending I would expect from the latest of the CROSSFIRE SERIES. Booo<br />I still want to meet Gideon Cross though.
B001224V14|2.0|Erotica should be an album thriving with songs in the order of 'Vogue', 'Deeper & deeper', and 'Express yourself'. In short,  The Vogue and/or 'House' Album. Instead, we're pitched the unexciting, uninspiring, and unimaginative Erotica. Not only is this Album of demo-like quality but, most of it's craft (or lack there of) has little substance to it. For instance, the 'did I do it?' track, a complete Rap song by an Unknown, or Miscellaneous Male Rapper. Madonna utters not one single word, this song also shares the exact same music as 'The Waiting', another bland, and pointless waste of space. The subpar mastering and stripped down production comes off more underdeveloped & low budget than an actual audio effect. As a result, much of these songs are disposable and/or unlistenable. Although this album is her most controversial record content wise, it's also the least remembered of the bunch. Most people don't even recall her having an album at this point in time. There's no memorable hits that anyone can reference other than diehard fans. The album got most of it's promo through tours and not radio. It feels as if Madonna needed more time to get inspired before this production took place.nd very whole or complete like Vogue, Express Yourself or Deeper & Deeper. I also feel like the Opening track is all wrong, it has great lyrics and arrangments but the music is not slaying. I need some more layering, back tracks, and more additives. I need the music to be pumping, I need to feel the percussion and the bass. Another thing that bothers me is how the melody from \\"Playground\\" is in \\"Words\\", \\"Words, they cut like a knife....\\" Compare that to \\"Keep your held held high and dont ask why.....\\" It bothers me. Another petpeeve I have with these two songs is that they're too long, its too much of the same thing for too many minutes. 5 minutes is accessive for a song unless some other breaks, bridges or alternate hooks are included, I get restless letting them play straight through. I will find a way to cut them down to size and add some layering and other audio techniques so they can be what they shouldve been in the beginning...<br /><br />I feel that this album as a whole has no meaning or purpose. Her approach on this album has no substance, reason or rhyme. No message, no depth, no nothing. There is nothing remarkable or moving about this album whatsoever. A perfect example of unecessary ideas is the \\"Did you do it?\\" Track, shes nowhere on the track. I feel like it was done intentionally as a conversation piece \\"why did she do that?\\" \\"hey, did you hear that one song on Madonnas new album with that dude rapping\\" \\"is she even on it?\\" Sad and desperate attempt at trying to get attention. This is what I mean by there being no point to the material on this album. Has anyone else noticed that \\"Did you do it\\" \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Justify My Love\\" all have the same music? How creative....<br /><br />Not only are these songs forgettable and disposable, but the music videos are just as dull and bland. Being that this was the album to initiate her 90's career, it sucked. This album was a big flop. Ill be honest and say its not the worst album in pop music, but to say its aMadonna album, theres nothing about it that a fan can use to influence non-Madonna followers and/or fans to become interested. If I never listened to any Madonna albums in my life and I heard this album I wouldnt understand the hype she gets and how this is one of her albums. I would be confused that this is an album from the same woman that does whatever she wants, platinum blonde hair, bright red lipstick and causes controversy, and this is her album? This is it?<br /><br />If it were an unknown artist, I would go easier, but for someone thats known as \\"Queen of pop\\", how? With songs like these? This album sounds like a good quality demo, and to say \\"Vogue\\" was released right before this with the Dick Tracy movie & soundtrack you would believe she had some unexpected new & cool treats up her sleeve. I will admit, I love the content and the raunchy-ness of much of the songs but the lack of funk, rhythym and dynamic audio mixing devalues the entire work of art. It just sounds, stupid. If I have to be honest, I must say the Erotica Era was her best look (Like A Prayer through Erotica) was my favorite look of hers and I think she was her most raw during this time and her tours were really amazing during this time. \\"Oh Father\\" and \\"In This Life\\" were songs between this time and I actually love how dramatic they both are... Still cant/wont save this album, though.<br /><br />Again, Deeper & Deeper is the best track on the album, \\"Rain\\" is also a good ballad. \\"Thief of Hearts\\" and \\"Words\\" gets you excited for a moment because one might believe the album is finally going into a more intensed direction.... Not!, theyre worth a listen but eventually they fade and become forgotten. Over 20 years later, this album is unknown to most, still hasnt grown on me and a filler album to add to the list of Madonna albums, the more the merrier right?
0800141660|5.0|Enjoy the movie.

B00CGPPMKU|2.0|I liked this app at first, and I like that you can save it. BUT the delete button is is a very bad spot so I accidentally hit it a lot and loose my whole picture. Also, the share and import buttons  do not work so if I save an unfinished picture, I can't work on it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It cost a little so who cares it had a update people right now probabally think i am<br />A noob and stupid i dont care i like it =muy name is aries. And there is lava in this update
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves<br />Karen Joy Fowler<br /><br />Read the book before reading reviews. A review can’t help but be a spoiler here.<br /><br />“Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,” thus begins the great novel: Anna Karenina. Karen Joy Fowler’s book is about an unhappy family, the Cookes. They are very unhappy. They weren’t always like that. Loving parents, intelligent, happy children with a delightful environment until one disappears. The family is so torn up over the event that no one is ever the same again.<br /><br />The book focuses on family dynamics under the weight of tragedy. However this family is not your average family. We also get to ponder what memory is all about. Like Doris Lessing’s autobiography, Under My Skin, we must think about how reliable memory is. Are we remembering the actual occurrence or are we remembering an account of the occurrence?<br /><br />A strange coincidence in this book and Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn: Both novels use the phrase Psycho Bitch. Both novels use the word refulgent. Both novels describe a desire to grab a strand of hair and run fingers along it to the end. I only noticed this because I read one right after the other.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man again. You can't go wrong! If you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favor.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I love this game it's graphics are amazing, the online play is stunning, all around amazing game the only downside  is the huge amount of space it takes.

B00CH26TL8|4.0|I play this game all the time on Facebook! Happy that it is available for my Kindle Fire HD.... now if only they would allow us the Candy Crush and Farm Heroes Saga game, then I would be very appreciative!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This was a very enlightening book. As a result both my husband and I have gone gluten free. Yea yea.
B005ZMTXMY|4.0|The Opening Sequence Always Makes Me Cry, But After That, It Is Mostly Humor And Fun As Mr. Frederickson And Russell Have An Adventure. A Bit Of A Dennis The Menace Pairing With Those Two. Just Wish That A Female Had Been In There Somewhere, You Know, A Human One, lol. Great Visuals, Action, And Humor, And Oh So Very Touching. It Will Leave You Feeling Very Up. My Four Year Old Son adoresThis One.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|My 10 year old granddaughter installed this on each of our Kindles.  She told me she does not need her parents to wake her up for school anymore. She just sets her alarm clock.
0394818237|5.0|My son loved this book so much it got destroyed. I forgot about it until recently when looking for books for my daughter. I bought it wondering if she would love it as much as my son did and sure enough, she does! She wants me to read it to her every night. It's such a simple idea that teaches about people's jobs and how things get done, but kids really love it!
B00171E8CW|5.0|This has to be the very best tribute shows ever produced.  The music is awesome.  Definitely miss having George around in th emusic scene.
B0091WRCOA|5.0|Love this movie in HD! The visual and effects and soundtrack make it a keeper and not just a rental.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Fun for all ages!! cute and fun! I love animals so this is great!! and all the different animals are so cool!
B00APJLEGA|5.0|This is a very funny, feel-good movie. Great for the whole family. Something for everyone. I especially loved it in HD.
1781162646|5.0|I read this book and I loved it!  It's a wonderful story, that I will never forget.  I loved every character in the book...  Wonderful read!!
B00555X8OA|4.0|Kahneman provides an interesting theory of human decision-making that advances beyond rationality and invokes prospect theory. I have not read his academic papers, but his frequent references to his (and others') work in this field makes me believe that data back up his theory. His brief description/ advocacy for libertarian paternalism (&#34;nudging&#34;) in his conclusion is intriguing. Overall, a very thought-provoking work. I will read more on the subject.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really cool how you actually have the trucks running deliver and do the services. The environmental thing is neat because nobody thinks about the environment any more. Overall good game!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I think Sylvia Day is my favorite author. I've never been much of a reader but I couldn't put the book down! I wish the next one was out already!! I want to know where Megumi is and of course where Gidion and EV go next in the relationship.
B000W93CHC|5.0|World without End was a great sequel to Pillars of the Earth. It was informative and had wonderfully drawn out characters.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut is an excellent writer. He knows how to write dark comedy without being overly insensitive. One example is his use of the phrase \\"So it goes.\\" He even uses it for a drink being flat, or \\"dead.\\"
B0040I09RM|5.0|Episode one was slow but keep watching . well worth the time!! besides who doesn't like Ron Pearlman!? just give it some time to unfold
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the greatest books I have ever read. It is a coming of age book to remind you that you are not alone and that we are infinite.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|When I first bought this CD I didn't play it much. After a couple weeks I played it again and played it a lot after that.
030746363X|5.0|This guy has spent his life working out what works best for weight loss. This book is a gem. Buy it. It is worth more than the cost of the book.
0470901071|5.0|Initially I had Lammle's book but traded it in to Amazon to Odom's book. The reason I got rid of Lammle's book is that I didn't care for the way it was laid out, I didn't want to skip around chapter to chapter to find what I need to study (I took the exam in two parts). I think content wise Odom's book covers more of what you will need for the test but it was so dry I couldn't bear to read it. I did keep it but  I ended up buying the Todd Lammle book again to actually study with. Todd presents the material in a way that it is explained like a real person teaching the topic not just spouting off facts like a text book.<br />Honestly, I would say a person should get both. Use Lammle's book to actually study with and get a good understanding then use Odom's book to pick up the tidbits that Cisco thinks you should know that Lammle left out. This will ensure you get a well rounded education for your CCNA.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The characters were quirky, unique and completely lovable. Hazel and Gus are not your \\"average\\" teens for many reasons, but it is not just their illness that sets them apart. It is their love for each other. They understand one another in a way no one else can, and isn't that how true love is? A great read for teens and adults.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Wonderfully addictive. Great game. Easy to play. Highly recommend!!! Allows me to relax at end of day or while on road trips.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Always a pleasure to read, Follett writes simply and clearly, portraying his characters not just through adjectives, but through their actions. As a reader, I get so wrapped up in the lives of Billie and Maud and their offspring that I can hardly wait for a sequel. He has put human faces on the horror of war. Now, what will they do during the &#34;cold war?&#34;
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|A good entertaining movie with a good cast and good acting. A little disjointed at times but overall Good movie.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The first of the series captured me both in Follett's characters and in his historically accurate sense of the times. His portrayal of the aristocracy as they must have been is captivating. His description of the suffering of the lower classes was heart-rending, and the mixture of the two, volatile! Add the involvement of both in the politics of the time and get a captivating portrait of - as the old saying goes - a war made by old rich men that is fought by the poor. A powerful statement of poignant truths about World War I.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for season 4!  Left with a cliff hanger... of course.  I think it comes out Jan 2014, so I'll be impatiently waiting...
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|We saw this film in the theater and I bought the DVD as a gift for a shut-in friend with similar interests to mine.  The film is absolutely great for us old timers who still value classical music and classy people ---including the quirky ones.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Well written and often compelling.  Visuals are a little graphic and the language sometimes coarse.  How come the &#34;good guys&#34; can't win??  Want to watch season #2 soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great puzzler.  challenging fun but not impossible.  my son loves it also.  kid appropriate.  I loved it and couldn't put the game down
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|Great variety and amazing lyrics! I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of any kind of music!
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This but put together many questions that I had given up asking and set me on a new study .I believe this book is important to my health and happiness.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|By changing just one habit, you can start a domino effect that will spill into other areas of your life, according to this book. I think the point is that if you shake up just a little part of your routine, it causes you to really think about what you're doing and allow you to decide whether or not it works for you. But rarely is changing one habit isolated to one area of your life. I chose to wake up earlier. I'm still somewhat struggling with it, but I notice that my morning routine is less stressful. To get up earlier I need to sleep earlier, and that has caused me to assess whether my sleep is adequate (it's not). Which has caused me to adopt better eating habits (nothing too late, or caffeinated), work out (for better sleep) and pay attention to my sleep environment (I got a mattress pad which now supports my back better, so I don't wake up achey).So now, I'm somewhat healthier and less stressed, which gives me a little more energy. So not like my life is perfect, but instead of getting overwhelmed by the thought of overhauling my entire existence, I've picked one habit and little changes come from there and accumulate.
B0012PDVQ2|4.0|You have to put it into perspective that this was before a lot of the movies u see today. I'm sure the concept was revolutionary for its time as wellsas the look and feel of the movie.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is addicting and can take over your life. It has a hard time reading your touches sometimes and that can be aggravating
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The definitive version of TOS? The image quality is amazing. Love the fact that I can choose between original special effects and audio or remastered effects and audio. It would be nice to see the packaging re-designed but as far as content, good enough for me. The only complaint is that the season 3 box set did not contain an slipcover. Would have been better if it had since the other two did. But, it seems that that is a complaint amongst the fans.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The Little Mermaid is a wonderful Disney classic that all children enjoy.  The picure quality of the DVD is better as well
B000VM9Z8K|3.0|There is nothing deep or meaningful about this book, but it is certainly a fun escape book.  Precut for a day at the beach.
B005R473G8|4.0|I have to admit, it was a great book but at some point I begun feeling revolted of what a mischievous coward Georges could be. I like to think people are better than that.
1878424319|5.0|Practical sense that is written in short verse. This is a go to book to keep as reference that you can grab off the shelf and remind yourself what this life is really all about, simple dynamics! Very well written.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this series of books.  I read all three and saw the movie when it can out.  Of course the book is always better than the movie.
1577314808|2.0|I think it could of been written more simple than it was. This is a whole lot of information hitting the mind at one time. Attention span is 1 minute so given that I think he could of cut to the chase.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have now read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books. Getting After Dead as well. Very good ending to a very good series.
B005SEKMH4|5.0|As a marathon runner I already knew the benefits of exercise on the brain but it's great to read a scientific approach to how it can have so many positive effects on your mind, not just your heart!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Every song has a message, period point blank. it's not just a person behind a tight beat talking about how much money they have or how much better they are than you. If you like good music, you will love this album.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Archer creates a magnetizing cast of characters who draw you into their lives as if you were a first cousin hearing the story directly from their lips. The development of the story lines is complex enough to be interesting throughout the book, but straight forward enough so that the reader can enjoy trying to anticipate the next turn. The great let down is that the story is 1,000 pages too short.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was disappointed with this book because I expected it to be as good as his two previous books.  It wasn't. I had trouble keeping the characters straight and the storyline was all over the place. In the beginning of new chapters would be new characters and I couldn't figure out what they had to do with the characters in the previous chapter. Very disappointed.
B0000669JL|4.0|this music is timeless.  makes me want to go back to Jamaica.He can never be replaced or duplicated,  his music lives on
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I expected, actually, for this to be like most music cds, some wonderful songs and a few mediocres.<br />However, Bruno never disappoints.  I love every song on the cd.  Some are lively and toe-tapping,<br />and some are soulful and beautiful.  Bruno Mars is a HIT.  Nothing he does is mediocre. This cd is<br />my favorite by far, of all my cd's and I have tons.  :-)

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have never played a game like this before, but i would have paid at least 99 cents for it. Got it for free and i enjoy it. At points you feel like you'll never get past it but then suddenly something clicks and you find the missing clue. I would reccomend
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Lots of free books and low priced items.Love being able to read books on my android phone. I did have some trouble downloading the app on my phone.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|If you loved the U2 360 tour, you'll love this video. The Rose Bowl was U2's best performance of the tour, this is one of the best concert videos U2 has released. U2 360 is without a doubt U2's most visually impressive concert film, even surpassing the ones chronicling their over-the-top 90s shows. The enormous and seemingly sentient &#34;space ship&#34; stage (aka &#34;The Claw&#34;) is a spectacle unto itself, rivaled only by the sight of  98,000 plus perpetually euphoric U2 fans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a fun game for free a version...challenging without being too difficult wish there were more free levels though
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I saw the movie first, and really enjoyed it, so I thought I would read the book. The book is much more detailed, of course, but events in the story are also different from the movie, enough so that even after watching the movie, you don't always know what's going to happen in the book. Ultimately, I would say that the book is better than the movie by far, and if you enjoyed the movie, you should definitely read the book.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is a short but historically informative read. Mr. Patrick supports his \\"secrets to genius\\" through a study of the lives of important figures, e.g. Nikola Tesla, and how their achievements changed society. If you liked this book, download \\"Alexander the Great: The Macedonian Who Conquered the World\\", which like \\"Nikola Tesla\\", is free for Kindle.
B004BEMC6G|3.0|I thought this was a great thriller, never being sure of who was who they seemed to be. Every time I thought I had it figured out, I was surprised.<br />However,  it was hard to be too involved, as the sound quality was terrible. Anytime there were vehicles or music, there was a distorted roar that disturbed the whole scene. I'm not sure whether that's why the purchase price is discounted. Either way, they need to re-upload this movie with a clean soundtrack.
B004LE90ZC|4.0|This is a great read.  There is a huge amount of learning and research involved, but it is presented in a very approachable way. The weaving of the strands of the story is very clever.
B0015DROBO|4.0|It took me a while to finish because I started when I was pregnant and then time got away after baby. But it was easy to pick up and get back into. Some twists and page-turbo parts made it hard to put down at times.
B00AAQ7LP6|5.0|If you like Rihanna you will love, very energetic concert and very good songs, and the sound is not bad like others said, I really enjoyed.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love this app. use it on my kindle every night but you'll. want to plug it in for best battery life the next day.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This is a fun read - written in first person, the narrator has an unusual view of life and a self deprecating view of himself. The plot line is a little unrealistic, but the beauty of this novel is the manner in which the main character expresses himself, comments on those around him and describes his experiences. A short novel, ideal for a plane journey, though be careful your sniggers don't disturb your fellow travellers!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I was blown away at how much he sounds like Geoff Tate. This is a GREAT cd and this new singer has an amazing voice. They did an AWESOME job!!!!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This app is so much fun as a free version... but once you buy the full version it is sooooo much better!! Totally worth the upgrade !!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I fell in love with the movie, and I knew I owed it to myself to read the entire trilogy. So I did, in a matter of six days. By far my favorite read yet.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This Oxford Dictionary of English book is amazing because you can learn a new word that you never knew before. And why is that some parents don't give the children the right definition and parents should tell their kids what they have learned in school because school. Because that will tell the parents what their children have learned in class. But some classes don't help the children because some teachers don't stop and think and to think about the student and start helping the student and give the student a lot more effort.

B000IDEORY|5.0|I haven't re-seen the movie, thought I certainly, still, almost know every word of it, and of course the dancing is absolutely magical.  I don't mean to downplay the sensualism that is represented (those teenagers were WAY beyond anything I'd every seen as a teenager, myself, but it was fun to watch &#34;a different culture&#34; in the throws of expanding independence
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Love this tiny mic! What a deal ... compares to very very expensive alternative mics.<br />I lucked into this and the A-T payed off in spades.<br />You cannot go wrong with the Audio-Technica ATR-3350 lav!!

B00A4TKDKY|3.0|Not crazy about this particular set. It is OKAY but not great Buddy session.<br />Live at Legends just didn't do it for me. Maybe it is just not the right mood<br />for me right now. Sometimes these sessions have to hit you just right, this<br />one is bright and all about Loud. BUDDY IS A GENIUS and one Jimi respected.<br />So, just be prepared for some serious head-on sound.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and the scenery is awesome!  I am very much looking forward to the next movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game.  It is just enough of a challenge to be intriguing but not so much so that you get frustrated.  Good game and good fun.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Purchased for my class.  Thoroughly enjoyed by my 5th & 6th Grade Language Arts classes.  I will show it again.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It's the perfect mixture of romance, adventure, comedy and greatness in one fabulous book Smith a cliffhanging ending to it.<br />I definetely give it 5 stars!
B004I9CXHW|1.0|You need to attach a USB to iPod (30 pin or Lightning) cable for this to work, but the Audi Q7 does not recognize the iPod and I received no help from the supplier in making it work. I lost my time and money.
B009LNI0T0|5.0|This is a superlative set. The performances are based on solid research into Haydn's practices. The forces are very small for most of these, and there is no continuo. Tempi are brisk, textures light. I like this much more than any other set, and I have heard large chunks of most.<br />This is not complete. There are 79 symphonies recorded here. Missing are the later symphonies, which use larger orchestras.
B00511ONPG|5.0|I started my own business just over one year ago. Sales have all been by word of mouth, with a little help from a website and a Facebook page. I new to all of this and doing it on my own. I've read several articles and a couple books on social marketing. While I've gotten something new from all these sources, Dave has put together the best single source. Great book for a new guy.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I thought that the first Iron Man was great.  Struck all the right chords, no unnecessary plot points and great acting all around.  While I think the sequel is solid, there was a bit of a letdown (as there usually is with sequels to superhero movies) from the original.  To be fair, there is a lot going on.  The movie was trying to tell a separate Iron Man story, while also setting up the eventual Avengers movie, and setting up Thor and to some extent Captain America.<br /><br />I think the two new villains in the film worked well. Sam Rockwell playing Hammer who is a competitor of Stark, but who cannot do anything as well as Stark.  He was kind of over the top with goofy eccentricity as opposed to Stark's cocky eccentricity.  Whiplash played very well by Micky Rourke plays more of a silent but deadly character who has his own agenda to take down Stark that ties in family rivalry and revenge.  The only drawback is that his character spends a lot of time not involved in any action.<br /><br />The Avengers tie in introduces Black Widow (played by Scarlet Johansson), and expanded roles for Nick Fury and agent Coulson.  While I though the whole evaluation of Stark and whether he should be included in the Avengers was somewhat unnecessary (because it was well known that he was going to be in the group), it was as good a way as any to expand into that world.<br /><br />I think the one plot point they could have done without was the blood poisoning from the arc reactor in his chest thing.  There was enough else going on that if it was taken out the movie would have probably flowed a little better.  It did not grind the movie to a halt though, so it is just a minor point.<br /><br />I also think Don Cheadle did a great job taking over the role as Rhodes.  While I am usually not a fan of just replacing out actors in these kind of movie series (the continuity is part of what keeps the audience engaged), I just think he was more suited for the role.  I would have been fine keeping Terrance Howard in, but I think Cheadle would have been better from the outset.<br /><br />Like all superhero movies, whether you like this or not will be largely subjective.  Even for fans of the genre in general, what one person likes and another person hates can be very different.  I think if you like the first, you will probably like this one as well.  Maybe not as much, but still enough to enjoy.  The A/V quality on blu ray is superb, and if you get the two disc edition there are a lot of bonus features for those who like to watch that material.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Did love the app. than changes were made and made the map hard to read. Had to go another weather app. that I do not care that much about.
B00821OW8K|1.0|I'm an avid scifi viewer, with favorites including Battlestar Galactica, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, Star Trek (of course), X-Files and more. This series is just unwatchable. It's cliche, has horrible dialogue, tries way too hard to be something interesting, and everything falls flat. It's like reading a book for first graders. I don't understand the appeal. Perhaps this may be appealing to those who don't watch scifi at all. Very disappointing.
0385349947|4.0|Many others have spoken far more eloquently than can I about the good content of the book. My only issue with it was the physical quality of the book. It looks like handfuls of pages were all hand-cut at different times and then glued together into the book, as a bunch of pages are wider, then narrower, then wider, then narrower, throughout the book. This gives it a very awkward feel when holding the book and flipping pages. And it looks weird. Whoever did the binding on this book clearly lacked quality control. For the price of the book, I expect an even cut of the pages.

B00AZKCU7G|5.0|As a young child, Steven Spielberg was captivated when he saw the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />Decades later, the filmmaker would direct and produce the historical drama film \\"Lincoln\\" that is based on Doris Kearn Goodwin's biography \\"Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\\" focusing on the final four months of Abram Lincoln's life and focusing on his efforts to have the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution passed by the United States House of Representatives. in January 1865.<br /><br />Filmed in the Fall of 2011 and released theatrically int the Fall of 2012, \\"Lincoln\\" has received critical acclaim worldwide, earning seven Golden Globe nominations, twelve Academy Award nominations and grossing over $263 million at the box office, making \\"Lincoln\\" a financial success.<br /><br />The film would feature an all-star cast including Daniel Day-Lewis (\\"There Will Be Blood\\", \\"Gangs of New York\\", \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\"), Sally Field (\\"Forrest Gump\\", \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\", \\"Brothers & Sisters\\"), David Strathairn (\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\", \\"L.A. Confidential\\", \\"Good Night\\" and \\"Good Luck\\"), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (\\"Inception\\", \\"Looper\\", \\"(500) Days of Summer\\"), James Spader (\\"Boston Legal\\", \\"Stargate\\", \\"Secretary\\"), Hal Holbrook (\\"Wall Street\\", Men of Honor\\", \\"Into the Wild\\"), Tommy Lee Jones (\\"No Country for Old Men\\", \\"Men in Black\\" films, \\"The Fugitive\\"), John Hawkes (\\"American Gangster, \\"Identity\\", \\"The Sessions\\") and many more.<br /><br />And now \\"Lincoln\\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD, including a 4-Disc Combo Pack which includes the Blu-ray (2), DVD and Digital Copy in March 2013.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  With one of the most well-known cinematographers such as Janusz Kaminski (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Schindler's List\\", \\"Minority Report\\", \\"Catch Me If You Can\\") working on the film, one can expect nothing but the best in terms of cinematography, capturing the characters in fantastic lighting situations.  And once again, Kaminski's cinematography is fantastic!  Featuring incredible detail and like era, using natural color to enhance the overall feeling of the film, skin tones are natural, the film features great contrast with outdoor scenes featuring a variety of colors, from a normal day to a cool, cold night where Abraham Lincoln and soldiers ride their horses through dead bodies during the war.  Black levels are nice and deep, Joanna Johnston's costume design and Rick Carter's production design of capturing authenticity is also captured amazingly on camera courtesy of Kaminski.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" looks fantastic on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />As for the audio, \\"Lincoln\\" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HDMA, Envlish DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  I was very impressed with the lossless soundtrack.  It's one thing to expect crystal clear dialogue with wonderful music from legendary composer John Williams (\\"Star Wars\\" films, \\"Harry Potter\\" films, \\"Indiana Jones\\" films) but the amount of ambiance captured through the surrounds is wonderful.  With the constant chattering during the political debates, there is also use of LFE during certain scenes.  But even sounds of storms, sounds of wood upon wood, may it be a closure of a room, wheel making contact on the floor, good use of rear surround channels.  But it's the dialogue and the ambiance along with Williams' music that sounds incredible.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  The Journey to Lincoln - (9:24) Featuring interviews with Steven Spielberg, producer Kathleen Kennedy and the cast about being part of the film and the creation of it.<br />  A Historic Tapestry: Richmond, Virginia - (4:00) Filmmaker Steven Spielberg and crew talk about being able to film at historic structures to recreate the feel of Washington, D.C. and Virginia during the Civil War era in Richmond, Virginia.<br />  In the Company of Character - (10:23) A featurette about the casting of the talent to play various characters and working with Daniel Day-Lewis.  Each cast member talks about their involvement in the film and meeting the other talents and how they immersed themselves and prepared for this film.<br />  Crafting the Past - (10:43) A special feature about costume and production design.  Production designer Rick Carter talks and costume designer Joanna Johnston about capturing the detail of the era and trying to make everything in the film look authentic.<br />  Living with Lincoln - (27:04) A special feature about a period biopic and the contribution to make this film feel like it was taking place in the past.  Capturing the look and feel but also through the performances.<br />  In Lincoln's Footsteps - (16:35) A featurette about the editing of the film and how it was important to have the long periods instead of constant cuts.  Discussing the visual perspective of the film and the audio.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" comes with two Blu-rays (one for the feature film and the other for special features), a DVD and Digital Copy version of the film.  Also, a slipcover case is included.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When I was younger, my grandfather, an immigrant from the Philippines would always use Abraham Lincoln as an example for us and why people are fortunate today to be able to have a good education, strive for a good education because of what Lincoln was give people of color a chance of freedom in the United States.<br /><br />He would always talk about the Emancipation Proclamation and I as I grew older, like every child taught in school about what Lincoln did to free the slaves, it was an important order from Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War.<br /><br />Only until I became an adult, would you realize that there was much more to the story than the simple \\"Lincoln freed the slaves!\\" that we have been taught.  Along with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, it wasn't until the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 which abolished slavery, that the amendment was monumental.<br /><br />But it wasn't easy.  With so much focus of Lincoln on his assassination by John Wilkes Booth, I really didn't know too much about Abraham Lincoln's life until I saw the biographical silent film \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" (1930) directed by D.W. Griffith.  While this film focused on Lincoln's earlier life as a storekeeper and rail-splitter and his earlier romance with Ann Rutledge and later being engaged to Mary Todd and the Lincoln-Douglas debates about the extension of slavery, there really hasn't been anything showcasing the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment.<br /><br />I can understand why.  It's not an easy subject for one to craft and make it entertaining for general audiences,  People know how the amendment was historic, but would one want to watch it as a film?<br /><br />That's where filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes in and the fact that he is directing the film, the answer is yes.  If Spielberg can make this film entertaining, it's definitely worth giving a try.<br /><br />Joining him are top people in the industry, from composer John Williams, director of photography Janusz Kaminski, production designer Rick Carter and costume design by Joanna Johnston, and many others involved with the film, you know you have a great team.<br /><br />And what Spielberg is quite effective was building a storyline with showcasing how difficult of a time it was for President Lincoln.  While the Emancipation Proclamation helped give slaves a chance for freedom during the Civil War, if the war was to end, they would not be free any longer, and not too many were in favor of abolishing slavery, except President Lincoln and a few members of the US House of Representatives.  With wonderful production and costume design to keep the authenticity of the film and the amazing performances by actor Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathaim, Tommy Lee Jones, Joseph Gordon Levitt to name a few, you can't help but be amazed with how wonderful this film looks, but also how powerful the film is thanks to its outstanding talent.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis captures the look of Abraham Lincoln, Sally Field who gained weight for the role was also able to play the unstable Mary Todd and of course other performers throughout the film, made the film feel authentic and real.<br /><br />The film is smart, compelling but also a message about freedom and equality. Also, it's a subject that not many people are familiar with and you learn that freedom did not come easy but also how President Lincoln took a risk that could have had him impeached.  But he was dedicated, persistent and also made others around him persistent, but most importantly have them put their faith in him to make it happen.  A lot was at stake for some people who voted for the amendment, some who were threatened but yet knowing what was right and debating within, whether or not to be loyal to their political party or to side with Abraham Lincoln in giving freedom to the slaves.<br /><br />As for the 4-Disc Combo Pack of \\"Lincoln\\", you get the Blu-ray release (two featuring the feature film, the other with special features), a DVD version of the film and a Digital Copy.  Picture quality along with lossless audio is magnificent, special features are good but I wished they were slightly longer.  It would have been nice to have an audio commentary or even other special features on Abraham Lincoln. But that is me being picky!  For the most part, \\"Lincoln\\" is a wonderful Blu-ray release and a film that is powerful and another cinematic masterpiece for Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Lincoln\\" is a fascinating, compelling film featuring fantastic cinematography, production and costume design but also  a magnificent performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field and many others.

B004JMSIRC|5.0|Superhero movies tend to be cyclic in their quality.  There can be a run of very good ones, followed by a lot of clunkers.  And liking them or hating them can be very subjective.  There is not a lot of universal sentiment save for Dark Knight on the great end of the spectrum and Batman and Robin on the awful end.  Iron Man is clearly a movie with an ulterior motive that is not revealed until the scene after the credits. To set the stage for the Avengers movie, with Iron Man as the centerpiece hero.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr does a great job with the role of Tony Stark. playing him as brash, crass and arrogant, but with a strong ethical streak as well.  Jeff Bridges, who usually bugs me to no end because of his overacting does OK with the role of the villain.  The performance was not earth shattering by any means, but not bad either.  The first part of the movie shows the events leading up to Stark's capture by terrorists, and then making the first Iron Man Suit to in order to get away.  Then it shows him creating the upgraded suit and transforming into Iron Man.  It is fairly straight forward as an origin story goes for a superhero.<br /><br />I never did read the comic, so I have no idea how close the movie sticks to the source material.  Given that many changes tend to be made in a lot of movies that are adapted from comics, if something not faithful to the comics would cause you to hate the movie, then you may want to think twice.  For everyone else, it is in ways a typical summer blockbuster.  A lot of special effects, action and explosions.  The acting is better than what you get in a lot of summer action movies though, and it set up the \\"world\\" for the movies that came after leading up to The Avengers.<br /><br />The 2 disc blu ray version of the movie gives you a lot of special features.  The trailers, behind the scenes and making of material, cast interviews etc.  There are features both on the movie disc, and then entirely on the second disc.  So for those getting the actual discs, if you like bonus material there is a lot.  Of course the audio/visual quality in blu ray looks and sounds great.  Definitely worth adding to your collection if you get the discs, or just watching if you like the genre.e getting the actual discs, if you like bonus material there is a lot.

B00C5WR6JE|5.0|Is a marsterwork of this music call Americana, a combination of country, folk, popular music and contemporary music. Frisell is one of the most influential guitarist of the last tree decades in jazz and in others musics. \\"Big Sur\\" is his best work in this Americana line. Is beautiful, full of nostalgia and incredible simple to hear.His albums more influent , until now, probable are \\"Have a little faith\\" (1993) and \\"Nashville\\"(1997) and from now this album. He create with this three records a new way to understand jazz music, flock music and country. But the influence of classic american music is hear more evident than never. From Neil Young to Aaron Copland, \\"Big Sur\\" is a magic travel full of ideas and sounds. Is a special Quartet for a special occasion. Eyvind Kang on viola, Hanks Roberts on cello, Jenny Scheinman on violin and Ruddy Royston on drums. The production of Lee Townsend is perfect. \\"Big Sur\\" is  great music, great Americana music. If you like this Frisell side, you must buy now. If you did'nt please try to hear it. Is another way to feel the music. Another masterwork from Frisell. A \\" classic\\" from the first moment.
B00000IL1K|5.0|This starts out sounding like a parody of a Loreena McKennitt record.  Honest, it's like it was produced by The Onion.<br /><br />Which is not to say that it's not good.  One track in particular, \\"Deliver Me\\", will rip your heart out.  While you're dancing.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I love my new stand for the Kindle Fire HD.  Not only does it protect my Kindle, but you can stand it up for easier viewing.  I also like that when you close the case, the Kindle shuts off automatically and you don't have to search for that little button at the top of the Kindle.  Same when you turn it on.  Just open the case and it turns on.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

Frank Baum.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Disney, with the success of \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\\", it gave Samuel Goldwyn the idea that films about fantasy would do well in the U.S. and thus he acquired the rights and re-sold it to Louis B. Mayer in 1938.  And this would result in MGM developing the musical adaptation \\"Wizard of Oz\\" in 1939.<br /><br />Walt Disney would later revisit Oz with an idea to create a musical during the 1950′s with the Mickey Mouse Club titled \\"The Road to Oz\\" but the plan was dropped.  Another Disney opportunity to revisit Oz as a live-action film did happen in 1985 titled \\"Rainbow Road to Oz\\", but at that time, Disney films were not doing that well in the box office.  Disney would lose the film rights to the OZ books and the books were reverted to public domain.<br /><br />But for screenwriter Mitchel Kapner, having read the sixth novel in the series \\"The Emerald City of Oz\\", Kapner wanted to explore the origins of the Wizard of Oz and so, Kapner tried to present it to other studios but to no avail.  But Walt Disney Pictures decided to give a film adaptation a chance and Sam Raimi (\\"Spider-Man\\" films, \\"Darkman\\", \\"Army of Darkness\\") was hired to direct \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\".<br /><br />The film would star James Franco (\\"127 Hours\\", \\"Spider-Man\\" films), Mila Kunis (\\"Black Swan\\", \\"That 70′s Show\\", \\"Family Guy\\"), Rachel Weisz (\\"The Mummy\\" films, \\"The Fountain\\", \\"Constantine\\"), Michelle Williams (\\"Shutter Island\\", \\"My Week with Marilyn\\", \\"Dawson's Creek\\") and Zach Braff (\\"Scrubs\\", \\"Garden State\\", \\"Chicken Little\\").<br /><br />The film would become a box office success, earning over $490 million.  And now \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" will be released on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray + DVD+Digital Copy, Blu-ray + Digital Copy and DVD + Digital Copy courtesy of Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in June 2013.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio, 1:33:1 at the beginning of the film).  I can honestly say that \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is one of the best looking Blu-rays I have seen in 2013.  Colors are vibrant, skin tones are natural, CG elements manages to look convincingly real and world of Oz with its lush green mountains, colorful flowers, clouds, high above Oz and seeing the environments during the day and even the look of the city during night with fireworks, flames, etc.  This film looks amazing!<br /><br />There is so much to be impressed about with this film.  Close-ups of the characters show great clarity and detail, CG clouds to characters like Finley and even China Girl look fantastic close up!  Even the make up design on Mila Kunis as the wicked witch is impressive!  The mouth movements are perfectly aligned with what the character is saying and the film including production and costume design (as well as makeup design) are wonderful highlights to this film.<br /><br />During my viewing, I saw no artifacts or banding, no crush and nothing negative when it comes to picture quality.  If anything, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" won me over with picture quality but how is the lossless soundtrack?  Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HDMA, English .1 and 2.0 Dolby Digital, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, this film is immersive.  The soundtrack for its many action sequences along with Danny Elfman's music makes the soundscape so immersive with audio well utilized, LFE happening during the action sequences and I was impressed! From the scene where Oz arrives in Oz during the beginning of the film sounds amazing but once you get to the chase scene, soldier marching or even the plan enacted by Oz, audiophiles should be pleased by this active, immersive lossless soundtrack!<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Disney Second Screen - Explore the film on your iPad and make magic with Finley and Oz's Bag of Tricks.  Plus: Journey into the Fantastic Land!<br />  Walt Disney and the Road to Oz - (10:13) A featurette about how Walt Disney had wanted to do an Oz film since making his first animated film.  Despite trying to attain the rights to make a film, he tried to make a make an Oz musical in the '50s titled \\"Rainbow Road to Oz\\" featuring the Mickey Mouse gang.<br />  My Journey in Oz by James Franco - (21:43) James Franco documents a typical day on the set of \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" featuring interviews with Director Sam Raimi and the cast.<br />  China Girl and the Suspension of Belief - (5:26) The making of the china Girl, how they made China Girl using a marionette and the voice behind the character.<br />  Before Your Very Eyes form Kansas to Oz - (11:02) The art of oz and how award winning production designer Robert Stromberg added his own unique touch to \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\".<br />  Mila's Metamorphosis - (7:43) Mila Kunis and makeup designers transforming the actress to the wicked witch.<br />  Mr. Elfman's Musical Concoctions - (7:13) Danny Elfman talks about his working relationship with Sam Raimi and creating the music for the film.<br />  Bloopers - (5:06) Bloopers from \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" comes with a slipcover and this version comes with a Blu-ray, DVD (widescreen 2:40:1 (beginning of feature film is 1:33:1), English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, English 2.0 Dolby Digital, Subtitles: English SDH, French and Spanish) and Digital Copy of the film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Like many people who have watched the classic \\"Wizard of Oz\\", anything made after this film based on \\"Oz\\", many would like to dismiss it.<br /><br />But for fans of the 1985 film \\"Return to Oz\\", despite it not doing well in the box office, fans of the L. Frank Baum books were supportive of the Disney live-action film because it was a faithful adaptation of the novel.<br /><br />Since 1985, so much has changed when it comes to technology and recreating worlds.  And with the 2013 Disney film, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\", it gave director Sam Raimi and writers Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire to create a film, with a skillful and talented crew to recreate the world of Oz and give us a visual feast but also a storyline that the young and old can easily be entertained.  But I felt the film captured the fantasy and its efficacy lies in the fact that the world of Oz can look so gorgeous in the film, even though it may have been created via CG and the talent were acting around a blue screen.<br /><br />From the visual appearance of Finley, the flying monkey or China Doll, just the smallest details when it came to textures and detail, I was in awe by what was created.  Production design, costumes were magnificent and sure, the talents were superimposed on CG backdrops but it was well-done. It was convincing and it looks so amazing on Blu-ray!<br /><br />James Franco managed to play Oz...the magician, conman and womanizer with brashness, humor but also bringing dignity to the character.  Mila Kunis did a wonderful job of portraying the wicked witch Theodora, but I would have loved to see the character of Theodora in much more pain before her transformation into the vile, green witch...which would be known as the Wicked Witch of the West.<br /><br />As for Evanora, Rachel Weisz has done a wonderful job of playing an antagonist with amoral affection to her sisters but I was waiting to see if the film would make a correlation to the magic shoes which would become part of the Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />And Michelle Williams as Glinda, also known as the Good Witch of the South in the novel.  The moralistic and caringcharacter played with gentleness similar to her glistening and radiant version portrayed in the Wizard of Oz.  Primary difference is that Glinda was accused of crimes she did not commit and is a bit unsure of herself, while the later version of herself is calm and self-assured.<br /><br />This leads me to wonder if Disney plans on making a trilogy or more films based on L. Frank Baum's novels especially with \\"The Marvelous Land of Oz\\", the second book.  One that introduces the scarecrow and tin man but features a new protagonist named Tip and the witch of the North, Mombi.  It would be a great tie-in to the films of showing how the scarecrow and tin man came to be and possibly introducing the character known as Ozma.<br /><br />With the box office success of \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\", I would only hope that Disney does continue the story of Oz, as it would provide a very good connection to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\".<br /><br />As for \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\", I was hooked by the film's visuals but the storyline was fascinating and I was entertained but also wanted to see the origin of the witches and Glinda the Good and of course, Oz.<br /><br />For parents, personally I think the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" had more frightening elements than \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" but I can see some younger children being spooked by seeing how the Wicked Witch came to be or perhaps the scary look of the evil flying monkeys.  But \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is a wonderful family film that both young and old can equally be entertained.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release was magnificent as colors were vibrant, detailed and I saw no hint of any artifacts or banding, the picture quality was perfect.  The lossless audio was immersive and will no doubt make audiophiles happy.  And as for special features, you do get a good number of them included on this Blu-ray release.  I have been spoiled by magnificent Disney releases on Blu-ray that  I was hoping to see more when it comes to special features.  Especially with audio commentary tracks or just lengthier featurettes, so I felt the Blu-ray release could have had more special features included.<br /><br />I know there are people who have issues with the Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy being released separately.  While some companies choose to include their Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray 2D films together, Disney chooses to keep them separate but that's their decision and perhaps for future releases, they may consider people's pleas of releasing one release versus two separate releases.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is a gorgeous, thrilling and captivating film that has potential for even more sequels within the world of Oz.  I'm confident to say that \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is one of the most beautiful films I have seen on Blu-ray for 2013 and also to have a complimenting lossless soundtrack that is immersive.<br /><br />\\"Oz the Great and Powerful: Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy\\" is highly recommended!r />But for fans of the 1985 film \\"Return to Oz\\", despite it not doing well in the box office, fans of the L.

B0063M22QO|5.0|Great game keeps your mind sharp and improves your attitude.Will continue to enjoy during my freetime.I like to win at anything I do,so this is great!!!!!!<br />.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I loved this movie. From the first time I saw this film, it became one of my favorite films. The real standout performance to me was Leo DeCaprio. As far as the use of the dreaded n-word, get over it folks. This movie is set two years before the civil war in the south and if the n-word wasn't used the movie wouldn't ring true at all.
159463176X|2.0|Being a huge fan of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, read the glorious reviews of And the Mountains Echoed, I could not wait to read this book.  I've been waiting years for Khaled Hosseini to come out with a new book. I finished it today and I have to disappointingly say I did not like it.  I don't feel as a reader that I got to know the characters well and found myself wanting to know more about them, what happened to them, etc etc.  I did not think it was necessary at all to write pages and pages of Markos.  Yes, Nabi left him a crucial letter, but Markos was not even a main character.  I want to know how it came about that the cousin ended up paying for Roshi's surgery.  What happened to Pari's early years in Paris.  How did Pari being taken away affect Saboor and Abdullah's relationship?  So many unanswered questions - for me personally.  I don't feel satisfied and put the book down and sadly cannot recommend it.

B0033AI4PM|4.0|Fanny Brice will forever be known for her contribution as a Ziegfield girl during the early 1900′s, her work as an accomplished illustrated song model, comedian, singer, theater and film actress but possibly for creating the top-rated radio series, \\"The Baby Snooks Show\\".<br /><br />For well-known producer and Brice's son-in-law Ray Stark, he commissioned an authorized biography of Brice using the various taped recollections she had dictated, but was not too thrilled by it.<br /><br />While it cost Stark $50,000 to stop the publication of the biography titled \\"The Fabulous Fanny\\", Stark then wanted to create a biopic but of the ten writers who wrote the screenplay, none were good enough for the producer.<br /><br />But reading the screenplay, Broadway star Mary Martin recommended to Stark of possibly making a musical of Fanny Brice's career and Isobel Lennart would begin writing the musical loosely based on the life of Brice and her stormy relationship with entrepreneur and gambler Nicky Arnstein.<br /><br />But after a few troubles of finding a Jewish star to portray Brice, it was recommended that Barbara Streisand, star of the musical \\"Can Get It For You Wholesale\\" to be given the opportunity.<br /><br />And by 1964, after 17 previews and revisions, the Broadway production of \\"Funny Girl\\" began.  13 years after the death of Fanny Brice, who died at the age of 59 in 1951.<br /><br />By 1968, filmmaker William Wyler (\\"Ben Hur\\", \\"Roman Holiday\\", \\"The Best Years of Our Lives\\") would begin working on the film adaptation of the musical.  Barbara Streisand would reprise her role as Fanny Brice and her role would earn her an Academy Award for Best Actress, shared with Katharine Hepburn for \\"The Lion in the Winter\\".<br /><br />The film would also become the box office winner of 1968 in the U.S. and the American Film Institute would rank the film in 2006 as the #16 musical of all time.<br /><br />And in 2013, the all-new 4K restoration re-mastered in HD from a 4K source was released on Blu-ray in April 2013.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Funny Girl\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  The film received a 4K restoration from an original 4K source and is presented in HD via Blu-ray for the very first time.  The colors are absolutely beautiful and there is a fair amount of grain that can be seen throughout the film.<br /><br />The detail for the film is much better than the original DVD when it comes to detail and vibrant colors.  Detail is much more apparent and where backgrounds were a bit blurry on the DVD release, now you can see details that are much more apparent.  But the biggest difference are how robust the colors are on Blu-ray.  No doubt that this is the best looking version of the film to date.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />As for the lossless audio, \\"Funny Girl\\" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and French, German and Spanish 5.0 Dolby Digital.  Dialogue and music is clear and this is probably the best we will hear of \\"Funny Girl\\".  One may wish for a bit more music immersiveness  with the soundtrack but it stays true to the original and sounds crystal clear.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, Arabic, Chinese (traditional and simplified), French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Thai and Turkish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Funny Girl\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Barbara in Movieland - (10:09) A classic featurette from 1969 about how Charlie Peterson's train station was used for the filming of \\"Funny Girl\\" and behind-the-scenes footage from the film but also how Peterson was also given a role for the film by director William Wyler.<br />  This is Streisand - (5:34) An old 1968 featurette introducing musical star Barbara Streisand and her film debut for \\"Funny Girl\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />As a fan of silent films and early cinema, especially early radio, I was first introduced to Fanny Brice through the radio program \\"The Baby Snooks Show\\".<br /><br />As a frequent follower of old time radio, discovering Fanny Brice led me to the loose adaptation of her life in \\"Funny Girl\\" but also was the film that helped introduce me to Barbara Streisand, as my only knowledge of the actress was through \\"The Way We Were\\" and \\"Lentl\\".<br /><br />But there is no doubt that I can see the attraction to Streisand as an actress.  From her incredible voice and sassy-ness, similar to the character she plays, she is a natural talent born for the stage and in the case of \\"Funny Girl\\", while considered a loose adaptation, possibly the latest Fanny Brice would have been thrilled to see about the character portrayal.<br /><br />I agree with film critic Pauline Kael who wrote about Streisand, \\"There's hardly a star in American movies today, and if we've got so used to the absence of stars in that we no longer think about it much, we've also lost on of the great pleasures of moviegoing: watching incandescent people up there, more intense and dazzling than people we ordinarily encounter in life, and far more charming that the extraordinary people we encounter, because the ones up on screen are objects of pure contemplation-like athletes all wound up in the stress of competition - and we don't have to undergo the frenzy or the risks of being involved with them.\\"<br /><br />The musical of \\"Funny Girl\\" is supported by fans, especially for its music with songs such as \\"People\\" and \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" sung by the character of Brice and \\"You Are Woman\\" by the characters of Nick Arnstein and Fanny Brice.  But it was also a positive film about one woman with confidence that she has the talent to make it big, even if those around her, thought of her as not so beautiful or judgmental.  Yes, both Streisand and even Brice had an identifiable nose, so what?  Hollywood musicals have been to ingrained with the idea that a woman must have the look of a super starlet in order to drive box office sales, but Streisand, who is beautiful but also talented, goes to show how she can sparkle and dazzle the audience with her acting and outstanding voice.<br /><br />And because of her delivery, she makes the dialogue seem natural.  And I can see why many film critics went crazy for this film and for Barbara Streisand, she was a rarity then and even now, you don't see actresses who have that much talent and still entertain audiences and filling up seats decades later.<br /><br />And while the film is slightly positive for both Fanny Brice and Nick Arnstein, the film is entertainment and while taken care of by Brice's son-in-law and popular Hollywood producer Ray Stark, I do feel it's important for people to know that the film is primarily non-fiction with a few facts of the actual Brice and Arnstein mixed in to the overall story.<br /><br />For one, Fanny Brice was not a struggling singer, she came from a well-off family.  Baby Snooks was not created during her time at Ziegfeld and possibly the two major factual omissions to the film was that in real life, Arnstein was married to another woman before marrying Fanny and that he was busted by authorities twice.  And unlike the film, Brice had two children that she took care of, while Arnstein disappeared from their lives temporarily.<br /><br />While the divorce was mutual, the facts are that the real Fanny Brice did all she could for her family and even spent a lot of money in order to defend Arnstein.  While their relationship on the film seemed problematic due to his illegal business dealings, the fact is that things were not as simple as it was in the film.<br /><br />Granted, I'm sure it was difficult for Ray Stark and that is why there were so many writers taking a chance on this storyline, hoping one would appease him.  For Stark, his mother-in-law did not want her biography being published with the audio dictations that were done.  And while the musical and the film came years after her death, Arnstein was stillalive when the musical was made.<br /><br />I suppose that in order to appease both sides, to create something entertaining and a musical was more appealing to audiences and the fact that the musical had done so well, it's confirmation that people loved the melodramatic aspect of the storyline, the music and of course, the performance by Barbara Streisand, who brought that excitement from the stage to the big screen.<br /><br />And here we are in 2013 with a restoration of the film in 4K.  The film looks fantastic and better than any video incarnation released so far.  The film manages to capture the colors, the details and even backgrounds or people in the background are seen with much clarity than the previous DVD release.  And the lossless soundtrack is in HD!  And you also get two classic short special features included with this release as well.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Funny Girl\\" is an enjoyable musical, while not the great American musical to appear on film, it's one of the most memorable musicals thanks to the performance of Barbara Streisand.  If there is a film that captures the slogan of \\"A Star is Born\\", then \\"Funny Girl\\" is that film as it introduced the world to the amazing talent of Barbara Streisand.  And the film has never looked as brilliant as it does now on Blu-ray.... Highly recommended!les, but Streisand, who is beautiful but also talented, goes to show how she can sparkle and dazzle the audience with her acting and outstanding voice.<br /><br />And because of her delivery, she makes the dialogue seem natural.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender is a child in a future world where having a third child isn't done anymore. But it's allowed as long as he is taken into the military at the age of six, with the high hopes that he is the genius they're in need of to save them from the 'buggers,' or the bug-like alien race that is threatening Earth.<br /><br />I think what I enjoyed the most about 'Ender's Game' is that it is just as much about the inner conflicts that the characters in here face as it is about saving the world. Ender has to face off against bullies, his own demons and society's high expectations of him constantly, till you think he's going to break and give up.<br /><br />Everything in here is woven intelligently into the plot which builds up to a great ending. I'll have to pick up 'Speaker of the Dead' to see how Ender's ventures continue, as the ending also leaves much to further explore in this series.
0385474547|5.0|I have been told that Chinua Achebe's African Trilogy constitutes \\"The Great African Novel\\".  I can't and won't speak for that high praise.  However, having read the first in the series, \\"Things Fall Apart\\", I can state that I believe Mr. Achebe HAS succeeded in illustrating how times (with a big push from the colonial powers) altered tribal living in at least one part of Africa.<br /><br />Articles and books have been written analyzing this work; I won't presume to add my analysis on top of those scholarly works.  I WILL state that I was impressed by Mr. Achebe's narration; how he described events within and around the community without making it sound like he was explaining them to an outsider.  He would casually mention something that OF COURSE we would all know about, like \\"The Royal Python\\".  Then, in the same breath, describe it and its significance in such a way that it felt as though it was just a continuation of the story rather than a sidebar explanation for us poor outsiders.<br /><br />As someone who normally reads mysteries and thrillers, I can't say that Mr. Achebe grabbed me by the throat (or otherwise) and refused to let go.  HOWEVER, he did succeed in holding my interest; something that many other highly praised works of literature fail to do.  We all know of - and sometimes ourselves feel like - a man like Okonkwo, comfortable in the knowledge of how things were and how they still are, until facing the truth that those ways are changing, perhaps forever.  It is because of that commonality that this novel can touch anyone, no matter their country or circumstances.<br /><br />5 stars, Mr. Achebe.  I only wish I'd gotten to this a few months earlier, so that you could have celebrated this rating with us before your passing.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is a awesome game!  It is so cool that the birds are made after some marvle super heros you should get it!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|angry birds is a lot of fun. keeps us entertained for hours. the music is not annoying. everyone enjoys the game. great way to take out frustration.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer has maintained the fast pace, twists and turns and intrigue to make this book a page turner.  Having read the first three books of The Clifton Chronicles I am anxiously awaiting the next chapter.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very fun game and it updates a lot and soon Xbox ,computer ,and phone will all be the same so it's pretty cool game and a lot of building and pretty good quality.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game. Look forward to more levels. The more challenging the better. I love free games that also have quality.
014242613X|3.0|I cannot get into these children's books. The Pelican Brief is a fleeting memory interrupted only briefly by an occasional Litigators. Just me. Not going to get exited about (or pay the premium price for) another of his books.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|I bought this for my son's birthday. He loves this show. Personally I lost interest in this series some where in season 2.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|ADD KINGDOM RUSH FRONTIERS TO KINDLE FIRE AND KINDLE FIRE HD PLEASE!!!!!!!!! I've been waiting for the game to  come out on PC but sadly, it never did. It's on the Apple products so PLLLLLEEEEEAAAAASSSSEEEE get it on Amazon. :)
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I love Ken Follett's writing because his novels appear to be based on true historical facts and they are very suspenseful..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the care for this game is so realistic and the graphics are amazing. I highly recomend if you are looking for a realistic horse care game like I was. love it!
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Now this is what we've been waiting for.  Geoff Tate's version of the 'Ryche is a sad version.  A saxophone doesn't belong anywhere near Queensryche's music.  Todd is a great addition to the band and they guys sound better than ever.  I can't wait to see them in a few week.  Being from Seattle, I've watched these guys grow up and unfortunately, break apart.  I really think this is a major step forward in the evolution of the 'Ryche!
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|I thought it was super cool. Said my 7 year-old, he loves Lego s and super hero s so this was a good combination of both we would definitely watch it again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a great book!! So addicting you will not put it down ever! Great download for your kindle! Once you read it watch the movie
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I was expecting a touching story, but was not prepared for the humor all through the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series can do no wrong with me. The Governor should be applauded for his role...pure, unadulterated evil. Genius. I missed Shane's craziness, but the Governor was fantastic! David Morrissey was made for this role.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, nice challenging puzzles, beautiful.  Fun, thinking game,but only a couple hrs to finish.  I want more from this developer!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this game for my the year old who loves horses. It's a little complicated for her, but she loves petting and feeding it. Awesome that it's free!
B0010T0JBA|3.0|I bought these to wear to work, they looked great feel great but it really bothered me that the bottom soul keep peeling making me feel like I am going to trip. I have wore them for a week and had to glue them with super glue 3 times already.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Not Thrones but a fun read all the same.  Took me a bit to get into first book but worth a bit of slogging.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I'm not good at keeping up with sagas that are shown weekly. I forget and/or forget to tape for later. So I bought the complete seasons (so far) and am greatly enjoying them. This saga is so well written and entertaining for all. Anyone that watches will be hooked on it. Can't wait till series 4 starts.<br />Enjoy. I certainly did.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|A simple film with genuine personalities that tells us to open our eyes and see things the way they really are.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I liked the description of the story, I am a Twilight fan but the vampire theme has been so overdone.  I liked the characters in the book, although there was not a lot of action it was a well placed read.  I look forward to reading the other books in the series.  I would recommend this book to young adults and anyone who likes a good love story.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Every bit as fun as Cut The Rope but makes playing with your food more fun than it ought to be.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins has created a thrilling, tragically realistic saga of the emotional and mental trauma caused by war and violence. Her trilogy, set in a dystopian future America, explores the limits of human cruelty and the far-reaching individual consequences from the perspective of a teenage girl caught up in events she does not understand.<br />Katniss, the heroine, struggles throughout the series with her increasing symptoms of PTSD, including difficulty determining truth in a shifting political morass. Her courage and grit shine through her inner turmoil and self-doubt, as she pieces her broken life back together in &#34;Mockingjay,&#34; the final chapter in the Hunger Games tale.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Love love love. Darn read this in one day!!! Great writing , great, great story, great characters.  Waiting on the next book!
1250039037|5.0|This is the second book in this series. They're the type you can't put down and are disappointed when they're finished! Can't wait until the 3rd book comes out! These books have a little something in them for everyone. Jeffrey Archer is an amazing writer. So much detail and action. He puts you right in the moment. I'm also reading his other books. Just wish he could put them out faster. Archer is a great entertainer and does not disappoint!
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Great fun following Rachel's ups and downs in life. I found it a nice, easy read with plenty of laughs throughout. Recommend for a holiday read.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|The development of the Chimp from the earliest point in the movie is well played out.  It's an amazing look at the masterful manipulation of animal behavior involving the simian species as it counteracts the malevatent actions of their sadistic captors.  Well worth the viewing.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great graphics, cool storyline and just the right length! One of my favorite HO adventures ever! Bring on #2! Can't wait! Got a little annoying being harassed constantly to rate it but not enough for penalties!<br /><br />One thing I freaking hate is playing a couple levels and then can't continue till I pay for the full version! More and more games are doing the same thing! It's a no-brainer that if you charge full amount at the beginning, your customers would not get so annoyed and irritated! Your creativity would speak for itself and word of mouth would and should measure your success rather than souring a customer in a way that seems sneaky and shady! A LOT of developers' apps do the same thing so I don't feel quite right bashing a really really fun and good game!
B002QZ399G|3.0|I had a hard time following because it wasn't a fluid story, the scene changed too fast between plots and different characters
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG can't wait til the next book.  Then I go to her website and they are going to be making a tv series.  I can't contain my excitement.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|Perfect movie for children. You do not have to worry about them seeing  anything not appropriate . Uplifting and fun musical with a meaning
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Each level gets more interesting and challenging which is great. Really enjoy the use of two rooms and the randomness of objects used to help escape the room. Great game for thinking outside the box and using what you have to solve a clue. Love it! Definitely recommend it!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Great action movie.  Jeremy Renner is a very suitable substitute for Matt Damon's character.  Look forward to other Jeremy Renner action fils in the future.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have enjoyed this game as far back as 0.4 and it has improved immensely. At this point there are only a few things left that I can think of to add. Stained glass, fireworks, and some more commands such as random tick speed or stacking mobs. Overall, worth the money. And\or the few years I've spent on it.
B00881VLCE|2.0|OH MY GOD - THIS USED TO BE MY FAVORITE APP - DOWNLOADED THE UPDATE TODAY AND IT IS AWFUL - WONT DOWNLOAD MY PURCHASED PUZZLES - WONT LET THE PIECES MOVE SMOOTHLY - @@@@ AND I SO LOVED THIS GAME
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game definitely kept me hunting and wanting to solve. I've played similar games, but this was much better.<br />I hope more levels are available soon.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|its a cool fun game to play to swim under the deep water and eat fish like sharks to I love it
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Loved the unexpected twists and turns.  You are kept guessing most of the time.  Impossible to put down - read it in one day
B009MF5BXK|5.0|From the initial action scenes to the end of the movie, Stalone and company project a fearless approach toward over-powering enemy numbers.  Would have enjoyed seeing Jet Li play a more significant part, but the play in lines during all facets of action/inaction contribute immensely to the major players' dedication toward accomplishing the mission.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Brilliant serious but again the same trouble of no subtitles with uk dvds which is a rip off.  I think it is a shame the company starz did not learn from my and others complaints about this.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Another look at the man that changed the world. Great lnformation about<br />his life and all he had to overcome. Well put together. Makes you wonder<br />what he could have done without all the bad times.<br />Thanks for the great book.<br /><br />Brad
B0012CH350|5.0|This is a very nice cover for an 18 inch Weber.  It fits perfectly and looks nice.  So far it has not had to deal with too much rain, but I plan on leaving it outside all year and I suspect it will do fine.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Solid zombie book.  Slightly different point of view or perspective.  Would have liked stories that intertwined but the style is fitting.  Realistic that is.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I really enjoy playing this, but and hadn't played magic for years. Easy to get back into it and have fun.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|The aerial battles involving Red Tail Black fighter pilots is adventurous with breath-taking aerial engagements with German enemy pilots.  A realistic perspective on how the pilots meld together to form a bond that is undeniably solid through their desire to demonstrate their ability fly missions with fierce determination and bravery.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|I loved this movie!  It started off a little slow, but once it picked up, the action never stopped. \\"Git-yo-hands-off-my-JORDANS!\\" This was a great line in the movie by Jamie Foxx, the audience was roaring with laughter.  I can't wait for the DVD to add to my collection.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|a lot of music on this video in the peak of their career.this is a great performance.if you like supertramp check it out.you won't be disappointed.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Easy to learn and addictive. I do wish that there were more options for the card themes. I like the clock function a lot.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|That's the AMERICAN AMAZING GAME!!!!!!!!!!!! :)  it`s pretty good  game but why can't you buy the whole game free?? It's just waste of space....
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This is my first Blake CD, I purchased this for one song &#34;Boys Round Here&#34; The entire CD is AWESOME! It is our new favorite CD, Thanks Blake and Amazon.com!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|John Carter transition from the Old West to Mars via a dimensional portal is a fun experience as he deals with native inhabitants on the Martian world.  The action is solid, if not unbelievably provided in the sense of true fantasy throughout the movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really like this kind of thing! Moving on to Season 3 now. When will they start season 4? any more?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|tricky yet not too hard to figure out. definitely one I enjoying playing. great brain workout. Will reccomend to others.
B000A0K2JO|3.0|Did not work for 'my' USB keyboard,of course I am not the most tech savy guy.I'm sure it's not the product and that I will find what I need to make this work eventually.Probably the PS/2 driver download for my computer.Always nice to be able to save USB ports though.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Love the game but you can only get the new update by getting Bad Piggies Premium! I mean,that's ridiculous! I'm not going to spend my money on the same exact game for a few new levels! I'm perfectly good with my free version even if it's a little behind updatewise.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. Beware that you will become addicted after the first level. It's challenging and dunb at the same time. Great for exercising and stimulating the brain.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Very well acted, with a good cast of characters. Interesting story line with a mix of battle, community and personal situations.
B00280LYIM|5.0|The book was amazing I keep reading over and over. It is a Great book I recommend it to you.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|I can't say enough about this song. I first heard it at the gay pride pararde this year and I couldn't wait to download it. I can't help but get up and dance whenever I hear it. The beat is infectious and it's a great party song. I LOVE IT!!!!
0761169253|5.0|dIRECT,SIMPLE,INTELLIGENT,WITHOUT THE NEED OF MORE WORDS AS REQUIRED BY YOU GUYS,TO TELL THE BOOK IS VERY GOOD SO i RATED IT WITH FOUR STARS...ok?dIRECT,SIMPLE,INTELLIGENT USEFUL CONCISE.!!!ok?<br /><br />five STARS...mY MISTAKE
B004UID2LC|4.0|I've seen some people give one star because there was some add / update. That hasn't happened to me yet, so so far, this app is great! It let's you save the videos you love, but sometimes it won't let you play the video. Example: So there is this hamster called &quot;Hammy the Hamster&quot;, And the videos are hilarious! I was trying to play a video, and it took forever. When it finally was ready, it said this file cannot be played, after I waited like 10 Minutes! Otherwise, the app is great! You should probably downloaded it. But if an annoying add pops up, don't blame me!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun hidden game. there are no clues though you just have to start pressing on everything to reveal puzzles or number codes. once you have everything solved you can leave the room. I wish there were more levels because once you get started its hard to stop
1781162646|3.0|This attempts to combine King's usual supernatural with a whodunnit and it doesn't work very well for me.<br />R. Miller<br />Roseville, CA
1781162646|4.0|This is a pretty good quick read.  Centered around an amusement park in 1973 involving a murder mystery and supernatural element.  Not his greatest work (nothing may top The Stand in my eyes) but far from worst.  Perfect for a rainy weekend or relaxing on a beach.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I started to watch this movie on TV and decided not to stay up to the early morning to finish watching.  I hated the advertisements so decided to order and own it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A good book, interesting and well rounded characters, however after the &#34;Kiterunner&#34;, and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; I was mildly disappointed.
1617751588|5.0|Very Funny Series! The whole family loves all Simon's Cat!! Great gift idea for a birthday or Christmas. Highly recommended!!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|i so much cannot wait to get the third season in the mail.i love this show so much and i been waiting for two years to own it...finally it is mine .on time in a quick manner great shipping and handling.ease of order was great.thanx amazon....cannot wait for the third season already...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the romance and the action. And how it has like the romance side for girls and the action for boys. AWESOME BOOK!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
B00B23O96A|4.0|I am a bit biased. EC in my view has never released anything bad or un enjoyable. He has taken a few standards here and put his twist on them...a must buy
B000J3OTSM|5.0|Good plot. Many different social issues. Entertaining, characters were believable, acting was good. Certainly the main characters had chemistry, considering they are married in real life now. The choreography was good.<br />This movie was the first in the step up movies, it is my favorite.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|4yr old grandson played but we were charged $19.99 once played. Hard time removing. Make sure you have control set so can't buy while playing game.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I couldln't get enough of this series.  Happy to be able to purchase it and plan to watch it again.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|i love how easy it is,super quick to download and immediately worx.the price is totally fair.i would be a return customer
140053271X|5.0|though the shelving system is quite troublesome and i don't have the option to delete books from the nook, it certainly serves well as an ereader
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Every song has the the Boz Scaggs trademark and guitar style Good driving music to say the least! Looking for the next go around for sure
0060555661|5.0|This book explains investments thoroughly enough for me to understand and invest wisely even in difficult times. I have made a profit on 3 investments so far.
0385535147|5.0|Another great one  by the great Grisham. Unpredictable and clever as usual. Broad in scope and surprising cultural understanding. When's the next one?
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|In spite of the coarse language and violent content I believe this series gives &#34;somewhat&#34; realistic view of the corruption of this era...love the characters.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|i cant believe i actually own this show now.i cant wait to watch the second season i absolutely love this show and am so happy with my order the product and the shipping.it came to me quick too.didnt have to wait at all.thanx amazon
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|The game was good and had nice graphics. Played on my Kindle Fire HD with no problems. Game was only four levels. Not what I expected for $1.99. Hoping additional content will be made available.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This is the last story in the Old Mans War  trilogy.  Bummer.<br />  It was one hell of a good ride for me , and seriously depleted my Amazon account . I had  to buy all three after having read the first one ,  read them over two days on my Kindle. It was worth EVERY Penny.  Having \\"discovered\\" John Scalzi , I will probably have to spend  even more  for the rest of his books in the Amazon book store.....  The up side is there are MORE books to buy !<br />  Nilo52
B001KZG99A|4.0|I put off watching this movie for a while.  I thought it would be a waste of my time but it turned out to be entertaining and I liked all the actors.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|it works perfectly. i had already sharpened a few knives and it did its job. i got it for my dad for fathers day and he likes it
0345803485|5.0|This book is heavily detailed,as you read about Mr.Grey you become the place of Anna. Whew! I need a cold shower.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the ability to access this at any time on my phone.  The Plans have great resources to further develop Bible growth.  I just love it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Would recommend this set of discs.  I have a blu-ray and reg. dvd player... nice to have both discs.  Thank you!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Like the story line, really mysterious...Great graphics and animation. Like being interactive with the story and makes you really look for the clues and hidden objects.
0062255657|1.0|Please make no mistakes... This is a nice little story that I enjoyed reading. However, I think you need to place more emphasis on the word \\"little\\".<br /><br />With undersized pages and a large typeface, this story still only totals 181 pages. I finished the whole thing in under 2 hours... and I'm a slow reader.<br /><br />Dare I say it... Without getting fanboy-bashed?<br />I am surprised the publisher and the author had the nerve to title this \\"Ocean at the End of the Lane -- a Novel\\". Neil Gaiman is familiar with quaint, underused but apt words. If he had called this a \\"novella\\" or a \\"two hour mystery\\", I would have had more realistic expectations.<br /><br />It's also not as good as \\"The Graveyard Book\\", but it's written in the same vein.<br />Vulnerable boy ends up in an unpleasant situation. Supernatural villain interferes with his life. Boy has friends who attempt to aid him. Change some names and details, tone down the originality, and voila! The same story!<br /><br />Sorry Neil... For the first time in decades, I'll think twice before I buy a story with your name on it. I guess I'm not as loyal as I thought I was.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I found this book very helpful in formulating my book for the Kindle. I would recommend it to all writers.
159514188X|5.0|This book shows the effect that one action can have on someones life a great read for teens! Great for suicide/self-harmers.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|My daughter is 15, it has been a struggle this past year with her starting high school.  After reading this, I feel stunned and unable to read again.  Too much, too personal.  Amazing story but it leaves you sad and without words questioning your parenting.  But it also opened my eyes to deal head on with my baby, my life, my love, my daughter.  Thank you
B0002JJBZY|5.0|I am 66 years old and have enjoyed Star Trek for many years.  After watching reruns for all those years I figured that I had seen all the shows...  WRONG!!!!  After watching all the shows (some 60 to 70) I lost count at about 12 -15 shows I had never seen.  Some people said they wanted the newer remastered show with the new special effects.  I did not.  The special effects did not take over the show...It was the great acting and writing that made the show.  I love to see the slightly fuzzy Star ships and the cheesy special effect... They bring back wonderful memories of watching them for the first time.  I hope you enjoy them too!!!!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I've seen other reviews accusing the group of \\"doctoring\\" up the sound for the cd.<br /><br />But I saw them live in Berkeley and there was nothing to \\"doctor up\\"!  They came out smoking and left it smoking!<br />Yes they're getting old; can't hide that but they still sounded great, which speaks to their greatness over the years.  They still sound good at 70!<br /><br />Tight vocals with the help of a sound backing band; both vocally and musically.<br />Trust me you weren't cheated if you saw them live: they sounded great and they sound great on these 2 cd's.<br /><br />I only wish the DVD was reflective of their live show as were the CD's.<br /><br />I also wish they recorded the Berkeley show as the crowd was LOUD in them thar echoing hills!<br /><br />Great concert; great cd's worth getting
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|I've bee waiting for this app to come out for the kindle and now it's here, thanks guys for bringing it to the kindle. :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had no expectations for this book when I bought it. I was pleasantly caught by surprise at what a great story it was and how well it was written. I cannot wait to read more of Mr. Howey's work!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game, is challenging, entertaining, fun, and it will keep you wanting more of it. I totally recommend this game to anybody.
1423124111|5.0|I'm a huge Disney fan and always enjoy reading about the origins of anything Disney-related.  This book not only provides a catalogue of the poster art from attractions old and new, but also adds some background to the artists, techniques, and styles of said posters.  I really fun read and great coffee-table book!
B008858OFM|5.0|I love this movie because it is based upon a true story.  I love the dedication to herself and strong will.
0307960471|5.0|If you love great drama, great writing, believable plots and imperfect characters -- this story is definitely for you. Jo Nesbro does a fine job of bringing the reader back into the world of Harry Hole.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Every Season of Supernatural, should have a shrine built to it's episodes, and Season Eight, through the Amazon Instant Video, is no exception.<br /><br />Kudos to Amazon for offering me an instant, mobile and private way for viewing my two favorite men, Dean and Sam.<br /><br />I challenge new and existing fans of Supernatural, to view these Instant episodes on your own, then close your eyes and daydream your own lavish ideas.<br /><br />Most respectfully,<br />bigyellowworm@gmail.com
B00CWM3F4C|1.0|NOTHING TO COMPARE TO THE FIRST RECORDS, YEA THE GUITARS, THE MELODIES, FOR FALLING SLEEP AND HAVE NIGHTMARES, TO MUCH WASTE OF TALENT, C'MON  THE MOST BORING RECORD....
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Reasonably well done.  A lot of depth and it is nice to understand some of the verbiage from the tv series.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved all three books!  I have even gone back and re-read different parts of each book.  I hope she comes out with more books.  I'll read each and every one of them.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|I swear this movie is one of the best animated movie that has come out in the past many years.  I loved it and would have watched it over and over and over again at the movie theater if I had the money! My daughters really loved it too and we are waiting to buy it as soon as it comes out.  Who knows how many times we will watch it before we finally slow but I can tell you it will be a lot.<br /><br />I really feel like to get the most enjoyment you have to have kids to truly appreciate many of the jokes.  Now mind you, you can enjoy the movie even if you don't have kids but I have noticed that a lot of the reviews that call this movie sub-par are without children.<br /><br />Yes the cavemen are predictable but hey who cares.  It was a fun, enjoyable, happy movie.  I liked this movie from the beginning to the end.  And probably my favorite part of the movie is how they sleep in a big ball.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoy this whole series. I enjoy the characters. I am not smarter because I read this book, but I was entertained.
1781162646|1.0|Way too long for character development which were all pretty empty, save the shooter and her kid. Corrosive language was disjointed to some characters and/or situations. Story did not pick up until the mystery was virtually solved nearly close to the end of this weepy story. I, personally, was very disappointed. It read like an amateur author that had an obligation to comply, and time constraints. And, yes, I know Stephen King wrote this rotten egg.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I really loved the character development.  All of the people were real enough to connect with in the story.  That only thing that was a little dreary was Calin's so called disability.  He was definitely a spoiled brat. Luckily he was able to overcome this attitude with his friends help and became a decent young boy.  I would read this again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love checking my weather forecast for the day. store I leave for work each day.  I. travel between locations and schools.  Thanks for agreat app.
1452101248|5.0|This is the vegetarian cookbook for omnivores.  The photos are lovely and the recipes complex to the taste but not too complex for the home cook.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The original Bond character as conceived by Ian Fleming was edgy.  Daniel Craig has managed to maintain this throughout all of his Bond films.  The way they made the plot of Skyfall a bit old school I thought was brilliant.  It was refreshing to see Bond rely on resourcefulness and cunning to defeat the villain instead of loads of high-tech gadgetry.  It was also great to see Bond as a bit human.  Although I will miss Judy Dench as M, the way they made the transition from the old M to the new was also brilliant - especially their selection for the new M.  As a car guy, it was great to see the old DB-5 back in action!  And finally, they brought back Moneypenny - excellent!  If you are a Bond fan, I highly recommend seeing Skyfall.
B00756GRUE|4.0|I bought the watch today and am very happy with my purchase. The watch is beautiful and is the only one you will need for night or day. It is hefty and has weight to it. I like this as my everyday watch. We live near the beach and with two kids it is a very popular place. I do not worry about this holding up to the Ocean or pool. I rated it 4 stars due to the size of the watch. Be aware how large it is. You still cant touch any watch for this price with this much value and style.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Duh! Love the Avengers.  This was a good buy and we are enjoying it over and over and over and over......
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great looking game, super fun.<br />It is pretty easy, but there were some parts that had me stumped. Can't wait for a new one.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I love to play this game. each one is more challenging than the one before it but mostly easy. my favorite is the the one where you have to manuver your car around the other cars. I would definitely recommend for ages 10 and up (general)
030759565X|5.0|Everyone needs to own this book.<br />Perelman understands how we cook in the real world (time, space, number of bowls to clean) and everything we made turned out better than anticipated.<br /><br />This will be my gift book for everyone regardless of their ability or proclivity to cook!
B0083DJUMA|5.0|As an artist who licenses my designs to mass market manufacturers, I found this to be a very interesting read.  I've been seeing the effects of rising wages in China and how it is affecting the retail market and manufacturers who supply them... Which also trickles back to me.  I'm really excited about the new possibilities I see for my work and how I can get it out into more niche markets with these changes in access and manufacturing.  I've already lost some sleep with so many ideas buzzing around in my head... Thanks Chris!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Great follow up story to two two wonderful books I would definitely recommend this book to lovers of this author
140053271X|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He didn't think he would use an e-reader.  The Nook is so easy to set up and use.  I have one too and we both read with them all the time.
160459201X|5.0|this author makes his point in a very simple way. he takes you from a to z with examples and explains it in simple words.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I watched the show first and the book is just as good or better.  I would recommend to any fan of the tv series who hasn't already read the book series.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|This game sucks mostly because the bubbles in the pot wer<br />e only partly random. After you get into the game a bit you start getting six or seven of the same color in a row all the time. Which makes it almost impossible to get a decent score. I don't mind a game being challenging but when it's because of a stupid reason I don't like it. If you get this game for free it's ok. But DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Fun and challenging game; I love the way the board changes from game to game which keeps the challenge fresh.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A wonderful insight into the life of an a person with Asperger's syndrome.  To all OCD's , we can laugh at ourselves
B000UVT3OI|5.0|You can easily why Garth Brooks is the biggest selling solo artist in the history of the record industry, 128 million albums.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is such a crazy ending but holds you to the very end. The characters were very interesting and warped.
B000WYF2FW|5.0|I also own this on vinyl, but was worried about ruining the record with how often I play this album.<br /><br />Essentially a three record album of all of the music, poetry, and creativity that George was unable, for various reasons, to express while in the Beatles.<br /><br />A must have for any music fan.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|it was by far my favorite book by this author,made you not want to put the book down the whole time :)
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Great puzzles.  I had heard this was a good puzzle game, but I had no idea that I'd love this as much as i do.. I've replayed this 5 times, and always a new ending.. great fun!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I chose my rating because of the creative, insightful talents of the author. Always a joy to read his writings. I have read all of them.<br /><br />Sometimes I had difficulty with the backwards/forwards flashbacks of the lives and time frame of the the characters, which often  appeared disjointed and difficult to connect.<br /><br />How the changing face of Afghanistan  impacts the lives of its citizens was soul  reaching. I definitely enjoyed this book and would recommend it.
B009GED3HS|4.0|I had stopped watching HIMYM most of season 6 and 7, when it was airing on tv.  I had pretty much religiously watched all other seasons, but 6 and 7 got lame.  Season 8 was pretty good, better than the previous seasons.  I'm glad there is one more season left.  I can't wait to see his relationship with his &#34;wife&#34; and how it all goes together.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I loved the addition of Cole to the pack.  I feel he brings depth and a new perception to how it feels to be a wolf and why transformation would be coveted rather than scorned.  Wow! How much more rising action will be necessary to get Sam and Grace to forever.  Loved this novel...can't wait to dig into or shall I say sink my teeth into forever.
