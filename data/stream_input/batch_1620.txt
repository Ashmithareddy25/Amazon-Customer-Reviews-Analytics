B005EM8O8O|3.0|The Fear Index is an interesting read especially in light of the increasing importance of computerised trading in the world's financial markets. It also played to incipient fear we have of the  'machines taking over.' The book is fast paced and great for a long flight - which is exactly where I read it.<br /><br />My annoyance with this book is mainly technical. Unlike Harris's Pompeii or Cicero books, he uses omniscient perspective, meaning the point of view jumps around between characters mid-scene. While it can be useful to know where everyone is coming from, you really feel the presence of the author in the story.<br /><br />Nonetheless, a worthwhile book.<br /><br />In the same vein as Pompeii, btw, is [[ASIN:B008E1P7KA God King of Angkor: A Novel of Tyranny]]. Definitely one of the best historical novels in recent years.
B00846REIS|5.0|After having read 50 shades, I came across Bared to You and WOW is all I can say. The writing is much better than 50 shades, and now I'm torn as to who I'd want more, Gideon or Christian. Its been almost non stop in Bared from the beginning. Gideon tells Eva right up front what he wants .... the honesty between the characters is something else.  I've already pre-ordered books 2 and 3 and I can't wait for the 2nd book to be released. In this we learn a lot about Eva's past, but now it's time to learn about what's eating at Gideon... and who caused it.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Just as good as Where's My Water! So far really enjoying this game! Looking forward to new and exiting levels!
B008MZPUO6|5.0|This review will only be for the remastering as the merits of the recording are well established. The mono mix of this really will jump out of your speakers. The stereo mix for me was never that good. Also there was always some funny sounding echo which is not found here. The bottom end seems to have been given a slight boost. Again this is all my opinion. It is good to be able to purchase a mono mix of a classic album in cd form as many now are only being produced on Lp which I like many people I know have places in mothballs

The only way I could finish the book was  mentally listing all the paralels.  \\"I can't stay away from you; then don't\\" Ana- Bella, plain, smart, converse-wearing, clumsy girl? COME ON... Seattle, meadows,UGH! I guess anyone can be a writer. Oh it was entertaining to a point, then I'm thinking OMG not another boring, repetitive sex scene!! I started skimming over them just to get to the plot. Sorry I wasted my time.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I have no complaints, the shipping was fast, putting the batteries in was very easy, and the sonic screwdriver itself is brilliant. I just can't stop pressing the button to see it light up and make the noise; I love it. One of my favourites in my Doctor Who collection!

B0026772N8|5.0|This is a book I re-read every year or so for the past twenty years.<br /><br />I still get new things out of reading it.  It's a great reminder to me that sometimes the individual is right when the rest of society is wrong.<br /><br />It's well worth your time to read it.

0525953728|5.0|Being a female, I was unsure about buying \\"No Easy Day\\", the autobiographical book by Mark Owen. I am so glad I did. His account is reviting, humbling, and certainly revitalized my opinion and respect of all our military personnel! I couldn't put the book down until I finished it, but was saddened when I went to donate to the charities to help our servicemen and women that was in his book only to find out they refused my donation? His book had truly inspired \\"me\\" to give back! A must read for everyone. Thanks to Mark Owen, it took courage once more to tell the untold story!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game. wish I could find more like it. cant wait for game 2. keep up the awesome work.
B0053O89KG|5.0|First, let me clearly state that Castle is a television show I enjoy. I find it to be an entertaining dramadey with a talented and appealing cast. In contrast to many police procedurals, this is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously. Yes, accuracy and even continuity are frequently completely ignored, but the show remains a welcome escape. The writing usually includes interesting plot twists and amusing banter. And unlike many shows of this type the gore is kept to a tolerable minimum. The goal is to amuse with words rather than gross-out with blood and guts.<br /><br />For some reason the creators decided to radically change the tone of the show during season four going from light to dark. It reminded me of the comedy show Frasier when in season 6 he lost his job and the fun departed along with his radio show. Big mistake which was quickly rectified in season 7. Let's hope that Castle's upcoming season returns us to the strength of the show -- a light romantic dramadey with killer chemistry between the leads. The cast is blameless. They performed as well as possible given depressing material.<br /><br />No way around the fact that this was a disappointing season but the last episode was stellar. Well-constructed and genuinely romantic and passionate, the culmination of four years of longing, made all the more significant because of the lack-luster season.<br /><br />But, whether I think this season failed to live up to the previous three, or whether I think the writing drained the fun and tension from the interaction between Beckett and Castle, or whether I think the lighting and wardrobe guys hate some of the cast members, or whether I think whomever came up with the Elvis-themed episode should never be allowed to make another creative decision are all discussions of interest only to the most serious fans of the program, people who probably pre-ordered this DVD set and won't be reading reviews to decide whether to part with their hard-earned money and purchase the discs. So, my star rating will focus on the DVD set and its extras rather than my opinion of the show itself.<br /><br />The set is not high definition and is also not available in Blu-ray format but the quality is still good, and mirrors the prior seasons' sets. Sound is Dolby Digital 5.1. The DVDs look and sound good and I encountered no problem playing the discs. And, although initially excited to find significantly more bonus material included in Season four's set of five discs I was disappointed with some of the inclusions.<br /><br />The deleted scenes are always of interest, and one of the eight actually helped explain some dialog in the final episode - seeing the deleted scene provided greater clarity. Time constraints force these cuts and it is beneficial that DVD sets allow us the opportunity to view these scenes.<br /><br />The four minute blooper reel is easily the best of the four seasons - good enough that I found myself watching it a few times in a row. For those offended by such things, note that a number of scenes contained a bleeped-out profanity or two.<br /><br />Also included in the bonus material is a sixteen minute feature on the making of a special effects scene of Beckett's car going into the river from this season's two-part story. It was fascinating to watch from the creation of the storyboards, drawn scene by scene, down to the computer generated animation that created the actual visual of the car sinking. It was also interesting to see the two stunt doubles for the show's leads -- spooky how similar they looked to the actual actors.<br /><br />Three episodes featured commentary - each with a different group of cast and crew. The result was mixed but some interesting details were revealed during the discussions. I've heard better commentaries, and worse. Fillion (Castle) and Katic (Beckett) were featured on only one of the three episodes selected for commentary -- probably the worst of the bunch made so because the showrunner andhis writer/wife (paired with them) seemed uncomfortable. The commentary on the Blue Butterfly episode was the best.<br /><br />There is a feature on the Bowman father and son directing team which was interesting but a little too long -- my attention drifted. But the worst offender was the Fillion and Friends Castle Goes Radio. The title was blatantly misleading. I expected to see the Castle cast recreating a radio show and instead found a program unrelated to the show at all.<br /><br />The radio show is a bare bones production regularly performed by a troupe of actors designed to simulate a radio program performed in front of a live audience.  Nathan Fillion and Molly Quinn appeared as guests and were only on screen briefly. The feature had nothing to do with Castle. The pseudo radio show was mildly amusing and the actors seemed to be having a great time but the result was largely mediocre.<br /><br />Watching this was for me a waste of time and as a fan of the television series I felt manipulated into viewing it thinking it was Castle related. Bonus material needs to be relevant to the actual show -- that is what the purchaser is paying for - not just anything featuring some of the actors. If we are going that route soon these sets will include voice-over commercials for automobiles and beer.<br /><br />Over-all the set will please avid Castle fans, but if you haven't watched seasons one through three (at least most of three) do it -- don't judge the series by season four.<br />Rating -- four and a half stars (half a star deduction for unrelated bonus material) rounded up to five stars.his writer/wife (paired with them) seemed uncomfortable.

B005LAIGJQ|5.0|I never put much into an Eddie Murphy movie, but for some reason this movie wasn't bad. It actually made me think. The moments of funny were welcoming. I put it on par with his movie \\"Imagine That\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well,I may have missed the initial party,but it's never too late to become a Browncoat.I am proudly displaying my Browncoat beside the suits of The Federation,Earth Alliance and the Commonwealth(I will let you savvy TV Sci Fi fans figure out which show belongs to what suit!).This Joss Whedon treasure is as surefire winner,from the brilliant writing to the direction to the wonderful ensemble cast,as any of the aforementioned shows were.The only difference between those and this show is this one was cut off in its prime.After only 11 eps(including the 2 hour pilot) the show faded to black.Three shows were filmed and left unaired,but have thankfully found a home in this set.<br />Star Trek was originally compared to being a Wagon Train-like show set in the future.Well Firefly takes the Wagon Train element and brings it more literally to life than Star trek ever did.There are horses,wagons,six shooters,rifles,cattle,cowboys;all the things a good western needs and more.The shows premise harkens back to the US Civil War where the Union fought the Confederacy,here referred to as the Alliance against the Independents.The lead characters consider themselves all members of the latter.The Firefly class ship(it actually is reminiscent of said insect)is called Serenity,so named after the famous battle of Serenity Valley which two of the lead characters fought through and barely survived.It was the battle that ended the war between the two factions.The ship and crew now do odd jobs for odd characters,going where the pay takes them and generally trying to steer clear of the Alliance.What sets this Sci Fi series apart from its competitors is the decided lack of aliens.This series focuses more on the human factor;that is our own progression out into the galaxy and our colonization of it.Goodness knows there is enough writing fodder to be had concentrating solely on humans,without having to add the alien dynamic into the mix.And Joss Whedon successfully does just that.<br />The cast was a dream cast.Everything gelled perfectly.They were:Nathan Fillion as Malcolm Reynolds,Gina Torres as Zoe,Alan Tudyk as Wash,Morena Baccarin as Innara,Adam Baldwin as Jayne,Jewel Staite as Kaylee,Sean Maher as the Dr Tam,Summer Glau as River and finally Ron Glass as Book.Glass is well known from Barney Miller and Gina Torres is one of my fave kick butt-type characters from Xena,Hercules and Cleopatra 2020.The characters were brought vividly to life by each actor,and each had their own back story to tell,which fleshed out the entire feel of the show.<br />The entire set of eps in this DVD set are in w/s format,clear and crisp for the most part,and there are oodles of extras for all those dedicated Browncoats out there such as:a featurette on the making of the series,the ship,deleted scenes,a gag reel,and more.<br />I never saw the original series in its original airing(the only one out of the aforementioned others-if you have successfully guessed by now which ones they are-I didn't).But I heard alot about it and its' premature demise.The first thing I ever saw of Firefly was the movie Serenity(see my review on that)and loved it.I did not know then about the back story but now having viewed the original series,it all comes beautifully into focus.This set of four single sided discs is da bomb,believe me.This series will show you what intelligent TV writing can do and Whedon is to commended for his vision on this project.Whedon killed off some of the shows characters in the movie but there is no reason a renewed series couldn't just pick up where the original left off,with all the same people and have the movie as the final fade out of the series once it is done.But that takes vision and guts on the part of TV execs,which unfortunately is sadly lacking when they see shows that don't neatly fit within their prescribed parameters.<br />Well,the ever swelling ranks of Browncoats just added one more enthusiastic member.I urge you to buy this set and guarantee after you watch it,you will be joining up too!atch it,you will be joining up too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|im so glad they finally came out with an app for the kindle fire! very pleased use it every day!
B000FC1GJW|5.0|A wonderfully written book that brought to a close a great series. I must say, unfortunately, I was ever-so-slightly displeased with the ending. What felt like a huge, series-long build up was, on most points, a faint disappointment. Still, I am reminded it was a series meant for children/young teens, and the contents are certainly beautiful and well-written and convey a wondrous story.
1781161313|3.0|I ordered the book right off the bat when i saw it,expecting a rich detailed book with lots of schematics and detailed info on the USCM...<br /><br />And im a little disappointed to be honest. Dont get me wrong,there is lots of information on the organisation of the corps,the gear used etc,but its much more text-rich than image-rich. There is almost zero schematics,aside the UD40 dropship,most of the iconic gear from the movies is unexplored in favor of less known equipment such as missiles and radar systems. A few sparse images here and there illustrate quickly the given topic but are only there to block out the walls of text contained within.<br /><br />If you're looking for detailed information,this book is both good and bad. Its a strange combination of in-depth information and a lack of detail (like mentioned) on the things that made the Colonial Marines stand out. For a few quick examples,the pulse rifle and the smart gun are treated to two quick diagrams (no exploded views,just a lineart picture) and a page of text each,while complicated radar systems of the dropship get a 3 to 5 page covering. The iconic APC is glanced over in a page or two as well. Personally, its a lack of imagery and actual description of the important gear used in the films that brings points down on this book.<br /><br />Otherwise,i'd still recommend it to anyone looking for more insight into the heart of the USCM,just dont expect to know more than you already do. :(

B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest! I could spend hours on it if only the kindle app didn't prompt me to force it closed after only a short time of browsing. it is very easy to navigate and use otherwise I just wish it wouldn't keep shutting down on me:(
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Captain America: the First Avenger is one of the greatest movies ever! Chris Evans is an amazing actor, and in this movie he seems totally to really be in the time. All the characters actually seem to belong in the 1940's, not thrown in. I am a thirteen-year-old girl who likes Marvel in general, but anybody can appreciate the story of Steve Rogers, the guy who became Captain America.<br /><br />Unlike some other Marvel characters (e.g. Iron Man, who is very great but it has to be admitted is far from the perfect true hero), Steve is a really good, likable guy, who constantly tries to do what's right. He puts others before himself and is constantly showing self-sacrificing courage and honest humility. He is the ideal American and an amazing human being. To top it all off, he is - of course - the perfect soldier, thanks to an expirimental perfectionizing thing preformed on him by a generous scientist.<br /><br />Peggy, a British army recruit, is a great character as well. I always find it indredibly nice when people are able to create a female character who is strong, tough, and brave; yet she still gets to have an amazing man risk his life for her. That is what they have cleverly done with Peggy and Steve.<br /><br />I won't spoil the plot, but the ending is just sad. Alright... if you wanna know the sad ending, read the next paragraph. If you don't, then skip it. Just know the ending is sad, but not so sad that it's not worth watching. It's totally worth watching.<br /><br />SPOILER ENDING: So, after an amazing fight with the Red Skull, Steve ends up frozen in the ice, wakes up in a fake 40's hospital, realizes it's not real and breaks out, only to be dazzled by the 21st century before him. Suddenly he comes face to face with Commander Nick Fury of S.H.E.I.L.D., organizer of the Avengers. So it is that Captain America is called the First Avenger. And, Steve misses Peggy already (who according to other resources, i.e. comics, is still alive but is an old woman.) That's the sad ending.<br /><br />And so, the movie ends heartachingly, begging for a sequel. On to 2012's The Avengers! But basically, Captain America: the First Avenger is awesome. If you haven't yet, you should definitely watch it.

B0087HT36U|1.0|No idea how good or bad this game is, because it force-closes on Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus. Don't like Jelly Bean much, do you?<br /><br />What's more interesting is that all but three of the 5-star reviews share a complete disregard for capitalization. I'd guess they're written by the same miniclip employee, same as the reviews for all their other games.<br /><br />Tip: If a developer has enough time to write shill reviews, he's not spending time fixing bugs.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for removing the developer's comment from this review, the one where he launched a personal attack and called me some ugly names.<br /><br />That got my attention, miniclip, and I'll be sure to review all of your apps at my leisure.

0525953728|5.0|I have waited of this book since I heard it was to be released.  Took me 2 days and I had a hard time putting it down.  It's a first hand account of a man who tells his own story of growing up and how he became a Navy Seal.  He explains his motives, his being driven to succeed above all else and puts his own emotional and real life on hold to do a job for our country and our people.  I saw and heard the political account of the Bin Laden raid and killing and heard the leaks from the White House and all the nonsense of how Obama 'got Bin Laden.'  My ex husband is a retired Army Colonel and I lived the Army wife for 24 years.  The military life is NOT easy especially for a family and the men who put their own future on hold to protect this country are to be commended.<br /><br />I see NO 'secret intell' in this book that the political hacks are screaming about.  These men deserved to have a say in the telling of a historical event that took place in this world and their part in it.  They are heroes as are ALL those brave men and women who helped gather the info, plan the strategy and logistics and carry out the raid down to the pilots who kept them alive flying them in and out of the compound.  God be praised for getting all in and out alive.<br /><br />'Mark Owen' deserves a lot of credit for stepping up and doing what rightfully should have been done for these brave military personnel, telling a first hand account of a bad day for 'Osama Bin Laden'.  I wish it could have happened YEARS earlier. My deepest respect and heartfelt gratitude for what you and your people did and continue to do for our great country. God Bless 'Mark Owen' and those he served with.  Enjoy the rest of your life..............it is well deserved!

0345803485|5.0|A good book (def):  A book that is hard to put down and makes you wonder:  What's next?<br /><br />I borrowed this book to find out what all the chatter was about and I found out!<br /><br />This book fits my definition of a good book.  It was hard to put down, it's an easy read, you do get caught up in the characters, and I was wondering how this would turn out so I ended up reading all three.  *rolls eyes* :-)<br /><br />I must say I don't understand the vitriolic reviews about this trilogy and I have to wonder if perhpas they have an ulterior motive.  Repitition?  The paperback has about 500 pages to it.  If the characters roll their eyes 41 times that's about once every ten pages!  Jeez!  Is that really too repetitive? (I'll let the reader do the arithmatic on the other repetitions.)  Given the context in which they roll their eyes, or her inner goddess speaking, I found it humorous.<br /><br />Another complains about a twenty something being a billionare, flying a helicopter, a very good pianist and fluent if French.  Once I read that he does all of that in the book, I came to the conclusion this book is really fantasy.  Isn't that what ficiton is?  Particularly this type of genre?  *biting bottom lip*  :-)  Perhaps they should stick to reading biographies?  Of course the sex is fantasy.  *blushes*<br /><br />If you're on the fence about buying this book, my recommendation would be to buy it and read it.  Ignore. The. Vitriolic. Reviews.  :-)<br /><br />Enjoy!
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|My husband and I have watched all 'Underworld' movies and love them all.  I especially looked forward to THIS one since one of my favorite actors is Kris Holden Ried who plays a werewolf in the TV series 'Lost Girl' is also a Lycan in this sequel.  Action packed and graphically well done, I was disappointed Kris did not have a larger part - maybe 10 minutes over all before he was killed off.  The movie keeps you guessing and primed for more info in the NEXT film.  Worth the expense and entertainment.

B000FA5STS|5.0|Very good read from cover to cover. It was so exciting towards the end you felt like you were there. Almost every page had a twist and turn. Good ending with a opportunity to create another book starring Sidney and Sawyer.I like the way I can order from Amazon so the book is sent straight to my Kindle, also can read on my I Phone.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app. I find it very intuitive for many of the functions of pinterest - like browsing in particular topics or browsing your own boards. Repinning is a cinch, too. I like the large buttons for tapping on and easily scrollable pages. I find the display to be really clean as well, it never feels cluttered or cramped.<br /><br />The one complaint I do have is it will occassionally crash or won't load for no apparent reason. Once those kinks are worked out, it will be even better. Overall though, it's a great mobile app for pinterest addicts like me!

B006AZZPCM|5.0|this is the only app that allows you to download files and transfer to Pc. there are however some minor issues with the app. the download sometimes take a long time and then freeze. sometimes the app wont play a file and it will shut down unexpectly. other then that ive had good times with my mate.

074356619X|3.0|Well, as someone who has been reading, following some of the teachers and doing many processes regarding LOA and attracting (mainly Abraham-Hicks, but others as well) for many years, I agree-this is about LOA which is NO Secret. And it is very simplistic and it is not pragmatic or 'practical in that it presents these theories in a 'magical' fairy-dust way while not mentioning much about doing the inner work, following inner guidance and then taking outward action when inspired to accomplish your dreams. But I feel the critics were too harsh in condemning the book for lack of \\"scientific\\" evidence of LOA and the concepts presented..this is about faith and trust in a universal set of laws and if you have to have tangible proof or see it and feel it BEFORE you believe it..well, no spiritual philosophy will work for you and maybe you should consider the legal profession! I think the book does not really say anything new, but it's format might appeal to and reach those beginners or those wanting to learn the basics of LOA and for that I think it will do just fine and is a good thing. One critical reviewer summarized the book as (paraphrasing here) telling people to just sit around and dream of what they want, then if it doesn't happen, it is your fault because you didn't do it right..I think the book does a bit more than suggest you just 'sit around and dream'. The sections on gratitude are excellent and worthwhile BUT they have a valid point about the blaming of yourself when something does not materialize. This has been my criticism of not just this book but of most teachers of LOA. When someone asks why, when they have done all the emotional and mind work, has something not ccome to pass the answer inevitably is that the person has held beliefs or thoughts that have prevented it, thus leading many (and I have seen it many times in others and experienced it myself) to the false conclusion that they aren't doing it 'right' which usually leads to destructive or at leastnon-productive blaming of oneself. I agree that we choose much of what is around us through our vibrations, feelings, thoughts and I see the correlations in my own life BUT labeling yourself the reason something bad happened is most times just WRONG-there are times when poop JUST HAPPENS..If you get layed off or experience some unfortunate event and you can't find anything inside you or some action you took that may have contributed, then it just HAPPENED and is not your fault- I just don't buy into any rigid LOA person when they state YOU attract (cause) everything in your life-good and bad-no exceptions. That may sound good in theory but it can be destructive and is too limiting and restrictive. Take some credit for the good, examine yourself for REAL responsibility for the bad and if you find nothing-LET IT GO-it is NOT your fault- maybe you didn't think, feel or do anything wrong-maybe that tornado that wiped out your house just happened to YOU due ultimately to forces we will never understand! So,in summary, there are probably better beginning books available on LOA but if you want a starter book told in pleasant voices and simplified, nothing really wrong with this one.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Would have liked to have seen this picture on the big screen. It was very good. All the hype about to much sex in this movie was over exaggerated. Acting by all was great.

B007JMW46U|4.0|This kept me up late reading on my kindle well into the night. Very enjoyable! I was also quite chuffed that my city, Auckland in New Zealand, was mentioned in this old novel, even if it was just a mention. Well worth the read.

0545259088|4.0|My Thoughts:<br /><br />Everything really comes full circle in the conclusion to this wonderfully sweet and highly emotional YA drama.  I was very impressed with Ms. Stiefvater's writing and I can't wait to delve into more of her worlds she creates.<br />I am going to try my best to not include spoilers, but being that this is the third book in the series, that may be hard to do.  So be FOREWARNED:<br />there could be some SPOILERS.<br />Whew!  I am glad I could get that off my chest!<br /><br />I feel like all the mistakes, all the sacrifices, all the betrayals are hashed out and finally put into reason in this last book.  I felt like we did get a lot of closure on many aspects of the story line but the ending : not so much.<br /><br />Sam is such a sweet character, so fragile and broken, I didn't think he would ever man up.  I honestly didn't know if he had it in him but I was pleasantly surprised for him.  I found a tough exterior to him I didn't know he had and I actually liked it in him.  I feel like Sam has grown to be the man he was supposed to be, finally leaving his demons to rest.<br /><br />Grace seemed to grow a little bit more, though, I don't think she really needed to anymore.  She was already pretty tough and tired of being hurt from the people that she needed the most.  I loved the fact she stood up to her parents and  I feel like they deserved every bit of it.  If not more.  I felt like Grace lost a lot but she also gained something she wanted the most: a real family.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Cole!  He was the proverbial \\"bad boy\\" that every girl thinks is the best!  But I really enjoyed reading the book through Cole's eyes, experiencing the feelings that he had on the inside.  I feel like he really grew as a character and became someone that was a wonderful addition to the pack and especially to Sam.<br /><br />The character that I seen the most improvement throughout the entire series was Isabel.  In the first book, I didn't really like her, and now; I feel like she was the pivotal factor that saved them all.  Besides Cole, I think Isabel ended up stealing my heart, and I didn't even know it until the end.<br /><br />I loved the writing, the poetry in it, and the intense love between all of these characters.<br />What I couldn't stand was the way it ended!  I felt cheated at the end and no closure at the relationships.  I would have liked a more in depth look at everyone's HEA but instead I felt like we were being pushed out like a guest that has outstayed their welcome.<br />It was left wide open but with no promise of another book.  I guess I should just assume everyone got what they were looking for and everything turned out perfect for them.  But it would have been nice to see just a glimpse into the aftermath before we left the world of Mercy Falls.<br /><br />Forever is a great book with lots of emotion to be felt during this calming read. I enjoyed the series; loved the characters I was introduced to, and enjoyed the descriptive prose throughout the story.<br />I couldn't give it five hearts just because of the way the ending made me feel, or didn't as the case may be.  I was left with too much longing....<br />But I can give it four hearts for everything else!and now; I feel like she was the pivotal factor that saved them all.

B001NFNFNU|3.0|Despite my three star review I still feel this is a must-see movie. The story is so compelling it makes you wonder why this was never made into a movie before. There's so much going on here, though, that I think all the material handcuffed Eastwood a bit. The lost child; the corrupt LAPD; the grief-stricken mother; the \\"fake\\" son; the heartless detective; the crusading minster; the illegal commitment to the mental hospital; the serial killer...and it goes on and on like that! Any one of these elements would've made a fine movie, but crammed all together in a two-hour plus film is just too much to take in. But my biggest complaint is how hamfisted some of the scenes are handled. The over-the-top acting. Not by Angelina Jolie, mind you; her Oscar nomination was well-earned (except for a particularly improbable scene in the jailhouse, when she bitch-slaps her son's killer). Several scenes are far more sensationalistic than need be. At times it plays more like a made-for-TV movie. And for someone like Clint Eastwood, one of the finest directors working today, I just expected MUCH better. Yet while the movie lacks any sort of subtlety, Clint Eastwood's lovely musical score is spot on. He understands (at least with music) that less is more. The simple notes he plays on the piano are haunting and evocative. Like many of the songs he's composed for his movies, I downloaded them the first chance I got. You might not agree with my critique of Mr. Eastwood's direction, but I have no doubt you'll enjoy the movie.

B0087HT36U|1.0|Don't support rip off games. Seriously isn't there laws protecting game makers? And what is with this twenty word minimum review? Amazon should not support games that are so blatently plagiarized.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|I had never heard of this author or this book until Amazon recommended it.  It was a very fast read and I immediately purchased another book by the writer upon completion.  I highly recommend the book and anything by Blake Crouch.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This is a movie that can be enjoyed by both young and old; it has amazing cinematography, wardrobe, effects, and the storytelling is a fresh take on the original. I've avoided Kristen Stewart because of Twilight, but she does a fantastic job here, and while Theron does try to steal the show, Stewart definitely manages to hold her own.<br /><br />I never thought I would've liked this movie. Ended up loving it.
B007SGM084|1.0|Sorry I couldn't continue reading it.  Found it to upsetting for my taste.  As an older woman, I still believe in real love and can't stand women being used as a sex slave.  Waste of my money!

B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  However, I had read the book (and the sequels) and a lot of details were not in the movie.  This is usually true of most book adaptations.  I recommend reading the book if you haven't already.
067144901X|5.0|I am an English/Reading teacher. I bought this book for my two-year-old niece who absolutely adores this book!! Whenever I come over she wants me to read it to her as she reads along.

0307593312|5.0|An awesome book.<br /><br />As a longtime Murakami fan, I enjoyed the hallmarks of his style. That said, this is his most self-indulgent piece yet, and may not be for first-time readers of his work.<br /><br />Great narrative arc, seamless blending of several disparate storylines, and an ending that fits. If you like Murakami's work, you'll love this.<br /><br />You might just love it anyway.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game. I never actually watched Phineas and ferb but I loved the where's my water game so much I had to try it out and it did NOT disappoint

0525953728|5.0|From the moment I started this book, I could not put it down. I really enjoyed his account of his years as a SEAL team member. Most of the book is devoted to describing his life as a SEAL, what is involved and sacrifices that are made - especially on the home front when it comes to friends and family. I found his description of what happened with the raid on Bin Ladin riviting. I like that he gives most of the credit for anything and everything to others. This book was not written to make him look good, but to make the team look good.<br />Frankly, I am having a problem figuring out what all the hoopla from Panetta and others is about. I have read both Marcus Luttrel's books, American Sniper, and at least a dozen other books on the SEAL teams, and I can't find anything in this book that isn't also - in one form or another - in their books. I'm not seeing the secret thing.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone. I don't think you will be able to put it down once you start reading it.

B007WOFXB8|1.0|This is a stupid selection of albums consisting mostly of titles already available in remastered form. The ones most needing remastering -Tejas and El Loco- which were badly butchered by the original cd mixes are left out?  Why?  It's nice to see Rio Grande Mud here but Rhino promised a decade ago to remaster all the early albums and then quit after Tres Hombres and Fandango!  A quick cash grab for the two most popular and then nothing. Until this. Now in order to get Rio Grande Mud fans have to re-purchase Tres Hombres and Fandango! This is a new low Rhino records.

B00866H7SS|5.0|This is a great read. Explicit and exciting. Its well written. It is a real page turner. Keeps you guessing all the time.
B0035JRUZQ|4.0|Bought through Amazon.com at a great price, \\"El Dorado\\" is the only movie to co-star John Wayne and Robert Mitchum and feature a young James Caan. This is the scond version of the same story by Howard Hawks. In the first, \\"Rio Bravo,\\" Wayne was the sheriff, Dean Martin the drunken sidekick and Ricky Nelson the young gunfighter. The third version was \\"Rio Lobo.\\" When Hawks brought up the script Wayne he asked if he got to play the drunk in this one. Nope. Here he is the gunfighter. Regardless of the sameness, there are more than enough twists to \\"El Dorado\\" to make it a humorous, rough and tumble, action-filled ride for Wayne and Mitchum fans and a nice addition to any westerns collection.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Not much for playing games on my phone but this game is fun to have. I`d for sure recommend this game.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|One of the most addicting games in the play store, I have them all and just can't stop playing it.
B0098VXE50|3.0|this wouldve been a 5 star movie if it wasnt for kristen stewart. She did such an injustice to the character , it was disheartening. She has the emotional range of a foot stool and is less interesting to watch. Its a shame because everything else was great.
0525953728|1.0|This guy is a disgrace to the uniform.  He disregarded his solemn oath of service to make a quick buck.  The SEALs want nothing to do with him and neither should you.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love this app.,  but it can be glitchy and freezes rather often. With a little work I could have a full on addiction.
B001R9THMU|4.0|It's an excellent and well built sandal.  You'll need to order a size up because they run small.  Because they are well built,  they also feel heavier than others I wear.  Yes I recommend them and would buy another pair.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I didnt think that this could be better than Enders Game but I was wrong! The characters in the book come alive and its so hard to not to feel their pain and sadness.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Im not going to write a novel about this headset; Im just going to leave a few kind words. First off, I own the wireless x32's, but they don't work on account of me throwing them against the wall when I was raging on gears of war. The hissing on the x32's were worse than on the x41's, it's practically nonexistent on this headset. Two things about this model make me glad I purchased it: the perfect fit on your head, and the 7.1 sound. Unlike the x32's which don't have a great range of extension, this model fits perfectly. With the older model you were always aware that there was this thing on your head but the x41 have long extension and the perfect pressure to make them unoticable. Anyway I love this thing, and I would suggest all of you serious gamers getting this...
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I have read countless books and this is one of my favorites. The story line is fantastic and the the adventures he has are editing. Its almost a perfect book
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Outstanding audio and video bluray.  Nothing short of reference quality.  I was so impressed with the Audio and Video quality of this disk I purchased the 2D and 3D version and we do not own a 3D projector yet.  Yes it is that good.
0425263908|1.0|Wow! Surprising that we haven't tampered with Copywriter laws here. Fifty shades is clearly written much better than Bared to you, and it's characters have much more substance. You could easily make the leap that Bared photo copied most of Gray's pages and changed some of the dysfunction in each of the characters. I was shocked at how much was identical in so many ways! Had I known it was so easy to write by Merely changing a couple of items to have a best seller, I would have jumped on the band wagon years ago! Fifty takes the award and Bared gets the \\"been there, done that\\" prize.
1455844195|5.0|What a beautiful story for middle schoolers and adults.  The author is right on target when it comes to the characters' inner most feelings.  So many lessons to be gained by any reader.
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought this movie was excellent, but it only got 4 stars because if you had not read the book first many of the parts wouldn't make sense. Once you read the first book you HAVE TO read the next two, so buy them together or you'll wish you had. Can't wait for the next movie to come out!

B00003CXDD|5.0|My wife wanted me to get this movie for our movie night with the grandkids.  It's been a while since I've seen this film, and now I wonder why its been so long.  The movie is fun to watch.  As other reviewers have noted, the is no harsh language, and the story follows classic good verses evil good wins lines.  But to watch a new generation see this film is priceless.  My granddaughter absolutly loved it.  Long after Grandma went to bed, we were still watching it.  She especially loved the Brownies, and said they were the funniest part of the movie.  And she is always asking to see it again, which I take to be a good sign that she liked it.<br /><br />I ordered this from an Amazon affiliated site, and was pleased with the shipping speed and quality of the item.  It arrived ahead of the estimated delivery date, and was in perfect condition.
B0091XRRQC|4.0|This is a wonderful comical movie from some of the best claymation artist. It's a steam punk style movie and the storyline is predictable. The movie is perfectly fine for kids, although they may not understand many of the jokes. It's quite enjoyable to watch as an adult. I very much recommend it to everyone.
B0087HT36U|4.0|good game but a little hard good for parents and kids too a cool game to<br />keep your kids busy.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Lee Child is my favourite crime writer.  I have read all his novels.  Jack Reacher is my hero.  There is nothing finer than escaping with a Reacher novel and a bottle of red.  It is one way I define happiness.  But having finished \\"Worth Dying For\\", packed with action and so powerful in arousing emotions that crave justice for the oppressed and exploited, I bought \\"A Wanted Man\\" the day it was released.  Perhaps I was expecting in this sequel the authorities to be hunting Jack Reacher for his crimes in the name of justice.  It was not so.  I was disappointed.  The bulk of the novel was set in a car and the prison-like motel was barely plausible.  It was so different from any previous Reacher novel that I wondered if Lee had actually written it himself.  It gets the thumbs down from me but for all that I read it in two days and I am still looking forward to Lee's next release.

B003V2HWP0|4.0|BEAUTIFUL Sophie Marceau plays a single, independent woman (as much as one could be back in those days where a woman could marry and be someone's property or be single and lonely as a governess).<br /><br />Her mother had died in childbirth, and she was raised by her dad. They don't tell you what he did, but her dad is in prison and she needed money to get him out. She could either marry well and have them pay to get her father out of prison (but then she'd be bound to that person for the rest of her life) - or she could sell herself short term, discreetly, and then get on with her life.  She choose the latter by way of agreeing to  carry a strangers child (he needed an heir) for a generous price - not knowing who he was or where that child went. She would only know of course that the child would be raised in a wealthy home. They spent 3 nights together and went their separate ways. When the time came for her to deliver, arrangements had been made with a woman to see to the delivery and the immediate whisking away of the baby to its father. ...A rather cold arrangement.<br /><br />What she hadn't counted on was how much that baby would mean to her - though she never saw it, just heard the midwives say it was a girl and hearing her first cry when her bottom was slapped before the women scurried off with her.  She clung to the memory of her child's cry and made pretty pictures in an album remembering the birthdays etc...to someday give to her child. And she spent 7 years searching for her.<br /><br />She finally finds a position as governess for her daughter, who is a complete brat and runs nannies/governesses off in short order.  When the child's father comes home from a business trip and is introduced to the new governess his sister-in-law hired - he (of course) recognizes her, freaks and says she must leave.  Unfortunately, they must give 1 month's notice so that the governess may find another working/living arrangement elsewhere, so he's stuck with her for 1 month.<br /><br />Within that time, she makes progress with the child and they develop a bond, and romance is kindled with the father.<br /><br />Not really a unique/special story, and the physical love scenes leave a lot to be desired.  Then there's the not-too-well-thought-out story of his wife \\"who didn't die\\" - she's in a coma for 10 yrs however back in those days there was no way they could've kept her alive for 10 yrs in her condition as they didn't do intravenous feeding and even if by some miracle they got broth down her throat, it's not likely they could've made her last 10 years. But aside from all that, it was still a pretty decent movie and Sophie Marceau was really wonderful in it..<br /><br />Within that time, she makes progress with the child and they develop a bond, and romance is kindled with the father.<br /><br />Not really a unique/special story, and the physical love scenes leave a lot to be desired.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|Why is it that when these authors get a movie or large TV deal there writing goes to sh*t.  I was looking forward to the next Jack Reacher adventure, I got a little paranoid when I heard that Tom Cruse was playing Jack in an upcoming movie ( Jack as a young boy maybe).  This book was as big a disappointment as the current offering from the \\"Game of Thrones\\" guy.  They get big media deals and thats the end, such a shame.<br /><br />R Thorpe

I downloaded and played this game a few weeks ago and deleted it almost immediately. I dunno what's up with this game,  but it will drain your battery faster than any other game I've ever played.  The physics are bad and unrealistic. IAPs was the deal breaker.

B0087HT36U|1.0|Pretty much everything we love to hate about an app is here. I was motivated to post an honest review to counter all the fake 5-star reviews by Miniclip.com. I won't go into detail about what other reviewers have already stated so well. The ads, in-app purchasing for the complete game, excessive permissions and Open Feint, completely unoriginal concept and the constant stream of fake reviews reveal a very shady developer that you should not trust with access to your device.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|This app is pretty much a waste of time. I downloaded it, thinking it was a great deal-- can't go wrong with free, right? But the song qualities are often low, some don't work right, others don't even show up on the device. When in search, the app skips a lot, forgets what it's doing, and forces closing. If that's not bad enough, about 3 days and 45 downloaded songs later, an annoying little window appeared at the bottom of the screen saying the video is not updated, and that my &quot;cache will be cleared, please try again.&quot; After that, I could no longer download songs or videos. UNINSTALLED!!!!!!
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. I liked the challenge of trying to get three stars and the fun little tools were great.<br /><br />However it repeatedly froze my Kindle Fire. I tried the whole uninstall reinstall and it did not help. If they could fix this problem them I would gladly up the rating. But until then I have to give it a low score. What good is a game if you can't play it?

B0085Y4JF0|5.0|This chest rig is amazing for the price. Upon first examination, it was exactly as I expected from Condor, excellent quality for the price. After I played with it for a while I found that the pistol magazine flaps are removable, they are attached inside by velcro. My P-Mags fit perfectly with the bungee cords nice and snug. There is also room for two extra mags on either side of the rig. There is a compartment for a chest plate, and a mesh compartment for documents behind that. All in all this rig cannot be beat, and once you factor in the price you would be crazy not to buy. If you are hesitating because the air soft boys play with it... Don't this rig is the real deal.
B00834R580|2.0|I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan and quite open to modern interpretations of Conan Doyle's classic tales. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. The lead actors are quite well cast, and do a fine job, but the plot of this episode (which is virtually unrecognizable from the original Hound of the Baskervilles) is at best contrived and actually borders on the preposterous. Other episodes in this series are quite good---I was very disappointed with this version.

B004LROUW2|5.0|There are certain types of readers for whom 1Q84, the latest novel written by Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami , is not for. I am just going to list the types because if you find yourselves among these types you will not like this book. You will read it, complain that this review was inaccurate and possibly prevent someone who would completely love this novel from reading it. If you are the person who likes their books to hold true to one specific  genre or another  you will not like it. It has elements that are, technically speaking, science fiction, but that is a minor plot device. It is an action book , but the action is slow, Mr. Murakami sometimes brings things out to painful detail, however the details are necessary and Mr. Murakami actually gives away the whole plot and how it will be resolved, but you never know it until the last page or so. If you like books that have clear and logical conclusions when character exit and why they are no longer relevant you will find yourself quite quickly tearing up your book (or smashing your e-reader) into very small pieces. If you like short books, then I suggest you stop reading this review right now , at nearly1000 pages in the print edition it is a behemoth of a book. For the rest of still reading this book, if there is only one book you purchase this year, 1Q84 should be the one.<br /><br />  The characters are all well drawn. There is the aspiring writer by day, fearless math cram teacher by night Tengo Kawana who is going no where in his life fast and who, by editing a bizarre book but a young girl and the request of his editor and long time friend Komatsu, sets all the events in motion. Another main character is Aomame, the gym instructor who kills men who prey on wives and girlfriends with skill that would make any Ninja proud. Finally there is  the silent and mysterious Fuka-ari whose account of the little people, an innocent story sets all the events in motion. They are supported by a host of characters who insome small part tug and jolt the story along in a way that only a true master like Mr. Murakami could pull off successfully.<br /><br />  If you decide to venture into the alternate reality of 1Q84 don't let its large 1000 page size scare you away. The book was originally published in three volumes so, in the grand tradition of War and Peace, it is suitably large. Almost by design each story is a story within the story. These sub stories are necessary because the whole concept to tell the complex story. They also seem to provide a natural break for the reader. So much so you may often find yourself thinking \\"Oh the book is nearly finished...no..wait..there are another 600 pages..\\". It is worth the patience and each story contains details, even if it is a sentence or a situation, that is relevant in end.<br /><br />  Haruki Murakami is a genius and his writing shows a level of understanding the art of storytelling that is far deeper than any modern writer. Trying to describe the plot or anything more than the basics of the book would be a disservice to his words. His book 1Q84, despite its monstrous length, convoluted (yet at the same time completely clear) plot  and unresolved manner of writing make this an enjoyable and well worthwhile reading experience. Trust me it is an experience. Oh yes , a bit of advice, before you start reading the book, count the number of moons in the sky, just to make sure.

B000AADYYO|5.0|\\"Ghost Reveries\\", Opeth's eight full-length release, holds a very special place in my heart. Not just because it was yet another great installment in their catalog, but also because it was the first Opeth record I ever listened to. My first exposure to \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" on the radio when this came out just left me speechless. I've been listening to various forms of music for quite awhile, but none had taken me by surprise like this one! Breathtaking melodies, earth-shattering brute force, dynamic instrumentation, an epic scope, grade-A production values, triumphant band chemistry, honest expression and expansive variety all mixed perfectly into every single track. Such tracks are not limited to, but include the aforementioned Conjuration, \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\", \\"Ghost of Perdition\\", and the jazzy, other-worldly \\"Atonement\\". This album, the last to feature long-time members Peter Lindgren and Martin Lopez, is probably the only Opeth album to be on the same leagues of, say, \\"Still Life\\" and \\"Blackwater Park\\". Hell, it may even topple them both! That may be up to you to decide, but I will most likely remember \\"Ghost Reveries\\" for as long as I live.

B002AF4Y9G|5.0|All i want to say is, this is a great movie no doubt. BUT a lot of these reviews are giving all the credit to Stone, which don't get me wrong is a wonderful director, but Tarantino wrote this movie. Stone did a great job on Tarantino's script, as Quentin knew he would, but hardly any of you reviewers are giving Tarantino any credit at all. Point being this movie would not have been what it was, and still is, if it wasn't for these two genius film makers coming together to make this fantastic film! So do ur homework and give credit where credit is due!!<br /><br />p.s Tarantino is the absolute BEST film maker, writer/director of our time!!

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Good album for fans of later-day Dylan. It punches up and broadens the polite blues/jazzy/rootsy sound of Together Through Life. The real pleasant surprise is the quality of Dylan's lyrics and songwriting this time around. He also seems to be singing with much more commitment (and anger). Dylan's voice continues to be \\"gritty\\" to put it mildly, and I would agree that Dylan's voice, now more than ever, might not be for everyone. But for me anyways, the musical and lyrical approach matches his aged voice well. His damaged singing gives force to his darks words. The songs are generally pretty long, but I find myself engaged and not noticing the fact that I've been listening to one song for 7 minutes. I'm enjoying it way more than Modern Times and Through Life.  I never cease being amazed at how Dylan has never really stopped making music. He's the man.

B000MV8XPG|1.0|I have to say that I am quite disappointed in this toy.  It is not very stable.  And it doesn't look like it will be very durable.  The mechanism works but isn't very smooth.  The result is that the scooped dirt or sand sometimes ends up on my grandson, sometimes even in his face.  Needless to say, he gets frustrated with it.  This is definitely not a Little Tykes manufactured toy. I won't buy another Kettler toy.
B004LROUW2|2.0|The plot is very interesting and it started out great. Unfortunately, it quickly became obvious that the story was being drawn out. At least 25% of the book could have been edited out, if not more. I was disappointed as Murakami's other novels have not felt this way to me.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|First of all, this album is officially a \\"comeback\\" since the band has not released anything new since 2003. And this album blows away anything the band has done since at least 1994. The two extra tracks on the Best Buy version of the album really do add something, particularly the closing track \\"Drive By Lover.\\"<br /><br />\\"Chartreuse\\" and \\"Gotsta Get Paid\\" are two great tracks to begin the album, and aside from a few slower songs toward the middle, the album never lets up. Billy Gibbons is playing with fierce abandon, and they seem to really have enjoyed making this album. It's certainly their bet in a long time.
B008LZHA3G|1.0|This is a review of Tempest. A friend brought it over and I TRIED to like it. The music is uninspired. I think they're reading notes or charts and it was either the first bad take or the 100th tired take. Monotonous. Bob, well, his voice is shot. Not gravelly, not Tom Waits, not Louis Armstrong, just bad. I think I understood 3 words. Honestly. I tried to like this. Not one solo or shift or hook or anything redeeming. The HINT of steel guitar would make some people think they're hearing some kind of hybrid country. The HINT of distorted slide ... same thing. It ain't blues. OK, it's a good effort by Bob, who can barely talk. Bad effort by the producer and band. I couldn't listen to this twice. Like I said, this is a review of Tempest. This is what cigarettes does, kids.

B007VTVG4C|4.0|When Fiona Apple debuted in 1996, the precocious teen showed a huge amount of maturity on her debut \\"Tidal\\". The album critically acclaimed, but didn't take off comercially until a year after its release of the song \\"Criminal\\". Three years later, she traded out producer Andrew Slater for Aimee Mann producer Jon Brion for her sophomore album. While \\"When The Pawn...\\" was praised by most critics, the album didn't exactly strike lighting in the same place commercially. However, that album became a huge influence on Kanye West, who enlisted Brion for the co-production of his multi-platinum sophomore album \\"Late Registration\\". Several years had passed and Fiona recorded \\"Extraordinary Machine\\"- an album that eventually ended up getting shelved by her label Epic Records. Devoted fans took to the internet to demand a proper release and they got their wish in early 2005. After the release of \\"Extraordinary Machine\\", Fiona went into hiding yet again.<br /><br />In 2012, she released her fourth studio album- which, like \\"When The Pawn...\\", has a fairly lengthy title. She named the recording with the quirky title: \\"The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than The Driver Of The Screw And Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do\\". On this new album, she takes over the production with assistance from her touring drummer Charley Drayton. The album starts off with the chamber pop influenced first single \\"Every Single Night\\". \\"Daredevil\\" recalls the sound and spirit of her second album while the songs \\"Left Alone\\" and \\"Jonathan\\" interject a noticeable jazz influence. She sings about wanting to end a bad relationship on \\"Werewolf\\" and pokes fun at former flame with \\"Periphery\\". The song \\"Regret\\" rides a very understated rhythmic arrangement while \\"Anything We Want\\" is a song about Fiona wanting to be alone with her significant other. She closes the album with percussive laden, chorus heavy \\"Hot Knife\\". Overall, Fiona's \\"The Idler Wheel...\\" is a good record, but seems to drag on a bit- even with only ten songs. It may not be one of her strongest efforts, but it's still a solid recording from a woman who's grown comfortably in being thirty five years of age.bit- even with only ten songs.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a very addicting game. I'm sure glad I bought this as it keeps me busy when things are slow.
055357342X|5.0|I don't know if is is that I took a break between book number 2 and 3 in the series but this book to me seemed by far the best.<br /><br />The book picks up immediately where the last one left off with pretty much each chapter leaving at a cliffhanger of sorts.  Each one leaving me desperately wanting to find out what happens but then getting drawn into the next charter.  There are some serious twist in the story, totally unexpected to me that left me shocked!<br /><br />With each book there is more magic as well which I really like.  Oh and it is so descriptive, I can really picture the scenes in the book.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the next one.

1840226447|2.0|\\"The Repairer of Reputations,\\" \\"The Court of the Dragon\\" and \\"The Yellow Sign\\" are all weird, atmospheric yarns that invite rereading, but the rest are trash.  In these packing peanuts, fancy-lad artists fawn strenuously over fragile beauties and no one is immune to the vapors.  Even \\"The Yellow Sign,\\" despite its ultimate coolness, suffers from an excess of delicately scented hand-holding.  The worst tale is probably \\"The Demoiselle D'Ys,\\" the climax of which is so idiotic that it only makes sense if you mentally rewrite the pitiful little snake as a teleporting two-step viper.<br /><br />As noted by Lovecraft, Chambers had great talent, but he squandered it for the sake of a buck.  I shall explore his voluminous spewing no further.  You fans of weird tales should most certainly seek the few good stories of his, but I would advise against poking the remainder with a long stick.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Clockwork Angels is truly one of Rush's best albums, probably my favorite since \\"Test For Echo.\\"  This concept album truly is one that initially grabs you with its theme but only after you listen it a few times through do you really get a sense of the story and the messages that Neil Peart's masterful lyrics convey. The album starts strongly with \\"Caravan,\\" a hard-rocking song with nice movements that give you a preview that this is not your typical Rush album.  By the time you get to the catchy riffs of \\"Anarchist\\" you can't help you but get very excited about what's coming next.  \\"The Wreckers\\" and \\"Wish Them Well\\" are two of my favorite tracks, both melodic but the strength is also in the lyrics and how they convey the emotions of confusion, fear, hope.  The slower acoustic \\"Halo Effect\\" is an impressive track and you see the versatility of Rush as they move right to the strong bass and guitars of \\"Cities of Gold.\\"  The album's last track, \\"The Garden,\\" at first struck me as not sounding like Rush but the more I listened to it, again the more I grew to embrace it.  Clearly, that is the true experience of Rush and Clockwork Angels; it displays their unboundless creativity which pushes beyond traditional Rush's fans' comfort level and then makes you want more of what they continue to produce.  I loved this album, it told a story, pulled me in and didn't let me go.
B008MZPUXW|4.0|Back in the pre-internet days--before one could look up anything faster than it took me to type this sentence--I was a heavy listener of both Slowdive and Mojave 3, without ever realizing that they were essentially the same band as far as the members were concerned. Each led by singer/songwriter Neil Halstead, the two groups could not have been more different musically. Both specialized in lush, melodic, dreamy songs, but Mojave 3 were the stripped-down and mostly acoustic--one could even argue country-ish--cousin to Slowdive's tripped-out walls of guitars.<br /><br />With Slowdive being only a distant memory (though reunion rumors are getting increasingly louder) and Mojave 3 an on-again off-again venture, each subsequent release from Halstead has been more subdued and personal, and that trend continues with 'Palindrome Hunches,' his first album in four years.<br /><br />Halstead's uniquely intimate yet alluring voice--accompanied throughout only by a gentle acoustic guitar, subtle piano, violin, and the occasional banjo or tambourine--is in top form here. He has a way of making me strain to hear every last word, as his songs are almost like short stories, with little nuggets of wisdom spread throughout, and always delivered with an interesting turn of phrase that, when combined with the beautiful musical arrangements, makes it seem more profound than it would be otherwise. A good example is the dark, haunting \\"Tied to You,\\" one of the fuller arrangements on the album. When he sings \\"There's a heart that beats, but you don't show it,\\" it's very powerful--almost ominous--when backed by an eerie violin and hypnotic, minor chord guitar picking.<br /><br />The production on the album is very understated, giving the whole thing an almost live feel, which works well for Neil's quiet, almost fragile songs. The only negative for me is that--similar to other recent efforts by Halstead--the overall mellow mood never really changes much throughout it's 45 minutes, other thana couple of slightly more upbeat numbers, resulting in an album that can become a little monotonous after a while, as beautiful and powerful as it's individual moments are.<br /><br />Overall though, I think this is one of his more consistently rewarding efforts, delivering more than a few moments of pure bliss, not to mention one of the most infectious melodies of his entire career on \\"Bad Drugs and Minor Chords.\\" The song was stuck in my head for hours last night while I was trying to sleep, and I finally had to get up and listen to it so I could go back to bed. That plan backfired on me, big-time.<br /><br />While I definitely wouldn't scoff at a Slowdive reunion, or another Mojave 3 album, I'm just glad that Neil continues to put out such amazingly consistent work, even after 20-plus years. It's true that nothing he's done post-Slowdive has been groundbreaking, but when the music is as timeless and moving as the best of 'Palindrome Hunches,' who cares?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  It's faced paced, exciting, and has a somewhat darker & more realistic attitude than the first two.  Not that this teenage fight-to-the-death wasn't a dark concept to begin with, but this last book shows that Katniss is not a superhero - all this horrible stuff IS having an afect on her, as it would on anybody.  Showing her suffering from PTSD, repeated injuries, and losing many people in her life that she's come to care for is a very realistic scenario of war.  That she nonetheless keeps going - keeps doing what she perceives necessary and later slowly rebuilding her life - is a testament that despite being broken & injured, her life is by no means over and she is by no means defeated.<br /><br />I noticed that many readers didn't like this daker image of our heroine, but I thought it very uplifting that after everything, she's continued on with her life and still thinking in terms of the future.  She is broken, as many readers have noted, but not beyond repair and she is slowly repairing herself.  She may never be entirely whole, but she is living a worthwhile life and she's whole enough to recognize it.  An excellent work about both the horrors of war and, at the end, about the slow rebuilidng afterwards - about hope for the future.<br /><br />Patty L.

B0084IG7KC|3.0|The Top 5 films at the box office (worldwide) this year are: The Avengers ($1.5 billion), The Dark Knight Rises ($1 billion), Ice Age: Continental Drift ($836 million), The Amazing Spider-Man ($744 million) and The Hunger Games ($645 million). In the US, The Hunger Games ranks third behind The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises. It's clear that comic book heroes sell, and other key elements are action and conflict. The Hunger Games aims to give us a new fantasy hero to follow after the conclusion of the Harry Potter franchise.<br /><br />Does it succeed?<br /><br />The movie is an adaptation of the first part of a trilogy, written by Suzanne Collins, which was initially aimed at young adults. But, like the Harry Potter series, the trilogy appeals to readers of all ages. I can't comment on the quality of the books because I haven't read them, so I don't know how faithful the movie adaptation is. All I can judge is how well the story works on the big screen. The second movie in the series is set for a 2013 release, while the final part of the trilogy will be split into two movies. So, to answer my question, The Hunger Games is a resounding success as a financial venture and it's enormously popular.<br /><br />Financial success is one thing, but is the movie worth your time? I guess that depends on what you find entertaining. Let me describe what you can expect.<br /><br />***Spoilers ahead***<br /><br />The story opens with a glimpse into the life of Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence). We learn that she lives in one of the poorest of twelve districts in Panem, and that food is scarce. She feeds her mother and sister by hunting for game in the woods and she's a gifted archer. The twelve districts hold a lottery each year to select a boy and girl to represent them. The 24 children will fight to the death and only a single victor will survive. When Katniss sees her young sister chosen, she volunteers to take her place. The chosen boy from District 12 is Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson).<br /><br />That's all we are told about life in District 12. This is not a drama in which we learn about the struggle to live under such a regime, it's more of an action movie. The story moves on quickly and we are shown the sharp contrast between District 12 and the Capitol, where the population is wealthy and the games are seen as nothing more than a form of entertainment. Katniss and Peeta are interviewed on television by host Caesar Flickerman (Tucci). The Capitol is presented as weird and decadent, and most people look like extras from Amadeus. One character looks to be based on Rita Skeeter from Harry Potter. I had the impression that these people were weird for the sake of being weird and it didn't feel convincing.<br /><br />The movie plays out like an American version of Battle Royale with elements from The Running Man added for good measure. Those in control of the game can intervene at will using computers. Sometimes they will send medicine, while at other times they will harm or kill some of the contestants. It's all a grotesque manipulation aimed at entertaining the population in the Capitol.<br /><br />Director Gary Ross is a gifted storyteller, and he also has writing credits for Big, Pleasantville, and Seabiscuit. Unlike all three of those movies, I found that The Hunger Games lacked depth. It's obvious why I am supposed to root for Katniss as she risks her own life to save her sister, but there aren't enough background details to make me connect with her strongly. It felt more like a cynical plot device than anything that was remotely real.<br /><br />So, for me, The Hunger Games became something of a comic book. There is an attempt at showing group dynamics. Who will work together? At what point will they try to kill each other? Who will take their chances alone? What skills will each of the characters have? How inventive will the deaths be? But the attempt is flawed because some of the most dangerous contestants are displayed as sneering idiots, and it detracts from the seriousness of the situation. This is supposed to be a battle for survival, not a comedy?<br /><br />I'm trying to give a balanced review, but some of the battles are rather silly. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have a few good moments. One alliance in particular did resonate with me and I reacted emotionally to the death of one character.<br /><br />My overall impression is one of sadness. Not because of the death of some of the characters, but at what we are becoming as a society. Do we really need to see children fight to the death in order to be entertained? As with modern comedies, we are relying more on shock value than good writing. Katniss Everdeen was portrayed well by a promising actress, but original ideas were few and far between. You know almost exactly what to expect from The Hunger Games before it begins, and most events are thoroughly predictable.<br /><br />The next three movies will be a huge success, I am sure, but I'm not anxiously awaiting their release. I'm glad that I avoided The Hunger Games in theaters and waited to borrow the Blu-ray from a friend. Don't label me as a prude or someone who is against violence in movies. One of my favorites is Kill Bill, but, unlike the portrayal of Katniss Everdeen, I was shown enough background to care about what happened to The Bride.<br /><br />This movie does have a huge audience as I outlined at the beginning. If you are the kind of moviegoer who enjoys action, good presentation, and special effects, The Hunger Games will entertain you. You'll need to switch your brain off for a couple of hours, but movies like this do have their place. I guess that's why they get made. I am left wondering about the book and how much was left out. Don't let this review stop you from buying the Blu-ray (which looks and sounds fantastic) or checking out the movie for yourself. I'm clearly in the minority on this one.<br /><br />(9/29/13 Edit to add: After seeing this movie for the second time, I eventually ended up buying it. It seems that I was in the wrong mood the first time I saw it. Jennifer Lawrence is very good in the role and I am planning to see the sequels and maybe even read the books. I upgraded my rating to 3.75/5).s, and it detracts from the seriousness of the situation.

Not because of the death of some of the characters, but at what we are becoming as a society. Do we really need to see children fight to the death in order to be entertained? As with modern comedies, we are relying more on shock value than good writing. Katniss Everdeen was portrayed well by a promising actress, but original ideas were few and far between. You know almost exactly what to expect from The Hunger Games before it begins, and most events are thoroughly predictable.<br /><br />The next three movies will be a huge success, I am sure, but I'm not anxiously awaiting their release. I'm glad that I avoided The Hunger Games in theaters and waited to borrow the Blu-ray from a friend. Don't label me as a prude or someone who is against violence in movies. One of my favorites is Kill Bill, but, unlike the portrayal of Katniss Everdeen, I was shown enough background to care about what happened to The Bride.<br /><br />This movie does have a huge audience as I outlined at the beginning. If you are the kind of moviegoer who enjoys action, good presentation, and special effects, The Hunger Games will entertain you. You'll need to switch your brain off for a couple of hours, but movies like this do have their place. I guess that's why they get made. I am left wondering about the book and how much was left out. Don't let this review stop you from buying the Blu-ray (which looks and sounds fantastic) or checking out the movie for yourself. I'm clearly in the minority on this one.<br /><br />(9/29/13 Edit to add: After seeing this movie for the second time, I eventually ended up buying it. It seems that I was in the wrong mood the first time I saw it. Jennifer Lawrence is very good in the role and I am planning to see the sequels and maybe even read the books. I upgraded my rating to 3.75/5).
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a great great great great great calculator .  It's easy to use and easy to see.  I recommend it.  The end.
0345803507|5.0|Both this book and the other Fifty Shades book I ordered arrived but I haven't readi it yet.  I hear they are good reading
0385344333|5.0|Another first class book by Lee Child.  Action packed, suspenseful, try to figure it out wonderful story that I and many others love to read.  Once I got started I couldn't stop.  Jack Reacher is smart, plotting, working every angle and I really like him.  It was worth the wait and I look forward to the next installment.  For the people who gave bad reviews or talked about Tom Cruise in the movie........WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?????? This is a book series by a talented author, who writes for this type of customer.  If you don't like it then move on but don't spoil it for the rest of us fans.  Lee keep writing - We love you and Jack !!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" was a great book to read. I usually don't like to read books but I bought this book, read it from cover to cover and realized it was the best damn book I've ever read! It keeps you in suspense and keeps you wanting to read more and more. That's why I'm already on the last book of the series \\"Mockingjay\\". Great read, I'd suggest it to anybody.

0525953728|5.0|This is an incredible book.  Aside from all the publicity surrounding the authors decision to describe, in such detail, the assault UBL's compound was very strong.  The lead up in the story from Owens' start as a Navy SEAL in the Teams to his indoctrination into DEVGRU was very interesting, especially if you have read Rogue Warrior by Richard Marcinko.  Here Owens describes how things have evolved from back in the beginning to the current makeup of DEVGRU.  The authors, I feel, gave you the sense of following along in Owens career and then how by sheer luck gets selected to participate in this mission.<br /><br />The excruciating feelings of being torn between the possibility of capturing the most wanted terrorist in the world and having the mission scrubbed was very well written.  They gave the reader the sense of being there along side them feeling the same feelings.  When the mission is executed, it is amazing how everything played out.  Again, the authors gave you a sense of being in the \\"stack\\" and breaching doors and clearing the entire compound.  Finally, when they enter UBL's room the intensity of the assault and the result of having to positively identify him gives you the feeling of \\"Hurry up, we gotta go.\\"<br /><br />After the success of the mission, Owens decision to leave DEVGRU was difficult, the sense of \\"what else is there?\\" is portrayed in an excellent manner.<br /><br />If you have ever been involved in any type of special operations you will appreciate the story line but may feel that he violated the secrecy behind the team but you will still find your self riveted to your seat.<br /><br />If you have never been involved in such activities you will be amazed at what these quiet professionals are capable of and how they execute their job and how they can quickly adapt to an ever changing situation and still make it a success.<br /><br />FWIW, I highly recommend it.  If you're not on board with the necessity of this mission then you will not be interested.  I am glad there are men like Owens who are putting their lives in harms way to keep us safe and able to sleep peaceably at night.

B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I expected to like this film if for no other reason than I expect Charlize Theron films to be of a high caliber--also, I like fairy tales.  I was not disappointed; in fact, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting something like a fantasy-horror film, but it turned out to be much heavier on the fantasy element than is typically seen in contemporary mainstream movies.  This worked out quite well for me because I enjoy fantasy.  In fact, the movie reminded me of The Lord of the Rings trilogy in a few places, if only for the epic scene shots.<br /><br />In terms of the characters, Charlize Theron's Queen stole the show.  She was a character with some real depth, more fully fleshed out than I think I've ever seen the \\"evil queen/stepmother\\" character portrayed.  The Queen ended up being a far more compelling character than Snow White, in fact, because she felt more human.  She's not just some woman who turned to dark magic because she was vain and evil for the sake of being vain and evil; she's a traumatized, fearful woman who became cruel in a world SHE percieved to be dark and cruel.  As evil as she was, I pitied her--and THAT is a good villain. Theron did an excellent job bringing this character to life, and was, as always, stunningly beautiful.  I particularly like what she did with her voice, making it deep and round--it gave her a real presence.<br /><br />I've seen some reviews that complain about Kristen Stewart's role, but the truth of the matter is that Snow White is not the real protagonist of this movie in my opinion.  Snow White is written as a grail maiden in this film; a living embodiment of goodness and purity (and they're not subtle about it).  She has no flaws and does not grow at all during this movie, because she does not need to.  Her only real \\"journey\\" in this film is literal.  She is a plot device.  I think Stewart pulls this role off competently, if not with Theron's skill.<br /><br />The true protagonist of Snow White and the Huntsman is the Huntsman.  The Huntsman is an interesting character.  In the fairy tale, he pities Snow White and so lets her escape, fooling the Queen into believing he has killed her.  He takes a more active role in this movie.  It is his choices that allow the movie to take shape, and he is the character who grows the most in the film.  He makes an interesting foil for the Queen--they've both been shaped by trauma and bitterness and anger, but while the Queen embraces her bitterness, the Huntsman...well, I won't spoil it.  But HE is the character who has an inner journey, thus, to me, he is the protagonist; incidentally, he is also the narrator.  Helmsworth pulls the character off nicely.  He's always fun to look at, and he's managed to bring the charaters he plays to life in unique ways in every movie I've seen him in.  In fact, even though I recognized him, I had to double check that he was who I thought he was because his Huntsman was so different from Papa Kirk and Thor.  And I really enjoyed the accent (although I admit I probably wouldn't be able to recognize a bad one if I heard it).<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this movie is its take on love.  In the fairytale, it is true love's kiss that awakens Snow White from death.  In this movie, I don't think they mean for that love to be seen as 'romantic'.  I'm not sure how to explain it without spoiling the movie, but I enjoy the nontraditional presentation.<br /><br />There are a few things I think could have been done better.  I would have liked the film to either make Snow White more of a character and less of a plot device, or fully embrace the Huntsman as the main character.  It waffled, and that's the reason that the villain was the most impactful character in the movie.  I also would have liked to see them do more with the other characters.  The dwarves were interesting, but William and his foil, the Queen's brother, had potential they didn't really live up to (I think the actors did a good job, but the characters just weren't given the chance to develop fully in the plot)--and most of the other characters were just background.  The movie had some breathtaking scenes, but was a little too heavy on the computer graphics at the same time.  But overall I really enjoyed the movie.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This game was fun for a day and then it stopped working. The little pencil keeps going round and round and will never go to the next screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but to no avail. I was considering purchasing the ad-free game but have changed my mind.
0143120530|5.0|I don't usually get sucked into non-fiction books, but I actually found myself not able to put it down (except for breaks in between chapters to process). Very witty, fun to read, and extremely informative. Unfortunately, it does not give me much hope for my memory, but all of the background knowledge is very interesting. Definitely worth picking up.

It was all fun and games, launching pond rocks the size of softballs at my neighbors house, until I accidently launched Dirt Claude, my grannies cat! unfortunately, he didn't land on his feet, he kinda splatted on the wall!

B0096DZKZC|5.0|I love [[ASIN:B008K8U13K Episode I]] and all, but as much as I enjoy playing it, it's easy to see why others bashed it. It was a good Sonic game, but we were expecting a Sonic 4. And since the game was composed nearly entirely of rehashed materials of Sonics 1 & 2 (It may as well be called [[ASIN:B000023VTY Sonic Pocket Adventure]] 2), it did not deliver the experience a sequel should.<br /><br />What's important about Episode 2 is that it IS that Sonic 4 we've been waiting for! It's complete with all-new zones, Tails, catchy music (Catchier than Episode 1, too), and even more elements that made the Genesis Sonics so great (It has momentum, people!).<br /><br />As with the gameplay itself, it's pure 2D Sonic platforming action remastered, and boy has it held up pretty well! Everything has that exciting feel from the original Genesis games. The graphics are beyond-awesome (Check out them backgrounds!), the music is catchy as heck, and the game as a whole is just flowing with excellence! 4 zones (Not counting Death Egg Mk. II Zone) may sound like this would be a short game, but the levels themselves last for 2 to 4 minutes ([[ASIN:B004J4WZJC Sonic 3 & Knuckles]] did this as well)! I timed myself once, and the game lasted 1 hour and 35 minutes, which is just as long, if not slightly longer, than a Genesis Sonic title. And that's without collecting the Chaos Emeralds, via Special Stages, and Red Rings scattered around in levels. Both of those elements make for some nice replayability.<br /><br />And of course, we have Tails. How does Sonic's sidekick help enhance the gameplay? Well, if you have played Sonic 3, you would know that he could fly, and even helped lift Sonic out of danger. This game has that feature, but now you can also have him hold onto Sonic as you control him swimming underwater! This is a MUST for me, because I really don't enjoy playing water levels so much. It's not as cheap as you may think it is, because you still have to worry about the surrounding enemies and Sonic's amount of air. And of course, we have the cool-lookin' Rolling Combo attack (Think Sonic's Spin Dash x 2).<br /><br />The story is being followed amazingly here. In Episode 1, we can't focus on that so much since we're seeing Sonic go through suspiciously familiar environments as he did before. Here, BOOSH! Metal Sonic comes into the action, after being revived by Eggm-er... Robotnik, except he's more badass than ever! Metal Sonic doesn't mess around. In [[ASIN:B0009OGJ02 Sonic CD]], he's just introduced and you have to instantly race him (He kidnapped Amy, too, but...you know what I'm trying to say. He didn't play a BIG role). And let's not forget Robotnik, who has went on to create HUGE machines used for boss fights! Speaking of which, unlike Episode 1, this game manages to actually be challenging! I usually beat Episode 1 in a walk. Meanwhile, there's actually some difficulty here! You may get a couple Game Overs during a first try at the game.<br /><br />Although this is one heck of a Sonic game (especially as a Sonic 4), there's still a few minor things I'll have to mention. For example, I think the boss fights could last a little shorter (1 or 1 1/2 minutes) rather than 3 minutes, and I still think the price tag is a bit steep for a classic Sonic game (Hey. It deserves being in that category in my book).<br /><br />But overall, this is it. This is Sonic 4! And it definitely proves itself worthy of the name. If you are on the fence for a Sonic game, you should go get this game, even if you don't own the classic Sonic games already. If you are wondering to buy either Episode 1 or 2, WHY THINK ABOUT IT? Skip Episode 1 and go straight to here (Although owning both results in allowing you to download \\"Episode Metal\\", letting you play as Metal Sonic through enhanced levels)!<br /><br />UPDATE: I've recently gotten ahold of Sonic 4: Episode Metal. Really, it's Metal Sonic traveling through 4 levels, with each based off of the 4 zones of Episode1. The only real problem I found is that Mad Gear Zone has a few pretty cheap areas that'll cost you some lives. Other than that, it plays just fine, and it's a nice way to kill 15 minutes.1.

B004RCUJ9E|5.0|since Android 4.1.1 upgrade, checkers no longer works.  I hope they get it going cause it is a good game.  Game was updated (Dec 2012 or so) and now works great.  If you like checkers, this game has many levels to play at.  I would recommend.

B000002O4S|4.0|For years, this was the only soundtrack album for Back to the Future. This is a fun, solid soundtrack album. It has songs from Back to the Future(1985). It also has two tracks of Alan Silvestri's music score. We get to hear two uncut versions of Huey Lewis and the News songs from the movie. People claim the annoying music in Back to the Future The Nintendo Game is Huey Lewis' The Power of Love! The animated Back to the Future on CBS had a cover of Back in Time. This CD has Time Bomb Town, Earth Angel, Johnny B. Goode, Heaven is One Step Away, The Wallflower, and more. This CD is worth the money if you're a die hard fan of Back to the Future.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Most artists at Bob Dylan's age...what? He's old! It's not a bad thing, I'm just making a point...anyway, most artists at Bob Dylan's age who remain as prolific and hard-working as the Bard tend to suffer from either a lapse of focus, an abundance of polish, or a combination thereof. But not Dylan; \\"Tempest\\" is a masterpiece, another in a string of outstanding albums Dylan has released since qualifying for senior discounts (such as 2006's superb \\"Modern Times\\").<br />The overall mood and hard-eyed themes of \\"Tempest\\" reflect a combination of Reverend Gary Davis and the recently-departed Levon Helm. The production is gritty and rough, jagged sounds woven with force through often-melodic and beautiful structures. Bob Dylan, as if it would surprise anyone, is not trying to strut some duckwalk at age 71 (as if he ever did) like other senior citizens who also happen to be rock icons - the Stones, now in their late 60s, or Roger Waters (not an icon by himself, but you get my point), who thinks it's 1981 and \\"The Wall\\" is still at the top of the charts, or Madonna, who of course made her debut long ago singing backup on Blind Willie Johnson's 'Take Your Burden To the Lord.'<br />Rather, Dylan, with his ailing voice but still-healthy observational sternness and poetic prowess, crafts one of his greatest albums with \\"Tempest,\\" an adventurous, sometimes dangerous, late-night car ride through the darkness of love and lore. Tracks that will garner repeated listening the most are 'Long And Wasted Years,' 'Duquesne Whistle,' 'Early Roman Kings,' the rocking-chair-on-fire epic title track, and Dylan's greatest album-closer since 'Every Grain of Sand' from \\"Shot of Love,\\" 'Roll On John.'
0525953728|2.0|I bought this book to get the details on the Bin Laden raid. I am currently two-thirds of the way through the book, and still no details on the Bin Laden raid.

The only chapter that I think is great, is chapter 6 about propaganda. A lot of the principles he lays out in that chapter can be seen in society today, everywhere from marketing, politics and even business. Probably his best contribution to society.

B006OAB3ME|3.0|First, I want to say here that I love Sir Paul, and I love the Beatles.  My year wouldn't be complete if I didn't attend the Beatles festival every year.  Something would be missing you know???  Most Beatle fans and post-Beatle fans feel like a Beatle can do no wrong...and this is a fine album, and Paul is in good form.  His vocals are crisp and clear, and his guitar lends real beauty to these classics.  My argument here is not with the album at all.  I guess most people would think I'm nitpicking here.  I know Paul is not a youngster anymore.  I recognize he is quite possibly way past his prime.  It seems to be a crime to put down a Beatle, but I'm forced to play a role of devil's advocate here.  Paul's last effort Memory Almost Full was 5 years ago, and this collection of classics is what we get from possibly the recognized greatest star the rock era ever produced???  I don't know, but at times I feel Paul has forgotten how to rock!!!  His live performances are great, but in the studio, I think his former bandmate Ringo has perhaps surpassed Paul!!!  Ringo's Y Not and 2012 may not be great, but at least they rock at times.  C'mon Paul.  Drop all this classical work you've been up to for the longest time.  Let us see you roll up your sleeves and really rock one more time, and put out one last great album before you go off into the sunset ok???  I know you have it in you.  You're the best!!!
0316044695|5.0|This book was one of the best SF books I've read in a long time.  I've always respected the SF community, however, I had no idea the level of mental toughness these guys have.  Mark Luttrel vivid explanation of the fire fight as well as his survival in the mountains was nothing less than \\"tear jerking\\".  After reading this book, I felt, inspired, heart broken, and upset all in one.  Upset mainly because of the ROE that ultimately lead to the fatal decision that ultimately lead to the death of three SEALs, this is a recommended read for anyone!!!

B004XVMCN0|3.0|Times Change and What Was Scary in the 90's is not now. The special effects are really good but I could not get past Mira Sorvino's really bland performance. Twice she was supposed to be crying but she was just not convincing. As the movie went on, I was kind of hoping \\"they\\" would get her. Overall not a bad movie with an interesting storyline but the acting was pretty bad. Miro was the worst but you had to buy a lot elsewhere too.  I mean Jeremy Northam threatening Charles Dutton? Really. I think in life Charles would have smacked Jeremy upside his head. On the other hand, they had a great actor in Murray F. Abram and wasted him in little more than a cameo. So if you don't mind really bad, over the top acting and a dated movie, go for it.
031620157X|4.0|Alex and Connor aren't your average American twins. Their father passed away in a car accident and their mother works overtime just to barely make a living for the family. Their grandmother travels around helping children and is rarely present. Alex loves school and the fairy tales that her teacher talks about. Connor for the most part could care less and finds his class boring. On their birthday they're given a book of stories - full of fairy tales their grandmother and father used to read to them. But this isn't an ordinary book...soon the twins find themselves in the Land of Stories. Once they're in this other world they realize they'll need to find a way back which isn't all in a day's work as they find out.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book from the start. The plot was fairly simple but the writing is what carried the story for me. I stayed up late just trying to finish the book but only failed when my tiredness got the best of me. The characters in the story are a mix of ones we all grew up reading about and some that Colfer has invented himself. The story seemed to move along at a brisk pace. One problem I have with the book is some things seemed too cookie cutter. Nearly everything I expected to happen happened and many things in the story were tied into a neat little bow. There was only one thing that definitely threw me but I'll let the reader find that themselves. The only other problem I had with the book is that Colfer relied on more telling instead of \\"show not tell\\". It didn't hinder the reading experience too much but I think the story may have benefit with using a few flashback scenes instead of having characters tell each other various stories of how things came to be. This book was definitely the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" for the younger generation. All and all, The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell was a great light read and something I'd definitely recommend to adults.

B001J710Y8|5.0|The Wicker Man is creepy and unsettling for the same reason Rosemary's Baby is creepy and unsettling. In both movies the locales are otherwise ordinary and people populating those locales may be a little eccentric but can not be considered to be seething with evil, but as the protagonist (Mia Farrow or, as here, Edward Woodward) journeys through the movie, they most assuredly are. This is a horror film, a thriller in the best possible way, but not as that genre has been corrupted in its present state. What passes off as a horror film these days is a serial slasher movie, where the only question is who will be killed, when and how. In The Wicker Man, the motivations, thoughts, -- what is really going on -- is constantly at doubt, until, of course, the final act.<br /><br />The general plot is that a straightlaced policeman travels to an isloated Scottish island to find a missing girl. While as the movie progresses it because obvious he has arrived at a black hole, the well-drafted screenplay keeps the viewer guessing until the very end. Christopher is especially creepy as the overlord of this pagan oasis. To this day, he considers this movie his personal favorite. Aside from its generally unsettling atmosphere, The Wickmer Man can be seen as a clash of civilizations of the most ancient kind, and one thought to have been resolved hundreds of years ago, that of Christianity verses Paganism.<br /><br />There is a longer version of The Wicker Man available, and that version is preferable to the more common shorter version, if only because it keeps the viewer's suspense longer. Either version is highly recommended.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was not a fan of zombie movies before this show, but I tuned in because a friend told me it was very good.  I found it to be among the best TV shows currently. It was not the usual blood, gore, and screams zombie fest.  While it does have its share of that, it also turns out to be first & foremost, a well-told story about very human characters, with all their failings & heroism, showing both the good & the bad in them.  And it is dealt with in a realistic fashion, with the characters making decisions that let them survive, or making wrong decisions that get them killed, without any miraculous \\"saves\\" that we don't get in real life.  It is on-the-edge of your seat suspenseful, keeps me coming back & wanting more.  Can't wait for the new seasons!  If you like a good story about very human characters, even if you don't like zombies normally, you'll probably like this!

B001N9ESQ4|4.0|I had not heard of either of these movies. They showed up when I was doing an Amazon Prime search for something to watch. I watched them in order, Sunrise first, and enjoyed them both.<br /><br />The acting was superb and I thought both roles were cast quite well. Before Sunrise drew romantic feelings out of me from my youth which is quite a feat as I'm 65 now.<br /><br />You have to be prepared for dialog as both of these movies are about 98% dialog between the two characters. The dialog is rich and gives strong hints about the things unspoken between the lines.<br /><br />I especially liked the Paris scenes in Sunset because I lived in Paris between 1978 and 1981. It is the only period of my life for which I can come to tears when seeing the city. There is something quite special about Paris.

0525953728|5.0|I just finished NO EASY DAY. For the most part it's about the training that the author goes through in preparing for a live as a Navy SEAL. HE dips into his past to give us lessons he learned for a life time. He contradicts MANY of the previously \\"known\\"  facts of the Bin Laden Raid itself, even to the point of calling Bin Laden a \\"Big Pussy\\" for not making an attempt to fight it out when he had a gun in reach. This raid was a couple of feet of metal strut from being another DESERT ONE. The calm and cool actions by the men who went into that compound is magnificent.<br /><br /> Contrary to claims by FOX NEWS it is NOT pro- Obama. Mark Owen is the pen-name of the author. FOX decided to out him and disclosed his real name. Shortly afterward Al Qaeda declared him an enemy of Islam. THANKS for the patriotism FOX. This really is a straight forward account. If it has ANY slant it's toward forcing us to recognize the fact that theses guys and in fact all those in Special Forces of the U.S. are doing a job. As an audio book it's bout 6 hours so that makes it a one day listen or a one evening read.

B008MU8ZNO|5.0|The blu-ray of \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\" represents a highly noticeable visual improvement over the 2001 special edition DVD. Some people are grumbling that the blu-ray looks like an upconverted DVD and that is absolutely not the case. Either these people expect all blu-rays to look like \\"Inception\\" or they don't have the DVD on hand for a direct comparison as I do.<br /><br />Detail takes a dramatic leap over the DVD and this is most apparent during the numerous closeups of the various clowns. Black levels are vastly improved and the colors really pop in comparison to the DVD. There is a very nice level of film grain throughout and it doesn't appear that any DNR (digital noise reduction) was used at all. The film will always have a bit of a soft look to it at times but that's due to way it was shot and the type of film stock being used during the late 80's. As a huge fan of this film, I was very pleased with the blu-ray visually. The film has never looked better!<br /><br />The audio is presented in 2 channel DTS-HD master audio that packs a lot more punch than the DVD did. While some might not like that MGM didn't do a 5.1 mix for the blu-ray, I don't think that it needed it.<br /><br />All of the extras from the 2001 special edition DVD were ported over and there are unfortunately no new goodies for the blu-ray. Since the DVD was loaded though, at least nothing was left out. I would have liked to have seen the music video for The Dickies be finally added for the blu-ray but that didn't occur. The commentary track is one of the best ever featuring the Chiodo brothers and the featurettes are highly informative too.<br /><br />As for the film itself, I still love this film as much as I did when I first saw it in 1988. They don't make them like this anymore and it's a great blend of laughs, scares and lots of cotton candy.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I actually prefer this over Angry Birds! Great little pass the time game, if you enjoy silly strategy games, I recommend it.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|\\"Tempest\\" is one of Bob Dyaln's best albums...period.  The brilliant lyrics, unparallelled storytelling, and musical arrangements are exceptional.  His voice complements the mood of the songs, and frankly, they would not be as rich and meaningful if sung by anyone else.  There is not a weak track of the ten.  Sure, I have my favorites (Tempest, Narrow Way,  Pay in Blood, Scarlet Town, and Tin Angel - that's half the CD!), but the others aren't far behind.  The title track is epic, both in its length and meaning.  At about 14 minutes, the master wordsmith most carefully creates the story of the Titanic.  And while listening to it, the time seems to fly as the listener is transported back in time and genuinely senses all the emotion that was occurring on that fateful night.  But it is really far more reaching than this.  This is a story about humanity as love, treachery, cowardice, regret, and noble acts are all beautifully captured.  His voice inflections are superb, as he ever so slightly alters his delivery at certain times to emphasize a point, which engages the listener more closely.  Just superb, splendid stuff from the master.  And this is just one song!  Enjoy, and be grateful that he is still around producing such art in its highest form.  I can't wait to see him in November performing some of these songs live.
0670023329|5.0|This true story of Shin Dong-hyuk's experience inside the walls of one of North Korea's many \\"total control\\" concentration/work camps is the true Hunger Games.  But it's not a game, and it's not something you'd want to make a film about.  The thousands of people in these camps are starving, incredibly ill, exhausted and overworked.  Their living conditions are similar to the ones depicted in the dozens of books and movies about the Nazi concentration camps during WWII.  However, while those camps lasted about five years, these have been in place for fifty.  Furthermore, the brutal Kim-dominated government of the country don't even acknowledge their existence.  The brilliant journalist Blaine Harden reminds us several times, though, they are clearly visible on the satellite images provided by Google Earth.  Anyone with internet can see them.<br /><br />I had to stop reading many, many times to remind myself that this story is true, and these conditions persist for tens of thousands of political prisoners in North Korea.  It just seems to atrocious, painful and horrifying to actually be true.  Shin and his fellow prisoners sleep on concrete floors their entire lives, work 364 days a year, and live on slight portions of cabbage and corn.  They are obsessed with food, of course.  Some of them regurgitate meals to eat them again.  Some eat rats, bugs, and pieces of grain found in cow manure.  If they try to escape, they are executed.  If they disobey a guard's order, they are executed.  One child was found with 4 grains of stolen corn in her pocket, and she was beaten to death by a teacher in the front of the class.  She was six years old.<br /><br />Shin was not a criminal; he was not a political dissident.  He was born in the camps, and knew nothing about his country or the outside world until he was 18 years old.  All he knew was hunger, pain and misery.  His mother was a rival for food, and he knew little of his father or brother.  But the story is in the title, andthe events leading up to the escape are so riveting you will be barely able to put the book down.<br /><br />Applause to the virtuoso journalist Blaine Harden for bringing this story to the light of the world with such brutal honesty, insight and eloquence.  He spent years interviewing and researching for this book, and it is one of the most incredible stories committed to paper.  Everyone should read this book.  The atrocities of the fascist Kim regime need to be disclosed to the world, and we should not stop working and talking about it until that government falls and all of the prisoners are freed.

B008RBL87I|5.0|I really loved this documentary.  Prehistoric has always been so interesting and I have always been impressed with what the artists from Prehistoric times were able to accomplish but these blew me away.  The paintings and the filming of them were simply stunning.  The film makers were sensitive and created a film that showed the beauty and the importance of these works of art.
1594135851|4.0|As part of the trilogy I enjoyed reading this second book.Very easy to read and in general it's like a reality show with certain elements of extracted from what we see daily.I had no idea that I was getting the large prin edition which at the beginning made me feel a little dizzy but got used to it.
0525953728|4.0|Got my copy on the day it was released.<br /><br />Couldn't see what all the political fuss is about. Nothing top secret or new in the book that I didn't already know. What was interesting was that I knew when the author deliberately lied to supposedly hide the truth.<br /><br />There was nothing overly special or unique about how the assault was planned or conducted -- it was actually 99% spot-on to textbook SOC procedure -- except for the fact that it was Osama bin Laden and that the assault was conducted deep inside the borders of a sovereign country.<br /><br />However, there was one thing I did take note of that was never mentioned directly in the novel, although the supporting facts are stated within the narrative during the assault. The compound was not very well prepared to defend itself in case of an assault... and this was the home of the #1 Most Wanted Man in the entire world. Which tells me that Osama bin Laden felt very comfortable and safe living there in Abbottabad... which further tells me that someone in the Pakistani military had guaranteed his safety -- never thinking that the United States might make an assault so deep into Pakistani sovereign territory. The U.S. frequently makes raids across the Afghan-Pakistan border to chase insurgents, but 120 miles deep was a distance no one expected the U.S. to travel.<br /><br />If there was one piece of sensitive information that might have had both the military and the politicians wincing, it was probably the acknowlegement that the U.S. was sending unmanned reconnaisance drones deep into Pakistani territory. Everyone accepts the reality of satellite surveillance, but low altitude drones flying hundreds of miles into sovereign airspace are something all together different.<br /><br />I thought the book was worth the read. I do get a little bored with all the \\"we're the greatest\\" chest thumping that seems to be the mantra of every special forces dude who writes a novel. It has become absurdly cliche, especially when realizing that the vast majority of special forces operatives, SEALs included, are not into chest-thumping.

B00802EYDO|5.0|First -- Amazon's description of the 5.1 recording as 24 bit 192Hz is a mistake.  The 5.1 is actually 24/96 dts-HD Master Audio.  Only the 2 channel track(s) are 24 bit 196Hz PCM.  The October 2012 issue of STEREOPHILE confirms this fact.  This same issue of STEREOPHILE also compares this Blu-ray remaster of MODERN COOL to the SACD version on Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs' gold CD.  STEREOPHILE's review is worth reading.  It also reviews the new 2 LP pressing of Ms. Barber's NIGHTCLUB done by RTI (Camarillo, CA).<br /><br />Second -- The resolution of the 2 channel version of MODERN COOL on this Blu ray disc is the best that I have ever heard.  Deeper and clearer bass extension.  More realistic and airy vocals.  In all, much more present.  Buy this BD today.

B00817V670|4.0|I recently read Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter and watched the movie, so when I saw Team of Rivals on my bookshelf I decided to read it.<br /><br />This book is fun to read. In it, the author calls Lincoln a genius for being able to put together his cabinet from a team or rivals. Many in his team did not support his decisions, or each other's decisions, but this is exactly what Lincoln wanted. If all agreed on a decision, then this is like having only one consul. By creating a team of rivals, Lincoln could take advantage of multiple consuls!<br /><br />The book mainly concentrates on the Civil War. The Civil War started under Lincoln and ended under him too after almost 4 years (1861 - 1865). Many of the battles are described in detail, as well as the generals who fought them. The faults made during the battles are cited, and the weakness in Lincoln to sometimes chose the right generals for the job. The Union lost many battles and advantages from indecisiveness and lack of courage on the part of a particular general. Yet Lincoln, at the surprise of his cabinet, did not fire him. This was a mistake Lincoln did.<br /><br />A lot of information is about Lincoln's personal life, such as his relationship with his wife, the death of his son, and his deep depression (a fact I never knew). This book is a walk in the park with Lincoln.<br /><br />The book describes the Union's victory and finally the assassination of Lincoln. The author describes the event in such detail that it is hard not to grieve for his death at the closure of the book.<br /><br />For fans of the Civil War, this is a great book. For history buffs, this is a great addition to your library. For general readers who love to devour books, like myself, this is a great and enjoyable read.<br /><br />I recommend this book.

B004WGIXX4|4.0|I love Natalie Portman and have tried to watch everything she's done, ever since I saw her in \\"Where the Heart is\\".  I think Novalee will always be my favorite character of hers. I hesitated watching this one, though, because of the reviews, but I figured I could always turn it off if I hated it.  I almost did stop it a few times. But!  If you can get past the terrible and ridiculous jokes, underneath it all is a sweet love story. Predictable, yes, in the way it ends, but it's intriguing how they finally get there.  I like the story line, and it kept me interested once they finally stopped with the so-called humor.  I do recommend it... just be patient through the stupidity and get to the heart of the story.  I would give this movie 5 stars if the bad jokes were removed!

0741470314|5.0|Sanemjfan unfortunately has to eat the words he or she has written about the author of this book being a poor researcher. Even Michael's lawyer, recommends it and he got to know Michael extremely well. In addition, it is on the top ten for books about Michael, as listed by fair-minded journalists who followed his entire career and supported him throughout. I was introduced to Michael when I was 5 years old and first heard him sing. He was 11. I was instantly transfixed by this amazingly talented child who later became the aptly named King of Pop. I have since watched him move throughout life, the ups and downs, the trials and the tribulations. This book may have been better organized but it is factual, honest and worth the time to read. People seriously need to ignore reviews written by people who give themselves mjfan handles. I find that many times it's a ruse to get readers to think they know something, just so they can trash the subject. Michael endured needless pain at the hands of others when he was alive. It's time to stop poking at him now that he's gone and hear the truth. Michael absolutely was \\"Gone to Soon\\".

B003IY48PS|5.0|There comes a point when you watch a movie and you're marginally impressed with it and feel a bit underwhelmed after all the accolades and positive rapture it received from fans. But when you watch a movie again in a new format that truly demonstrates what this film was going for, you realize it's not the movie that was wrong, but you.<br /><br />Such was the case with &#34;Evil Dead&#34;, in which a couple of years ago, I gave it an average review and criticized its supposed bad acting and script holes but praised its production values (I have since deleted this review and replace it with this one). Watching it again on Blu-Ray, I can finally understand the entire hullabaloo. The goofy acting actually adds rather takes away from the film and as for the script errors - well, nobody complained about how Rick's raincoat suddenly dried up after reading Elsa's letter in &#34;Casablanca&#34;. &#34;Evil Dead&#34; is, far from underwhelming, a relentless experience from beginning to end. In fact, it is so unremittingly intense that Raimi had to make its sequel considerably lighter in tone.<br /><br />Watching &#34;Evil Dead&#34; made me discover all the hidden nuances that I didn't see the first time I saw. The supposedly &#34;dumb&#34; characters that Raimi created was intentional - unlike most slasher films, that lazily goes through the motions to set up a character's death, the way Raimi sets up these characters' mistakes and inevitable demises has weight because he shows us how a minor foolish action could have severe ramifications. Take, for example, the scene where Cheryl is raped by the trees in the forest. The scene is shocking in its gleeful violence, but the aftermath gives it weight. Cheryl tells her friends the experience, but none of them believe her. This subsequently leads to a chilling scene involving a deck of cards where a demonically possessed Cheryl goes berserk and stabs Linda with a pencil, which in turns leads to her possession. Thus we find out the motivation behind such sequences - small human errors leads to large ramifications to all the characters involved and it becomes an endless cycle until one character is left standing.<br /><br />If there is an argument where less is more, then &#34;Evil Dead&#34; is truly the model of that argument. The way Sam Raimi builds scenes for the inevitable scare and the gruesome murder now strikes me as impressive enough, but the methods he used to make the film bigger is astonishing given the film's pathetic budget. The claustrophobic sets, the drearily grainy imagery and the dark shadows lurking outside the cabin and in that dreaded cellar add to the horror, creating a frightening experience for viewers who want to get out but are trapped inside much like the film's ill-fated characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was something that I didn't notice when I watched it on DVD a few years ago. Watching it on Blu-Ray, however, I understood the director's intentions. The 16mm camerawork of &#34;Evil Dead&#34; is extremely effective in capturing the grit and violent imagery on film. In that sense, Raimi's challenge in overcoming all kinds of deficiencies that would have been solved by a few extra million dollars benefits rather than takes away from the picture.<br /><br />As far as the goofy acting is concerned, I have another confession: I enjoyed it. First time I saw it, I didn't like it. But watching it again made me rethink my opinions. Far from an example of bad acting; the &#34;dumb characters&#34; now strikes me as comic relief and their goofiness even adds to the gallows humor to the seemingly scary sequences. One of the best moments comes when a possessed Cheryl grabs Ash by the throats, which leads to Ash whining at the demons for tormenting him. Suddenly, he turns away to see one of Ash's possessed friends gleefully declare, &#34;We're gonna get you&#34;. It's a wonderful sequence that's both funny and scary at the same time.<br /><br />&#34;Evil Dead&#34; is a movie that warrants second viewing even by people who hated it the first time they watched it. On my first viewing, I was underwhelmed by the film given the hype. Watching it on Blu-Ray made me want to stab a pencil on my ankle for not realizing the film's brilliance. &#34;Evil Dead&#34; is the &#34;Detour&#34; of horror movies: a zero-budget movie that overcame its financial hurdles to deliver a visceral experience for viewers and in doing so redefined its genre. The Blu-Ray enhances the experience even further, providing an exceptionally grainy video (remember, this was shot on 16mm) and a rousing Dolby True HD 5.1 track. As for the bonus features, unfortunately I bought the bare-bones Blu-Ray version that only contains the audio commentary track (recommended for those who want to make films with minimal production values), but there is a limited edition out there that contains a DVD disc featuring numerous supplements.

B0059XTTW8|2.0|Great cast, acting and directing, but I really never knew what the heck was going on.  If you thought Memento and Inception were hard to get, you won't like this either.
B007VF0VCE|4.0|I'll be brief, though Lizzy is one of my very favorite bands. Nightlife is a transitional album for TL, and not the strongest in their catalog. The band wasn't happy with the production, as I understand it. However, NL introduces the Gorham/Robertson tandem of excellence, and continues to showcase Phil Lynotts' immaculate songwriting powers. He was truly a master who we lost way too early. The deluxe edition makes a relatively uneven original release, a great deal better, with bonus tracks and alternate takes. Going back an album, the Vagabonds Deluxe edition (Eric Bell the lone axeman)is an exceptional listen. Don't hesitate to grab that. TL fans should get all of these re-masters, post haste. The sound quality and selection on each is excellent. Cheers Phil.<br /><br />Sheppy
B00340ESIS|4.0|I bought this at the recommendation of my editor. I was looking for some tips to improve my fiction story writing and this was a good addition. It is not the end all, but instead give you a very helpful outline of story structure and a few very helpful little writing \\"tricks.\\" If you're just beginning, you might need other sources to get the basics of story telling, but this book is a good addition you skills.
B0040HO16S|5.0|Lovely BBC production of a book series that tells of a particular place and time. Worth the cost of Amazon Prime alone. It is what the BBC does best a drama with a sense of humor. Of course life is idealized with a little gloss but wonderful to get lost in completely. I have a favorite restaurant with WIFI and I sit there and have dinner as I watch episodes on my original Kindle FIre. Good stuff.
B007SPPANM|3.0|The new revamped version of Titanic is as great as it ever was and just as touching and emotional. But unlike most of the other releases ans the recent blu-ray the dvd version of the recent release only features deleted scenes on the special feature aspect. There are about 60 deleted scenes here so if thats what you are into by all means pick it up, but if you are like me and hoped for more features on the new dvd i'd look elsewhere. Some of the reviews i have been reading are for other dvds on past releases not the current release of Titanic that was released in theatres as Titanic 3-D. Again the only feature are deleted scenes, the film portion is great but thats about all you get. I had hoped for such an epic film such as this the new current release would have more features as well as updated features for example maybe a small tribute for the late Gloria Stuart who portrayed Old Rose, as other films have done for their stars. Great movie but for me the features just don't cut it.

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Grammys have been garnered and there are more to come for Hillary Scott,Charles Kelley and Dave Heywood. Twelve great tunes are on this third multi-million-seller of theirs. The trio promoted this album with a musical guest appearance on NBC's SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE eleven months ago,performing the title track. Aside from the title track,another great song on the album is FRIDAY NIGHT. Scott had a whirlwind romance with the group's back-up drummer and she married him on January 8. So that's a personal success for her. What's next for these three? Movie stardom? Well,one would automatically assume that.
B0086700CM|5.0|they finally got it free 4 kindle fire download this!!!!! it's the best ever :) &hearts; i love it awesome great spectacular
B002WIDRM6|5.0|In July 2009,the title track was released as a single,six months before the album. That's another Grammy-winner for Hillary Scott,Dave Heywood and Charles Kelley. We can say,that the title track is officially a soft rock staple,played on every English-speaking soft rock station on the planet. This album itself,won Lady Antebellum another Grammy. Way to go,guys! Keep up the great work!
B0087HT36U|3.0|I like this game a lot. It takes some effort;but once you start to play it you'll like it very much and I can guarentee you that. [[ASIN:B0087HT36U Siege Hero]]
1469984202|4.0|I love discovering new authors. It's something of a talent of mine. The Science Fiction Book Club used to help with this, exposing me to countless new authors early enough that I was often in the know about breaking books long before any of my genre minded friends. It probably helped that I read far more than most of the people in my social circle and my voracious appetite for words simply encourages my literary gluttony. But the heyday of the SFBC seems to be gone, and I see less and less new authors with mid-listers gone after just one book. So I've switched to review blogs like the excellent Staffer's Musings and Amazon. I found Hugh Howey's Wool Omnibus on Amazon for a steal and quickly dove in to his tale of a subterranean dystopia. Originally started as a series of self published novellas, Wool has gone on to win critical acclaim and has been optioned for the big screen by none other than Ridley Scott. Not that I knew any of that when I made my purchase, but I can't say I was surprised to find out about Howey's success.    Wool is set in a subterranean silo with hundreds of levels. Within the silo reside the survivors of an unknown apocalypse generations past that rendered the surface of Earth hostile to human life. Our story begins with Sheriff Halston, who has decided to commit suicide by going outside to clean. Being sent to clean is the equivalent of capital punishment in silo society. Criminals of the worst sort and all those who speak of going outside are sent outside the silo to clean the sensors that provide the only view of the outside world. Holston's wife demanded to go outside years ago, and Holston has never understood her reasons. his questions regarding her sudden change in mental state along with his long standing grief lead him to resign as Sherrif and be sent outside. When he steps outside, he is met with an unexpected sight but his protective suit fails like all others have before leaving him to die next to the withered remains of his beloved.    This opening volume of the omnibus was obviously designed as a short story and leaves the reader with more questions than answers, but Howey manages to inject Holston with enough gravitas and depth that it never feels like a cheap parlor trick. Howey's depth of characterization and choice to reveal critical information slowly keeps the reader engaged and makes for page churning pace. If I hadn't been on a vacation full of site-seeing and fantastic food, I would have finished Wool much sooner. However, my slower than usual pace allowed me to savor the world and characters of Wool and I find myself grateful for the opportunity.    The story continues with the silo's mayor travelling to the lowest depths of the structure to enlist a lowly mechanic to take the place of the deceased sheriff. Her decent by means of the central staircase that runs through the silo with the dead man's deputy gives readers a thorough understanding of life on the silo but never reads like an info dump or travelogue. Howey injects this sequence with purpose and depth by telling us about the potential sheriff through the mayor's stops to interview both her estranged father and the head of the silo's IT department who has objections to her potential appointment. Underlying all of this character and world building is a tale of yearning and romance long denied between the aging travelers. Throw in a surprise poisoning and all of the cogs of this dystopian mystery are in place to ratchet up the speed.    Newly appointed Sheriff Juliette has her hands full with a murder investigation and her own questions about her predecessor's choice to clean. She is up against the new interim-mayor and head of IT. She quickly discovers she is in over her head as she discovers a conspiracy that, if revealed, will change the lives of everyone in the silo forever. Powerful forces are aligned against her and she finds herself removed from her new position and sent back to the bowels of the silo. Determined to get to the truth, Juliette puts herself in great peril and soon finds herself sent out to clean.    Howey's characters have the same guaranteed life expectancy of George R. R, Martin's and he makes good use of this tension, leaving you to wonder when and if our heroes will meet an untimely end. And like Martin, he makes each of these characters deep enough that we always care what happens to them. Add in the fact that there is nothing heroic about these characters other than their resolve, decency, and strength and you have something extraordinary in genre fiction. There is a sense of realism in this story that many tales of this type lack. All of Howey's characters respond in ways that resonate with the reader because they like us are all too human. That is the biggest of  Wool's considerable strengths.    Howey also manages to keep readers guessing, by revealing key bits of information that, while not always unexpected or shocking, always change the landscape of the story in new and interesting ways. His action sequences are rarely explosive but are almost always pulse pounding and tense. He manages to keep readers on the edge of their metaphorical seat much like James Cameron's classic Aliens. He milks claustrophobia in new an unexpected ways, especially given the underground setting of the silo.    Pacing is solid, ratcheting up after the first two installments that are sadly much shorter than the last. There is a drag in pace in the last volume, but that is largely do to its much larger size than the preceding volumes. I didn't find it distracting at all, because of my attachment to the characters and Howey's skill at world building and starkly beautiful prose. For a guy who didn't have an agent or a publisher when he first published these novellas, Howey has nowhere to go but up.    If you aren't convinced that you should read Wool yet, let me ask you a question. Answer that and you'll have your decision. Do you like to read? If the answer is yes, buy this book. Word has it the first volume, at least, is free.    More book reviews at [...]
B008602KQI|3.0|If I hadn't read the book first would have thought this movie was just about kids killing kids. The movie doesn't introduce the characters the way the book did. Rue wasn't just this kid that got killed, she was more than that. I know in a movie you have to keep it short but the humanizing element wasn't there.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A good. easy ap not a complex calculator that forces one to search for basic keys. Also easy on eyes that aren't what they used to be!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Flippix art puzzles are fantastically addictive. My only complaint is there is not more of them. If you are a logic fan,  you will love these.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book started slow for me, picked up, and then disappointed.  I was tempted several times to skip to the end because I was soooo bored.  I didn't, but probably could have used that wasted time reading a new book.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|dont like it. I reinstall right away after trying to play this game. maybe good for little kids so they can have some fun, play and learn how to draw.
B0089LT8Y6|4.0|Testament is back to their Legacy and New World Order days with this release. Guitars and drums are tight and heavy and Chuck Billy has a great voice. My problem is that the CD was written in a manner that made it impossible for my car's player to read. Whether its a MP3 CD or due to some anti-piracy measure, I should be able to play a CD in my 2001 vehicle. Death Magnetic (Metallica - 2008) works in my car, Endgame (Megadeth - 2009) works in my car, Dystopia (Iced Earth - 2011) works in my car, but Dark Roots of Earth (2012) doesn't. I had to copy the disc to my computer and write it on a CD-R. Really kind of defeats the point of buying the physical copy. That is why I gave it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down! I think I finished it within 2 days.<br />Some parts were predictable but there was always a new twist or turn to keep you wondering what will next with pidge and trav.

B005PK1G76|5.0|I needed a stroller organizer (and really, drink holder) for a stroller that came without a parent tray and this totally fits the bill.  It attaches with velcro securely to the handlebar portion.  It is designed to hang from the bar, so consider that when ordering.  We have used it on a Joovy Caboose, a Britax B-agile, and a jogging stroller and it fit all perfectly.  I have many times put two 32-ounce drinks in it with no problem whatsoever.  It also has a nice, but small, zippered pocked inside for keys or other items you can't afford to lose (like that extra binky!)  It has a surprising amount of room inside and since it's black, doesn't stand out from the stroller at all.  I have been able to wash it in the washing machine as well.  For what it is, I really have no complaints whatsoever and would totally buy it again!
0321356683|5.0|I do not think i can write enough about it. it has been already reviewed enough. i feel every penny is worth..
0525953728|5.0|I felt I needed to read the book \\"No Easy Day\\", it taking up a lot of News time these days.  Checked several vendors for availability and price.  Amazon had the best price and a reasonable shipping time (7 days).  I ordered the book and it arrived sooner than promised, in 3 days. The book condition was better than expected!  Half way through the book and find it very interesting.  Well worth my pruchase. I am very pleased.  Thanks Amazon!
B005DOKL3E|2.0|The cover came as I expected, although I would have been wise to read the reviews on this before purchasing it. A couple flaws in my opinion. First, the outside strip of faux leather has no meaningful purpose to me. I'd rather they skip that and give me a slightly larger sleeve with a pen loop on the inside that I could use to hold my stylus. Second, as it stands, the sleeve is very tight on the Kindle and offers little protection from anything more dramatic than dust or fingerprints, especially on the corners. And as my title implies, it is a bit pricey for what you get.
B007ZBWJXI|1.0|I thought this would maybe be as good as their first effort but I was wrong. This effort falls far short. it was just plain lousy.  Matter of fact i just tossed it in the trash.<br />A big letdown, I miss prog rock but this in not an answer.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I got this and it's really boring. You can hardly do anything and you can't play with anyone unless you are connected to the same wifi thing. Blockstory is much better its a single player rpg and its great on mobile devices.

B00013RC8O|5.0|One of my favorite older movies. This was made back when they made movies instead of concentrating on the special effects. I love the race across the U. S. I've been spending my efforts looking for the older movies. I even enjoy watching to see if I can catch when they use a different car and you're not supposed to notice. That's one of the things a lot of people don't pay attention to.

B00992CF6W|4.0|Thanks Mojang for finally bringing Minecraft PE to the kindle fire! It runs really smoothly even on fancy graphics settings. There are some bugs, or things that haven't been added yet though:<br /><br />You can't make double chests. You can&quot;t even have 2 normal chests next to each other!<br /><br />I have created a few worlds, but I haven&quot;t found any caverns or ravines that are filled with ores and stuff; This is the mainreason I don't like mining on MC PE.<br /><br />I see that you can place trapdoors in creative mode, but I don't think you can craft them in survival.<br /><br />Other than that, this is awesome! I would recommend this to anyone who has a tablet/smartphone!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There are so many to choose from and they are so easily accessible. A great help in a over crowded schedule.
067942850X|5.0|What a great read. A real page-turner. Anyone interested in travel, outdoors, itinerancy, hiking, backpacking, camping & alternative living would love this book. I wish my dog hadn't torn apart the pretty hard copy version I had. The hard copy is very pretty, with several nice maps throughout the book. I luckily found a paper copy that works for when I want to read it again. I love this book!
B005KELWJY|3.0|First, let me say I'm not one to enjoy book covers. In fact, I've never liked them. HOWEVER, when I bought the Kindle Touch, I realized it was a little less than impervious to damage. So I sought out and bought the Belkin Verve. It arrived before the advertised date, and while it was a little difficult to install it, it is securely in place and there's no loose feeling. Now I'm assured that, should I drop the Kindle, it is as protected as it needs to be to survive the impact. Once in place, of course, I had to learn how to hold the kindle all over again, but once learned, is still easier than holding a paper book.<br /><br />So, while I don't like the concept, the protection is exactly what I was looking for. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends or family.
B003XU02QG|4.0|Total conjecture about what might have happened with a lost Roman Legion.  Still, more or less true to the times, and the interactions between soldiers in a war in a far away country when part of a Global Empire.  Down at the personal level though effected by the big issues.<br /><br />Generally good performances by all important characters.  A few illogical scenes, but not to many, and none puncture the suspension of belief any good movie requires.<br /><br />Give it a shot if you are interested, you likely won't be much disappointed.

B006M4F67A|4.0|Then they &quot;updated&quot; all their mahjong games. I haven't been able to play a full game since then because it's so buggy now. I bought all of them. Now I wish I hadn't. First of all they now have all the tiles shaded that can't be played. How is that challenging? The buggy part is when the game is close to ending the tiles won't light up no matter how much you touch them. I would like to know if anyone else has this problem. I have all these games I loved and now can't play them. That sucks.

0385344333|2.0|I hate to say it, but I think that may be the case. I've found the last few entries in the series no longer reach the high standards that made Reacher such an iconic literary hero in the first place. This latest book is a great example of why that is.<br /><br />In the early books, Reacher was a taciturn guy who was motivated by his own inner moral compass, and we could easily understand why he'd find himself a reluctant knight in rusty armor, riding his tired steed to the rescue of some poor soul in dire straits.<br /><br />But that doesn't seem to be the case any longer. In the recent books, he seems more stoic than taciturn; more like the Terminator in the second of those movies. Taking action more as a result of programming than a sense of justice. This makes his character far less interesting and sympathetic.<br /><br />There also seems to be a lot of padding in the book, probably in order to bulk it up. The story moves VERY slowly, and actions are repeated ad nauseum, with repeated dissection. Hypothetical example: \\"The cat is blue... Hmmmm... but is it a cat?... and is that color really blue?... and has it always been blue?...Hmmm...\\" I just took four words and stretched them out into 19 words and 6 ellipses. That's the kind of thing Child does repeatedly throughout the book. To what end? An attempt to build suspense? I don't know, but if that's what he's trying to do, it doesn't work and he needs to stop it.<br /><br />Maybe it's time for him to quit the series. There are certainly enough examples of other series that have outlived their shelf lives. Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series comes immediately to mind, as well as Patterson's Alex Cross. There's only so much anyone can do with a recipe before you become repetitive or the dish changes so much it becomes unrecognizable and unpalatable.<br /><br />Child may have reached that point, I'm afraid.<br /><br />Postscript: to weigh in on the Tom Cruise as Reacher \\"debate\\". Who the hell came up with THAT awful idea? Maybe in Oz, in the munchkin land, but in this world? Pipsqueak Cruise as Reacher?<br /><br />Hilarious!<br /><br />I don't see myself rushing out for tickets to that fiasco...a? Maybe in Oz, in the munchkin land, but in this world?

B0059XTV4Y|4.0|What can I tell you? The movie is visually beautiful, two stories in two era's (think Julie and Julia) and Madonna, the co-writer and director, portrayed Wallis in a fair and flattering way.<br /><br />Poor Madonna, she didnt get the credit she deserved. This is a good movie, a good chick flick movie, beautiful period piece. The clothes of the original Wallis of yester-year could compete with the likes of Titanic. The cinematography could compete with The King's Speech.<br /><br />It's like an art house movie instead of a blow-em-up \\"block-buster.\\" You're probably not going to get your man to watch this movie with you but enjoy it anyway.<br /><br />I bought it used and I know I will watch it again and even lend it to some girlfriends.

0345803485|5.0|All I can say is wow! I am a 30 year old mother of 3 daughters, I have a good looking husband of 11 years and I work 3 12 hour shifts a week. I do not read ever and a mother on my daughters softball team told me about 50 shades so I bought it out of curiosity. The first night I read 10 chapters and made myself stop at 4am! In the next 2 days I finished it and ordered the next 2 books. It brought me back to life, back to that place when me and my husband could not stay away from eachother. Any woman who is over the age of 27 married with children and you feel worn out and tired and busy, and it feels like a chore to please your husband, you have to read this! It will wake up every bit of the young sexy woman you remember that you still are! Trust me ladies this is better than anything else out there to bring it back!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked reading this book.  I always enjoy when a book is so intriguing that I have to tell people what it is about.  Only problem with this book is it is hard to talk about it without giving the best parts away. It is testament to the fact that you can end up hating the one you love almost as much or more than you love them. It raises the question of how well do you know your spouse and are there things that are abusive in nature you hide from yourself in your relationship to maintain peace. I like the stranger than fiction twists and have actually lived a few of these.  Props to the author and would defiantly recommend to read!!

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob Dylan has become an American Archetype. We can discuss/ argue about the what and why of it, but the fact is-he is. He's like the Oracle of Delphi. We can debate what he says and how he says it but the primary fact is, is that it's been said. So all the opinionated broo-haha is just that, so much yada-yada. Dylan and his words and music will live long after all of us, him included. Take it or leave it, as you deem fit, but \\"Tempest\\" is here, it's not going away,anymore than \\"Saved\\" or \\"Knocked Out Loaded\\" has. I feel lucky to be alive during the tenure of this great American voice. The good news is that there have been, and will be, others. But right now, it's Bob Dylan. Period. Tune in to the true \\"Voice of America\\"---Mr. Bob Dylan. Musically, this album strikes like a powerful punch to the chest. There is no swagger here, no intriging word play, no clever by half song structures. It all feels like a means to end, and the end is Bob saying exactly what he has to say. \\"unloading his head\\". This album is not for the faint of heart. It's the True \\"state of the union\\" no one has had the courage to enunciate. As long as he is breathing Bob will be telling us what it looks like from his side of the Universe. Keep it rolling, Bob.

Plan Toys  are the best, they are affordable, so well made that they can be handed down, made Eco friendly, and not made in China. Who could ask for more!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Really this is such a pathetically written book. All the characters are so confused in their depiction so as to be just totally unbelievable. No interest in what may befall the characters what so ever. Did not finish book.Really Mills and Boon porn.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I do enjoy this game even with the little bugs. do wish I could play the game on my kindle on my phone instead of having to start from scratch again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So everyone of my reader frens were going on and on about this 50 Shades. So I decided to get my copy sent to my kindle. I started reading the instant it arrived and I could not put the device down. This book draws you in and all u want to know is what gonna happen next. I am now on Fifty Shades Darker and I can not wait to see what happens in book 3. I feel the need to meet the Author, I am truly impressed! This is a must read
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved all three, didn't put down for 3days ! Definitely a must read! Looking forward to the movie. Decidedly worthy of the big screen!
B007V2UGPE|2.0|it is good at the beginning but when you get to wave 40 it is impossible to beat whithout spending money. I had one samurai charm with everything upgraded but it failed. Then I used a friendship spearman charm and it still failed. So if you want to spend hundreds of dollars on a video game then you shouldn't do it on this.
0142418471|5.0|This was my first John Green book and my first David Levithan book. I have to say it did not disappoint. I enjoyed the dialogue in the book as well as the main story itself. The Will Graysons were a lot of fun to get to know and I really thought the character of Maura was a nice twist on the frigid bitch. What she did to Will Grayson (lower case) was horrible and I was so upset with her for doing that. She took something that was so private and used it to her advantage.<br /><br />The best part of this book for me was seeing the relationship between Tiny and Will and Gideon and Will. I saw the relationships make the story come alive in the book. I thought both authors took a great approach to writing two different characters that just mixed together so well and each Will Grayson was great in their own way. I had to give this book 5 stars and I will be looking into both authors other work
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love the soothing music and the fact that the puzzles are not timed so I can take my time and figure out these challenges. I have such a feeling of accomplishment when I get a perfect score on a level without any hints. The game is beautiful and well developed.

B0041VV03A|5.0|I watched this movie  in the theater a while ago and decided to buy it because it is a great Sci-Fi movie what will be watched again and again. The script, actors, and  actresses are all great.  Overall this is a well developed movie.
B00821OW8K|4.0|...which isn't a bad thing. It's still a really great show! I'm totally addicted. But while the survival story of Walking Dead is full of take-no-prisoners surprises, this is less unpredictable and a bit sweeter. Having said that, the casting is awesome. Moon Bloodgood is my new favorite heroine, I think she's awesome.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I see I'm not alone in my overall negative appraisal of Lee Child's latest Jack Reacher novel. It starts out great, with Reacher trying to figure out what's really going on with these three people who have picked him up on a lonely mid-western road. Lee Child does an outstanding job of setting the stage and letting us tag along in Reacher's mind. I remember thinking as I read the first few chapters, \\"Wow, this is the best Reacher novel yet!\\"<br /><br />But then it all went to Hell in a handcart as the characters began switching roles from bad guy to good guy and the storyline got so twisted that I had no idea what it was all about. And it all winds up with page after page of senseless carnage, including the killing of the gal that Reacher seemed destined to develop a relationship with.<br /><br />No thanks, Lee. If this is the best you can do now, it's time to turn over the reins.

0446556750|2.0|#3 in the Mickey Haller series.<br />Combines Bosch + Haller<br /><br />Even though this featured long established Bosch and relative newbie Haller, the characterisation tended to be shallow with them just popping in and out of scenes with a chorus of other characters - wives, children, co-workers, protagonists.<br /><br />It ended up being rather shallow, not all that suspenseful and with a conclusion that raised your eyebrows in disbelief.
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed this book and its direct approach to the Osama raid and the difficulties of Seal life and the hard ship of our military in general. I would recommend this to other to just clear up the political spin that was put on the raid.
044655667X|2.0|#4 in the Mickey Haller series.<br />Wearing thin ... next one will be #Who Cares<br /><br />Another beach read ... a bit of a yawn though ...

B005LAIH2W|5.0|Really short and really quick!<br /><br />Disney's John Carter was a totally cool sci-fi and a very sweet action movie! The critics who reviewed this movie and didn't like it were on withdrawal from Sunset Blvd. crack or just waiting for the next three hour cinematic Oscar bore/snooze/kiss-ass fest from the likes of the extremely lame and the very badly aging, Meryl Streep!<br /><br />This is a guys movie! It's got a smoking hot alien princess, monsters, space ships, big explosions, super powers, and a universal conspiracy to conquer Earth!<br /><br />If this is what you're into? Then, look no further! John Carter delivers it... big time!There should be a sequel to John Carter!However, the supposedly \\"marketing gods\\" over at Disney idiotically dropped the ball on marketing John Carter to the Comic Con/Nickeloden/Cartoon Network/MTV/Video game crowd!<br /><br />John Carter is a exceptionally good super hero adventure that deserves an over the top sequel!Mad love and laser beam respect due to whoever was over at Disney that had a  pair the size of Texas to green-light this movie and to get it out to all us sci-fi and adventure fans! I love you! Thanks!
0743454537|1.0|Welcome to my first and last Jodi Picoult<br /><br />Just not my kind of a read ... if it is going to be melodrama then I will take it in period costume. This was trying to be philosophical but fell on its arty arse. The multiple narrative was woeful ... the \\"voice\\" used was the same, usually impossible to tell (without names) who was narrating the chapter. (Maybe the problem is that I have recently read some great change of voice/point -of-view multiple narratives that work in spades!!)<br /><br />I found the characterisations a bit on the clunky side, lacking credibility. In fact there were too many characters who were not relevant to the plot ... what was the point of the lawyer's old love affair?<br /><br />Maybe the only problem with the surprise ending is that they weren't all treated to the same fate!

0060557818|3.0|Apparently a story-from-the-script<br />Great fantasy ... so wouldn't mind seeing the show-from-the-script.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman actually wrote \\"Stardust\\" (one of our fav fantasy movies) ... have bought that book but haven't read it yet (waiting for the movie to fade from imagination). So meanwhile we have been taste-testing other Gaiman's (and the bonus it that through him we have got on to Kadrey).<br /><br />I enjoyed this soooooo much more than \\"American Gods\\". He created another world that exists under London. It is kind of an Alice In Wonderland for grown-ups. It keeps your interest through all the travails of the hero.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|Good movie reminded me of \\"Black Beauty\\".  Horse gets taken away from the one he loves and who loves him only to be treated poorly.  And then to come home again.  Would liked to have seen more of the horse in the good times.

0375507256|5.0|A disturbing dystopia we are already creating.<br /><br />This was shortlisted for 2004 Booker ... I shall have to read the book that beat it (The Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst) because it must be a mighty fine book!<br /><br />This is something brilliantly different. You can't skim read because it is so rich in thought, so rich in style. It is a book to be enjoyed for the author's talent - for the the structure and the stories.<br /><br />This book is extraordinary in that is a series of short stories that are interlinked by the major theme and by the interconnectedness of the characters. It spans time periods from the colonial Pacific in the 1850's, composers in the 30's in Belgium, shonky nuclear reactors in Reagan's California, the dystopian world of the conurbs and fabricants, to the disintegration of civilisation. All echoes down a corridor of time.<br /><br />I have blathered on ... I shall have to edit this when it filters through my synapsis.<br /><br />We go up the timeline with a short story of each, then back down the timeline finishing off their tale. Simply brilliant use of language, voice, pace.<br /><br />Way tooooo hard to explain. You just had to be there! Awesome. Epic!<br /><br />But not for everyone. So I don't want to know if you don't like it.<br /><br />*Ice Cream Soup : As a child, my sister, Mary, used to make her bowl of ice cream last until we had eaten ours, just so she still had some left. What she really had was just Ice Cream Soup ... but she did get to draw it out and savour it for as long as possible, and just maybe we did envy that she still had some.<br /><br />This is a book to savour ... and I wish I had some left!

0439023513|1.0|Maybe it wasn't a good idea to read 3-in-a-row.<br /><br />I do admire that the author planned for a trilogy and stuck to it ... but why did that still lead to a feeling that the ending was so unsatisfying. I felt the main themes were the evils of war and subjugation of people with an underlay of the love triangle. So I was a little aghast that the main character who had had so much grief and physical and emotional torment and torture thrown at her was happy to vote for another Game involving innocents, that she loses sight shooting Snow on a whim. And then there is the avoidance of a reasonable ending to the romance ... Gale went away, Peeta hung around ... boy, that bought it to a climax!
0425263908|5.0|I really don't know where to start with my review. I felt totally torn about the book the whole time I was reading it. The similarities to 50 Shades Of Grey are just to hard to ignore. That did kind of rub me the wrong way throughout the book. It felt like a recycled version of 50 Shades Of Grey. I feel like I am being harsh by saying that but I feel I wouldn't be honest in my review if I didn't. Even after saying all that I did still really like this book. I just have a weak spot for a wounded alpha male. I can't wait to see what lies ahead for all the characters in this trilogy. I love Cary! I want him to have his HEA and be healed too!
0439023491|3.0|On With The Games ~ Part 2 of the trilogy<br />Ummmm ... ok ... but ....<br /><br />I gave a Book 1 a \\"Reading Excellence\\" ... fast paced, certainly sucks you in, good plot and characters ... but in Book 2 those characters start to wear thin. The main character, Katniss, becomes a bit wearisome and the two rivals for her affections are too similar in their insipidness. Implausibility seeps in and leads to a bit of eye rolling as you read. And it ends abruptly with a \\"cliff hanger\\" that is an unsatisfactory finishing off of the book ... just leaves you hanging.<br /><br />Push on ... now for Book 3!
B004D9FLJE|5.0|The purchase was received on the date specified. It was carefully wrapped and the product was just as described. I love it!
0307477479|5.0|I really enjoyed this because it kept you on your toes mapping the relationships, remembering who was who. There was virtually no narrative. It was a series of different stories, in different voices, in different formats, in different times. Characters featuring in one story may have had a fleeting role in another and may appear in another story in a different time. The stories are not chronological ... in fact, not anything-logical.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I read every other day and it keeps me with a positive outlook on life. everyone needs the Bible daily.
030771652X|3.0|Oddly unusual, crime/psychological thriller.<br />Fast paced page turner with nice twist at the end.<br /><br />I enjoyed this ... but not sure if I enjoyed it because it was a good read ... or because it was readable - after that bad-taste-in-my-mouth last read (The Gathering). The book was engaging and, while the plot line jumped through time and place, it was easy to follow.<br /><br />Characters, while maybe a little two dimensional, were believable. The narrative was told through Beatrice giving her statement to the prosecutor with addition information coming though her flashbacks or imaginary talks with her sister.<br /><br />There seems something a little surreal about her deposition but I can say no more without revealing too much ....

0439023521|4.0|Fast paced teen fiction ~ Let The Games Begin<br />Part 1 of a trilogy<br /><br />Not highly original but that makes no-never-mind as it is such a smooth, slick read. Plenty of non-stop action - a bit bloodthirsty but not overdone. Plus a bit of romance with star-crossed lovers and a bit of teens getting the better of adults. Nice to have a strong female lead and I guess you can forgive her shortcomings because of her youth.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and have moved straight on the Part 2 ... but will it wear thin?

1439183392|2.0|Follow up to \\"The Dawn Patrol\\"<br /><br />Have been a big Don Winslow fan ever since \\"Power of the Dog\\" but it may be time to give him a rest.<br /><br />This is a follow on from \\"The Dawn Patrol\\" with the same characters. The story is set in San Diego with a set of crimes that PI Boone is investigating knitting together. I didn't really find it page-turner crime and there seemed to be many passages of exposition needed to give background and explanation and move the plot forward.<br /><br />If you are into books with a strong surf culture background, then maybe it's for you.<br /><br />(If you haven't read \\"Power of the Dog\\" by Don Winslow, it is a Must Read!)
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book has left me speechless.  I have never cried and laughed so much while reading a book... It captured my heart.  I highly recommend reading this book!
0061743526|5.0|A reading experience for any age group<br />A classic to be reread and reread<br /><br />This book is brilliantly written. It is a classic read not just because of the storyline but the excellent writing, the wonderful readability. Lee gives so much social background and so much personal background by weaving it deftly into the plot. There is never that sense of blah-blah-blah pages that often annoy in current narratives (that strike me as author's notes that force the characterisation on the reader rather than it being gained by osmosis).<br /><br />This is an encompassing experience : such a vivid portrait of the times, of childhood, of growing up, of bigotry ... of so many, many things. It is a slow, warm, endearingly evocative insight into the world of the Scout, Jem and Atticus. I was sad to leave them at the end!

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case does exactly what I bought it for; it's tough and protective, and very compact. I've got into the habit of always and only placing the strap on the cover when I've turned my Kindle Fire completely off, and not doing so when I've just put it on standby and set it down. That way I'm never in doubt as to the powerup status of the Kindle.

B0090SI3MU|5.0|I love \\"Finding Nemo\\" and have watched it about five times with different people. This time around in fantastic 3D, where the ocean comes alive, the visuals pop and the fish emote, and that's only in the beginning. There's much more cool stuff throughout this captivating, animated adventure. I was mesmerized at the beautiful sea of colors, and there's so much fun for the children. \\"Academy Award-Winning Best animated Feature\\" returns to the big screen for the first time in thrilling Disney Digital 3D. A Stunning underwater adventure with unforgettable characters, funny, and heartfelt emotion as we watch the journey of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin, and his son. Nemo becomes separated from Marlin in the Great Barrier Reef, when Nemo is unexpectedly taken far from his ocean home, and dumped into a fishtank in a dentist's office. Marlin embarks on a dangerous mission to find his son, and Nemo has a few plans himself. Entertaining animation, and fun-filled for the entire family. The effort for Marlin to rescue Nemo becomes an epic. Delightful and Enjoyable!

0525953728|4.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" begins like a James Bond movie with the flight into bin Laden's compound--and the helicopter crash.  The book then takes us readers back in time to give context to the raid.  The book has a section of photos showing SEAL stuff and a second section of graphics detailing the events of the raid from infiltration to exfiltration.<br />Murphy's Law is illustrated throughout the book.  The author doesn't stray from what he knows--the pointy end of the spear--to explain the helicopter crash or how intelligence was developed over more than a decade.  On the other hand \\"Mark Owen\\" does cover those subjects.<br />I do quibble.  On page 60 the Bradley Fighting Vehicle is described in error as being armed with a 20mm turret gun.  The turret of the M-2 BFV has a twin TOW launcher (wire-guided anti-tank missiles, Saddam's sons were clobbered by some of these), an M240 coaxial machine gun in 7.62mm NATO, and a 25mm Bushmaster cannon.  The latter has two magazines: a 70 round magazine that usually is loaded with armor piercing rounds capable of killing Russian T-72 tanks `up close' (in tank combat terms) and a 230 round magazine usually loaded with high explosive cannon shells (which also proved capable of taking out the T-72) plus 600 more 25mm cannon rounds stowed.  The gunner can select which of the magazines with a flick of a switch and also pick rate of fire.  The \\"effective range\\" of the 25mm Bushmaster Chain Gun is 3000 meters, and its intended mission was \\"suppressing\\" SAGGER anti-tank missile crews to protect the M-1 Abrams Main Battle Tank.  The 20mm wouldn't be able to do that.  On page 259 the text says that the Pakistani F-16 was armed with 30mm cannon--my best information is that these ex-USAF F-16's have the standard 20mm M-61 Vulcan multi-barrel cannon with a maximum 511 rounds of cannon ammunition.  Foreign F-16 operators frequent the Hill Aerospace Museum where I volunteer as a receptionist, and I spoke to several Pakistani airmen over the past few months as they attended various F-16 workshops.<br />Like I said, I quibble!<br />Nothing was mentioned about the Blackhawk used in the raid being stealthy.  By the way, the movie, \\"Blue Thunder\\" (1983)<br />[[ASIN:B000EAT246 Blue Thunder (Special Edition)]] mentioned that the helicopter stealth technology was in service--but \\"No Easy Day\\" didn't mention that the Blackhawk was stealthy or standard!<br />The controversy over \\"No Easy Day\\" is of the same kind that this movie covers: \\"The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell,\\" [[ASIN:B0000EYUDO The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell]] and for the same reason.  Dwight D. Eisenhower was threatened with court martial, too, when he completed a 1920 paper on the tank.  \\"Mark Owen\\" signed a non-disclosure agreement against releasing classified information, but prosecutions are more often for revealing information that is less than flattering to the politicians in power.  The author states that he is donating the proceeds of his book to three charities (page 299).<br />Of course, his statement on page 249 that Osama bin Laden didn't man up and fight to the death might be the reason that the Department of Defense is angry.  Or perhaps it is the shoddy way the SEALs were treated by the White House?  That's standard for all administrations--regardless of which party \\"owns\\" the White House.  It's something that military people understand--we're dirt and they are the beautiful people.  It's been that way for years.  America's military is non-partisan--though Abe Lincoln may owe re-election to the military vote in 1864.  On page 298 \\"Owens\\" states: \\"Of course, the raid is now being used in a political wrestling match as both parties fight for the White House.  The mission was never about that for the twenty-four men who climbed aboard the helicopters that night.  Politics are for the Washington, D.C., policy makers who safely watched the action on a video monitor from thousands of miles away.\\"<br />On the other hand, the release of \\"No EasyDay\\" on September 11, 2012 can be interpreted as a move to influence the November elections.  But the book didn't really expose classified means and techniques; these have been exhibited in many other places, many other times over the past thirty years.  I did mention \\"Blue Thunder.\\"<br />\\"No Easy Day\\" was an enjoyable read.  Get a copy.  If you must, wait until after you cast your ballot in November so that you aren't \\"influenced\\" by \\"Mark Owen\\"--but it shouldn't make a difference.

B008EG700U|3.0|3rd album from Swedish artist--sweet, swooning, lovelorn storytelling pop ballads for rainy<br />  afternoons in an outdoor European caf&eacute;, watching handholding strangers go by with a tear in<br />  your eye.  Lekman's gently intriguing, inviting voice is surrounded by a minimally orchestrated<br />  jazzy pop feel that emphasizes the subtlety of emotional expression.  I guess it's just a bit too subtle for  me.  Sometimes recalls<br />  Morrissey, Prefab Sprout, Sondre Lerche, Elliott Smith.
0385344333|2.0|Like most reviewers, I did not enjoy this book.  I'm not surprised, though, as the quality of the Reacher novels has been going down for some time.  I think the basic problem is that Child has created a character in Jack Reacher that has no way to grow.  He's bigger, stronger and smarter than anyone else in the book.  He's long since figured out who he is and what he believes which leaves no room for moral dilemma, and puts Child in the position of having to fill pages with less-than-interesting description and gimmicks.  Reacher has some interesting qualities, but at the end of the day, he's a two-dimensional hero who is the same in every book.  I think it's a credit to Child's talent that he's been able to keep Reacher going as long as he has.<br /><br />By the way, I'm O.K. with Tom Cruise playing the role of Jack Reacher, although I'll be surprised if the movie is any good.  I've always thought it kind of strange that most of the people Reacher beats up would pick a fight with him in the first place, being as big and obviously tough as he is.  Tom Cruise...not so hard to believe.
B0078ZYXSA|4.0|4th album from English band responsible for \\"Come On Eileen\\"; 1st since 1985.  This one is a<br />  subtly powerful record of sweet British soul.  The songs sometimes move from semi-<br />  orchestrated, sincere balladry to punchy funk/soul at the drop of a hat.  The arrangements are<br />  meticulously constructed, smooth & flowing, with a very \\"adult\\" sort of sophistication.  Rowland's<br />  voice is in top form, both as a jazzy nightclub crooner and a Stax/Volt British cousin.  He sounds<br />  very comfortable in his own skin here, showing a relaxed potency that lends his vocals a glowing<br />  confidence.  I don't think this is an album for everybody.  I'm not even sure yet that it's for me.<br />  But something about it makes me want to grab a glass of wine, turn down the lights and slow<br />  dance with my shadow.  Includes contributions from members of Style Council, Ocean Colour<br />  Scene, Divine Comedy, Incognito, Juicy Lucy, Guillemots, Sunlight Square.  It's a nightclub soul<br />  album that recalls artists like Al Green, Tindersticks, Jackie Wilson, Tom Waits.

B008GFI4KY|3.0|3rd release from outlandish British retro-rockers:  Led by Justin Hawkins' uniquely high-pitched<br />  vocals, these are ridiculously over-the-top, big-hair, tight-crotch glam rock songs that combine a<br />  sense of humor and self-parody with a soaring, grandiose stadium rock ethos.  The first time<br />  around, this was great fun and a major musical kick in the ass.  On the third album, the songs<br />  feel a bit lackluster, and the novelty sometimes wears a little thin--with the exception of this<br />  stand-out Radiohead cover and a couple of other tunes.  Shades of Queen, Slade, AC/DC,<br />  Sparks.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the third installment of the Fifty Shades Trilogy and it picks up right where the last book left off.  The story opens with the wedding just over and the honeymoon in full swing.  Christian and Ana are back and as good (or bad!) as ever before!  The plot thickens as there is sabotage at Grey Industries, fights and disagreements with the couple, and (of course!) explicitly described make up sex.  The scenes are hot and if you can get past a few editing issues (eek!) then you will surely enjoy what the book has to offer.  My biggest complaint is that the end came much too quickly!  What am I going to do all night now?  Sleep?  Anyway, if you are like me and are looking for something to keep you occupied after the trilogy is over, check out [[ASIN:B008UCKTL0 SENSATION AND MAGIC - A woman's erotic journey through Submission and Mastery (Erotic Adventures - Women's Journals)]] or [[ASIN:B009AC559A PAYBACK - a time of Revenge and Desire (Erotic Adventures - Women's Journals)]].  Both of these stories have a lot of the same sexual exploits going on as the Fifty Shades books and are very well written (and edited! ha!).  Plus, these books are bargain priced!  Happy reading!
B008JEJVXG|5.0|2nd release from Virginia band:  These are absolutely stunning, full and warm dream-pop songs<br />  that pull you in with a wistful, loving despair--like the extended hand of a forlorn friend seeking<br />  to meld.

0674057929|5.0|I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.<br /><br />All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.<br /><br />In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our `unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for `gross indecency' a few years later.<br /><br />From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.<br />It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.<br /><br />Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture ofDorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs.Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I have written a book in Norwegian and was looking very much forward to publish it on Amazon for reading on Kindle. Unfortunately, that cannot be done since Kindle does not support Norwegian (Scandinavian) language. Very disappointed. When will that be possible? Any known plan?

B008BRC6NS|1.0|I wish I was able to listen to this music Cd before I bought it.....The CD was brand new in the package and nothing wrong with it EXCEPT.....The music Stinks.  I don't know what Jennifer was doing when she thought this would go over but for me and my household, we are passing on this one.  I am giving it away for free. Which is sad cause she usually does really good on her singing.  Maybe the next one...Who knows
B002RI99IM|5.0|Im still getting into the book, but I have to say so far it is a fantastic read. As I am reading if for my work as well as personal interest, I have to say I am getting a double benefit. I would recommend it to any one to read, and indeed I already have to many of my co-workers.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have had occasional issues, but overall, the app is very workable. There have only been a couple of times that it wouldn't pin. Most of the problems I encountered were early on...and mainly because I wasn't familiar with the app.

B00514HDNW|5.0|I hesitated to read this book because of seeing the movie first years ago, but after reading so many reviews that said the book was so different that it wouldn't spoil it, I went ahead and bought it. WOW!! This book was great!<br />I don't want to give too much away, but the title of the book should in noway mislead you into thinking that a \\"hero\\" will emerge, be self sacrificing, and put the evil in its \\"proper place.\\" Will Smith is no where to be found among the pages, this Robert Neville is not the Hollywood stereotype hero. He is flawed, a little crazy at times, and can even be slightly annoying. In all honesty the only reason you root for him is because it would seem he is the last of our kind.<br />I am so glad I went ahead and read this, I highly recommend it.

B007ELN8Y8|5.0|The Artist follows in the great filmmaking traditions reminiscent of Francois Truffaut,  Jean-Luc Godard  and Akira Kurasawa. A truly independent picture that is an instant classic.

B0068THAGY|2.0|The \\"Goonies\\", \\"Stand By Me's\\", and \\"ET's\\" of my day were way better. Super 8 tries to be a coming of age story, but falls way short. Like so many movies today, instead of developing the characters and focusing on a good storyline the film relies heavily on special effects. In doing so the film loses its heart. We have plenty of Transformer type movies, it would have been nice to see this movie differentiate itself. Also, what happened to the professor in the end....?

B0000VCZKM|1.0|I can't speak for the stage musical but this film does not faithfully represent the comic strip by Harold Gray. While dir. John Huston slipped in a few (weak) references that only a dedicated Gray fan would understand, the film overall is a terrible adaptation.<br /><br />Daddy Warbucks is a tireless enemy to crime in all its forms & devotes his life to bringing justice to criminals who escape legal punishment. That is what Punjab & The Asp are for, they are efficient assassins who step in when \\"Daddy\\" needs them. Annie isn't a cute singing moppet, she is a pint-sized adventuress who endures true hardship & tragedy and often joins in Warbucks' fight against crime. Punjab is not a sideshow conjurer, Gray's world is filled with *real* magic, miracles, and supernatural occurrences. The drunken carpet-baggers in this movie would be no challenge at all to the real Annie or Warbucks, and if they crossed a certain line, the real Daddy Warbucks would send the Asp along in the night to make sure they would never hurt children again.<br /><br />It pains me to write this since I am a huge John Huston fan. I can only imagine what he would have done with the real source material, not a musical that steals its plot from \\"Silas Marner\\" and requires these dignified, intense, often dark characters to stop and do a little song & dance every five minutes.<br /><br />Skip this & read the Fantagraphics reprint series. That's where the real Annie can be found. If you like stories with intelligence, action, adventure, mystery and a touch of philosophy, you'll love the original strip by Harold Gray.

B008PZ69T8|5.0|I have to admit that I am totally caught up in the trilogy -- and I have always loved classical music-- so this is a double treat for me. It has introduced me to Thomas Trellis, who like many people who are casual classical listeners, I've never heard before being introduced to it in the book. Some other less familiar pieces are simply haunting and lushly beautiful. The more familiar pieces are heard in a slightly different context. If you've read the book, you will never be able to listen to Bach's Concerto in D Minor without thinking of Christian Grey playing sadly at the piano, or the Goldberg variations without thinking of \\"THAT SCENE!!\\" At the same time, this volume stands on its own as a relaxing and lovely collection of some of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written. It is worth every cent!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Personally, I preferred a low-cost and no frills cover for my new Kindle Fire HD. The problem was that at first only Amazon's far more expensive leather products were available, and there were few details about the alternatives. So I took a risk and bought the Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\".<br /><br />I am delighted with the purchase. The case is well-built, and can be set either horizontally or vertically. There is a black elastic strap that easily stretches over the outside cover (from back to front) to protect the Kindle Fire HD even in a suitcase, backpack, or briefcase. And the case is anti-skid, so that it rests solidly on your table or desk.<br /><br />And honestly? Although the Kindle Fire HD is a bit heavier with the case, it is far easier to grip safely and comfortably for long periods. That is especially important for me because arthritis in my hands makes gripping uncomfortable after just a few minutes.<br /><br />The case is well made, it looks beautiful, and I am confident that it will protect my Kindle Fire HD even if I drop it.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this product, especially at almost half the price of the Amazon cases.

0307279189|4.0|As someone whose longest distance running was five miles, I'm not a member of the \\"running class.\\"  Wish I were, though. I've had a tiny taste of the euphoria the real runners experience.<br /><br />I've known of the Tarahumaras since my days as a cultural anthropology student, and have been fascinated by them, as well as by the amazing Copper Canyons.I really enjoyed this book, and learned much about the world of long-distance running, Nike's scams, and of course, the Tarahumaras. Also I enjoyed the wonderfully colorful characters such as Caballo Blanco. About 2/3's of the way through the book, though, I felt I'd had enough biographies of runners and long accounts of races, and was anxious to get back to the main subject - the race in Copper Canyon. Of course, you can skip the parts of the book that bore. Overall, a very worthwhile experience, highly recommended.
B008B11R1Q|1.0|This album is probably at least 2 and 1/2 stars, but in principle I'm giving it just one for many different reasons. First the album is a slow, frustrating listening experience even though almost all the songs clock in under 4 minutes. There is little variety in terms of song structure for the tracks and hardly any melody. It's a slog! Perhaps \\"Swept Away\\" is the only track with any drive (But only in a measured pulsating way). I was really letdown. I think only 3 or 4 songs are \\"good\\" but not great or fantastic. Really, not one song on this album comes close to any of the great tracks on the debut! Even though there is nuance, detail, and a generally enveloping sound to the record - It really just limps along with none of the tracks revealing anything special. But here's the thing that really gets my goat: In the 3 years it took to produce this album, not one person in the band or studio, a friend, manager, record executive or engineer suggested that these tracks were pretty tepid and unfleshed out. Not one person tried to challenge the group to perhaps expand their vocabulary? It is even more infuriating to think the XX has been touring a lot in this time; So it is suprising that as these songs were tried out on stage they weren't developed beyond the sadly embryonic state they are here. It really feels they got lost in trying to make some dark emotional \\"STATEMENT,\\" but instead squandered their dynamics, natural pop instincts and general momentum. It suggests that since winning the Mercury prize, people around the XX became a little bit of \\"YES\\" men/can do no wrong. Despite this harshness of my view, I'll be on board for the 3rd album.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|What's the old saying? Money can't buy you love, and how true that is! That to me is really the moral of this story as it has been portrayed.  I won't deny it brought a tear to my eye now and then when you actually see how much Jack and Rose really loved each other and how the story actually ended. All in all, a wonderful film and very heartfelt!<br /><br />The bluray quality is a 10/10 in terms of picture and sound. I'm unable to comment on the extras as I rented this film from Redbox, but from what I understand it has tons of material on it.  This honestly is a great film when it comes to true romance, emotions and tragedy.  Three hours flew by in a heartbeat!<br /><br />An update: I just had a friend call me who has the bluray and he said his disc froze when Jack allegedly gets arrested for stealing Rose's necklace. He had to press forward on the remote and says he lost about 45 seconds of the film before it played again.  I have read that other people have had issues with their discs as well! I certainly hope this isn't a screw up on Paramounts part where some defective discs have been released.  That would really suck big time considering how many people put their hard earned cash into these movies.

0439023521|2.0|This book has probably been more talked about than any other over the past year or so.  However, in my opinion, it deserves almost none of the credit it has been given.  Despite being a very enthralling book, I tend to have the habit of not noticing poor writing quality until after the fact, and this book alerted me at the very beginning.  Over the course of the book (and the series), there are many chances to develop the backstory with the inner conflict with the Capitol and the tyranny, but the books live too much in the moment.  They never take time, as a good book should, to reflect on what has been happening, why it happened, and what that means.  Even in narrative, the book falls short.  It isn't written nearly well enough to have been adapted to a movie.<br />  One of the main problems with this book is the lack of a real hero.  I mean, we all know as readers (or writers) that heroes need conflict, and some of that conflict should end in failure, right?  Well, throughout the series, every conflict, no matter how minor or major, seems to leave Katniss, the main character, in a bad position.  No matter how overdue Katniss's victory is, it never comes. Not even at the resolution of the series, in the end of Mockingjay.  Granted, I rushed through the series in 3 days, but that was only because I was so very much anticipating the resolution of the series.  However, that resolution never came.<br />  I suppose I should talk about this book in particular.  The beginning, the introduction, is the best part of the book.  Reading it gives you the sense that you're going to be plunged into a great story, with well-rounded characters and a good plot and subplot, as well as well laid-out conflicts.  However, it disappoints in every single aspects.  THe characters turn out to be nothing but an excuse for a reason for the story, and the plot centers entirely around what happens to Katniss at the present time.  She never reflects on anything, and sometimes her lack of this simply kills the purpose of the story.  Also, her personality continually makes random, drastic changes.  For instance, at one point, she shoots another tribute in the Games with no side thoughts, just as a reflex, but later in the book, she completely freaks out about the thought of even hurting anyone.<br />  The book is also simply, for lack of a better word, ruined by the romance aspect.  This is not a book in which romance should be prevalent.  At all.  I mean, it's always good to have some strong, quasi-romantic feelings between characters to keep it interesting, but this is not a romance book.  And it should have stayed that way.  Evidently, though, the need for romance seems to be everywhere, and it just sells more books.  I hate it when authors write certain things into their books just to guarantee people's need to buy it or to read the sequel.  There were so many other ways in which the romance could have been done, and any of them would have been better than the way it was.<br />  For this book, the only good thing I could find was the action.  Though sparse and censored, it's there, and it does almost make the book worth reading.  At times, the book is very intense.  Sadly, though, there isn't any sort of blood or gore.  And ironically enough, the anticipated blood and gore was the entire reason I wanted to read the book in the first place.  That book really could have used some more gore.  I mean, if anyone has ever read the book Lockdown: Escape from Furnace, you'll see that the Hunger Games is like the freaking Teletubbies compared to some other teen novels.  It was way too G-rated for what it's about.<br />  Overall, the book and series pretty much sucked.  It spent 3 whole books halfheartedly building up action, only to disappoint greatly in the end.  Actually, the ending of this first book came too soon, as well.  The book should have actually concluded, instead of simply stopping once the conflict was done.  It seems that all the author wanted todo was write about the Games.  It kind of sucked.  The book simply didn't do what it boasted, and that never ends well for anyone.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Well first of all it is absolutely terrific that ZZ Top has released a new cd after almost nine years of laying low (at least in the recording studio). A new ZZ Top recording is reason enough to celebrate. For those of us who remember seeing them when the beards were just starting to grow and have remained with them for the enitre ride, we welcome any further proof of that signature sound, the song writing skills and above all, that Texas boogie, blues/rock musicianship. La Futura, however, is a mixed bag at best.<br /><br />Their previous cd, Mescalero, contained 16 songs and while not critically acclaimed was in my humble opinion their strongest showing in many, many years. So now we have La Futura nine years later and containing ten new songs (12 if you purchase the cd through Best Buy). That's a little bit better than one new song written PER YEAR. Couple that with the fact that these guys play virtually nothing new LIVE and you have a band that's relying heavily on the past while trying to figure out what \\"The Future\\" holds or even means to them.<br /><br />Given the \\"ingrediants\\" that went into the making of this cd (time, a critically acclaimed producer, time and more time) we should have had our ears bar-b-qued by this cd. Instead we get a few very good songs, some sporadic inspired playing and, surprisingly, a couple of songs that don't even seem to know how to end. Are you kidding me?<br /><br />This week ZZ Top performed live in NYC. Perfect opportunity to unleash a batch of new songs on their adoring fans. No such luck. One, yes one new song from La Futura was in the set. What does that tell you about their own confidence in the new material?<br /><br />Last summer I saw them LIVE (for probably the 7th or 8th time going back to the Tres Hombres tour) hoping to hear something, ANYTHING from their most recent 3 or 4 releases. NOTHING. Just the same ol' same ol'. That little ol' band (from tejas) plays those same ol' songs (from tejas) over and over again.Why even bother writing new material Mr. Gibbons if you're not going to bring it?<br /><br />La Futura has its strong musical moments and may have delayed ZZ Top from becoming nothing more than a glorified Vegas lounge act, but boy, if this is what \\"La Futura\\" holds, then it looks kinda bleak to this long time fan.
B006GM881Y|1.0|I could go into detail about how the books are SO much better that the TV show, but the TV was worth watching except for a few episodes, like this one the clip show.  No one likes clip shows.  They take advantage of the audience, hoping that they will watch ten minutes of new material while the studio pays almost nothing to reshow the various clips.  This is a clip show, so despite the \\"Creator\\" name, nothing at all happens that matters to the story in the least.

Reading his story, the military must take a lot out of the family life of a person.  And being with the SEALS even more.  It is a life of dedication, one that the American people really appreciate.<br /><br />I hope everyone either buys the book or goes to the library and get a copy to read.  The book opens up our eyes to what military is and what it does to our military warriors.
B008LZHA3G|2.0|An album with content that is oddly enough, more boring than the album cover. Come on Bob, let's shake things up a little yea?
B0087HT36U|1.0|stupid that's all I have to say if I could rate it 0 iwould who ever made this absolutely copied angry birds and made it 10x worse by having it crash your system never buy this game.
B005P06AAO|1.0|I LOVE THE SHOW BUT I BLOODY HATE CENSORSHIP WITH A PASSION. I WAS DISGUSTED TO DISCOVER ALL SWEARING AND THE SHOWING OF THE MIDDLE FINGER WAS BLOCKED. SHAME ON THE COMPANY RESPONSIBLE FOR RUINING THIS GREAT SHOW. AMAZON SHOULD DEMAND THE FOLLOWING SEASONS ARE UNCUT ON DVD AS THIS WILL ENSURE BIGGER SALES AND BETTER ENJOYMENT FOR US MUGS WHO DESERVE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. PULL YOUR BLOODY HEADS IN AND SHOW US SOME RESPECT IN FUTURE BY NOT TREATING US LIKE KIDS.
B009329Y30|4.0|Great movie I't is a tearjerker,everyone should watch this.I saw the prewiews and it was more than I expected.I would watch it again
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The bag is not very big but is good enough for an amateur photographer, there are several pockets , the quality is good, and there is enough padding to protect the equipment. I am happy with this purchase!!!!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really enjoy this app for my kindle fire. My husband put it on here for me. It gives me a clear reading on what can be done and how long can be done. Thank you for such easy to understand app.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Never a bored minute with this game around.  It is constantly a challenge to improve my time.  would highly recommend.
0307593312|5.0|Although I'd heard bits and pieces about this Japanese author, I'd never actually read any of his books. When this novel came out, I bought the hardcover version so that I could start reading it on my own, uninhibited by other reviews.<br /><br />I loved every chapter. Although many have criticized the book's length, and I admit to skimming a bit in the last section, I didn't want the novel to end. I found it lyrical, magical, and inexplicable. Months later, I'm still thinking about how patiently Aomame watched the park to see if Tengo would appear and wondering if true love has to be that patient, that hopeful, that fanciful.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of the book was the way it flipped back and forth among characters. Whenever I started a new chapter about Tengo, I was excited to see what had been happening with him. The same was true when I started a chapter with Aomame.<br /><br />What I can't understand is how a book written in Japanese could translate so easily into English. That is magic in itself. I can hardly wait for my next ride with Murakami, wherever that will take me to.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Really well designed game. I rarely write reviews but this game really deserves 5 stars! Loads of fun and such a smooth interface.
B008HI7BMW|5.0|This is the kind of score that I had been waiting for in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. I respect James Newton Howard as a composer, but I never quite felt his style matched the tone of Nolan's movies. Hans Zimmer did a masterful job capturing the dark mood of TDKR with a balanced score that was equal parts somber and explosive, with his trademark brassy melodies. Easily my favorite score of the three movies.
044654146X|5.0|Amazing book! Learned so much from the Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle.<br /><br />Great job Saul Singer and Dan Senor, keep it up!
B00881VLCE|3.0|Love the app..but it freezes up frequently. The puzzles themselves are quite fun to do.  Needs a bit of tweaking...but very fun!
B00571F26Y|2.0|I believe in eating clean but this book is too hard for me to follow.  I was curious about this diet because a friend of mine was doing great...losing lots of weight and looking great. But being a \\"southern\\" gal, I find myself having a hard time with it.  Maybe if I HAD to go Gluten Free for my health it would be a helpful book, but right now I just need to make smart choices and not restrict myself sooooo much.
B0087HT36U|4.0|this is the best game I have ever play in my life. There are 4 types of levals. and 63 leavels.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wasn't sure about this series when I started with the Hunger Games. My daughter encouraged me to \\" pick it up again\\" and read more. I should have known better. Most great books will take a little bit to get into. And that's how it should be. Why have the story obvious and apparent from the beginning? Don't we want the story to take our mind somewhere different? Don't we read to escape? Well thank goodness I persevered. I am now on the last book called<br />\\" The Mockingjay\\" and I can't wait for my lunch break to read it on my Kindle Fire. I am at the stage to where, I am already disappointed that this series will not continue !! It's terrific !  Read it!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|it's a very good movie for young and old alike.. love the minions. even bought the 3 mini-movies on the minions.....banana,banana???
B0074VTHKM|2.0|What the ding dong? Is there a John Grisham, Jr.? Maybe there's a John Grisham training camp where wannabe authors submit their rejected works for review. This book is one of them. When will the real John Grisham write a new book?
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Man I had to repurchase these AKG'S they are killer phones!!! I am in an extensive recording program at my school and the right headphones are essential to the labs there and let me say that they are absolutely superb.  Someone stole the first pair I had, and I rarely repurchase the same item twice but these were definitely worth the reinvestment.  True sound, ultra clear highs and low end without distortion.  I'd recommend these, and they cover your entire ear, I know it says semi open but it covers the entire ear and they are super comfortable too.  Hope this helps
B0087HT36U|4.0|Similar to Angry Birds, yet fun in a different way. It's easier to master the levels than Angry Birds. Good way to burn up a couple of hours.
B007ZD17XO|1.0|This game would be great, but on my droid 4 running ICS its very laggy. my wife has a droid 3 and it runs great. please address this issue as this is a great game otherwise.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|this app worked perfectly until for some reason it just stopped it tells you to update when there isn't one and it won't play/download anything anymore. hope they fix it soon best app for my kindle fire that I found. want it back asap.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love it...no more lost pieces. I can take my puzzles with me and never have to worry about keeping them secure
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's not often that you run across a book that is unique in story line and keeps you drawn in.  This book is all of that.  Hugh is a gifted writer and has done a great job in portraying what life in a \\"doomsday bunker/ silo\\" could be like. Required reading for doomsday preppers!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Worth more than 6 dollars. Perfect fit, protects phone well and is not excessively bulky. Looks nice and makes phone easier to hold and hard to drop. Good design.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great app to find and share information on your likes and interests.  this has become an everyday app tor me!  its a lot of fun to use!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm pretty terrible at writing reviews, but I wanted to give this game the 5 stars it deserves. Simple interface and gameplay, and it really forces you to get creative, especially on the higher levels. I highly recommend it.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Maybe it's because so many of the songs inspire/fit the scenes in my new book. Maybe because the music reminds me of the place I live even if they are a Brit band. Maybe it's the soulful quality. Maybe it's the rage and anger. Maybe it's the yearning. Maybe it's the longing for place and belonging.<br /><br />but it's most certainly the talent- instrument and voice - that is the reason I love this cd.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|Best I've heard in a long time! This band is just simple put...awesome. Looking forward to more cd! A must have in my opinion!
B000KIPD5E|5.0|it's an instrument/amp switch, it does what it's supposed to do and it does it good. Great for the price.
1401322786|5.0|the time keeper is another must read by Mitch Albom. this author takes you on journeys with several characters in different aspects of their lives. You feel as if you are one his characters, feeling their emotions of that time and place. Almost feeling like you are there, wanting to reach out and involve yourself, only to pull back and allow these characters to figure life out on their own.<br /><br />A must read!
B008SVS0K0|5.0|This is an amazing CD and the best Billy Talent CD yet! I give it 5 gold stars and 10 thumbs up.
0887081770|2.0|I thought I was getting the full size book and I ended up with a tiny 4x6 book.  The story is great, but I am disappointed in the size of the actual book.  I did not see anywhere on the listing that it was so small.
1439156816|3.0|I really wanted to give this book 3.5 stars...3 seems a bit low, but 4 was a bit high.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it was a good book. It was full of Stephen King's casual and perfect irreverence. The biography parts flowed quickly and easily, and it was fun to be able to see a glimpse into the background of one of America's most famous authors of horror. As many of his books do, it left you craving more. I've always wondered what it must be like to hear a bedtime story with Stephen King as your dad, for instance.<br /><br />The instructional parts were simply \\"fine.\\" I didn't find anything groundbreaking or novel about the advice. It was good advice, and King's style made it easy to read, so it was valuable in that sense. I enjoyed reading his take on how a novel takes shape.<br /><br />The ending seemed very abrupt. He says repeatedly that it's going to be a short work, and it was, but it still seems like somehow there must have been more to say. So it left me with a vague sort of \\"that's it?\\" feeling.<br /><br />Overall, the book succeeded in one thing (and probably its main purpose). It made me want to put down the book, pick up my pen, and write.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|so addicting .....this app is awesome. I would recommend it to any one especially since its free. I sat in bed for over an hour playing this game. No matter who you pick. my character was ALF and it guessed correctly.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|It worked great then there was a recent issue but there is a patch and it asks me to update every time i open the app. the problem is there is no update option.
B008FOB124|5.0|When I saw DCD was touring, i bought a ticket immediately and caught their show in Berkeley at The Greek.  I was stunned; it was so very beautiful.  The show opened with \\"Children of the Sun\\" off Anastasis.  Really fine.  I mean really fine; the show included a mix of the familiar and songs from this album.  Tim Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren\\" sung by Brendan as an encore knocked me out.  If you are a fan of progressive, ethnic-influenced, intelligent adult hypno-trance music with astounding male and female vocals, Anastasis is for you.  As is the whole catalogue of DCD.  And see them live.  Yes!!
B0034G4P1W|5.0|We rented this film for my nine year-old son who had the stomach flu. I half-heartedly paid attention while trying to get other things done, but my son kept calling my attention to the screen. So we would rewind it a bit and every time we did, I saw something that cracked me up. I finally realized that this was worth watching, not just listening to in the background.<br /><br />There are extremely clever visual gags, homages to British historical figures and culture, and really fantastic animation all throughout. There is also some dialogue that was maybe a little tough to understand at first but reviewing it was worth the effort. Even loved the Pirate Captain's ridiculously sentimental montage to the Flight of the Conchords non-love-song song, it's when he hits bottom and realizes what's most important to him. Try to listen to the lyrics during it-they're perfect! There are also plenty of fun things to look at during the end credits.<br /><br />Be forewarned that if you aren't able to give it your full attention, you might miss out on some great belly laughs. In summary, my message is simple: give this one a chance, for you and your children alike. It won't disappoint. I loved it!
B007SGM084|5.0|Its the best novel I've read so far.<br />It's captivating and exciting.<br />Didn't put it down till I got to the last page. I have it on my kindle and on paper back. I've read it twice now.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|The 7th season of SUPERNATURAL, introduce us to Leviathans, hungry creatures that escaped purgatory while Castiel was trying to trap them back in, and you might thing that Levianthans are one more easy kill for the Winchesters, thing again! Leviathans are far more smarter and they can't be killed with any known way, or can they? Watch as the Winchesters trying to save the world from those hungry creatures that seek to make the planet their own casserole...

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a calculator that just does the job without a lot of bells and whistles. This one is perfect for me.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Im almost finished with this book, and I must say that I have enjoyed it so far. The only complaints I have it that the author has a tendency to re-use phrases and words a lot.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|You want a cartoon, you got a cartoon.  The plot seemed silly and the stunts were amazing and of course completely improbable.  If you're looking for good story line, drama and a complicated plot, you don't want this one.  If you want to see amazing effects and stuff getting blown up, this is a good pick.  It's good at what it is, I look at it this way, many movies pretend to have good plots which actually suck and supposedly realistic action which isn't.
B008N1LL42|4.0|I was shocked when this movie did not make it at the box office. It is entertaining,fast paced and interesting the entire movie. I have watched the movie 2 or three times and will watch it again. Conversely, I watched Star Wars One once and that was once too many. John Carter is another similar movie that also fits the bill.
B008FOB124|5.0|Dead Can Dance have not had a new album out in 16 years.....Anastasis is a great comeback to the music world. Dead Can Dance are known for their etheral sounds and worldly music. This album stays true to that style. It edges more towards a middle eastern style mood.  While the album as a whole is great...their are a couple of tracks which I found outstanding. For me Amnesia and Children of the Sun are two tracks which brought back the magic of Dead Can Dance. I have listened to Dead Can Dance since the late 80's.....they are still in fine form today with this latest release!

B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I have a short list of living actors that if they make a movie, I watch. They only pick interesting movies.  If you don't agree, then yell at the sky because I couldn't care less.  Kurt Russell, Sean Connery, Sigourney Weaver, Morgan Freeman, Robert Downy Jr, Johnny Depp, Leo DiCaprio and now Charlize Theron.  Monster was amazing, Hancock was cool, but this one sealed Ms Theron for me.  I never thought any actress could hold a candle to Weaver's stepmom in Tale of Terror.  Ms Theron is a close second.  And being a close second to Sigourney Weaver is a damn good compliment.
B00770KR7W|4.0|well in my opinion its a well destined figure for the most part. it is well detailed and poses well except for the hips. the figures leg joints and not very poseible. the rest of it is awesome. even with the 1 major flaw i would still recommend this figure.
0985081821|5.0|From the first moment you pick up this book, you can't put it down! I was captured in the first paragraph and had to know more! I fell in love with Sophie and Charles as soon as I read about them! If you are looking for the next \\"it\\" in paranormal, this series will do the trick! I am anxiously waiting for the second volume to come!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I'm still playing this game. Probably about midway through. It requires you to use facebook to get past certain points, and to share updates. It also asks you to review, but isn't pushy about it. There are more than ten levels, but I haven't finished it yet. Occasionally, the items blink on the 'find the differences' game. It hasn't caused any problems with game play. I'm using a Kindle Fire. These plot is so-so, but it's not terrible. Overall, I am enjoying this game.
0307950689|4.0|This book, being the third in the series that features Robert Langdon solving age-old mysteries in a matter of hours, has fallen into the rut of formulaic exposition. However, that is not all bad as many of us enjoy going along with old friends as they try to figure out the latest mess they manage to get into. In this book, the author spins up a web of intrigue involved the United States, Freemasons, and a supposedly lost secret trove of knowledge that the world is not ready for, that has been hidden for millenia, but is now the focus of some madman. As was true in the first two books, Robert Langdon is somehow involved, and he manages to resolve the situation in a matter of hours, while being hounded, pressed, violently beaten, and otherwise placed under stress - obviously the best way to solve mysteries that the most brilliant minds in the world could not solve for many centuries!<br /><br />But that's poking fun at the whole concept of this series of books and in reality, this book was probably as much fun to read as the others. The focus of this book is Washington DC, and as someone who has spent many hours and days in our nation's capital, part of the fun for me was to try and imagine the locations mentioned and compare them to what I know from my visits. For the most part, this book is not too far off the mark, although there are some mistakes or twists that are simply not reality, but again, let's suspend our disbelief and just go with it.<br /><br />There is very little different in the structure of this book from The DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons. The puzzles are different, of course, and the linkages between various items are new and different as well. It was fun to see some of the puzzles and I have to admit that I took some pride in solving some of them as soon as I saw them, or knowing how to solve them, as well as identifying quite early on, where the final scene will take place. I also figured out the relationship between the evildoer and the other characters within the first few chapters. It was also fun following along the various chases and scenarios that were forced-fit around the main plot to help confuse us and also to pad the book's page count. However, I did end up taking away one star from this review for two main issues that I had with it. First of all, there is a main character who is supposedly progressing the science of Noetics. However, except for continuously telling us how her research was important and how it was going to change the world, there is almost nothing else mentioned about it. The second reason I took one star away from this book's ratings is that the last 100 pages or so became very metaphyiscal and boring in endless expositions of a meta-religious coming together of all the world's hopes and dreams etc. Even with the tenuous connection being drawn between Noetics and the coming enlightment of the world - I suppose it was trying to counteract the complaining about how this world is going the wrong direction and how evil is winning - but it did not work for me and I was flipping through unread pages to get back to the storyline.<br /><br />In addition to some geographical problems and some technological gaffes, this was almost believable and would be the kind of book that I would want to take on lengthy airplane rides as nothing like a Dan Brown novel makes the humdrum reality of sitting in an uncomfortable seat for many hours, pressed against people you do not know, and being squeezed from the front and back into feeling like a sardine in a can, go by faster. For this reason, I give this book a four star rating.r characters within the first few chapters.

B002KD0OSS|5.0|Cohen is the man! His poetry is amazing, his voice is a little lacking but he more than makes up for it with the emotions he elicits from his listeners. This is a beautiful album with a lot of heart.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars strictly on fun factor alone. The plot is simple enough to not lose itself anywhere. Not that there is much in the way of things that could be said and be considered spoilers, but I'll keep my description brief anyway. Basically, the misfit brother of a Naval officer gets arrested trying to steal a chicken burrito for the uber hot chica in the flick and is basically forced to enlist in the NAvy himself where he is made an officer. Of course, things happen (namely an alien invasion) and said misfit ends up as the ranking officer in the arena, where he, his crew, and a few other people are forced to squash said alien invasion by themselves. Now, you basically know the entire plotline, lol.<br />So, why did I enjoy this movie? Many reason actually. It was a big, visually pleasing movie. The battles between the human and alien ships were super cool, and the alien technology in particular was really neat and very devastating. The aliens themselves were pretty well thought out in a slightly more advanced than, but not completely dissimilar to humanity sort of way. Their armor in particular was quite reminiscent of the Mjolnir armor from the Halo game series. The interaction between the characters was also pretty funny, and there were plenty of enjoyable moments in that regard. The cast was spot on, and was tailored to a younger crowd. From o-boy of John Carter fame to Rihanna, there was plenty to relate to, and for us older folks, well...there was Liam Neeson and a whole host of crotchety old navy shipmen. The audio for the movie was also quite big, and completely complimentary to the visuals. Last, the way in which they tied the battle structure in the movie to that of the game itself was very cool.<br />So, while not a writers opus, this movie was certainly enjoyable, and I think you will have found your time to be well spent.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Buy this book! It will keep you up all night! It is a fast read, full of excitement, suspense, intrigue and a bit of science fiction.<br />I am off now to purchase [[ASIN:1460974425 Run]] by Blake Crouch since I am now hooked!

B008B11R1Q|4.0|I was very skeptical at the new The XX's record \\"Coexist\\" when I listened it through the web stream on their page. To me, it was too slow, too monotonous compared to their first record. Then I bought the CD and after giving it a few listens, I am now very impressed by the details of the record. This is a high quality record I really enjoy listen to it very loud. Well, It's still sort of slow to me, but it has a few good songs to dance to (\\"Tides\\", \\"Swept Away\\", just to mention some). Overall, even though the style is not quite my cup of tea, I can't deny it is an amazing record if you listen it from start to end. Very well recorded. The XX sound more mature and professional in Coexist.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it was working GREAT then now it's not working. its not even working on my friends kindle fire we have the same device.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|Superbly written. Narrative style is gripping. The intensity of sufferring and the purpose of comeback have been presented in an involved and engaging way. Author is gracious to share her experiences which she could have chosen not to.A must read for everone to realise the gift of life and the joy of living and to overcome the fear of unknown.
B006MPK9SU|5.0|Michael Connelly keeps the action moving. I appreciate following characters through from one book to another, it makes Bosch and the other stories more personal.  You feel you are part of the scene, and the characters are people you know. The twists and turns of the story are intriguing (don't read the last page first!)
B004EPYZSK|3.0|A man wakes up in the deserts of Arizona with no memories of who he is. He has a funny gizmo wrapped around his wrist. Three guys ride up and assume he's wanted for a bounty, so they try to take him. He beats and kills them all, takes some guns and better clothes, and heads into town. In the town of Absolution, he is patched up by the local preacher (who also packs a rifle). The preacher gives the amnesiac some advice: The good Lord don't care about what you did in the past, it's what you do now that's important. The man winds up in a confrontation with the son of the local cattle baron which lands both of them in jail. Before the sheriff can take them to the U.S. Marshall, the town is attacked at night by strange lights from the sky--ships that capture a bunch of the locals, including the cattle baron's son. Luckily, the gizmo activates when the alien ships arrive and the man shoots one ship out of the sky with it (regular bullets do nothing). The pilot escapes, leaving a trail of inhuman footprints for the posse to follow.<br /><br />The movie has great production values. Southwest America looks great and the aliens are seamlessly integrated into the visuals, making the movie a treat for the eyes. The aliens are a bit of a PG-version of the alien from the Alien franchise, though they are scary enough for this film. The one misstep production-wise was an explosion that looked a little too much like the space shuttle Challenger exploding. It was a bit of a shock though it must be unintentional.<br /><br />The tone of the movie was a bit off for me. I expected a movie with the title \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" to have a lighter, more comic tone. There are funny lines and occasional humorous moments, but mostly it's played as a straight drama. That'd be okay but I didn't find the back stories of the amnesiac or the cattle baron very interesting or their characters sympathetic. Rooting for them was a little hard since I didn't care that much, even though they were played well enough by Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford. The theme of redemption is touched on throughout the film but I did not find it very convincing at the end.<br /><br />Maybe the problem is the genre-mash-up aspect of the film. The high water mark for genre-mash-up has to be Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which combines a period drama with a kung fu flick with a romance with a mystery. The big difference between Crouching Tiger and Cowboys is the starting point. Crouching Tiger starts with a great story that spills over into all these other genres, like a rosebud unfurling its petals. Cowboys seems like a bunch of people took all these cool petals and tried to put a flower together. The credits show seven different writers and seventeen producers, co-producers, and executive producers. The compelling, central story just isn't there or it got lost in a long line of people trying to shape it just right. A lot of neat ideas are in the film but they don't quite make a cohesive whole.<br /><br />Cowboys is entertaining enough for a rainy day. If I ran across it while channel surfing I might watch a bit but it wouldn't keep me on the channel.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm a professional story analyst, so it's a little tough to pull off a plot twist on me -- I typically see 'em coming pages in advance. I love a book that surprises me with a turn I didn't anticipate, and this is one of those. I really enjoyed the novel and had trouble putting it down before I was done with it. However, I was disappointed with the ending; it left me unsatisfied and unresolved. Maybe I was just sad it was over. I would still recommend the book - good characterizations, strong plotting, suspense, and shrewd insights into marriage and relationships.
B0038AUY96|4.0|Usually I give Jo Nesbo five stars, but for me The Snowman was only worth four stars because I guessed the villain right in the beginning.  His previous books have been very clever with many twists and turns.  Either I've become smarter and figured out how Jo Nesbo's mind works or this one was a little predictable.  Right from the word go I knew there was something strange about Bratt, and when the body fell out of the freezer I instinctively knew why she reacted the way she did.  As for the villain, for me it was obvious who it was.  The attempted twists aand turns didn't detract me from my first choice of villain.  Am hoping The Leopard won't be as predictable as The Snowman, but my criticism aside, it was still a good story and an excellent read.
B00846REIS|2.0|not what I expected didn't keep  my interest almost a copycat of fifty shades of grey.wouldn't recommend a read to anyone.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought this for MMORPG gaming (LOTRO) and it works great.  It was not hard to get used to and the mini joystick works very well.  Good button placement for use with left hand.  All keys can be custom programed to your liking even with structured time delays between keystrokes.  Easy to program.  Multiple profiles for different characters and classes.  Each profile also has 3 different modes, each mode gives you another programming slot for all keys.  I have only used for a month and just really scratched the surface.  Sturdy and heavy so it does not move around while using it.  When installing the software it picks up the games you have installed and custom macros for your game are available.  I am very happy with this and highly recommend it.  Can also be used for general productivity.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Why all these 1 star reviews? The game is fun, And angry birds wasn't the first castle destruct game.  Just because you baught a crappy device, isn't the games fault. Just because you have a new incompatible operating system doesn't make you cool either. if you're going to complain about incompatibility wait until the bugs worked out, before you upgrade your device.  again the game is fun, don't listen to the low IQ 1 star reviews
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was non linear and unconventional but captivating. You got to know and love the characters. The descriptions of clothing, scenery and sensory delights are wonderful. I highly recommen this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great love story with an awesome twist. Will read it again. All 3.  I recommend this book and have purchased  several for gifts to family and friends.

B008J05EL8|1.0|I just updated my OfficeSuite app through Amazon Appstore and I got a pop up window telling me I am eligible for extra fonts. Little did I know that clicking on that pop up would send me here.  This has to be the sneakiest in app purchase attempts I have come across. Five dollars for something fonts on an Android device? You've got to be kidding.<br /><br />OfficeSuite Professional 6 is a good productivity app for my tablet to read MS Word, Excel &amp; PowerPoint files on the go, but this font package is a complete rip off.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I find this app very tranquil and relaxing when you listen to the sounds and close your eyes its like your actually there. I reccomend this to anyone who has stress
B0087HT36U|4.0|Just picked up Siege Hero as the Free App of the Day.  I've seen other reviewers complaining about it not installing but it plays w/o a problem on my Samsung Galaxy S II phone and my old HTC Flyer tablet running Honeycomb.  The graphics are very good, especially on my tablet.  There are limited options, just to turn sound off / on and to reset the game.  You begin with Fortress Age.  The start takes you through a little mini movie of some black and red helmeted warriors taking over a land of peasants.  I just played the first ten levels to test out the game on my tablet.<br /><br />The game is simple to play, you tap the screen at areas to throw stones at.  You are in a first person shooter view on this game.  What you'll want to do is figure out how to destroy the buildings and take out the enemy warriors using the least amount of stones.  You get extra points for how many stones you have remaining.  There are also treasure chests that you can target for extra points. You are awarded a gold crown if you complete the level while meeting certain objectives.<br /><br />On level 1-3, the telescope feature is unlocked.  You hold your finger on the screen to use it.  I found this made it a easier to get a precise hit.<br /><br />Complete level 1-5 and the Treasure level is unlocked.<br /><br />Level 1-9 introduces a peasant on the screen.  You have to save that peasant while taking out the enemy warriors.  (The graphic is kind of funny with the peasant having a big straw hat covering his entire head and a white halo.) So make sure you don't hit that peasant.  This makes the shooting a little more difficult and you may have to repeat the level until you figure it out.<br /><br />Going to the Treasure level, you will see a message saying that Gunpowder is unlocked.  Using gunpowder instead of stones causes an explosion there you aim it that throws debris and shrapnel across the screen.  You have to figure out how to use it<br /><br />Overall, I think Siege Hero is a good casual game.
B008B11R1Q|2.0|First off I must say their debut album is one of my all time favorite albums which I can listen to at any moment. I've been looking forward to this album since early summer. One of the few albums I've bought without having to listen to a single song. After listening to this album four or five times through it just doesn't compare.<br /><br />I was unaware of the guitarist leaving the group. I've seen a high lighted review saying they kept their sound without replacing him. This is completely not the case, those haunting guitars riffs that came out of nowhere on their last album are sadly nowhere. The beat and feel of this album is sadly incomplete. If the original band were still together or maybe if they had replaced the guitarist would surely have made this album amazing.<br /><br />In the end if you were hoping for another album with the amazing sound of their debut album you'll be sadly disappointed. This album is just incomplete and needs a little more substance.

B008QCBFPI|5.0|I pre-ordered this limited edition Vinyl record of Elysium as soon as Amazon had it available for pre order.<br />As a long time fan of the Pet Shop Boys, I have learnt to get their limited Edition products fast, cause they sell out, and then become hard to get collectible items.<br />Listen on one of the more comprehensive discbography pages, they state that only 1000 of this magnificient copies were made.<br /><br />2xLP: 2012 DE (Parlophone; 5-0-999-3-04391-1 5) [7 Sep; limited edition; x1000]<br /><br />The record packaging is beautiful, the gatefold format is new to their way of releasing an album, and the music inside is just the peak of their long spanning career.<br /><br />A lovely addition to my collection that spans 1984 to 2012.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a terrific novel. I'm not usually fond of mysteries/suspense, but I love Gone Girl! Just when you think you know the characters, they throw you a curve. You can follow their logic, and they seem quite reasonable till you hear it from the other character's perspective. I can't wait to read the other books by this author (and excerpts are very thoughtfully included at the end of this one.)
0684803356|4.0|This book is the fiction novelization of the Hemingway's experiences in Spain during the civil war. But the book is more than an historical novel (in fact it does not have many historical description) or a war novel; it is just a novel with adventure, with love, and with the background of poor but proud suffering people.<br /><br />The novel narrates the story of an American international brigadier fighting for the Republica in the Sierra (mountains) of Madrid. The novel is clearly divided in two parts: the first one that is about the guerrilleros, a slow paced part that mostly cares about feelings, love and suffering. The second part, fast paced, is almost a classic war novel with the goal of blowing up a bridge.<br /><br />The first part, although maybe too slow sometimes, relates feelings, how the guerrilleros feel about the coming of a foreigner and how they finally get use to him. The most interesting point of this part is the feeling of fear, of quite calm, of the stressful waiting that Hemmingway transmit, nothing happens although they are in the middle of the war. To transmit this feeling, Hemmingway narrates the experiences of the guerrilleros at their villages, some passages are specially moving.<br /><br />The second part of the book is the planning for blowing up a bridge. This part although more entertaining is more typical, is fine though as you get inside the planning and have the feeling of the excitement at the war.<br /><br />If there is something to criticize about the novel is the too much stereotypic description of the Spanish folks. Although poverty, pride, racial and impulsive behavior of Spanish people are well depicted (like Lorca, Cela or Baroja successfully did), somehow it is like if they were actors, too much gypsies and folklore. Hemingway mixes mastery descriptions with others less moving, more artificial. At some passages it is easy to see that Hemingway was not Spanish, and much of the culture is left outside the book and/or simplified (gypsies and folklore).<br /><br />Summing up is a mastery piece where the simple writing style of Hemingway yields a colorful depiction of feelings and actions, although sometimes Hemingway is not capable of transmitting the complexity of the Spanish country.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow.Captivating from the beginning.Love the characters.Had to get vol<br />2&3 as soon as I finished the first. I read all three and loved them all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I mostly use this app on my kindle fire.  I haven't experienced any problems.  I prefer the app to the desktop site.
B007V80WUC|5.0|This is my very first album review.  I've been reading reviews on Amazon for years and never bothered to review an album.  I like reading reviews in an effort to find new bands.  I like when reviewers make the comment that \\"if you like this album...you'll like yada yada yada\\".  That's how I find new bands.  That's how I found Vanden Plas, Circus Maximus, and Pagan's Mind.  I never intended to ever review a band or an album, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to review this album.  OK, first, I understand that reviewers are biased by what they like.  SO...this review is coming from someone who loves progressive metal.  I grew up in the eighties and my bands were Rush, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest.  I also enjoyed Pink Floyd and The Who and Zepplin.  Now, in my older years, I'm into Dream Theater, Kamelot, Symphony X, Vanden Plas, Pagan's Mind, and Circus Maximus.  This album, Nine, is phenomenal!  It's reminds me of Kamelot's Black Halo that stayed in my car's CD player for six months.  Nine has been in my car's CD player for a long time...and even when I remove it to try to listen to something else, I end up listening to one song and then put this back in.  My favorite songs are Architect of Fortune, Burn After Reading, Last Goodbye, and I Am.  Ask yourself this, how many bands have an awesome epic (about ten minutes or more) on an album?  Circus Maximus has three on this album.  Unbelievable!  I love their first album, and was blown away (after several listens) to this album.  Rock On!  This is a MUST BUY!  It is metal, but has awesome and beautiful, passionate melodies, and convincing lyrics.  I couldn't resist.  I had to speak my mind.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a retired navy man who knew a couple of seals i found it very interesting. it was a very good book.
B000002H48|1.0|It would have been helpful to be able to hear a short version of the songs on this album.  I wouldn't have purchased it but I did.  I returned it but as of this date September 14, 2012 I have yet received my refund.  I'm a little upset about this.  I didn't care for the live performances of the songs.

B0088EDMMS|4.0|Hocus Pocus is not the best film ever made, by far. The teen actors (except for Vinessa Shaw as Allison) give overblown performances. The contemporary part is nearly embarrassing. BUT, when the Sanderson Sisters are reawakened, this film turns into a guilty pleasure. Bette Midler, especially, but Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker as well, play the sisters to the hilt, and it's fun to ride along and see how they cope with modern life. Don't miss the cameos by Gary Marshall and Penny Marchall. Not perfect, but fun for Halloween!
B005LAIHHC|1.0|They were clever not to disclose that the digital copy was Ultraviolet. Have yet to have one work---total garbage. I should have purchased from iTunes. Only purchased to get digital copy and it doesn't work. Buyer Beware
055357342X|4.0|Still a great series (haven't read books 4 or 5 yet). There's a great twist at the very end of the book - but I don't have much faith in where that line will go.<br /><br />These books are best read at a high speed, and slow down during the action sequences.  I originally began reading these books at a relatively slow mode to absorb the detail - but there's just too much.  I'm excited to continue with the series, but the effort and time involved to read 800+ pages is intimidating and may force me to put the remaining books on hold.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|It is OK. I enjoyed the game but eventually it gets repetitive. There seem to be so many birds games out now that I quit bothering with them. It is fun to play I just got bored after a while; that and my smartphone went belly up and all my games were lost and I had to start over so I am biased on this. If you love the games I say go for it other wise skip it.

B00005CDNJ|5.0|Tensions may have been growing within the group when Abba recorded their seventh album in 1980, but the album turned out be one of their most consistent with several classics besides the hits \\"The Winner Takes it All\\",  \\"On and On and On\\" and \\"Super Trouper\\".<br /><br />\\"Happy New Year\\" written in Abba's welknown musical style, became one of their most popular, and the song was released as a single 1999 to celebrate the new millennium.<br /><br />\\"Andante Andante\\" is one of Abba most beatiful ballads, and a personal favourite of mine.<br /><br />\\"Our Last Summer\\" is, though not as strong as \\"Andante Andante\\" another fine ballad, featuring a surprising guitar break from Lasse Wellander.<br /><br />\\"The Piper\\" is a folkish experimental song, slightly in the vein of \\"The Eagle\\" from \\"The Album\\".<br /><br />\\"Lay All Your Love on Me  is a disco-styled song that brings thought towards the previous album \\"Voulez Vous\\".<br /><br />The closing track \\"The Way Old Friends Do\\" which was recorded live, sounds like an old Scottish folk-song and works as a magnificent finale to a near perfect album.
1250010489|5.0|(Disclaimer - I was given a signed copy of the book in hardback by Mark as a competition winner but I'd already bought it on Kindle so I didn't need to wait for shipping from USA to UK!)<br /><br />I enjoyed both of Mark's previous books (including the short story Operation Desolation) so was looking forward to the release of Trojan Horse. The book doesn't disappoint there is a good mixture of thriller and technical espionage thrown in. As one of the other reviewers points out this book is slightly lighter on real-world technical content than the previous books however I think this doesn't detract from the overall impact of the book (Also if your not a techy don't worry anything computer related is explained nice and clearly). The scenarios outlined are all entirely plausible and are all based on current real-world scenarios (see STUXNET).<br /><br />The book follows the story lines of several different people over the course of a few days. At first it's hard to see how everything fits together but soon the disparate threads start crossing-over and build up to a satisfying (if bloody) conclusion. The book does require a little bit of suspension of disbelief and leaves a few unanswered questions, but no more than any other thrillers of a similar genre.<br /><br />All in all a satisfying read Looking forward to the next one...
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great physics based game. You touch the screen to launch rocks, bombs, and other unlockables at structures in an attempt to knock them down. Very reminiscent of Angry Birds, but not as frustrating unless you're trying to get all gold medals. Great time killer!

B00371XIJE|5.0|Based, somewhat loosely, upon a true story from 1920's Japan, about a dog that went each day for 10 years to wait for his deceased master to arrive at the train station, this film is an emotional work of art.<br /><br />It's such a pity that it was never released in theaters, but instead went straight to DVD.  When dreck like Battleship or a movie about an obscenity-spewing, coke-snorting teddy bear are heavily-marketed by the industry and small masterpieces like this are discarded, it's clear that Hollywood is a soul-less, empty wastebin.

Kudos to the makers of this latest release!

030758836X|2.0|I was very happy to read all the negative reviews of this book, strange as that may seem. I have been thinking that I was the only person who disliked this book.  I listen to a lot of podcasts that are sponsored by audible so I heard this book plugged as the most \\"listenable read\\" on audible all summer long.  I did listen to it and, although I will agree it was very listenable (if listenable means I did not feel like turning it off and finding something else to listen to; having said that I must add that it was like watching a train wreck.  I was horrified by the idea that a marriage could exist in which two people hated each other so much they spent months trying to figure out how to screw each other over.  It struck me as kind of a book version of the pina colada song--if a marriage is so awful that you have to {a} put a personal ad out in hopes to meet someone else  or {b) plot to destroy the other person's life, why does the marriage exist in the first place.

B005DF2QMC|1.0|I really wanted to give this a try despite other reviews. I have lots of cassette tapes left from the past and wanted this to be a good way to preserve them before they deteriorate beyond recovery. This is not the way.<br /><br />The product does not work. It is cheap plastic. Upon inserting batteries and trying to play a tape just using a pair of earphones, the sound was like a cat dying. The tape speed was going fast and slow several times a second making the sound output horrendous. I thought it might be the tape. I tried several others with the same result. Then I put the same tapes in a tape deck and tried to play them there. They played without problem. It wasn't the tape. It was this player that couldn't perform the simple function of normal output, not to mention getting that output to my PC to convert to MP3. The software did not seem to have any issues and would have worked fine, but the tape player was a complete bust.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, but I strongly recommend against anyone purchasing this. The chances of throwing away your money seem very high. I think the best option I have found for Tape-to-MP3 recording is an Ion Tape2PC dual dubbing deck, also with USB connection to your PC. It is more expensive, but it works and does not feel like it would fall apart after 3 uses.

0307592731|4.0|I enjoy adventure non-fiction for the vicarious thrill, and this book does provide a captivating, well-written account of that, along with an attempt to explain how the author's trip got her life back on some kind of normal track.  By the end of her trip, however, I'm not convinced that she has given up the drug abuse and sexual promiscuity.  I'm happy that she eventually married a guy whom she thanks in the acknowledgements, and dedicates the book to the 2 kids she has with him.  What I'm really curious about is what happened in the years between the end of her trip and marrying the guy.  Is that the topic of her next book?
B000FC1LOC|5.0|What a compelling story.  I was hooked from the first chapter right up until the last one.  This is every parents nightmare, that their child would become sick, we would do anything to save our loved one.  My heart broke for this family, and there are many tearful moments but there were also many moments that made me chuckle, thanks to Campbell, the lawyer.  I would very highly recommend this book.  Our book club read it and I gave it a 10, which is our highest rating, as did many of our members.  This is the first Jodi Picoult book that I have read and will definitely be reading more.  Great story!!

B008WHQZJI|4.0|A lot of fans are are going to blind sided by the Pet Shop Boys latest release.  It's dark, mellow, and as uninviting as you can get.  If you're looking for \\"Yes\\" part 2, and I  admit I was as well,  wait for the next release.  In the mean time, give this one a lot of patience, multiple listens, and it will get under your skin, in a big way.<br /><br />I'd say this is one of their best albums, given the blatant, emotional lyrics and deliberate down tempo riffs to accompany those lyrics.  \\"Leaving\\", \\"Memory Of the Future\\", \\"Breathing Space\\", \\"Everything Means Something\\", are all masterpieces in their own right.  And if you're looking for the next gay club anthem from them, \\"Face Like That', will do just fine.<br /><br />Artists mature and age, and with that comes emotional turmoil; which Neil and Chris express masterfully, and this makes for a thoughtful, creative and introspective departure from the amazing \\"Yes\\" album.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Gilda (Charles Vidor, 1946, 110')<br /><br />The archetypal film noir, Charles Vidor's principal masterpiece. This cleverly plotted, morally ambiguous tale of intrigue and m&eacute;nage-&agrave;-trois was one of Columbia's biggest money-earners to date. It stars Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth in her signature role as the ultimate femme fatale. The film was noted for cinematographer Rudolph Mate's lush photography, costume designer Jean Louis' wardrobe for Hayworth (particularly for the dance numbers), and choreographer Jack Cole's staging of \\"Put the Blame on Mame\\" and \\"Amado Mio\\", sung by Anita Ellis.<br /><br />The film's plot is continually narrated by Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford), a small-time American gambler newly arrived in Buenos Aires. When he wins a lot of money cheating at craps, he has to be rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson (George Macready). Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to practice his skills there. Farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson.<br /><br />Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him and quickly gains his confidence. One day, Mundson returns from a trip with a beautiful new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth). It is immediately apparent that Johnny and Gilda have a history together, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Eventually, they and their love-hate dynamic continues, in turn eventually leaving Mundson dead. Farrell and Gilda finally reconcile and confess their mutual love, and apologize for the many emotional wounds they have inflicted on one another.<br /><br />When first released, the staff at Variety magazine liked the film and wrote, \\"Hayworth is photographed most beguilingly. The producers have created nothing subtle in the projection of her s.a. [sex appeal], and that's probably been wise. Glenn Ford is the vis-&agrave;-vis, in his first picture part in several years...Gilda is obviously an expensive production -- and shows it. The direction is static, but that's more the fault of the writers.\\"<br /><br />More recently, Emanuel Levy wrote a positive review: \\"Featuring Rita Hayworth in her best-known performance, Gilda, released just after the end of WWII, draws much of its peculiar power from its mixture of genres and the way its characters interact with each other...Gilda was a cross between a hardcore noir adventure of the 1940s and the cycle of \\"women's pictures.\\" Imbued with a modern perspective, the film is quite remarkable in the way it deals with sexual issues.\\"<br /><br />Rita Hayworth, aside from her stunning looks, is also a truly great actress and dancer!<br /><br />162us - Gilda (Charles Vidor, 1946, 110') - 16/9/2012an expensive production -- and shows it.

B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I saw a DVD of the rehearsals for the concert that never occurred due to Michael's death, and loved the music, which was a combination of music from Thriller and additional, new songs.  I immediately found the CD on amazon.com and purchased it.  It is fantastic!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm really enjoying this puzzle pack. Several puzzles to choose from with lots of FREE additional puzzles available. 4 size choices is a nice feature. I also like that it gives you the option of making it more challenging with rotating the puzzle pieces. Only complaint is that the preview pieces are super tiny and hard to see. otherwise a great app. My dining room table stays clear and I can do a dozen puzzles a week!
0099579936|1.0|I read this book in one day- I was not impressed.  Probably because I have a normal and healthy love life.  It is a book for those who have boring sex lives and need a fantasy world in order to spice it up.  It's ridiculous.

B008LZHA3G|4.0|Bob continues to uphold the traditions of pre-rock musical forms which he got into full bore with 2001's eternal classic \\"Love and Theft\\". With this release, he still has plenty of steam even when he unabashedly cribs a melody from Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley. He stays squarely in the tradition of Chicago blues, but he still makes \\"Early Roman Kings\\" his own by supplying his wit, especially with the line \\"I ain't dead yet/My bell still rings\\" - pretty darn good for \\"Old Croaker\\".<br /><br />The by-now-familiar single, \\"Duquesne Whistle, a jazz-blues is all toe-tapping brilliance. Bob's vocal brings the spirit of Louis Armstrong, even in its big-band arrangement, without resorting to parody. It's old-time lechery at its best.<br /><br />Conversely, Bob's able to pack so much anger, regret and resignation into the compelling \\"Long and Wasted Years\\". Its folk melody is beautifully underpinned by a descending guitar riff throughout the song. In another powerful folk piece, \\"Scarlet Town\\", he bares out cold rejection in the triplet \\"You promised I'd be your bride/You left me here to rot away/Like holly on a mountainside\\". The piano work and the lovely violin here amplify its mood of abandonment.<br /><br />With the great rattling rocker, \\"Pay In Blood\\", Bob growls as if tearing away at his flesh. Nobody is immune here and I'm not sure that he's ever been less tender-hearted than on this cut.<br /><br />Then there are the two closing numbers. Each recalls the horrors of two very public events. The title track, with its cavalcade of verses alluding to the Titanic tragedy, seems overdone at first. But each successive listening brings a certain logic to it even if some of the facts are consciously distorted. But it's the finale, \\"Roll On John\\", on the life and the travails of John Lennon's senseless death that cuts the deepest. The facts are intact and I believe they express Bob's attempt to come to grips with what happened. It's a mournful blues in A emphasized by the faint strains of Donnie Herron's steel guitar and a gospel organ.<br /><br />With Bob mostly circling back to the past, it appears he's finding the home he's been searching for all his life. With lead guitar ace Charlie Sexton back on board, he adds a lot of bite to the sound. The nostalgic verve of the  music is an efficient vehicle for Bob's voice. It doesn't matter if this is not quite up to the standard of his 1997-2006 trilogy, I still look forward to what will be in the pipeline come three years from now.strains of Donnie Herron's steel guitar and a gospel organ.<br /><br />With Bob mostly circling back to the past, it appears he's finding the home he's been searching for all his life.

B0087YYHZU|5.0|All right, it is the best original movie musical. That goes without saying. But it's also the ultimate in three strip Technicolor, (right up there with THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD) with a dazzling array of colors, from ever so subtle to incredibly saturated.<br /><br />My history with this title goes back quite a ways.  I first saw on tv on NBC's Monday Night at the Movies, as the first network show after the weekend of mourning following the Kennedy assassination. In '63, we didn't have color, but I was totally sold on the film. My first theatrical viewing was at a museum, in 16mm, and I was immediately taken by its ultimate in razzle-dazzle Hollywood sheen.  Then I saw it on the big screen in 35, several times.<br /><br />On video, the colors never came through with the same impact. I had a vhs,  the initial laser incarnation  (which rotted and was replaced,) then the newer pressing with a big gatefold sleeve and then, the first big dvd set.  They each had big improvements on the one immediately preceding them.<br /><br />It was 'close, but no cigar' until this latest version, the blu ray.  Truly epic, tasty recreation, this time. Don't play it on the vivid setting, though. It is not a digital original. Try it on 'movie' and the warmth of the Technicolor process will come bursting forth at you.

B008JH5CVS|1.0|I love science fiction movies. Escape from New York and Pandorum (two movies that this one vaguely resembles) are among my favorites.<br /><br />Yesterday I rented Battleship, even though it was generally panned by critics and viewers alike. I went into it expecting garbage and wound up pleasantly surprised. I can't say the same for Lockout. Whoever is responsible for the dialogue should be laughed out of Hollywood. The constant one-liners are beyond tired and meaningless. Nothing is funny. Nothing is fun. Nothing develops in terms of character or plot. It just sits there being not particularly exciting, in fact it gets worse as the movie progresses.<br /><br />The action sequence near the beginning uses CGI that is so clearly CGI, it's embarrassing. The subsequent action is uninspired and predictable.<br /><br />I had to pause it a few times to look for more interesting things to do with my time, and wound up watching the last 20 minutes while playing a game on my phone, that's how entertaining this movie is.<br /><br />I'm not sure who could be entertained by this movie. It just doesn't deliver on any level.

1401937519|5.0|For starters, Anita Moorjani's book, Dying To Be Me, was an amazing read.<br /><br />It is a book about the agony and torture of the relentless spread of cancer. It is also about an opportunity for redemption that arises out of Anita Moorjani's  NDE as she feels herself leave her body and, for a brief period, being allowed a glorious preview of what eternal and joyous life is like after our body physically dies.<br /><br />Anita's account of her NDE experience reminded me of what author, Betty Eadie, shared in her book, Embraced By The Light, published back in 1994 by Gold Leaf Press.<br /><br />Anita's experiences that I found  wondrous were:<br />1. Stepping outside of linear time<br />The sensation of stepping outside of the physical boundaries of what we know of as linear time. In her NDE, every sensation, every visual image, every thought was available to Anita to absorb or experience in an instant, irrespective of whether the event occurred 20 years ago, 10 days ago or was actually in the present moment. In other words, in the 'real time' realm of where she had traveled to, any experience could be viewed or manifested on the spot without the barrier of time acting as a barrier or shield.<br /><br />2. The analogy of the darkened warehouse<br />I loved her analogy of wandering through a gigantic darkened warehouse filled with wonder and visual treasures with only something akin to a small flashlight. Then, flip the switch that turns on hundreds of bright floodlights and the scope and depth of the warehouse and it's contents are now revealed.<br /><br />3. Remote sensing ability<br />Her ability to tune in on remote events, conversations, and even the personal feelings of her family, medical personal and others, many of whom were far from her hospital room or separated by a considerable distance. Remote sensing is the parapsychology term that applies to this phenomenon.<br /><br />The following excerpt of Anita's describes her feelings and observation of herselfwhile outside of her own body:<br /><br />\\"Ohh...I'm dying. Is this what it feels like? It's nothing like I ever imagined. I feel so beautifully peaceful and calm...and I feel healed at last!\\"<br /><br />\\"I was still acutely aware of every detail unfolding before me as I observed the medical team wheeling my near-lifeless body to the intensive care unit. They were surrounding me in an emotional frenzy, hooking me up to machines while poking and prodding me with needles and tubes.<br /><br />I felt no attachment to my limp body as it lay there on the hospital bed. It didn't feel as though it were mine. It looked far too small and insignificant to house what I was experiencing. I felt free, liberated, and magnificent! Every pain, ache, sadness, and sorrow was gone. I was completely unencumbered, and I couldn't recall feeling this way before ---not ever.\\"<br /><br />Whew! Pretty remarkable disclosures of what her experience was like. Imagine being allowed a dress rehearsal exposure to the extraordinary, then being graced with the ability to return to our physical world to report about it to others.<br /><br />As caregivers in our personal lives of four aging parents suffering from the effects of both stroke and Alzheimer's induced dementia, Anita's story renews the hope and faith of my wife and I that something wonderful awaits each of our parents when their time to go home arrives.<br /><br />Anita Moorjani made a courageous decision to share her very personal and private though astonishing story with us that encompasses a miraculous healing and a mesmerizing tour of the hereafter.<br /><br />This book is a must read. If you enjoyed reading the story of 4 year old Colton Burpo and his NDE as told in, Heaven Is For Real, you will find Anita Moorjani's book heartwarming and reinforcing of your own faith in that of a spiritual Creator and Source.<br /><br />Jeff Dodson<br />September 14th 2012<br /><br />FTC Disclosure: I received this book for free from Hay House Publishing for this review.

B007TBCTRK|3.0|As someone who has worked with Vangelis and Hans Zimmer for much of his carreer Ridley Scott has found a recent collaborator in Marc Streitenfeld who scored his last five movies including Prometheus. I often wonder what he sees in him, to be honest. It is not that I despise his scores, but Streitenfeld's work is just so inferior to Vangelis and Zimmer that I can not understand why he is Ridley's go-to-guy nowadays. I can only speculate what another composer would have done with the material, but Prometheus, while being a fantastic movie, could have been much better given a proper score. I am afraid though this isn't it. Streitenfeld again delivers a largely forgettable soundtrack like with his previous ones. I don't mean to be personal, I just think with a film like \\"A goog Year\\" Streitenfeld might be able to pull of a nice little score, but with \\"Robin Hood\\" and \\"Prometheus\\" he is just out of his league. Considering that Ridley Scott is planning a sequel to Blade Runner I sincerely hope that he finds another composer for it. Matching the quality and status of Vangelis' score to the 1982 original will prove almost impossible to begin with and Streitenfeld will surely not be able to pull it off (again)...

B006OOHYIC|5.0|great game but will not connect to original Quell for dual access through one game.  have to open them individually.
B004H1U2HE|5.0|Not only a classic memoir, but the key to the concerns and even the images of many of Oz's other novels and stories, from [[ASIN:B004H1U24W My Michael]] to [[ASIN:B004S3NECQ The Same Sea]] and [[ASIN:B005OC2ANO Where the Jackals Howl]]. You might even say it's a key to his chosen name, Oz, which means heroism and valor in Hebrew. Personal heroism against the enemy, from the British occupiers to the Jordanian-Arab invaders of 1948 was one of the child Oz's principal fantasies when he was growing up in Jerusalem. Well worth your time and money.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|A great tv series from SyFi.  You never know how long these shows will last so I wanted my own copy.  Actually this is my second DVD.  I loaned the first one, who loaned it to someone, who....I gave up getting it back and liked it we enough to buy it again.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I taught this book for a high school summer reading group at an all boys high school. Our conversation ranged from Max Brooks's take on capitalism to the reason for our cultural obsession with zombies. We discovered, among other things, that zombies inhabit a liminal position. Neither clearly alive nor clearly dead, neither clearly human nor clearly animal, neither thoughtless nor thinking, zombies become a medium for exploring the boundaries of the human condition, and Max Brooks does that well.

B000002AHM|5.0|I guess I'll just interject a quick rebuttal to the critics of this album.  If this set had been locked up in a 1970's attic and was released today it would blow away away any acoustic album standing in its way.<br /><br />These guys were not out to set an ambient mood.  Nor prove themselves as superior musicians.  They were simply out there up on stage having a riot of a musical night.  And were have the privilege of being invited to the party.<br /><br />Maybe a little redigitalization could bring out a crisper quality to this ancient set,  but believe me I have no criticism toward this unbelievable CD.

B0052FX6M2|5.0|I wanted to read this book since it came out. I have not been disappointed. Kissinger gives a lot of up close portraits of the people he met in the Chinese Leadership, the differences in personalities and the quirks of individuals like Mao, Deng, and Zhou. He describes well the historical background, why this and that happened, allowing the reader a much better understanding of the entire historical period. It helps if the reader knows the context from the Korean War in 1952 to China 1985. He also speaks on the relationship between Mao and Stalin and the complicated relations between China and Russia and the role China played and still plays in Asia as a whole. The Vietnam conflict is also brought into the picture to help understand that world politics and diplomacy is never black or white decisions.  Kissinger was most involved in the opening of relations with China and the visit by Nixon, he points out that the Nixon visit was the beginning of talks with China and how this impacted the Taiwan question. Recognition by the USA of China and opening of an Embassy in Beijing will come much later in 1979 under Carter, a point often forgotten.<br />Kissinger in the book is the able diplomat, the suave Courtisan, the great tactician and negotiator, he also gives credit to the people on his team for all their efforts in making is work easier. A very good book and an important book on understanding history.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Before I was just flipping pages thru a pdf version of my textbook that had over 500 pages which was definitely no bueno at all, but then I looked around and saw this app, read about it and tried it out. All in all, this was probably the best purchase I have ever made and it makes reading pdf files so much easier with lots of functions like highlighting words, bookmarking, note-taking etc...Even flipping the pages (by holding down the lower right corner)look cool haha
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Another endless runner game, but this time with a jet pack. No story, but when something is played in 90 second increments, it hardly needs one. There's enough variety in obstacles that runs rarely feel exactly the same, and a wide variety of items make each encounter enique. Worth it as a free game, though I recommend if you like it to spring the coin counterfeiter for two dollars. It puts some money in the developer's pocket as a thank you and halves your time spent earning for new upgrades. 20 hours in for two dollars is a great deal in my opinion.

0393064476|5.0|I throughly enjoyed reading this book, which, among other things, caused me to wonder how our world might have been different if Poggio Bracciolini hadn't discovered and copied Lucretius's long poem, \\"De rerum natura.\\" Greenblatt takes the reader on a tour of 15th century monasteries, the papacy, Lucretius's philosophy, Greek and Roman art and thought, the Inquisition, and the intolerance of Christianity as a religion (although he never calls it intolerance).  He also gives us the life story of Poggio and ends the book with Thomas Jefferson and the Declaration of Independence. The book is very well written: the author says exactly what he means to say, and his thought and sentences leave the reader informed and enlightened. Highly Recommended.
0345404475|1.0|buy this because of the times you''l  have experiencing the freedom. Don't misinterpret the sound-sine waves you'll pretend that never occur otherwise. do it for your leaders.
B007RTAR64|5.0|If you are a Hunger Games fan, young or old, this is the item for you.  Super fun and cute barbie.  I bought her for my 14 year olds birthday and everyone loved her.  My daugher won't be getting the doll out of the box so I don't know how durable she is.
B004UID2LC|2.0|This was a good app until the last update when it stopped downloading videos and will not play them either, before that it was great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I devoured this book in two days. It exceeded my expectations exponentially! I loved it! Definitely recommended.<br /><br />Hugh Howey is a great inspiration. Just downloaded the sixth book, and off to read it, when I'm meant to be writing my own book... damn you Hugh Howey, damn you.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|A GREAT!! game with a scary storyline, great puzzles and hidden objects, wonderful graphics and I can't wait for part two.

B004I744AS|5.0|I have no complaints.  it is a very good app which does everything you could wish from a dictionary.  You can download it for your kindle and download it so that it is usable offline.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I unfortunately suffered through almost half of this dud before admitting it was going nowhere and ejecting the DVD for once and for all.<br /><br />I supposedly have a high IQ but had no idea what was going on, had to keep asking a friend if he understood (which he didn't), and after about 20 minutes did not care one bit if there was one mole or one thousand moles.<br /><br />If you have any respect left for the movie-making industry, avoid this at all costs. One of the worst films in the history of the cinema.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|All I have to say is when I ordered the Martyr's Unrated version which I had been told is not cut in anyway shape or form I was excited and decided to order it off of Amazon what I got however was not the movie shown in the picture on this site but something completely different from what I ordered it did not come with a slip cover and it did not say Unrated on the DVD itself anywhere at all . Therefore I am giving this a bad review only because I did not receive the correct version that was advertised in the picture and am wondering what had happened whether there was a mix up or if I just ordered the wrong version of the movie.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|Twists and turns in true Blake Crouch style, but not paralleling the Andrew Z. Thomas series.  I have always thought his writing was somewhere between Micheal Connelly's crime and Dean Koontz's fantasy. Well, he nailed that mix this time.

034580404X|4.0|I would sum up the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy in one word:  Craptacular.  The trilogy offers entertainment so poor in quality that it is ironically captivating.  It is combination of reading a love struck teenager's diary and seeing in print every woman's ultimate fantasy at some time in her life.  Ladies, all of you have to admit that at some point in your life you had a fantasy of marrying the perfect man before the reality of life set in.  Who hasn't dreamed of owning a man who is not only drop-dead gorgeous with a perfect body and equipment that he knows how to use to please you, but is also extremely wealthy and buys you your heart's desires.  On top of that, he's fallen so deeply in love with you that he has no interest in the many beautiful women who are constantly throwing themselves at him.  And he wants to marry you to boot!  And he's still turned on by you when you are very much pregnant.  And not only that, he's the perfect father to your children!  Oh, and also multi-talented, cultured and adventurous.  Despite the juvenile writing, I couldn't put it down.  I shared one of the many sexual escapades with my husband and lo and behold, he was listening and remembered what I read out loud to him and he spiced up an evening out to my great surprise!  So there is at least one redeeming quality about the Grey trilogy.
0345803507|5.0|Good distraction from the everyday hum drum, well written in a way that people talk think and do most anything, I would and do recommend this book, and No it is not all about sex but yes the sex is good/bad and educational, the plot is one most every woman wants, a man to love her above all else and give up his desires to show her just how much he does love her, as this book is written in present time the past mannerisums/behavior is delightful and charming which makes the characters so easy to follow/love/enjoy and wonder just what will happen next. You will set up til 3 am reading/wondering,, all my friends said these exact words, you just can't stop reading it, Enjoy Fifty shades of Grey
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I had not a chance to see the \\"Firefly\\" television series, but I did enjoy Joss Whedon's interpretation of the X-men comic series and so I thought I'd give this movie a try.  I like Whedon's use of dialogue to build and relieve tension in X-men, and he maintains his ear for good witty dialogue in \\"Serenity.\\"  He also does an excellent job of developing what are essentially comic book characters, and making us care about them and so that when this movie reaches its climax our muscles tense up as we root for our heroes to make it against overwhelming odds.<br /><br />That said, the special effects are really cheesy -- I suppose it's a homage to the campiness of Whedon's style.
B0087HT36U|4.0|An acceptable take on the genera. Probably worth whatever it cost when it isn't the FAOTD (as long as that price is 99&cent; or less anyway).

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book.  I have re-read multiple times.  I didn't think I would enjoy a book that involved young college students as characters, but boy was I wrong. I have become a fan of Jamie McGuire's other books as well.  Can't wait to read Travis' point of view in Walking Disaster.
B005FISBTO|1.0|Would you buy Murder on the Orient Express if the solution of the crime was in the beginning? Hell, no. Especially if you couldn't avoid it. But Showtime does. DON'T BUY THIS GARBAGE. The final scene is unavoidably placed in their dopey show previews. You can't possibly miss it, unless you were warned. It they don't care for their customers, why should you give them your hard-earned dollars? The entertainment industry is always pleading with you to buy their products and not to pirate them. I can't help thinking than if I had obtained this by nefarious means, I wouldn't have known the ending before the opening credits. I spent the whole year avoiding anything Dexter related because I didn't want to run into a spoiler. Thanks for nothing, Showtime! Jerks.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|John gives an eloquently simple plan that makes so much sense you wonder why you didn't think of it first.  The best part of the book is how it stresses honesty and sincerity.  The golden rule is heavily applied with John's system which is key to any success in business and life.  Thank you John!!!!!
B0078JOAOI|4.0|First time using the Amazon streaming video and was very satisfied with its ease and will definitely use again. Walking Dead is an awesome show and it was great to use Amazon to catch up on missed episodes seeing that AMC is no longer carried by my provider (Dish)

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is by far the best book I've read in a long time.  I could not put it down.  It was the perfect combination of sad and funny.  Congratulations to the author for such an amazing piece of literature.
1250004217|5.0|A young girl leaves her brother in a cupboard and promises to come back to him as soon as she's able. Only problem is, she was taken by French police in a roundup for Jewish families known as the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup.<br />Beautiful and deeply moving we follow the story of young Sarah in 1942 and the story of Julia 60 years after that as she tries to put together the pieces of Sarah's story.<br />I really enjoyed this book-it was very well paced and a few twists in it to keep you interested. The history behind it was devastating-although the story itself is fiction. I do wish that the author would have added in more of Sarah's story after the first half of the book though.<br />I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in the holocaust or anybody looking for a good book.

0307588378|2.0|BE ADVISED - SOME SPOILERS.  I loved Dark Places, and I loved Sharp Objects.  Those two books exhibited an intimacy with the setting, local customs and characters, which made not only the stories unique, but reading them so thrilling and engrossing.  The writing was so fresh, so sharp in those books.  The two books were unlike anything I had read before.  Gillian Flynn wasn't afraid, and I applauded her audacity not to shy away from writing about the grotesque.<br /><br />Sorry, but I HATED Gone Girl.  I hate the stupid title.  (Initially I had reversed it to Girl Gone, which I thought sounded so much better.)  I hate the whole book.  The writing was bad.  The writing was mediocre.  The writing was nowhere as good as her two prior books, but because of the publicity that had been built up, this book got all of the attention.  And it is her weakest book.  To the extent, I am offended.<br /><br />I felt with this book she was stretching.  It wasn't territory she was familiar with, and I could sense the effort.  Even with the writing, the fluidity and ease were not there.  This book just doesn't seem like Gillian Flynn.  The story was too cliché, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE TWIST.<br /><br />Genuine Gillian Flynn would have done something marvelous, something completely radical, and absolutely satisfying, totally unpredictable and would have completely blindsided the reader like Desi Collins outwitting Amy so she could never escape (with him acknowledging what a psychopath she was), or have Nick be a chilling psychopath as well, as vain and as clever as Amy.<br /><br />The praise this book has received really bothers me, because this book is so sub-par in comparison to her other two books.  Her first two books were stellar.<br /><br />I know this book will launch Gillian Flynn’s, precisely because it is cookie-cutter.  It was very easy to read at times, very tedious to read at times, very staid at times (especially the police procedure stuff - yawn) and some parts seemed unfinished.<br /><br />The one observation that rang true for me was Nick's statement that Amy could not discern BS.  She was gullible to the weight of her ego.  She was completely oblivious to her faults.  This should have been reflected in the diary entries, but they were written with an acute knowledge of the human psyche, they knew what normal was, they were intended to mislead (the reader NOT the police), and in this, the story failed, because Gillian Flynn didn't trust her audience; she needed a red herring.<br /><br />Story of Nick, who has secrets.  He is accused of the murder of his wife.  Amy presents herself through diary entries - she is the only child after so many miscarriages, and the basis for a series of books called Amazing Amy.  Amy is wealthy, beautiful, brilliant, and she loves Nick.  She had not wanted to move to Missouri after she and Nick had lost their jobs.  She hoped things would get better.  There are twists, which sink your stomach, and Amy’s brilliance is repeatedly revealed.<br /><br />I HATED THE ENDING.<br /><br />The book was such a waste.  It just wasn't the Gillian Flynn that I loved and admired.  The ending upset me, not because of the ambiguity and immorality, but because the error was made at the beginning, and Gillian Flynn was forced into it.  After so much heaviness, you hope for a better finish.  I had expected better after reading her two prior books.<br /><br />I anticipated the twist, but I coveted her blindside, but she pained me with the ordinariness of this book.  The writing was so staid, not a single sentence really resonates.  The writing took so much effort.  You could smell it.  Especially the diary entries.  (Of course, I can see that was the point.)<br /><br />Gillian Flynn is still a fine writer, and I hope the best for her career, but she let me down with this book.<br />READ HER OTHER TWO BOOKS.  THEY ARE SO MUCH BETTER.  IF SHE IS TRUE ARTIST, THIS BOOK WILL REMAIN A BLOT IN HER CAREER BECAUSE HOLLYWOOD PICKED IT UP.<br /><br />She can do so much better than this book.
1594744769|3.0|While this book shows a lot of promise, it never really delivers on what it sets out to do. The photos are beautiful and I appreciate what the author was doing as a sort of art project, the storytelling gets bogged down, a lot of it by the pauses required to pop another picture on the page. Jacob, while likable enough with his horrible lot in life of being an upper middle class white male, is very Harry Potter-esqe. It's a lot of the other characters he meets in the time loop that when added to Jacob, make for a mob of barely tolerable and very spoiled brats. The less than solid ending with the wide open sequel gate made me just about groan. I don't know as I'd even be interested in a follow-up to this book.
B0095T3H2U|1.0|This movie is plodding, painfully slow, and the main people have no personalities and no chemistry.  I don't think a good director could have given the story any charm.  It is neither a comedy nor a drama.  They try to surround the main couple with outlandish couples and character actors to make the story more quirky or charming but it doesn't work and it a total waste of time.  Somewhere under the boring is probably a story they tried to make about what it takes to make a relationship work but it isn't work anyone's time.  So not work the money I paid to rent it.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a wonderful book with a great story line.  Can not wait for the next book to be released.  Loved 50 Shades and I really loved Bared to you!  Highly recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|At first I gave this app a bad review because I could not connect to any multiplayer games. However, I found that the problem was in fact my own noobishness (lol) and I got it working now. Mojang and fellow reviewers please forgive me ;)
B00932AA5G|5.0|Great example of European movie making style. An understated thriller that manages to maintain a great balance between action, mystery, and a romantic story.
B008Y6WO88|1.0|Utter garbage. Incomprehensible deus ex machina thrown about meaningless action sequences and CGI effects that seem like a bad high-school-video-club-Matrix-wannabe.  If you don't regret spending money on this movie you deserve euthanasia.
B0087HT36U|1.0|Wont start. Went to un-install it from setting and it crashes the settings window when you select it. Had do download Titanium Backup to be able to delete it. If they fix this, I will update my review based on when I can try it.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|The whole movie had an air of despondency, no happiness or humor from start to finish.  The acting was poor and none of the characters were particularly sympathetic.
B00006RAKP|5.0|I have always liked Elton John thanks to my dad but never had the music. Great price for an amazing compilation !!!!!
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I was thoroughly entertained for two hours.  I thought the acting was top-notch, even in Kristen Stewart's case.  Yes, Charlize Theron's performance was Oscar-worthy, but none of the acting by any of the actors was anything but perfect.  All I can say to the movie's critics is, what were you expecting, a documentary of the Snow White tale?  And to those who thought the movie was predictable: what, you thought the evil queen would win and rule the universe?  This was a perfectly entertaining retelling of the Snow White tale, and I have become a fan Kristen Stewart.
B0087HT36U|5.0|awesome app would recommend to just pass the time it might be boring at first but it will get cool
B008MM9630|5.0|you get to make stuff and grow stuff and get stuff you get money and stuff I just love love it and if you like growing and farming this your game.

B001AQO3XS|5.0|YEs, I think this is a classic action movie. It looks superb and the Blu Ray definition is awesome. The sound comes over really well too, don't know what the reviewer complaining about this was on about. On my system it sounds great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|is a great tool to have  at home or your business is easy and fun to use with the hole family
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I was wondering if the impressive and innovative first season of Sherlock could keep the quality going, and the great news is it does. I enjoyed this hugely. It's very entertaining. There are many twists on the stories, so they aren't in the least predictable. The acting is superb and the scripts contain numerous references to the original stories, far more than I could spot in the entirety.<br /><br />These are great shows. Fantastic viewing, strongly recommended.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is a fun twist on the labyrinth style games. Perplexus Epic takes quite a bit of practice and patience to navigate the ball around the track. It is awesome and frustrating at the same time. If you enjoy puzzle games you should definitely enjoy this.<br /><br />That being said the plastic that encases the whole thing is fairly flimsy if you aren't careful when holding it you will bend the plastic in. It does seem to pop right back out, but I would be if you do it enough the plastic will crack. This did however come in handy for me because when it arrive the box was smashed to hell and there was no protective packaging in the box.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great movies and an important part of my childhood viewing. Will I be getting these as soon as they're available? Sure, no doubt. Looking forward to it. Hopefully they'll be as remastered as well as the Star Wars films were, as the originals looked stunning. Can't wait.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I think this book is probably looked over by many fantasy readers, and only came to my attention as an amazon recommendation for 2.99. I loved it! Different fantasy world/setting than usual, wonderful and unique characters and development, great romantic relationship building. Highly recommend and hope to read more by this author!
B000VD5I94|5.0|This movie is superb. If you've not seen it, do. The blu ray looks awesome and is the sharpest I've seen this film. It also contains both the original release and the better, more violent director's cut. Good stuff.
0385344333|5.0|I couldn't put down this most recent Reacher novel, with the creative story line, classic Reacher character, and intelligent and unexpected twists and turns which make these crime stories the best available. Already looking forward to a new one next year.

B0087HT36U|4.0|It seems pretty good, not sure if it will be good for replays. Could use more content in the future probably. Works fine on RAZR MAXX.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|A very enjoyable, thought provoking film. Visually exquisite. Not as violent as it was described to me, but enough to be convincing.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I loved when this movie first came out in theaters, I loved it on in that bulky VHS box, I loved it on DVD and well...you guessed it, I love it on Blu-Ray. some of the negative reviews are saying they had issues with either sound or playback. My BD played all the way through, from beginning to end without any issues OTHER THAN one small freeze up between a particular chapter change. I don't think I lost more than a second or two. It could have had something to do with the issues people were talking about or just dust on the disk or a smudge. Either way I'm not complaining. It did not interrupt my movie experience and I continue to love this movie. So glad that I can own it in such high definition. It looks and sounds great. You see every detail of every scene like never before. They really went out of their way to make this as clean as possible, and we're talking about a movie that came out in the late 90's. Oh! And the commentaries and special features are great, STILL haven't gotten through all of them. Maybe I'll do that now...enjoy.
B0087HT36U|2.0|App keeps freezing on photon. would be great if didnt. Not free game either. Like concept but cant play one level with out it not loading.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire and have minimal problems.  Every once in awhile It freaks out, mainly when I go to a website, and then go backwards back into Pinterest.  Somehow it can't handle that.  Sometimes I have to force close it when that happens.  Once or twice I have had to shut down the kindle and restart it.  Def. Still buggy.  BUT it is really nice to be able to browse pinterest and then if I want to go to a site, I pin it to remember it later when I am at the computer.
B0087HT36U|5.0|addicting fun. complicated and frustrating at some points but still fun. the help button is pointless. there are some bugs but still enjoyable.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|Amazing movie that always leaves warm fuzzy feelings at the end. :) Of course they left a lot out of Austen's original story, but this movie was excellently done and condensed in a way that I felt absolutely did justice to the book. It covered every main point without being rushed, and the main actors are phenomenal!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|It was a good movie about falling in love and trying to convince your love interest to love you in return. In the end he found someone to love.

B000JIHP88|5.0|Our son loves his rainforest mobile. It was very easy to put together from the box and install in the crib. I really like how it spins and then slightly pauses while spinning. This makes the rainforest creatures wiggle more than just spinning and gets our sons attention again if he was partially looking away. I also like the remote so if our son is still awake after it stops you do not have to go into the room to the crib, where he can see you, to turn it back on again. Highly recommend this product!
B004UID2LC|4.0|I downloaded this app on my kindle fire and it worked perfectly. I've had this app for about a year now. but recently the app wont even let me download a single song. it says searching but then never downloads.

0143119680|5.0|What a wonderful discovery to find an academician with the gifts of a novelist. I am reminded of Prof. JRR Tolkien's marvelous Lord of the Rings trilogy and his astonishing infusion of his own Anglo-saxon and Norse scholarship into his great literary masterpiece. While I haven't been a reader/devotee of the many recent works of fiction treating the subject of witches and vampires, I could not put down A Discovery of Witches. Diana Bishop and Matthew Clairmont are beautifully drawn and compelling characters. I could go on about the many virtues of this novel, at least from my perspective, but to what point? All I really want to do here is to write a fan letter to Prof. Harkness and to thank her for gifting the world with this literary gem. I am in the middle of Shadow of Night and I lose all of sense of space and time while I am reading it.  Thank you. K. Fink
0385341008|4.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is the story of Germany's occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II.  The story is told through a series of letters to and from an author named Juliet Ashton.  After receiving a letter from Dawsey, one of Guernsey's residents, Juliet becomes interested in the people and life on the islands during the occupation and asks that he not only keep in touch, but have other members of the literary society write her as well.  Before long, Juliet decides she wants to write a book and gets permission from her publisher to go to Guernsey and meet the people and hear their stories.<br /><br />I started this book a month ago.  I had a very, very hard time keeping interest in the story.  It wasn't that I disliked it, I just didn't care or wasn't in the mood for it at that time.  A month and several books later, I decided to pick it back up.  Apparently, I stopped right before it started getting good.  I found that once Juliet got to Guernsey, I couldn't stop reading.  I fell in love with the characters.  Oh how I would love to live in a place like Guernsey with neighbors like Dawsey, Isola, Amelia, and Ebin!  So, even though I struggled through the beginning, the last half of the book made up for it.  I'm glad I picked it back up and gave it another try.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My concept is, if the writing is bad, life is too short to waste. And when you can pull up a brief of the first chapter of the book and be goggle-eyed over the bad writing at that point, it is probably a good guess that the book isn't worth spending hard earned money on.<br /><br />Of course we peruse the best seller list. People are busy these days, and don't have as much time to read as we might once have. And of course, for many, many of us, money is an issue. We don't spend as we once did, and a guide for what might be worth spending our hard earned money on is appreciated.<br /><br />At one time, one may have been able to rely upon this type of guide to make good choices. However, with the advent of high-dollar publishing, the internet rating lists, and other means of manipulation, this is no longer the case. As blatantly proven in the case of this train wreck of a series.<br /><br />Those of you who have studied advertising and/or psychology may be aware of the tests in the mid-point of the 20th century, in which advertisers attempted to insert 'subliminal advertising' into television programs. Flashes of products sent in bursts, designed to encourage the purchase of products subliminally, without the watcher realizing that they were being manipulated. I find a unique correlation to what was done then with what is being perpetrated now - - 'loading' media in order to sell a product.<br /><br />I have found that, by utilizing the different methods of obtaining the first chapters of books, (i.e., Amazon's _Look Inside_, Barnes and Noble's _Read An Excerpt_, etc.) I can get a good grasp of the writing style of the author immediately. If I find the writing style to be encouraging (it doesn't start with obsessing over their hair, etc.) I start watching the reviews. Shades came out of the box strong, but soon I began to see a distinct \\"U\\" in the reviews. So, I put it on the back burner, and went on to other books until I could decide if it was worth pursuing. During that time, located several other authors that I enjoyed that had next to no (or no) press on their books. I found some real jewels through reading free first copies (some I bought the next books for because I liked the writing and story lines, some I didn't). I also went back to some of my favorites. And I kept checking reviews, while having my name on the list at the library for the first book. I often buy series after picking up the first at the library. A real money saver in the long run, because there are some true stinkers out there, as well as some hidden jewels.<br /><br />The more I read the reviews of Shades, the more suspicious I got of the \\"5 Star\\" reviews.<br /><br />Then, I got my chance at the library edition. It took me a VERY short time to realize that this was, in a word, disgusting. I have a knack for speed reading when necessary, and after trying for a bit to read normally, I sped read through - and then had to go scrub out my brain with (metaphorically) a steel bristle brush and lye soap.<br /><br />I suppose my point is, if something is getting all the hype, you don't have to rush right out and buy it to be part of the crowd. Sure, your friends may be all talking about the book, but surely there are other things you can discuss as well? And maybe your friends will turn you on to the fact that maybe that 'hot new book' is really not so hot after all. And then you can congratulate yourself on being the smart one in the group, while buying everyone a round with the money you saved! And just think, by not purchasing all the books in this series, you can buy yourself a really cute new pair of shoes!that time, located several other authors that I enjoyed that had next to no (or no) press on their books.

B002ZG975Q|3.0|but it didn't quite live up to it. The cast was great (I actually really liked the Olsen twins' performance as the witch)and the storyline is a classic, but the circumstance in which these two came together was so ridiculous. I can accept a spell by a vengeful witch, but a father leaving his son alone, a dad leaving his daughter in the hands of total strangers, a blind man miraculously cured??? It was a tough sell. I watched it and did enjoy it a bit but I hoped for more.
B007TML4EI|5.0|I hardly play any games on my Android devices.  However, Dummy Defense is just flat out fun and addicting.  I don't usually write reviews either.  Watching Melvin aka the dummy get smashed is super cool.  Then you get to smash or Kelvin, Melvin's dummy friend. I added this game on my Samsung Galaxy S3, Nexus 7, and Kindle Fire.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The first book of the trilogy was the BEST! I could not put it down.  I even took it to work and read it on my lunch break.  I would recommend it to anyone.<br />It is not like \\"male\\" porn.  It is well written and without the vulgarities.  I throughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Couldn't Put It Down

B002SSUQFG|5.0|It is very comfortable to wear, and durable. This is my everyday watch, I wear it to work, around the house and when I go out. People always comment on how nice it looks. It's not flash, but it does catch people's eye.<br />Over the last two months it's only lost about two mins. I'm not sure how accurate that makes it as far as automatics are concerned, it's the only one I have owned, but for my purposes it is fine.<br />If you're looking for a nice reasonably priced watch, I recommend this one.

B006OCM0G0|1.0|Do not download this game!  Windows will pop up during the opening of the game and ask you to buy more gems or a virtual object.  If you make a mistake and click on the bottom or even worse click the same area of the screen before the window pops up you will be charged.  This company is not willing to refund any gems you have lost during these misleading transactions........avoid at all cost!  Wish I could give this game a big fat 0.
034580404X|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy was ordered and at my door steps in about a week.  I had no luck trying to purchase from my local brick and mortar book stores...they were all sold out each time I returned.  I am just completing book 1 and can't start book 2 fast enough.  The hype was well deserved.  If you need romance and erotica with a solid storyline...these are for you.  Anastasia Steele, Christian Grey and all supporting characters are deeply moving and memorable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so cool. fun. I love this games it is super fun and funny. there is no better games then this one execrate for angery birds
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The 50 Shades trilogy should've only been 2 books and not three. The first book was good, established a story line and left the reader on a cliff hanger at the end. The second book was good as well, leading to more cheesy fiction and a happy love story. Definitely could lose the third book. I understand the elements of sex to the story but the third book is only sex and the same redundant sex over and over. I really feel that it doesn't compare to a normal dynamic between two people and its full of 30 second sex acts that end in explosion for both parties...I'm not buying it even for fictional purposes. Oh and the constant mention of Ana's designer panties does not make the scene any hotter. In fact its a huge turn off. I know the main guy character has tons of money, wants to spoil her, blah blah blah, but the constant mention of money and expensive clothes just makes this whole thing a waste of time to read. I wish I hadn't wasted my time on the third book because even as Christian's character developed I felt it was all too fake, the sex over exaggerated to the point that it wasn't even desirable to read, and the editing seemed to go out the window towards the end.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Can NOT say enough to tell you how amazing this site is!! You will be addicted too! Fun..creative..inspiring all at the same time!

0007477155|5.0|I watched the first two seasons of GAME OF THRONES on HBO and became totally hooked!  My son turned me on to the book series, which I hadn't known existed.  I got a great-looking boxed set of the current seven novels (the author is feverishly writing more even now!).  I'm about to begin Book V, and already worried about how long I'll have to wait for the newest novel.  These books are totally immersive - good characters, great setting, interestingly convoluted plot, no draggy or \\"filler\\" pages.  Just a really good, fun read!  If you like midieval or ancient<br />roman settings and issues,you'll enjoy these books.

B008N9AASC|5.0|Just about 30 years ago, \\"Koyaaniqatsi\\" was released, a visually overwhelming movie of \\"life out of balance\\", and now we get a 21st century update of sorts in this movie.<br /><br />\\"Samsara\\" (2011 release; 99 min.) is a movie in a similar vein as the previously mentioned \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\", bringing powerful and at times stunning visuals of our world. The film was made over a 4 year period in over 20 countries, and when I saw it this weekend in the theatre, I was nothing short of amazed of what I saw. I witnessed images I never thought I would see, none more so than the footage of the gathering of hundreds of thousands Muslims gathering in Mecca, brought in stunning visuals, including some time-lapsed footage. Wow, just wow. But there is a lot more. Beware, there are scenes in the movie that are not for the weak of heart, including a number of consumer-oriented scenes (too hard to explain in words, you'll have to see it for yourself). I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, and it rolled by in no time.<br /><br />As in any of these types of documentaries, the music plays a significant role, since there is no dialogue. The soundtrack is quite nice, mostly by now 62 yr. ambient musician Michael Sterns but it's not quite at the same level of Philip Glass's memorable music in Koyaanisqatsi. But it's a minor quibble. This movie premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September, 2011, and I don't know why it has taken a year to reach the movie theatres, but better late than never. This movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood commercial fare, but if you are in the mood for something different, \\"Samsara\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Good to see that jack is back to his best. started off a tad slow but soon the story expanded into an interesting plot which had you thinking. Must have been good as it finished far to soon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very fun and entertaining not a penny wasted on it! Though it does take a little time to get used to the controls. All in all, this is a great game! The graphics are the same as the computer.
B008XG1X18|5.0|There are occasional issues with the app force closing but that seems to be the only hiccup; otherwise I love it.

B008KW43TE|5.0|This is one of the most unique and creative pieces of work from any artist in the last few years. Definitely a lot of emotion in his voice and lyrics. Highlights for me are \\"thinkin' bout you\\", \\"sweet life\\", \\"bad religion\\", and \\"forrest gump\\".
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|The special effects and action scenes of this movie were good.  Too bad that the acting was so poor that it turned it into a B movie.  Just awful...

B004J64QSI|4.0|The 25th Anniversary edition is good looking and well sung, but it lacks the excitement and production values of the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast edition.

I can see where a lack of tutorial would be a problem for newbies and they should consider adding one... although there are some excellent you tube videos to help. hopefully the pocket version will someday resemble the Pc version closer but the portability of this version is a great trade-off. if this is posted as the faotd tomorrow I am going to be seriously ticked off!!!!!!

7119005901|4.0|The purpose of my review is not to critique a classic tale, but the quality of this specific collection. You should note that the author, Luo Guanzhong, had a strong bias for Liu Bei's Shu Han, and his account of the Three Kingdoms period is full of embellishment.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- This translation of Luo Guanzhong's masterpiece is really quite good and at times stunningly beautiful. You'll find yourself rereading passages again and again out of sheer delight.<br />- Each volume contains a marvelous collection of notes that really does illuminate the characters, locations and culture the reader encounters throughout the Three Kingdoms period. The author includes a wonderful introduction and afterword containing a lot of historical information about Luo Guanzhong, the period, and certain key characters like Zhuge Liang.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The only real issue lies in the quality of the books themselves.<br />- There are many spelling and grammatical errors that just weren't edited out. I've never seen so many mistakes in a book before.<br />- The pages are obviously thinner than western readers are used to, so bath tub readers BEWARE: the pages don't recover from drips, damp fingers, or hot, humid air. That said, as long as you treat them with the care due any book, they'll last just fine. I've read through my volumes three times, and they're still in very good shape.

B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Harold Fry, meet Forest Gump.<br /><br />Walk Harold Walk- that was all I could think of as I read this book.  At least Forest had proper shoes.  So Harold goes on walkabout one day, in an effort to \\"save\\" his friend Queenie Hennessey & right a wrong that happened many years ago.  Along the way, we meet a series of characters, who are just lovely (isn't everyone so kind?) to Harold and of course, Harold has plenty of time to relive every memory has every had- ad nauseum.  And, like Forest, many people decide the journey isn't so much about Harold & Queenie but about a larger meaning, and they must join it so Harold can help them find the meaning (hey, I've seen this movie before!).  Eventually we learn the ugly truths, and unearth all the memories, and Harold, his wife Maureen, and Queenie all come to the beautiful, utterly predictable ending of the story.<br /><br />It was a fine book.  But it was trek to get through it.

So while I was shopping for<br />my bobbins and needles and decided to also get this title for her and have it shipped directly<br />to her. She was so surprised when it arrived at her house she called to tell me it was like<br />Christmas. She has since read the book and says it was GREAT!

B00138KJY0|4.0|Michael Jackson finally steps into his own spotlight, with the help of producer Quincy Jones from the Wiz album. It's not an official solo debut, but it may as well be as the pop star is allowed artistic control of his music for the first time in his career. From the start, it's clear the album's main job is to get people to the dance floor. Dont Stop Till You Get Enough, it goes, or at-least until you Burn This Disco Out. It's an all-night groovefest, with funky instruments and suave falsettos.<br /><br />Most of the songs deal in romantic love, of course, and Stevie Wonder provides a slinky jazz ballad about how some people Can't Help but love other people in that way. But it's a bit of an anticlimax because the clunky chorus can't compare to the sweet vibe of the verses. It's better than Paul McCartney's submission though; a silly song entitled Girlfriend; which has Michael Jackson threatening to tell her other boyfriend what they've been doing if she doesn't come clean on her own.<br /><br />The best song is, ironically enough, the one you can't really dance to. It's a drumless ballad entitled She's Out Of My Life, about a girl who might've hung around after two years if only her boyfriend (Jackson) had expressed to her how much he loved her. With that, it's a good thing there are so many other girls in this club; the club that never seems to stop playing Michael Jackson songs. Heartbroken or not, all he has to do is walk up to the next one and pull her off the wall to make her his.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best and fun game I have ever played on my kindle fire. I love temple run. epic game
B002GEQC32|5.0|What's dangerous, at-least to the music career of Michael Jackson, is that, after three hit albums, he's decided to leave producer Quincy Jones behind. At nearly eighty minutes long, this collection of songs isn't as tight as it probably would've been if he were still around. It's the way that time is utilized that made it a risk worth taking.<br /><br />This is an album that goes for the New Jack Swing; gritty dance grooves produced by Teddy Riley; before dwindling the tempo down for an eclectic assortment of virtual ballads. It's mood music with a split personality that's never been heard on a Michael Jackson album before, at-least not this clear cut.<br /><br />Gone Too Soon, a lament, matches poetic similes with soaring orchestral chords. But before you can shed a tear, the music fades to the dark hypnotic pulse of a nightclub. It's not the club that's Dangerous though. It's one girl in it; a girl who's vindictive, conniving, sexy and divine all at once. The return of Dirty Diana? Perhaps.<br /><br />The rock song this time around features Slash on guitar as a passionate Michael Jackson pleas, or demands, for a woman to Give In to him. That's right. The good guy crooner isn't as innocent as you might've thought. At one point, he's even making sex noises In The Closet with a girl, \\"because there's something about you, baby, that makes me wanna give it to you.\\"<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, Michael Jackson has never sang better lyrics. The melodies of these songs are absolute magic and the beats are hi-tech funk. Just listen to the epic Who Is It and tell me it isn't one of the best songs you've ever heard. It's Teddy Riley though, and the way his New Jack beats complement Michael Jackson's new jack-staccato vocal style, that also deserves a load of credit.<br /><br />Is Dangerous better than Bad? Yes. Is it better than Thriller? Hmmm. It's a close match indeed. I think it is, if only by a (sharper/pointier) nose, but unnecessary rap verses and overactive sound effects make me want to think twice. In any case, it's one of the best two albums I've ever heard.<br /><br />marcellee.comund effects make me want to think twice.

B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is fun and addicting!  different than angry birds, but same feel.  check it out!  I reccomend it highly!
B0013D6LEM|5.0|What I don't like about Thriller is the placement of the title song. It would be a perfect closer. Instead it lingers near the middle. When the album ends, it does so on a random note; a romantic serenade to a girl Michael Jackson promises to love more each day, even when she's old and \\"gray\\". Rod Temperton is to blame for those gullible lyrics, but, as far as music and melody goes, The Lady In My Life is a gorgeous song. In fact, it's one of the best Michael Jackson's ever sang, along with almost every other song on the album.<br /><br />Not only is this his best album, it could be the best I ever heard. It almost certainly is on a song-by-song basis as all but one passes goodness to a level of greatness other artists can only hope to obtain once on a single release. But even that worst song; a duet that has Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney playing tug-of-war over a girl who might be playing them both; floats along charmingly. It's the talking, where Michael, in that wimpy voice of his, professes that he's a \\"lover\\" not a \\"fighter\\", that'll make you cringe.<br /><br />The worst song after that is Human Nature, which is excellent. That, of course, says a lot about the rest of the album. Then again, there are only nine songs, so making a Thriller isn't quite as daunting as it seems. The secret, for all you pop singers out there, is to cut the crap; any filler at all; and just put out an album of gems, with funky beats and magical vocals. \\"No one wants to be defeated,\\" Michael Jackson declares over rock guitars at one point. It's harmonized melody is one of the catchiest I've ever heard.<br /><br />Other highlights include Billie Jean, which tackles sex in a way little Michael would have almost certainly shyed away from, and a party jam about mischievous people who always Wanna Be Startin Somethin. Both songs are amazing. There's also a Valentine's Day theme entitled Baby Be Mine that's amazing. Okay, the whole album is amazing. It's just not perfect. But it would've been damn close if Michael Jackson, or executive producer Quincy Jones, had thought enough to put the epic title song at the end where it belongs.<br /><br />marcellee.come been damn close if Michael Jackson, or executive producer Quincy Jones, had thought enough to put the epic title song at the end where it belongs.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B005X5XIL0|5.0|The PBS / Great Performances crowd did a super job of capturing this live performance on video -- and what a performance it is! Andrea Bocelli sings his heart out, and there isn't a bad song to be found anywhere.  On the contrary, many of the performances are thrilling: \\"Amazing Grace\\" and a few others brought tears to my eyes.  The audience reaction shots show that they were just as thrilled.<br /><br />If you love music, you want this DVD!
B00138KF6W|5.0|Making an album that stands up to Thriller is a daunting task for any artist, but Michael Jackson, dressed in a black leather jacket with silver highlights, feels he's up to the challenge. He even goes as far as to wrap white tape around his fingers like the boxers do as the guy who once described himself as a romantic \\"lover\\", \\"not a fighter\\", stands face-to-face with the leader of a notorious street gang with no plans to Beat It.<br /><br />\\"I'm bad,\\" he declares, on the funky testosterone-soaked title song, before daring any man to come slap him in the face if they don't like what he's saying. It's a ballsy invitation, especially coming from a guy in eyeliner whose only source of weaponry consists of melodic tough talk and flashy dance moves, but, luckily for him, the act is over before you can dent your eyebrows and muster-up an answer to the question, \\"Who's bad?\\"<br /><br />From there, the album goes into more familiar territory as Jackson's attention goes back to the girls and the way they make him Feel. He's especially head over heels for one Liberian Girl, who, as far as he's concerned, is more precious than any pearl. He Just Can't Stop Loving guest singer Siedah Garrett, but he's not so fond of an obsessive groupie named Diana as her relentless seduction inspires the album's Dirty rock song.<br /><br />The dirty dance song is Smooth Criminal, about a guy who murders a girl in her apartment. \\"Annie, are you okay,\\" we ask, but she doesn't respond. It's wonderful music like that which makes-up most of Bad; an album that, though outstanding, never reaches Thriller status. The drums are just too clanky, the synthesizers too unnatural.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|well best app ever. love it.  if you think that this app has glitches ir if you think it is a ripoff you don't know what your saying. it is awesome for me and I have a kindle fire
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy this app on my kindle fire! It makes it so much easier for me to pin things and look at things. I love that I can look at my boards and pull up a recipe for what I want to make and just look at it on my kindle instead of printing it off.
B002BBJ52U|5.0|Definitely worth watching - good fare for a Friday night and a glass of wine.  Some well-realized characters and tight writing.  Wish we had seen a little more of the Ben A./Jennifer A. characters and their back story, but it wasn't necessary to the story.  Need to go research what else this director has done!
B0000669JL|5.0|This cd has every great song by the inmortal Bob Marley. My five years old loves it and brings it to her daycare. Her friends love it too. Her favorite song is three little birds. We sing it all the time.
B0087HT36U|5.0|it's a really good game  and you can get  it from amazon and play store plus it's free. I will get it now!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am so glad that that they finialy got it on the kindle but what took you so long people. people started buying mooncraft (rip off) and block story (fail) Which lost you a lot of buissness. plus where is the redstone. but now to my story I have an ipod then I found out about the pocket addition so I was like yay. I went to buy it but it said in needed an update so I waited all day infront of the ipod then finialy it finished. I went to buy it again but it didn't update enough :(::::::::::::  . so I waited for a new update on my ipod but it never came :(::::::::::: again. so just a day ago I was looking on my kindle for apps then minecraft!!!!!!! I was so :))))))))))) . I asked my.mom if I could get it and she said yes :)))))))))))))) again. so I have been playing nonstop. (cant wait for x-box update)
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Thank you amazon for offering a &quot;free&quot; game.  It only cost me $400.00 to make my child happy.  I can only hope someone will file a class action lawsuit against you.
0439813786|4.0|I enjoyed The Invention of Hugo Cabret. Having to read it for my Education class, I have to say at first I was not happy. I am not much of a reader so when I saw the book, all I saw was a giant Harry Potter size book that needed to be finished in five days. However, as I finished the beginning pages of pictures, I realized I had accomplished a lot without reading any text. That's because the story of Hugo Cabret, an orphan child living in a Paris train station, is uniquely told through a combination of illustrations and text. This combination made it a quick read that at the end leaves you feeling accomplished. The seemingly useless bits of information regarding Hugo's childhood, later proves its importance, making every word of text relevant. Like the parts of the clocks and machines Hugo fixes, every part is important.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its not construction , its not scientific , its just a calculator . so if you need a calculator with all of the bells and whistles, your gonna have to pay for it. but for simple math equations this calc. will do.
B009329Y30|5.0|Excellent movie... Zac Efron was great and is definitely not the kid from HS Musical anymore! :)  The chemistry between the two main characters was great and I suggest it as a good girls night movie!
B003AVPV1O|2.0|I know nothing of video technology, so I can't suppose why, but I'm not particularly surprised.  I installed this to add a second monitor from our video surveilance system and it made both monitors unacceptably fuzzy.  The resolution from the cameras are low to begin with, so maybe if the resolution started out higher, it would have been okay, but none the less the degradation is still apparent.
B0087HT36U|5.0|i love it. its an awesome game. my sister loves it too. keep the levels  coming!<br />  d d d d
B006E2VTG2|5.0|I love action movies and I love Zoe Saldana, so this a win win for me. The shoot 'em up is a 7/10, the chase scene a 7.5/10 and the improvised weapon scene was a 10/10. (Plot? What plot?)<br /><br />I want to see more action movies with awesome ladies and I'm giving this a 5 star review. There was one false note however. There was no need to have Saldana mostly naked and/ or in skin tight clothes for most of the movie. If her outfit is actively impractical I spend the scene nitpicking instead of appreciating the shots, stunt work and stuff. If we could bring the level of objectification down to male action-star levels in the future, that would be great.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|ive had one of these before and it was swiped. so this is the replacement. by far the best little sharpener on market. quick easy effective
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game on my kindle is cool but it costed a lot and wont let me join game help please? !
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it is the best app ever! I love it, it tells you everything you need to know! omg it it has everything and all the times and... its just amazing
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great and it is free.What are you waiting for.It is so much fun and on a 7 inch tablet like my nexus .
034580404X|5.0|The book is very good and interested. It is a must to read it ! I really recommend it to everyone!
B003R0MEZ4|2.0|i was not pleased with the purchase of this item.  of the six discs, one disc did not play. i was unable to view the entire season!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Played great on my Fire with no problems... but would like to have a map so you can jump from one place to another ..
B001KO1BN0|5.0|The best numbered vinyl I own.  A very early product from a band that caught my attention in high school with the ( ) album...it changed my life and ever since Bjork was irrelevant in my life forever.  The kings of Iceland had emerged and were screaming my name.  I love Ros and what they have done for me!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is the best battery app that i have tried. It has plenty of useful information as well as it is resource light in use compared to other similar apps. Keep up the awesome work!
B000F2C87Q|5.0|I've turned so many music loving people on to Delta Blues, Kimbrough, etc. through this cd.  I will throw it on at a poker party and wait for the question from that discerning music fan, \\"who IS this??\\".<br /><br />I can only hope and pray the Keys throw us another blues album like Chulahoma.  I love people complaining that its all \\"covers\\" or that its not played with \\"12 bars\\" and go on to say they are a \\"true blues\\" fan (whatever that means) not knowing I guess that many of their favorite classic 12 bar blues songs are actually covers of covers, etc.<br /><br />I guess that's why music is subjective.  My advice to anybody that seems to appreciate music of all genres is in keep your mind open and your eyes closed.  Otherwise you might end up painting yourself into a corner where only 12 bars sounds right to you ;)
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|There is nothing particularly outstanding about this movie, but I enjoyed it the whole time I was watching it and it was fun. The overall feel is very positive and adventurous. Good job.
0790729407|5.0|Here was a man of oratory, his words fuelled a nation.<br />Michael Collins was an extraordinary human being.<br />Played by Liam Neeson in majestic fashion,the director said \\" I will  never make a<br />more important film\\"<br />Love interest was played sympathically by Julia Roberts.,But my interest was in the<br />man and his stirring words and his deeds.
B005EHILV4|4.0|-This item is built strong, by feeling it you can tell its of good quality.<br />-Shippment was ok<br />-It works great, good mobility, good size, good price<br />-My only complain is that (and it can be justified for the price) you can hear a tiny bit of interference every time you record<br />- and By the way the phantom power sucks. With Phantom Power the Interference becomes 5 times worst
B0067R0APK|5.0|What else is their to say! Review's with a minimum word count suck! Pardon my words but this Sucks...! 9
0345472322|5.0|The idea of the book is that people who adopt a Growth mindset - believing they can learn to do better - achieve much more than people who think they only have whatever talents they came with.<br />I like to learn and started the book thinking it would affirm all my growth mindset goodness.  From the detailed examples, I could see areas where I really was limiting myself with a fixed mindset.<br />Now I've tried to take more of a growth approach, and am learning more.  Best of all, things that were previously drudgery for me are a little easier as I see them in a new light of building skills.<br />Also useful in the book are tips for parents / teachers / coaches on how to set children on the growth mindset early.<br />Good stuff!  I highly recommend reading this book!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i think it is realy realy realy really realy realy realy realy realy realy realy rely realy realt realy useful
B005FISBTO|4.0|DEXTER's 6th season employs religion and redemption as its underlying theme, bringing Dexter's own feelings into unfamiliar territory.<br />This season is marred by inconsistency and the poor choice of casting Colin Hanks as the main villain.  Likewise, the decision to make Deb's love for Dexter more than sisterly seems shock value rather than a plausible storyline.  As for Tom Hanks offspring---Colin's performance lacks true menace or depth.  Edward James Olmos is wasted in his role as Hanks' mentor.  Rapper Mos is surprisingly effective as the \\"redeemed\\" Brother Sam.  Michael C. Hall as usual is superb, bringing incredible nuance to his complex anti-hero role.  Jennifer Carpenter has a great season as Deb, given marvelous opportunities to display her wide range of abilities.  Her lack of Emmy nominations is baffling.  Fellow cast regulars---Desmond Harrington, Lauren Valez, James Remar, CS Lee, Geoff Pierson and David Zayas---provide excellent support.  The \\"return\\" of the Icebox and Trinity killings seemed more like detours than necessary plot advancements.<br />Overall, a good season, not quite as engrossing as previous seasons.  Still looking forward to Season 7 and how the finale will play out.
B0087HT36U|4.0|angry birds be ware of these pesky pirates... takes me away to far away times and places ... cool app to play

B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids (11 & 13) love this game! For parents, its a great game considering all the games out there geared at kids are truly questionable! I would love to see this on ps3 and Nintendo DS, not a fan on downloading it to our home computers, but Im sure thats my next step, they have versions on ipod & iphone, they are hoping this app is good, all the reviews are saying so.<br />Thanks Minecraft! Please work on other gaming systems or selling a gift cards for the full computer version for gift ideas!
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Amazing movie.  This documentary should be seen by all.  It is a wonderful lesson in discipline, determination and striving to become the best at your craft.
B0098VXE50|3.0|Had to watch because of Charlize and she did not disappoint. Makes a great evil villain. Overall, extended version too long for my taste and lots of slow sections that, I think, did not add to overall plot. Decent enough visual effects, none and again, as if they only had so much money for effects and had to spread them out. How would I classify this movie? Could be a date movie. Not horror or humor. Not just special effects. Not gruesome. Not graphic. No bad language. Familiar plot, sort of. Snow White?? Not sure I see the attraction of the woman, actress, that played Snow White. I am told she from \\"Twilight\\" series. Worth a look? I guess but nothing special in this movie either in the way of plot, acting or special effects. Well, other than Charlize. Always like Charlize.
030758836X|4.0|Well written.  Although the outcome appears obvious halfway through, the writer still holds your attention and interest.  Not the usual mystery.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|Better than I expected it to be. 4.0 to 5.0 stars. For some reason I had not heard of it before I searched on Amazon for movies. Bottom line, story line kept my attention and was entertaining.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is an awesome mini-series.  I can't wait for Season 3.  I'd rate it as good as the Pride and Prejudice mini-series.
B0074AGVWK|3.0|found the book to be most enjoyable. The characters were warm and friendly. The plot was appropriate for today. An enjoyable read.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie gets better every time my husband and I watch it.  I enjoyed seeing where everyone is today when they showed end clips.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is simple fun and addictive. Can be challenging at times but that is why it is fun. One of the best games in the app store and it is free. Props to the creators.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app has given me a way to enjoy Pinterest during the times it matters most to entertain myself.  I can pin and repin, like and follow with ease.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Your device should have a native PDF reader. If not than this is great but I use the pre-installed one and it works fine.<br /><br />This app is fine but you don't really need it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've read almost every book King has ever written and loved them all. This one really made me think about all the times in my life that I've wished I could go back in time and change things around. Maybe not such a good idea, after all.<br />It's only good books with great plots that make me 'cheat' and flip forward 50 pages..or else chew my nails off. With 800 plus pages in this one, I have no nails left and I cheated lots.<br />This book required tons of research and it was well done. That said, and I know my opinion on the subject has no place in my review: I still can't write one without saying how much I disagree with his conclusions about Oswald.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I think evernote is the best note taking app of all time. Problem is that my Zeki tablet isn't compatible so I have to use something else so that all my products are synced. If your devices are all compatible then use this.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|its nice not to wait to accumulate energy to collect from the animals..u can just keep collecting lol and the squirrel game is pretty funny hahaa
B005FISBTO|1.0|I borrowed this season off of netflix, and I'm glad I didn't buy it.  There are 2 minute unskippable ads for Showtime shows that you are forced to watch every time you start up a disc.  Utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />I recently purchased the complete Sopranos boxset, and was considering doing the same when Dexter eventually does a similar complete release.  That will not be happening if Showtime continues this garbage.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book had one of those beginnings that just grab you and don't let go. Having said that, the ending was something of a disappointment, but logically, I guess there really was no where else for the book to go.
0547569653|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Scott is full of wisdom, practical advice of how to keep moving on one's journey one step at a time, always staying in touch with your roots.  Love the recipes!!
0061906220|5.0|The School Library Journal is ALL WET.  \\"Teaches kids to accept their fate\\"?  Are you kidding me?  Since when is maintaining a positive outlook no matter what you step in a BAD message?  I read this book to my students, and they were singing along and laughing right from the start.  They absolutely adored this book.  I cannot wait to read it to them again.  What a fun and positive message!  This is my favorite \\"find\\" as a new kindergarten teacher (I've taught upper elementary but not kindergarten!).  I am absolutely incredulous that anyone could find fault with this book.  The illustrations are a hoot, and I love Pete's little comments (especially \\"Groovy!\\" LOL!!!).  Fun for adults AND kids.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The first book doesn't have much going on besides sex, sex, sex. If you like romance novels and like kinky sex, well then you'll enjoy this
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great tool. The large size makes it easy to use. I recommend getting this app for students or anyone wanting a convenient way to do the math!

1935670913|5.0|I have read just about all of the 'how to ebook' books out on the market over the last few months. Most of them were great. Mr. Locke takes his experience and gives helpful advice on a whole new level. I am very new to blogging and twitter and I have asked hundreds of questions to many different people about How? and Why? Not one other person has given me the How and the Why until I read this book. After hours and hours of trying to figure all this out, this book finally gave me that AH HA! moment where everything clicked together and just jived for me. Mr. Locke thank you, and remember my name. One day I may be famous because you helped me by writing this book. :0)<br />J.L. Gentry

B0087HT36U|1.0|Can't say much more than the app won't run. Just stops immediately after launch with no way to provide feed back. No testing on stock Android?! Welcome to one star land.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I love getting the combo packs for the Disney movies.  They are classic tales and with the combo packs, we get so many options for how to watch the movie.  And Amazon seems to have the best price and selection on them.  Love having the Digital copy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 games is so fun.Serpintines hard but I'll get it some day.I had to pick my favorite game it would be darts!

B000NQRE9Q|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the Indiana Jones films. This would have been a day one purchase from me, had it not included Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This is NOT because I don't like the movie - I do, though not nearly as much as the other movies. The problem is the fact that this film has ALREADY been released on Blu-Ray! Those of us that have it will now have two copies, and of course this forces the price tag up as well. Seems like a bit of a con job...<br /><br />Bottom line: If you don't have the 4th film, this set should be very good. From what I hear, the picture and sound of these movies on Blu-Ray is excellent. However, for those of us that already have the 4th film (or just don't like it) I think it's best to wait until they release them individually.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Though this isn't the most eloquently written book, it was a fun story and interesting to see what the hype was about.  I did feel like handing the author a thesaurus, but I am glad to see women talking so much about a book!
B0087HT36U|4.0|I think this is a great game.  It is very enjoyable.  I would have given 5 stars but it hangs after 10 levels or so on my Samsung Galaxy player 5.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|This movie was sooooo boring!  I gave it 1 star, but it did not deserve that!  Meryl Streep did NOT deserve an Oscar for this movie!  Her acting was horrible! She was NOT believable at all!  Viola Davis from The Help should have won.  This movie is over rated.  Please don't waste your hard earned cash on this movie!  You should only give this movie to someone you hate.  TRUST me when I say it's punishment just watching this awful thing!!!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|To me this was a good, but not great, read. I liked how Jack gave an explanation when someone was telling a lie but I do agree with others they spent a lot of time riding in cars. I suppose some would consider this book like a long and boring car ride. I didn't find it to be that way. I read it over several days as time permitted. It's obvious that over the years our hero, Jack has changed. In this installment we did see some of the old Jack (what happens near the end of the book - I won't say so as to not spoil it for others) but there are signs that our hero Jack is getting soft and mellowing out as he ages. Not once did he kiss a girl which I think is probably a first for any Reacher novel. Also is it just me or does it seem that Jack has a little Rainman in him. You mention a city and immediately he rattles off population, area code and other demographics. I can deal with a changing Jack Reacher as we all change over time but what I can't come to terms with is having Tom Cruise play Jack Reacher no way should he be playing Jack. Will I buy the next installment? Yup. I'll pre-order it for the Kindle as soon as it's listed.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Excellent book. I love the characters. Michael Connelly brings everything to life, can't wait to read another Harry Bosch story.
B004INHTK4|5.0|I finished this book in 2 days, reading late into the night, and I absolutely loved it.  I loved it because it made me laugh, gasp in shock, tearful and shake my head in pure amazement at this tiger mother and her account of parenting and family life.  I respect Amy Chua a lot for being so honest and matter-of-fact about her parenting experience...there are a lot of people out there who are not and prefer to bend to the social norm.  This a refreshingly honest memoir of a parent who loves her daughters to death and wants them to achive the highest they can from life and really reach for the stars...some parts I may have been shocked at but its very clear that the mantra of \\"assume strength not fragility\\" is something that we could all learn from.  I recommended this to my friend and she read it in pretty much one day and night.  If you want a book that really captivates you to the point that you can't put it down, read this one.  It's brilliantly written!
B002B3WEO4|4.0|While one could make the argument that all Tom Petty songs have a certain tone to the story or music, I would contend that all of the \\"greats\\" have a specific \\"sound\\" and it is the subtlety in the songs that make the journey interesting. Here Tom Petty brings things to a very intimate level, the subject of these songs is in part dealing with his recent divorce at the time (if I recall correctly). The music though is a more stripped down \\"summer\\" or \\"innocence\\" sound. Not the kind of naive innocence that we have as kids, but a weathered innocence; the refusal to be corrupted by the tragedies in life, rather to persevere and hope to find oneself in calm waters again with the sun on the face and feet in the water. This album is still rocking, in touch with Petty's persistent rebel spirit. Great album though all the way through.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is s clever, fun puzzle gems with easy controls, beautiful graphics and a great soundtrack. I cannot recommend this game enough, it is easily one of the best games out there.
B000TEMRIU|5.0|Classic album to begin with, then all of the double-disc goodies. This is a must have for any Pumpkins fan and a great place to start if you have never listened to Billy Corgan and the gang before.
B001EBV0MG|5.0|Who is in control. How do we change people? What are the consequences of our<br />actions? What responsibility do we have toward others?
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I bought this after reading all of the positive reviews and they were right what great comeback not a bad track.
B0087HT36U|5.0|very addictive!!! once I started I couldn't stop!!! a different take on the physics games!!! I highly recommend this game to all!!
B006P96PAO|5.0|Very nice movie.  I enjoyed watching it alot!  You will like it as well.  It's inspirational for people of all walks of life.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I personally love this album, and it's universally accepted that this is one of his best works, if not the best. All the songs a lot of meaning and the listener can defiantly connect to them. This is also a concept album and I think that it tells the story quite well. If you call yourself a Marilyn Manson fan and you haven't bought what is arguably his best work then pull out some cash and buy it now!
B000002JSR|5.0|A coworker recommended this CD and I took a chance and got it. I am not disappointed. This album and \\"Presence\\" were studio tapes that were made prior to John Bonham's passing and after the release of \\"In through the out door.\\" If you are a true Led Zepplin fan, this is for you, espacially Track #7. This was apparently recorded in an old apartment building that had the winding stairs that went to the apartments. They went to the top of the stairwell (lack of a better term), set up the recording machine and microphones, set John and his drums at the bottom and turned him loose---awesome! Jimmy really wails on track 3, so this album has got everything. Enjoy!
B004UID2LC|3.0|this app. was amazing like my fav app until September 15 it stops letting me download vedios it says searching but then nothing happens I really hope. they fix this. app because it was like the best app ever
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Of course, this classic of Stevenson is a real classic.<br />A great story about a boy growing up in an Inn, then going to sea to find a treasure. Many twists in the plot and a good outcome. Gives at the same time a look in early 19th c. life and a bunch of less used vocab, including maritime vocab :).<br /><br />The Kindle edition should have links from the table of contents (which was nicely scanned from the printed version), to the various chapters in the book.<br /><br />I remember that I have read (a translated) paper version a long time ago, and that there was a postscript, saying that 'he would not reveal the islands location'  or something to that end. I missed that in this edition. Not sure why. Where there different editions originally, some having a epilogue, and some not? Is my memory failing? Something else? Anyway, it is a good idea to add also the very final pages, even if they do not contain any story.<br /><br />Recommended! (Four stars means for me: really good book, but not that top level of A++)
B005MJ883K|4.0|The reason I rate this toy a 4 and not a 5 is because it is quite challenging, but easily one of the empathy addicting games ever! I love this game, and am Lookin forward to the next ones!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I know there are mixed feelings about this novel and it's place in the trilogy; but, I really loved it.  The trilogy is a dystopian story.  Dystopia is the opposite of utopia, so you kind of have to expect dark and depressing.  I won't post any spoilers here; but, I will say I am THRILLED with the ending.  There was one thing I wanted to happen and it did happen in the last 2% of the book.  Here's the advise I have for those trying to decide if this is a good book to read.  It depends.  While the first two novels were also dystopian literature, they were not the culmination of it.  This will not end like the Twilight saga because this is an entierly different sort of literature.  It is ok to like a fairytale ending and it is also ok to like an ending that does not leave you with a sense of darkness and depression at some level; but, if you fall into either of those categories, this may not be the book for you.  Personally, I loved it.  I felt it was true to the theme and even a bit shocking in its authenticity to the genre.  I don't often read books agian; but, I will be reading this book at least two more times when the last two films hit the big screen.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|enough challenging games to keep you from getting bored with it quickly. mix of the logic, hand eye coordination,  and reflexes add to that variety.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|The movie is dramatic and suspenseful enough, but is probably longer than I would think as being absolutely necessary.  There are a couple of places where the movie could have ended, but it kept going.  The story line also follows a kind of standard plot format that runs through a variety of these science-fiction films.
B008XG1X18|5.0|couldn't be happier... easy to use.... never freezes up and is the exact same as pinning on my Pc two thumbs all the way up
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was one of my free kindle lending library picks, but it would have been well worth the price for purchase.  This was a fast read - like some others, I had difficulty putting it down.  The plot was interesting and suspensful and kept me guessing until the very end.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000O14VAU|5.0|I watched this last summer, it was a roller coster ride! With a beautiful lead actor as selene and a cute guy playing michael corvin. I had found to be very drawn to selene and michael's relationship, it is unlike an edward and bella relationship and very different in many ways. I love this movie it is the end the very end! Lots of vampire and werewolves, and very little love in the movie. Michael sheen is in ths too his character is awesome I love this movie! I recommend this to any who loves vampire or werewolves!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|As with all Lee Child books this is an enjoyable easy read. Lots of action and fun. Lee Child is my favourite author for a lazy Sunday read by the pool.Lee Child always delivers what is advertised.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Very fun. NOT Angry Birds, physics yes, but different enough to have it's own niche. I enjoy it....haven't yet got stuck, no need to buy anything else. Wouldn't anyhow, I'd consider that cheating.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Very addicting game. I've already played the ad sponsored version through to the end. Starts easy, but gets to be quite a challenge on some the advanced levels. I have to admit that I needed to consult the You Tube tutorials in order to finish a few levels. Worth the money to get the paid version if you don't like to see the banner ads in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|This was a great love story with a great ending! I am a romantic at heart and this was a romantic film.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|Given how bad the second Transformers movie was in this trilogy, I was expecting the worse. Luckily, this one has more than enough to hold your attention. The storyline offers a pretty cool twist on what \\"really happened\\" during the 1st Moon landing. Plus you get gratuitous Buzz Aldrin as he is today in a cameo.<br /><br />OK, so no Megan Fox but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's lips are able to at least act and look good at the same time so no great loss fox-wise. There's certainly not enough of the Witwicky parents who are pretty funny with the limited screentime they get.<br /><br />Anyway, gratuitous Malkovich, gratuitous naked dude from the Hangover franchise, gratuitous McDreamy, gratuitous Lane from \\"Gilmour Girls\\" as well as Frances McDormand (say what?) has upped the acting ante but, honestly, any Transformers movie comes down to stuff that gets destroyed real good.<br /><br />In this case Chicago is a great setting to wreck havoc to plus they apparently mechanized and weaponized a worm from Tremors (hey, everything is Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon---even decepticons) to slice through buildings. All in all it's a decent thrill ride.<br /><br />Note: On the DVD I got the extras went nowhere. Just some weird loop of about a minute through scenes over and over. I'm sure it's some glitch so...can't really comment on what was on the extras.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|After hearing several of Fun.'s songs on the radio, and being told by several trusted friends how amazing they are, I decided to buy the album. It is fantastic! The songs are dynamic, they have great lyrics while being accessible to young people and older folks alike, and frankly I just love their style. The purchase went through just fine on Amazon's website, as usual, so I have no complaints on that part. Would definitely recommend this album! Even my dad liked it, and he usually hates a lot of newer pop music.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|The first Ghost Rider was a classic B movie. This was is so bad it's not even close to being in that \\"so bad, it's good.\\" Forget figuring out why anything is the way it is like why is the Highlander (Christopher Lambert) a monk with scriptures tattooed in what looks like Latin all over his face? Or why Stringer Bell from \\"The Wire\\" is suddenly the Ghost Rider's best buddy or how he survived getting killed in the first ten minutes? Was it just me or when his motorcycle flew off that mountain curve, wasn't he a goner?<br /><br />The most laughable thing is the movie starts out with \\"Eastern Europe\\" showing up on the screen like the movie exists in the vastness of the entire eastern half of Europe. I guess they were trying to snag that lucrative ex-Communist bloc market and not offend any one country for this mess. The worse thing about all this is how boring the movie was.<br /><br />Throw in the lead actress is no Eva Mendes and looks more at home at a goth concert, and GR2 lost me.<br /><br />The extras are, well, there are none on the DVD release of this. Maybe with the Blu-Ray edition you'll get an explanation of how the Ghost Rider ended up in \\"Eastern Europe\\" as the onscreen animated segment only showed me a motorcycle \\"driving\\" across the Atlantic Ocean.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Lee Child has again brought Reacher to life with a different approach to this adventure ./ From the start of the book you keep asking why did the murder happen and what will happen to those in the car . The suspense builds and the final outcome is only present in the last few pages . Once started this is a compelling read
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evermore is great for on the go need anywhere data. awesome app. would like to see some security features so that we can be more likely to use this in the healthcare field as well.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is the first German style board game to catch on in America. While some call this an entry level Euro game it does have a lot of rules to learn to get started. Thus, there are better entry level Euro games but this is a solid one that has taken the world by storm. With multiple upgrades and add-ons and even some different themed versions (most recently Star Trek) this game is what Monopoly could never be ... fun. There is no player elimination making it a great family game. Every player can play at their own pace and sometimes when you think that you are behind if you are doing a strategy that nobody else is doing you can find that you are suddenly in a position to earn those 10 victory points and win the game. This game works best with the Seafarers expansion and there are other expansions that give the game some great variants when you have played the game as many times as I have. It is a must buy but take it slow for new players ... especially those who are new to Euro games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful. It is a must to read. The imagination within the story is astounding!!! Hope others enjoy it as much as I have.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I would definitely share this. It's not like twilight or anything else that's popular lately.. it's a lot more mature to say the least. I enjoyed it, and my husband benefited from the effects it had on me haha
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This app stinks. Worked perfectly for a while.. Now it gives me errors messages and other messages saying I cant download. UNINSTALL
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this was going to be a predictable book. However there were twists one after another. I enjoyed the way it was written from two perspectives simultaneously. I couldn't put it down!
B008GANNIC|4.0|It's pretty good but the lyrics can be kind of confusing from time to time. The beats are really good though and P.O.D. has definitely changed their sound throughout the years but they sound pretty good on this album.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|ok, so I downlaoded this forever ago on my kindle fire and its worked great, but, everyime I open it up, it asks if I want to update. I click yes and it brings me back to here, where it says its updated. anyone else having these problems?
B008602KQI|5.0|liked it at the theater, loved the books, which is why we bought the movie - wanted to see it again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent book to read.  This is a book that is hard to put down and actually has a good story line.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Hugh Laurie's Bertie Wooster must surely be as close to Wodehouse's ideal as he could have conceived.<br />Never mind House, Hugh Laurie has never done anything as good as this. His facial expressions alone are comedic perfection.<br />Teamed with Stephen Fry's stoic Jeeves you have a comedy duo never bested. Wodehouse was ahead of his time, parodying the upper classes in the way that the Monty Python crew picked up on 50 years later. The script is so funny that you will want to watch these over and over. I have owned this set since they came out on VHS and have just upgraded to DVD. These tales never get old and would seem fresh to new viewers if shown on TV today. Anyone who loves vintage costume and interiors will really enjoy the art direction as well. I own hundreds of DVDs and this set is my absolute favourite. The whole 4 seasons link so you will want to watch them in sequence.<br />Guaranteed to brighten your day!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love love the pinterest app! it works great and makes it easy to view and pin with my kindle!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is way better than most of the other weather apps. You can depend on the information and plan your day.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|got kind of tired with it<br />after. unlocking all jet packs. but this is a must buy<br />go out to get it right now
B00005ATFN|1.0|This DVD will not play in our Sony HD Blue Ray Player.<br />It will play on ONE of our computers nicely but the other one has<br />to be reconfigured to a different \\"zone\\" to play it.<br /><br />If you live in the US this product is not configured to play on<br />your equipment at all or without time consuming and frustrating adjustments.<br /><br />Maybe it was in the product description that this was a foreign disk and<br />needed special equipment but we did not see that.
B00992CF6W|5.0|But, I have to complain about other people's comments. First, there's the idiot that got a refund because he said he &quot;can't join a wi-fi game, and my Internet is perfectly fine&quot; well if you ACTUALLY read the description it says Local Area Connection. That means you can only connect if you and a friend are in the same household using same routed network. Just read all the bad ratings, they're all by people who haven't or wont be let to buy it so they hate on it. Or they aren't very intelligent.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|ANY season or even an episode of Dexter is great.  One just can't go wrong with Dexter!  It is without question one of the best series ever written.
B000AQJPQE|3.0|this adds alot of fun to the room but is not any brighter than a night light and u should know the planets do not light up or glow they do spin but in the dark u cant see this feature & saturns ring is made out of cardboard. i was displeased but kept the item because my son loved it and its hs happiness with the item that counts. just be prepared to purchase a lamp too. i also purchased the moon in my room with this item and love it! these 2 items go very well together.
030758836X|1.0|I will give the book one star because of the fantastic job of marketing; hype and hyperbole have marked a black hole of literary worthlessness.  I find the nearly 1,000 5 stars remarkable, and can only conclude many reviewers in this category are not familiar with psychopaths and sociopaths, much less narcissists, and have a fascination with them.  Frankly, they aren't very interesting, nor are they creative and mercurial.  Neither are Nick and Amy.  I simply could not read this book more than half way through, although I do loath failure to finish something for which I paid so much.  Well, for those that do like it, enjoy.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|Ties in with Google account seamlessly. Problem: Play store and amazon store constantly updated each others version of this, along with foursquare. 5 star otherwise, although I prefer to read full screen with html preview.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is a really fun game with great graphics and puzzle layouts. Good music background as well. You will have lots of hours of enjoyment with this app
B005EWDA3I|1.0|Finally finished. When I start to read a book I have to read the whole book- no matter how bad the book is - being the plot or style of writting.<br />This book starts out very intresting, nicely written and I can see an emerging plot with cults and powerstruggles, throw in some vigelante assassinations and everything is set.<br />And then the little people creep out, and the story goes down the drain. Attempt to save the story by long passages of wannebe poetry do not help either. The last book is the final nail in the coffin, thanks to the moons I am finished.
B0031RS7X6|4.0|Very fun, easy read. If you don't want to make too  much of an effort this chick lit is ideal. I read it in a few days, related so well to the character (is she actually me!?) and would definitely recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was very well written and I plan on reading the next two follow up books but not at this time.  I enjoy more action novels like Vince Flyns Mitch Rap books or factual books like the President's Club.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This is a great read.  I really didn't want to lay it down.  I must admit I lost some sleep finishing it!
B000IOM9QG|1.0|If you want the original material with Boney M., then stay FAR away from this release.<br /><br />It's a re-release of the 1992 compilation \\"Gold\\" with a few changes.<br /><br />It's yet another compilation that's including edits and remixes. How can it be so hard to get the original single-versions or LP-versions on a compilation? If Sony Music had had a little interest in Boney M. it would not have been difficult at all. It however seems to be all about easy money.<br /><br />The compilation starts out with \\"Daddy Cool\\". Strangely enough they have managed to include the original 1976 version of this track and not the remixed version from the \\"Gold\\" compilation from 1992.<br /><br />Sony Music seems to enjoy the use of the \\"Gold\\" compilation from 1992 when putting together new compilations. Note! All tracks from the \\"Gold\\" compilation are remixes as the tracks have been added extra drumbeats and hi-hats. Most are edits as well!<br /><br />Some reasons to stay away from \\"The Magic Of Boney M.\\":<br /><br />\\"Sunny\\" is not the original 1976 version. It's a remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\" compilation.<br /><br />\\"Rivers Of Babylon\\" is not the original 1978 version. It's a remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\" compilation.<br /><br />\\"El Lute\\" is an edited and remixed version from \\"Gold\\" running 3:58 minutes. The original 1979 single version is 5:09 minutes. The original LP-version is 5:50 minutes.<br /><br />\\"No Women No Cry\\" is not the original 1976 single- or LP-version which is running 5 minutes. It's an edit as well as a remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\" compilation running 4:20 minutes.<br /><br />\\"Hooray! Hooray! It's A Holi- Holiday\\" is not the original 1979 version. It's a remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\" compilation<br /><br />\\"Rasputin\\" one of their greatest singles, is neither the 1978 single-version nor the LP-version. The original single-version is 4:43 minutes. Here is another edit and remixed version from \\"Gold\\" running only 04:25 minutes.<br /><br />\\"Painter Man\\" is not the original 1978 version. It's a remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\" compilation.<br /><br />\\"Belfast\\" is not the original 1977 version. It's a remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\" compilation.<br /><br />\\"Brown Girl In The Ring\\" is not the original 1978 version. It's a remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\"<br />compilation.<br /><br />\\"Kalimba De Luna\\" is not the original 1984 version. It's an edit and remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\"<br />compilation running 4:13. Original singe-version is running 4:31.<br /><br />\\"Happy Song\\" is yet another edit and remix from the \\"Gold\\" compilation running 3:56 minutes. The original single version is running 4:18 minutes.<br /><br />\\"Still I'm Sad\\" is not the original 1977 version. It's a remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\" compilation.<br /><br />And now to the real DISASTER! \\"Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord\\" one of the group's biggest hits ever is also included in an edited and remixed version. The original single version that went to no. 1 in England in 1978 was running 5:43 minutes - a true master piece. The version included on this compilation is ONLY 4:01. Yet another edit and remixed version from the \\"Gold\\" compilation. It honestly stinks. In the included version Maria and Joseph never makes it to Bethlehem which means that Jesus never was born and there's therefore actually nothing to sing about! Over half of the story has been cut out. How is that possible?<br /><br />\\"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\\" is not the original 1975 version. It's an edited and remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\" compilation.<br /><br />\\"Felicidad\\": Here included in an edited 2:52 minutes version, remix of course. Yet again from the \\"Gold\\" compilation. The original single version is running 4:33 minutes.<br /><br />\\"Gotta Go Home\\": Here included in an edited 2:50 minutes version. Yet again from the \\"Gold\\" compilation. The original single version is running 4:01 minutes. The original LP-version is: 3:45 minutes.<br /><br />\\"Ma Baker\\" is not the original 1977 version. It's a remixed version from the 1992 \\"Gold\\" compilation.<br /><br />Track 19 and 20 is a remix and a new recording. None of them worth mentioning at all. They should have left them out so the full versions of the original single-versions or LP-versions could have been used instead.<br /><br />Edits - No thank you!<br /><br />Remixes - No thank you!<br /><br />Original material - Yes, please!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Tons of fun, if you like Jewel-type games you'll love this one. Fast paced and variable challenge settings will keep you entertained for hours.
0345803507|5.0|The third book is just as good as the first ones.... Difference is that you will get to know Fifty in a much deeper way... Loved it and was so sad once I finished it,which only took two days :)
0756686970|5.0|My kids (myself also) LOVE this book. Well written and fun to read, it provides a great reference for the collector and enthusiast alike. A great buy and read, plus you get the one and only Hans with the book! A++++
B0086700CM|5.0|tempo run is so fun I love it when I play it I always be so exited what will I get and how far I will get I LOVE THE APP. If you get templ run you will love it.
B0092R66T6|2.0|Really wasn't what I expected.  I didn't care for the flick and it  didn't keep my intrest. I'm sure others will like, guess I was expecting a movie like Orginal Starship Troopers...
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I can only tell you that I bought it.. Amazon.. via Roku player.. and I was so enthralled<br />that I watched it in three sections over two days.<br />IOW I was so unenthralled that the only reason I finished watching it was because<br />I paid for it.<br />Compare this to say... From Hell.
B008N1LL42|5.0|A truly fun movie. Especially for former sailors.  My wife and I watch the movie together and she thought it was lots of \\"FUN\\" also.  5 stars if you haven't seen the move  check it out.  The acting is good, the  plot is a little unbelivable even for this type of flick but that's part of the fun.  Make a night of it move and popcorn time.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This young girl takes on the most important people in her world to become free. Go thru the emotions chapter by chapter thru different  character perspectives. In the end it truly gave me a new inspiration to life.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok game the games could be a little easier than they are.  also required point limit could be lower.  but a fun and interesting game nonetheless.
B00009NHC5|3.0|I had watched this movie before.  It starts a little slow, but once it is mainly featuring Audrey, it is good.  It is a different Audrey Hepburn from other movies of hers.  I got it just because I like Audrey Hepburn.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is way better on kindle than xbox or iphone. It works perfectly on the Fire. All of you guys should get. Hint: Has more stuff than on ios
030758836X|4.0|Read Gone Girl in a weekend which is pretty quick for me.  I could not put the book down at first.  I love the way that it was written with a his/her point of view chapters.  But I did feel like a lot of the other reviewers felt at the end.  Did not care too much for the ending.  But overall, I really enjoyed the book and I did order two of her other books from Amazon.
160309007X|5.0|Like all things in life, change happens. As we age, many of us want to revel in the delights of the past, while lambasting the here and now (I'm of course referring to the negative reviews). Alan Moore, in his Extraordinary Gentlemen series, refused to fall victim to inertia and made a point of having his characters grow (and in some cases devolve as the years beat them down). The result is epic, and the whole series from beginning to end is nothing less than brilliant. We celebrate the clarity of the initial stages of this tale, watch as massive change morphs the lives of the remaining heroes into something very different than we imagined, and (finally) sit back with a contented smile as the final moments of the Extraordinary Gentlemen saga seeps into what's left of our brains (this last volume, Century #3 2009, is outrageously good).<br /><br />For those that want something that's fairly easy to grasp (or those that hate leaving the comfort of reality behind), read the initial volumes, then leap to the final two. But I was riveted by every book in this series, and would happily give it 10 stars if possible.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|Dull,dead & disjointed. Poorly written & acted & horribly directed but it is better than Ambien for sleep-inducing. Plus, it's free & non-prescription.
B001974DG0|5.0|The book grabs you from the very beginning and doesn't let go.  The dog is a wonder, and it doesn't die at the end! Ooops, spoiler alert.
B008DYZKQE|4.0|Great book, I would give it a four instead of a five stars, because it is very short, but if you are reading to younger children, the book just might be the perfect length. I love Munsch. This was read to me as a Kindergartner and now that I am a Pre-K teacher, I enjoy reading it to my students.
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|Sorry to say,  but this is just a hidden object game,  and I do not like them.  I 've had my fill of games that promise adventure,  etc. and yet are mainly hidden object. Do not understand the 5 star reviews,  but,  &quot;to each his own.&quot; We need more true mystery games,  such as THE HAUNT,  LOST CITY,  SECRET OF GRISLY MANOR,  etc.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I became interested in this because of the movie being filmed now. However the story is interesting , kept my attention and I am now getting ready to read  the second book in the series. I am hooked.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I don't normally review games but this one is actually fun. Great solid physics and concept, try it out, you won't be disappointed.
0307950689|5.0|another good book keep you guessing till the end and the information are interesting since i am not a writer myself i will not spoil the book trying to explain

B0054JZC6E|3.0|I wish there were better ways to get points then this. so good luck on getting free points any other way
B0087HT36U|4.0|it is so fun!!! I have a blast playing it. its nautical the fact of blowing up stuuf and destroying stuff makes it awesome :)
B00913DPW2|3.0|Shouldn't need a walkthrough to be able to play the game / challenge of banishing evil spirits- but in this you need to almost memorize walkthrough in order to feel like you half way know what to do or why.  No story or reason to the way they set it up. Graffics and music is all it has going for it.  Too jumbled and frustrating.<br />Florida mom
B008MEM24S|5.0|if you get this game.....woow....this is all i can say.woow that is how good the game is.you have to get the game rite now
B004UID2LC|2.0|if you guys can fix the problem when I try to load a vedio if fix ill give a 5 star .... it was working and two days ago it stop
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app doesn't work on kindle. You cant download videos. I tried numerous different ways and I never got to view a single video.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|it made my dog fall asleep crazy its really relaxing you will fall asleep easy I reccomend this to other people
B0087HT36U|5.0|My 10 yr old and myself love this ham. I have a Kindle Fire and it works great. You throw rocks and bombs and stuff to kill the bad guys and some levels save the good. Its not hard but sometimes you have to use your brain and hit thinds in order to get everyone. Almost like Angry Birds, but different. Hope this helps.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|excellent read, loved it, couldn't put it down, loved all three books and enjoyed reading them all. will read them all again
B008XG1X18|4.0|I was using pinhog and enjoyed it very much before this app. was available. This is a smooth app with minimal issues: One of my boards disappeared so that is why only 4 stars,  however, I have made multiple food items from this site and am implementing many of the craft ideas in my classroom!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|how do I upgrade. it was great at first though but now it wont work this app sucks now and everyone app that has to do with youtube
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game. As usual, I wish it was completely free and that diamonds were easier to get. But they have to make money somehow to support the game.
B005FISBV2|5.0|I have been a huge fan of DEXTER right from the beginning of the very first season.  It is a show that fully pulls you in and has a premise much deeper than the simple description of blood analyst by day/serial killer of those worthy by night.  This show really gets into the mind of Dexter and we get to fully understand how he became the way he, why he does what he does and also understand his reasonings.  DEXTER is one of the best shows out there  and though this season, the sixth, is not totally up to par with the better seasons, it is still better than most television out there.<br /><br />The blu ray presentation here is amazing as all the seasons are.  The black/white ratio is excellent and colors are bright and vivid and pop.  Skin tone is very realistic and clarity is amazingly precise.  The darker scenes are just as vivid as the beautiful Florida scenery shots.  Add to the almost perfect 1080p video a Dolby Tru-HD 5.1 audio that is sublime and you have the best viewing experience possible.  Dexter's voice overs come out the speakers strong and present.  The rest of the dialogue is crisp and clear as well.  And surround speakers are put to great use here.  There is much action with season 6 and at the right moments all speakers are utilized for utmost effect.<br /><br />My opinion on season 6 has changed greatly from my opinion after watching it air last season.  Upon first tv viewing I found the season a little lackluster but was totally enthralled by the character Brother Sam played by Mos Def and found the ending an excellent unexpected twist that definitely made the whole season make sense and also sets up season 7 expertly.  Season 6 is primarily about Dexter facing the issue of religion especially in regards to what he wants to teach his son Harrison.  The Doomsday Killer is the evil entity this season and with first viewing it didn't seem fully effective to me.  The first 8 episodes were fine but the next 3 seemed to loose steam before the final explosive excellent episode.  After a reviewing of the season on blu ray I now can honestly say everything about this season was excellent and it was all held together as always by the presence and superb acting of Michael C. Hall as Dexter.  The entire reason this season seems a little subpar is the casting.  DEXTER has always cast the perfect people from Jimmy Smits to John Lithgow.  Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks just don't cut it here and the entire season is brought down a bit from it.  The story line of religion is a good one and it is handled well here as we see Dexter struggle with it.  Mos Def as Brother Sam brought a superb depth but the growing horror and suspense in the later episodes here totally lacked in true intensity due to Colin Hanks just not being able to handle the characterization he was given.  Luckily, Michael C. hall runs the show and each episode still rings true due to him.  Season 6 also has added emotional depth and intensity due to the welcome development of Debra, Dexter's sister played superbly by Jennifer Carpenter.  She has always been a major player in the show but this seasons her role becomes eve more complex and imoportant.<br /><br />Bottom line, DEXTER is such a great show that each season will have much discussion of how it held up to the others.  Season 6, though not the best, is still great and is a must own for DEXTER fans.  And the blu ray is definitely the way to see it.  Highly recommended.ive excellent episode.

0099579936|1.0|Where do I begin?  First of all, it goes against everything I believe in.  Had I known it was THAT bad I would not have bought it.  Good thing I didn't get it on Kindle because I would have broke the damn thing.  Now I have a book sitting in the spare room that I hate, don't want to give to anyone and will find its way into the trash.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|The title says it all. I marched right through this book since it was so hard to put down. There are witty and funny stories about her life experiences along with great tips on management.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book, so hard to put down. Ending was a total let down. Baffled by it. Like other reviewers i felt the author just got tired of writing and stopped. However bad the ending was, the rest of the book was very compelling, up until the end.
B00406V85Q|4.0|A very good CD, has excellent music from that era.  It brings back some memories.  I can highly recommend it.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I thought it looked pretty cool from the cover and the trailer. In fact, it appears to start out with some credible entertainment in the beginning and when the plane crashes--however quickly denigrates into a monotonous and unrelenting chase by a pack of fanciful, fake appearing wolves. Somehow the actors can only speak in 4 letter words to express themselves. ***SPOILER ALERT** Ends with Liam Neeson vehemently rejecting faith, considering his prior suicide attempt, focusing on his own self-absorbed nihilism and then dies. I ended up just skipping chapters which I never do in movies. Leaves you feeling hopeless and unhappy with yourself that you wasted 2 hours and three dollars. Find a more uplifting and creative movie elsewhere.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a really cool movie.  It's about this advanced research team that uses apes to find a cure for Alzheimer's Disease as well as making apes smarter and stronger.<br /><br />One thing that totally feels bizarre is the way the main ape character (hehe, that's a funny was of putting it I know!) gradually gets stronger and smarter the more he's locked up in his cage, and you can literally SEE how he's advancing by starring into his eyes!  A really unique and surreal piece of production trickery there.  The ape is basically turning into a human before our very eyes with every scene!<br /><br />Anyway the one ape is apparently smarter than the rest... or maybe that's not true at all and he was just the one the movie writers chose to pick out and focus on because they felt they needed to make one stand apart from the pack.  Either way, he was wearing a nice orange shirt so it was always easy to locate him (well, until another ape took exception to the shirt assuming he was trying too hard to stand out among the other apes and therefore ripped it off his back- a friendly \\"welcome home\\" reminder that there's a normal wild ape underneath that shirt perhaps).<br /><br />A good chunk of the storytelling revolves around watching apes swing around through high tree branches and even swing across beams on the living room and attic ceilings (of the one home the ape was temporarily living in) which results in a pretty awesome segment near the beginning with several carefully timed swings throughout the entire house.  This was the home of one of the researchers, where his own father had Alzheimer's Disease.  The researcher wanted to test his skills on his own father to see if a cure would actually occur or not.  At first it works and his father's a drastically different and more upbeat person.  Later... well you know the rest.<br /><br />The only part I strongly DIDN'T like is when the ape became smart enough to actually start talking, though at leastthe movie writers did the right thing by only keeping his choice of words to basically 3 or 4 things (mainly screaming \\"NOOOO!\\" with an exception of one crucial line near the end that I won't spoil).<br /><br />It's amazing how well the writing is in other areas such as showing the apes being aggressive and dominant but never intending to kill a human being unless they feel they're blocked in and absolutely have to.<br /><br />Expect lots of apes swinging from trees and branches (and ceiling beams) while watching this film.  Perhaps the writing could have been a little stronger in some regards (for example, while the one monkey was locked in a cage and had to deal with a security guard constantly smacking him with a club or squirting water at him along with several other disrespectful things, the ape never got the kind of revenge he most certainly *should* have gotten by persevering all that torment) but for the most part, it's a quality film.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I can hardly wait to watch the second part. I have the book and the film is excellent.  Very well adapted.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The author makes me feel like I can \\"see\\" exactly what Katniss sees.  The strategy part is fascinating!  Couldn't put it down.  Going to need lots of special effects for the movie version!!
B004MC8CA2|2.0|The Application is slow and tedious at times. I don't find it very user friendly. I think more plans would be a great thing also.
B005DN7W4G|5.0|I enjoyed this end of world movie more than Armageddon, this one has a tremendous story, seems a little deeper than Armageddon, not that Armageddon wasn't a good movie, I just like this one more.  Have watched this one many times and enjoy it every time.<br />Who doesn't love Robert Duvall, one of the greatest actors of all time.  This movie has several great actors, you will enjoy it if you love a great story.  ;+)

B0064NTZQ2|3.0|Preface: Please understand that customer reviews (and all reviews, for that matter) are purely subjective. Each person will interpret a book, movie, game, or album in a different fashion, unique to their experience. Therefore, no review (mine or otherwise) is a definitive judgment on a piece of media; it is simply one opinion of many. Please keep that in mind while reading reviews, and do not post angry comments because you disagree with a review's perspective (just because we're hidden by online anonymity does not mean that rules of courtesy do not apply). Level-headed comments or questions are welcome. Customer reviews are my way of making a small contribution to the Amazon community, instead of simply consuming media without offering honest feedback. On to the review:<br /><br />Drive has some moments that are executed magnificently, particularly the opening getaway sequence, which is full of quiet, subdued tension. As \\"Driver\\" (seriously, that's what he's called... but we'll get to the hackneyed writing shortly) attempted to safely navigate the streets of Los Angeles, with his two paying clients in the backseat, I felt as if I were riding along in the car, with my fingers tightly wrapped around the dashboard. The two thieves sit huddled in the backseat, silent, sweating, their eyes filled with fear, as the car darts from shadow to shadow, evading the pursuing police cruisers and the spotlight of a hovering helicopter. The fact that I was able to sympathize so strongly with the anxiety of these criminals, who I knew nothing about so early in the movie, is testimony to an impressive piece of film making.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we find that Driver (REALLY, that's his name) is a part time wheel man, while also working as a mechanic and a stunt man in the city. He seems to have no particular direction for his life, but his new romantic interest leads him into a downward spiral of crime, violence, and self destruction.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie is held back by juvenile writing. In one scene, Driver actually utters the following line, which is typical of his dialogue (and which made me burst out with laughter): \\"How about this... You shut your mouth, or I'll kick your f**** teeth in, and shut it for you!\\" At this point, I'm wondering: Who wrote this, a 15 year old boy? I have worked extensively with high school students, and I assure you... this is exactly how teenage boys write dialogue, when they're trying to summon the image of super tough, cool characters who take no guff. What makes this over-the-top lines even harder to swallow is how Driver is generally a silent, moody, nobody-understands-me type of character (again... high school male, anybody?). Furthermore, the scenes where violence comes into play is WAY over the top, to the point where it's just ludicrous, and employed for purposes of shock value, not moving the story forward. Ultimately, this hackneyed approach left Drive a movie that was difficult for me to enjoy.held back by juvenile writing.

B007SSEU9O|3.0|Be warned - this movie is not a full telling of her story.  It is a non-linear reflection of choices made by this amazing woman against the backdrop of her senile senior years, in which she comes to realize what she gave up to pursue her chosen path.  In short, she neglects her family to serve the free world.  Only, the movie doesn't really develop the high points of her career - for example, the Falklands get some attention, but the Cold War is all but absent.  I enjoyed the real-life footage that seems to have become standard fare for biopics these days, but I was disappointed at the lack of historical context for her achievements.  At the end of her life, all she - and the viewer - is left with is a profound sense of regret and irony, with no recourse available.  Perhaps other viewers had a better experience.
0380973839|5.0|Ray Bradbury weaves short stories together to share the conquest of Mars from many different angles.  The book compares western frontier settlements (like CA in 1849) to the colonization of Mars.  While Bradbury's beautiful descriptive language paints vivid pictures of the Martian landscape, his ideas are the most striking.
B005FISBTO|1.0|Season 6 is one of the best seasons of Dexter. However, this DVD will ruin your entire Dexter experience.<br /><br />There is an un-skippable commercial for Showtime at the beginning of each DVD, which shows a clip of the last 30 seconds of the last episode of Dexter Season 6. It gives away a huge plot twist that you deserve to anticipate for an entire season.<br /><br />Absolutely absurd.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Hi.  i enjoyed this trilogy.  It is excellent reading.  I started the books and could not put them down.  I have read them three times.  I also have read her other books,  Gregory , the overlander.  5 books in this series.  yakky.  was not expecting this and am sorry that i bought them.
B00932A2MC|5.0|This movie was great for people who like Syfy movie. Lots of action and special effects. I liked it. The new actors on this movie were great.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I couldn't imagine how a story about being stuck out in the wild for days on end could be entertaining for an hour and a half, but it sure was. This movie is so much more than a tale of survival. It's about courage, strength, inspiration, and an incredible will to live. It's about how one life touches so many others. What I also saw in it is how the universe works in such mysterious ways. I heard about the story when all this first happened, but seeing the movie and the extras puts it all into perspective. It's absolutely incredible.

B002GHHHPQ|5.0|This has got to be one of the most exciting war movies ever made -- air, ground or sea.<br /><br />A few of the reviewers take it to task for not following facts too well. Poo, I say. This is showbiz! It's entertainment and, boy oh boy, this movie really delivers. Highly recommended.

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|This retelling of the faery tale of Snow White and the Seven (not eight) dwarves. Everything is shades of grey and the only thing we can rely on is a rather angry performance by Theron (was the script written that way?). Hemsworth is a main strength and vehicle  that keeps the story moving forward, but unless he is fighting or providing exposition, he is just as underused as everyone else. But I don't fault any other actors (including Stewart) because this film suffers from a weak script. Great ideas, wonderful score and CGI... just a weak script.<br /><br />The special features are underplayed. We are treated with short featurettes focusing on the main characters. We have another on the generalities of the world, the Dark Forest, The Fae Forest. The troll, the dark fae guards of obsidian.The entire time I couldn't help but think of the faerie tales of the Brothers Grimm, and how easily comparable the film was. I should have figured - that was the mood and theme the crew was shooting for.<br /><br />And they didn't miss the mark by much at all. This is a great movie with great characters. I am not a fan of the script itself though. If you like dark fantasy, give this one a go!
